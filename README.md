# WFE Archive

An archive of NS region WFEs.

## Usage

Navigate to a `archive/region.txt` file to see a region's WFE. You can see how the WFE changed over time by clicking the `Blame` button or the `History` link.
For older regions with lots of changes, you might need to clone the repository locally first.

For example, here is the WFE for **Europeia**: [archive/europeia.txt](./archive/europeia.txt).

And here is the `blame` page, outlining when each part of the WFE changed: [click](../../blame/main/archive/europeia.txt).

WFEs are stored as text files. The region's WFE file is updated if the WFE in the daily dump changed.
