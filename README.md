# WFE Archive

An archive of NS region WFEs.

## Usage

Navigate to a `archive/region.txt` file to see a region's WFE. You can see how the WFE changed over time by clicking the `History` link.

For example, here is the WFE for **The North Pacific**: [archive/the_north_pacific.txt](./archive/the_north_pacific.txt).

WFEs are stored as text files. The region's WFE file is updated if the WFE in the daily dump
changed.
