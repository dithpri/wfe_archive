*ATTENTION EVERYONE* *ACHTUNG*
For the next three days, there will be an election held in the U.P.R. for the WA Delegate. To vote for a particular nation, you endorse them by going to the bottom of their nation&amp;#39;s web page, and click the endorse button.
It should be noted that the no matter who the WA Delegate is, the Capital is still Red City, P.R. Workers and Peasants. Furthermore, I maintain control of the map. 
Also, you can only endorse and be endorsed if you are a member of the world assembly.
