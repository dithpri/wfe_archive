A new region, founded by a country fed up of the WA, and sick of the corrupt regions of which it had been a part of. New (and old) countries that feel the same way are free to join. We aim to take over the WA by endorsing our Regional WA Delegate so much, that they have supreme control. We will rotate the WA Delegate every week.

So if you want to join, feel free.

Fred Thetasapoloupastou, Leader Of Theta, Founder Of The New Region Of Theta.
