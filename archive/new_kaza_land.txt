[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were out exploding planets and stuff with their giant death ray nest when suddenly jedi party crashers came along to ruin their fun! Luckily for the sith hawks, a shorter version of Yoda came along and shared a few words of wisdom before taking out the jedis allowing them to conquer another planet. 

If you want in on the fun, we have more planet blowing up festivities in our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]nest[/url].
