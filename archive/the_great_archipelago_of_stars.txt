This region earned its name due to the awesome amount of stars that one can see in the sky. They are even visible from the cities that dot its many large and small islands. There are many varying climates throughout its islands (from jungles to deserts) some of which can be considered almost continental in size. More info will be provided as more is learned about those who live in this region.
