This region will be run in much the same way as a former region of Eshurim, meaning that every nation will be able to participate in an in-depth role-playing experience composed not only of war, but of commerce, and of culture. Newly-joined nations must contact the founder, [nation]Melqan[/nation], to discuss your Khavokim regional I.D., which is essentially your RP profile for the region of Khavokim. Your Regional I.D. may be slightly different than the way you generally portray your nation, but that will all be decided via telegram.
