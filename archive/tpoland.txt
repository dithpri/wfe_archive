Bordering the arctic is an island around twice the size of the united kingdom. It is surrounded by automatic turrets and naval bases on all sides. Behind the defenses lies a true utopia, Patiterram, and its inferior allies. Together they form Tpoland, a region of ultimate power and the ultimate citizens. Together they live in true happiness with the ultimate freedoms and luxury. All other regions shiver before the greatness of Tpoland. All kneel down before our great leader, the ultimate being, a God amongst us. Long life Tposs!
