Beginning on or around 2184, the Super Earth Federation initiated a series of escalating special military operations which would ultimately culminate in the declaration of war on all &quot;agents of Tyranny&quot;.

Initially, descendants of the Bugs known as Terminids breached their enclosures, rapidly reproducing and spreading through the eastern sectors. Shortly after, a new yet vaguely familiar enemy emerged on the south-western sectors: the Automaton Legion. With two enemy armies threatening galactic peace, Super Earth mobilized The Helldivers on February 8th, 2184.

Much later, on December 12th 2184, a third enemy faction joined the war: The Illuminate.
