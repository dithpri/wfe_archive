Orientalium is one of many translations of East in Latin. I founded Orientalium because my nation-state is meant to be a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire a.k.a. the Byzantine Empire making it relevant I found a region for eastern nation-states. Anyone is welcome to Orientalium. The geography of Orientalium is eastern Mediterranean. Whoever has experience being a World Assembly Member is automatically a candidate for the region&#39;s World Assembly Delegate. As founder I am open to ideas on how to improve Orientalium in any way.
