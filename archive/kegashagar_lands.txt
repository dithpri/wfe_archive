The lands of Kegashagar have been and are the home of hundreds of peoples, nations and tribes, wild, savage and cruel, is the land upon which you feast your very eyes when you decide you want to visit the world of old.
Mountians higher than the very clouds, caves deeper then the pits of Veles, and seas and oceans broader then the sky, this my friend, are the lands of Kegashagar.
