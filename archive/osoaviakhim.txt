The Society for the Assistance of Defense, Aircraft and Chemical Construction (abbreviated as OSOAVIAKhiM) was a Soviet socio-political defense organization that existed from 1927&#150;1948.

The goal of the society was preparation of reserves for armed forces. It soon became a powerful militarised organisation with its own airfields, radio clubs, parachuting towers and firing ranges.

OSOAVIAKhIM supported a number of professional research and development programs for airplanes, glider, airships and stratospheric balloons, some of which were later taken over by the Soviet Air Forces. In the 1930s, Sergey Korolev&#39;s rocket research organisation (the GIRD) and Oleg Antonov&#39;s glider project, among other efforts, were part of the OSOAVIAKhIM.
