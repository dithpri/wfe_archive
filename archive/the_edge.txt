This is a conservative religious region where I can rule as I please - yet almost all embassy requests are welcome.

&quot;No one knows what he himself is made of, except his own spirit within him, yet there is still some part of him which remains hidden even from his own spirit; but you, Lord, know everything about a human being because you have made him...Let me, then, confess what I know about myself, and confess too what I do not know, because what I know of myself I know only because you shed light on me, and what I do not know I shall remain ignorant about until my darkness becomes like bright noon before your face.&quot;
~ Augustine of Hippo, Confessions
