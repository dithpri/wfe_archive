[u][b]Welcome to the Space Age[/b][/u]

Hello and welcome all! We&#39;re a sci-fi region of Galactic Empires and multiple galactic races! We are a region that jokes a lot so don&#39;t join if you&#39;re ultra-sensitive. Our region uses Science Fiction Theories that are actually able to happen in real life (or at least have some basis in RL science-don&#39;t bring up wormholes), so if you don&#39;t even know that a star is made of plasma then this region might be too intellectual for you.

We are fine with Inter-regional RP and all Sci-Fi regions are allowed to join however we will need to set down some rules before then.
