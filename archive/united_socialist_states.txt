The USS is extremely oppressive and has the right to free handedly form any rule or law that it finds suitable without an election.  Each nation that joins will pay what is called a Corruption Insurance Fee (CIF), which protects them from political unbalance. This fee is what keeps the region from falling apart completely. The more likely a nation is to face corruption, both civilly and economically, the more revenue it will be forced to put towards it&amp;#39;s CIF. However, a minimum tax towards each countries citizens will be mandated to ensure a stable flow of revenue towards each nations CIF. If a nation chooses not to abide by this rule, it will be expelled with force and/or declared war upon by the USS.
