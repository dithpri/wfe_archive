On October 15, 1945, the brand-new region of Sentenius was founded. After a bloody war that lasted 10 years, it was finally ended when 2 atomic bombs were dropped on Auckland. The countries woke up, they realized the dangers of war, and how much worse off it can get. After ratification of the Allied Powers Bill, the Sentenian Union decided to form a region that would end all wars in the future. Welcome to Sentenius.
