[b]The Nations Against Raiders (NAR)! Where we hate raiders, and we believe that [i]ALL[/i] raiders should stop existing![/b]

Everyone, of all races, genders, political ideologies and religions are allowed. Just no raiders! 

We are all united in the face of raiderdom, whom which seeks to control and manipulate regions from the shadows, weaving through the clutches of the World Assembly to cause mass havoc and destruction. The entire concept of raiding is inherently just a virus, seeking to control innocent nations, destroying communities built through years, all for...[i]fun[/i]?

We must unite. Divided, we&#39;ll fall. But united? We&#39;ll win. Here stands NAR, against raiders, [i]forever[/i].
