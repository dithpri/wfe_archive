A lush, humid archipelago of volcanic islands and dense jungle, the Subtropical South Pacific is a region of strategic significance and constant tension. Rich in uranium, timber, and exotic fisheries, it is coveted by local nations and foreign powers alike.

Conflict Drivers:
Resource disputes: Uranium mines and deep-sea fisheries are hotly contested.
Piracy &amp; insurgency: Jungle terrain and isolated islands make law enforcement difficult.
Ethnic and cultural tensions: Indigenous island communities resist foreign influence and militarization.
Geopolitical friction: Smalindraad Peninsula and neighboring powers vie for influence, often through proxy skirmishes and covert operations.
