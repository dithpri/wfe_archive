So I was at school and a friend gave me a muffin he&#39;d left in his bag. The muffin was squashed flat, there was no hope for it. Anyway, an hour later I was founding my own region and couldn&#39;t think of a title. I was like what about &quot;Pretty Good&quot; or &quot;Idubbbz&quot; or something but none of it felt like the right choice, then I saw the muffin. it was sitting on my computer flatter than ever and I thought &quot;hey, that&#39;s pretty good&quot;. Anyway, that&#39;s the story of Flat Muffin and how it was founded.

Note: Flat Muffin is in no way, shape or form an innuendo.
