Welcome to the FSRTP! It&#39;s a lengthy name, I know. This is a humble place. By free-spirited, we mean that any kind of nation is allowed to join, regardless of your nation&#39;s ethics and morality. I don&#39;t have any intentions of joining the WA, not yet at least. I&#39;m no expert in it either, so if you wish to inform me more about it, feel free to inform me. This is simply a place to socialize about NationStates shenanigans and RP with each other&#39;s nations!
