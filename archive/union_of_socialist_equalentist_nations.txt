The Union of Socialist Equalentist Nations (U.S.E.N) is an equalentist and socialist union originally created by [b][nation]Youtauma Empire[/Nation][/b] to bring socialists, communists, egalitarians, feminists, and anti-fascist nations together. It also serves as an LGBTQIA+ space and any LGBTQIA+ nations are welcomed here! Please remember that any form of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, ableism, etc. will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban from the region. Although this is primarily a socialist region, nations that practice a mix of socialism and capitalism are also welcomed. For a less techy and more isolationist experience away from modern society, check out the sister region [region]Union of Socialist Naturalist Territory[/region]!
