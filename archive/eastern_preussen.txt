East Prussia (German: Ostpreu&szlig;en) was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1773 to 1829 and again from 1878 (with the Kingdom itself being part of the German Empire from 1871); following World War I it formed part of the Weimar Republic&#39;s Free State of Prussia, until 1945. Its capital city was K&ouml;nigsberg (present-day Kaliningrad). East Prussia was the main part of the region of Prussia along the southeastern Baltic Coast.
