[colour=#006BFF][b]It&#39;s Pi Day! To celebrate, Lulu Suzuhara lead the way to gather pies but experienced some difficulties. The instability of the environment gave way early on, and after a while of fighting, it stabilised... but something was off. Everywhere she went now, the colours of the environment had their saturation increased to high volume, hills were now impossibly round, roads ended abruptly and misaligned, and more. 

But no worries, we got enough pies to throw a party! The locations we went to might not be the same, however...[/b][/colour]
