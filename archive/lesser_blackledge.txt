The allies and protectorates of the Royal Empire reside in a region known as Lesser Blackledge, a non-contiguous political area distinct from the heart of the Empire.

This region is a haven for those states who wish to preserve their sovereignty and culture. Nanny states and communists are looked down on, and monarchy is respected in its own right.
