[color=#ED4719]Navezgane County Arizona, a &quot;rare Eden in a world of devastation&quot;, is the main location in 7 Days to Die. It is a fictional county in Arizona that has been overrun by a zombie apocalypse. However, in the Apache language, [i]&#147;Navezgane&#148;[/i] means [i]&quot;Killer of Monsters.&quot;[/i] In other words, it means the Apache recognize the state&#39;s skill in eliminating tyrants. and zombies. I&#39;m pretty good at that too.[/color][hr]
