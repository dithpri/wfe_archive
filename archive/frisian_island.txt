My name is Jan, 
I am the Founder of the Frisian Islands. 
You may be asking- What can the Frisian Islands do for me? 
Well, as a region we are all very connected and peaceful. In the Frisian islands, you can be nominated to be the WA delegate. 
The Frisian Islands share two flags. The Frisian Flag, and the Nordfriesland Flag. 10 of the 17 members in the Frisian Islands also share the same National Animal, Motto, and currency, which is the DFG- Das Friesisches Geld. 
All of the nations in the Frisian Islands are Empires. There are requirements to live here though: YOU MUST BE AN EMPIRE. YOU MUST EITHER FLY THE FRISIAN FLAG OR THE NETHERLANDS FLAG.
