[b][color=darkgreen]The sunny coasts of Gran Colombia provide a welcome resting place.[/color][/b]

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said:&#151;Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shatter&#39;d visage lies, whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamp&#39;d on these lifeless things,
The hand that mock&#39;d them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
&quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!&quot;
Nothing beside remains: round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
