Is it normal for a guy to wear scuba apparatus when he makes love in the sea (make love to me)? Would it be weird for you if I touched your fishy hole, I know it would be for me. Do you have mermaid parties beneath the sea (am I invited)? At these mermaid parties do you smoke seaweed (if so, then how do you light it)? Are you the answer to a drunken sailor&amp;#39;s lonely wish (wish wish)? Or are you an optical illusion caused by a woman sitting on a rock, holding half a fish (half a sexy fish)?
