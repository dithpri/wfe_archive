Set inside the oldest tree in Makna Forest, Frontier Village is the sole Nopon settlement on the Bionis. Many Nopon live within the protective shell of the tree, but many others have spread throughout the world acting as scientists and merchants; exploring the world and selling what they find to the Homs and Bird people.
