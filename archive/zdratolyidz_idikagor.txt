Zdra&amp;#539;olyidz Idikagor can be roughly translated as &quot;Desert-like Shores&quot; from Festdidgean. It is named this as the region is characterised by the vast desert landscapes that meet with the grand oceans, surrounding the dry terrain. This region was first settled by Festdidgea and is home to peaceful and moral nations.
