Welcome to the [color=gray] Silver Khanate[/color], recruit. Do you seek riches? Fame? Or do you simply wish to feel the exhilaration of crushing the enemy under your boot? Here you will find all this and more.[hr]

In the [color=gray]Silver Khanate[/color] we hope to build a strong community based on the raiding and defending aspects of NationStates. However, if you don&#146;t enjoy R/D very much, there are still other things you can do in the region. We hope to create a fleshed out government system, with democratic elections and political parties.[hr]
