Now, I have nothing against the WHO on an existential level, my distaste for globalism does not collide with the respect for an organization dedicated to promoting health. However, the recent scandal in which the WHO soiled their name by working with the CCP in the Chinese cover up has made me no longer approve of them. This region had no military or political significant in terms of NS gameplay, but I wanted to add it to my empire anyways.
