The Celestial Isles are home to the Ik&amp;#39; Ka&amp;#39; Ek&amp;#39; Akai people, whose name translates to &amp;quot;the moon, stars, and sea&amp;quot;. The isles were henceforth named after them. Despite being tribal, they have learned to use modern tools. Their claim is not a true confederation, as nations are not technically united. They will allow nations individual freedoms, as they understand other nations work differently than they do. The nations are allowed to govern themselves in most ways. All nations are allowed to hold a grand council to propose ideas or make statements, though the Ik&amp;#39; Ka&amp;#39; Ek&amp;#39; Akai hold final judgement. (Flag: Celestial Isles from above)
