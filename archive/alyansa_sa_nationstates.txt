Alyansa sa Nationstates is an exclusive alliance of progressive nations with extremely diverse and multiperspective political and economic principles, united by a common interest: to erase the colors red and yellow from the color palette. Most of the Nations are led by highly empowered college students who would die for their principles but have no idea what the hell they&amp;#39;re doing.
