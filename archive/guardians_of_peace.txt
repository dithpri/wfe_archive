[b][u]Guardians of Peace[/u][/b]

The Guardians of Peace was an independent, gameplay organization created to handle gameplay affairs of the Audaxian Frontier of Audax. However, with Audax now focusing solely on gameplay, the Guardians of Peace no longer serves any purpose and is being discontinued.

In the words of the Frontier Marshal of the Guardians of Peace and the former Chief Guardian of the Audaxian Frontier, holding the Constitutional position of Founder in the [u]Second Constitution of the Audaxian Frontier of Audax[/u] (all of which is Sad-States): &quot;As we continue our endeavors under the name of Audax, we find it appropriate to discontinue the Guardians of Peace. We thank all our former members for their service and dedication to the organization.&quot;
