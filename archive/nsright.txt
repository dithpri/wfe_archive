NSRight is an alliance of regions that advocate conservatism and intend to spread it throughout NationStates, resisting values that advocate globalism, Marxism, and the liberal agenda. The purpose and goal of NSRight are to allow right-wing/conservative regions the opportunity to collectively fight the influences that support cultural/political globalization and Marxism, as well as respectfully acknowledge the unique cultures of our world in a mature manner.

Feel free to share regional matters here, but please forbear any oppressive speech, interpersonal conflict, and other sensitive affairs off of the Regional Message Board.[hr][b][i]You are the Resistance![/b][/i]
