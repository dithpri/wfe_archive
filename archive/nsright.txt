NSRight is an alliance of regions that advocate conservatism and intend to spread it throughout NationStates, resisting values that advocate globalism, marxism, and the liberal agenda. The purpose of NSRight is to allow right-wing/conservative regions the opportunity to collectively fight the influences that support cultural/political globalization, marxism, and fight for the preservation of individuality, tradition, and cultures of our world.
