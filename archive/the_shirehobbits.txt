The Shire-hobbits are a peace-loving region with no inclination to fight unless necessary. There are no strict laws concerning or affecting the Shire-Hobbits, and find no inclination to venture on quests. We will forever be united in subsections: Baggins, Brandybucks, Proudfeet, Boffins, Tooks, Chubs, and any new hobbit-kind not concerned with Smaug therefore.
