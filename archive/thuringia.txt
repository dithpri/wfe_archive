Thuringia is a state in central Germany known for its vast spans of forests punctuated with mountain peaks and medieval villages. Its capital is Erfurt, home of 8th-century Dom St. Marien, where Martin Luther, father of the Protestant Reformation, was ordained. As a monk, Luther lived in the medieval Augustinerkloster (monestary). Zitadelle Petersburg is an imposing baroque fortress outside the city.
