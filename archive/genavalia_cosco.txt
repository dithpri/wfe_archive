Founded January 26, 2017, the region of Genavalia Cosco is a growing alliance of nations of varying political and government backgrounds, but all with one goal in mind, to achieve power and influence in the world. The methoday be questionable, but the goal is of a noble one: to unite the many rouge nations and regions into one global government organization. We believe this to be the best course of action for the people. Any nation is free to join this alliance, so long as they are active.
