Long ago, Yami, the God of Darkness, was defeated by the great goddess, Mother Amaterasu. After years of war and feudalism in the unholy demon realm of Yomi, systems of alliances, treaties, and unions had created a single unholy empire, the Yomese Empire, lead by its most powerful and populous city-state, Sakai (renamed from Kashimura), also known coloquially as Capital City. After yet another revolution in the 1950s, this time by crown princess Hikari Shinonome, a polarizing new school of thought was introduced that would take the Empire by storm: the belief that you can be a force for evil and still be a good person.
