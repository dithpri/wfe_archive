Welcome to Paul-Dowdell School. Our countries are committed to enslaving those we see unfit to live free and progressing economically.

Our school offers the opportunity to learn at a high level in the arts, sciences, and letters. We are excited about the growth in the number of Advanced Placement (AP) courses, technology courses, and electives in social studies and science. We are committed to providing high-level support services in Academic Intervention (AIS) and special education.
