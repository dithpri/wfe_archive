Hello! Nubibus Kulleri is an assortment of islands that surround a continent called Nubibus. We are a casual region that allows role-play and has occasional elections or votes. Alien/Non-Human nations are allowed. [b]If you are in the WA, endorse [nation]Galahand[/nation].[/b] Being in the world assembly is encouraged as it allows us to differentiate between human and puppet.
