Hello! Nubibus Kulleri is an assortment of islands that surround a continent called Nubibus. We are trying to be a role-play region but so far everyone seems way too casual, cough

Recently the region has had a regional government reform, in which it is now ruled by a royal family and their magistrates.

Being in the world assembly is encouraged as it allows us to differentiate between human and puppet.

All normal regional stuff will be moved to dispatches in the immediate future, please stand by.
