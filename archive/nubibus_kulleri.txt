Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at our region.
Nubibus Kulleri was made after a former region went through a schism between the nations. We are a casual region that allows role-play and elections every 4-5 months. Alien/Non-Human nations are allowed. [b]If you are in the WA, endorse [nation]Galahand[/nation].[/b]

[color=red]Rules[/color]

- [B][u][color=red]Raider puppets will not be tolerated. All nations will be searched for any connections with factions like DEN.[/color][/u][/B]

- In general, be decent. Don&#39;t act like [nation=short]The Drumpf[/nation].
[more rules to come in the future]
