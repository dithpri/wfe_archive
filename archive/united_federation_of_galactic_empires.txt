[b] Liberty, Peace, and Justice! The United Federation of Galactic Empires is a medium sized region that has a large history. We are very active and we like to RP. We accept any and all. However, this region is futuristic taking place in the year 5000-5050. We have political parties, only two. Each have their own views, goals, and purposes. Enjoy! [/b]
