[color=#65A695]World-building is just fictional writing. You may write something entirely impossible in the real world, or aim for verisimilitude. I myself aren&#39;t an experienced writer, but I enjoy that just how a cat loves scratching bed sheets. If you are very new to world-building, take a look at [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1823244]this short guide[/url] and try reading around other factbooks.
