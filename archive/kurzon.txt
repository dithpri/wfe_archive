Kurzon is a large and vibrant continent, with a diverse climate populated by diverse peoples. Ethnic violence and international tensions have subsided in the past half century, but rogue states can still be a cause for concern. However, not all is bad. In fact, the economies of several countries in the region are top-tier and the region is a leader in science and research. Crime tends to be low in the developed states of Kurzon and the breathtaking views of the countryside belie the slew of natural resources that dot the region.
