[i]&quot;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!&quot; cries she
With silent lips. &quot;Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&quot;[/i]

-Emma Lazarus, 1883
