[hr]Welcome to Karanlik Yollar, a true democratic region, just like the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea! Ever felt like you were always lost in the endlessly-treacherous halls of those larger, &quot;democratic&quot; regions like 10000 Islands or Europe? Well, not anymore! In Karanlik Yollar, we are a small community so everybody (all two of us) knows everybody! So, what are you waiting for? Come join, talk, have some &quot;fun&quot;, and always remember, Iste Geldik Gidiyoruz!
