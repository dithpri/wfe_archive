[i][color=maroon]A world beholden to itself, the Ancient Towers stands free from the culture of fear and hatred of people unlike themselves of the rest of the world. It is an old place filled with history, and continues to make history today.[/color][/i]

[b]Welcome, welcome, welcome, weary travellers. Thank you for stopping by the Ancient Towers. Unfortunately, all of our open spots are closed to prospective buyers right now.

So visit for as long as you like, but you cannot stay. Of course, unless you can answer the ancient riddle.[/b]
