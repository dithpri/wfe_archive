The Two Archipelagos is a region based around the Maldives. The region is set in an alternate history Earth where the United Suvadive Republic succeeds in their secession from the Maldives with support from the equally tiny Sultanate of Lakshadweepa. In the 2000s, Lakshadweepa and their ally the United Suvadive Republic try the best they can to stop their rival from reclaiming their &#39;rightful land&#39;. With the Maldivian Sultanate having a new warlike Sultan ascend to the throne, the USR and Lakshadweepa get ready as war seems to lurk on the horizons.
