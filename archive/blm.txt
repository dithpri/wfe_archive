Formerly-founderless region REFOUNDED March 17, 2021.

Region presently LOCKED to prevent uninvited guests from coming in and spreading hate. (If you remember what this region was like before it was refounded, you know what I&#39;m talking about.)

[b]QUESTION:[/b] Should we keep the region locked to prevent racist vandals from attacking it, or should we open it up and try to make it a place for the BLM movement on NationStates to call home? [b]Please telegram [nation]BLMerica[/nation] with your answer.[/b]

Thank you very much.
