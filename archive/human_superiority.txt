Humanity is superiority, there are no beings above us, we are the dominate, we are the strong, we do not bow down to the whims of inferior filth, the ponies, the dragons, the dinosaurs, all of them, they are inferior scum, they must be subjugated under Human rule, it is the will of Mankind to control all the non-Humans, for too long we have shared this planet with those pathetic lesser beings, for too long they have claimed they are better then us in every way, one day, that will change as our armies march over their land, that day, is coming.
