When humanity started to colonize space, the hunger of power never ceased to grow into the minds of the wrong people.

One of those space colonies reached important milestones in technology and became one of the world&#39;s most technologically advanced nations. However, fascists took over the colony and imposed their far-right ideology.

After the government ordered the death of its opponents, the remaning freedom fighters escaped onto the many stations orbiting over the colony, and managed to get them under their control.

Taking the codename of the stations, the &quot;Tannhauser Project&quot;, these utopists rallied many citizens to their cause, and formed a new civilization, offering freedom for those struggling on the wasteland that has become the colony.
