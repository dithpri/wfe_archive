Welcome I&amp;#39;m sooooo glad to see you!!!!


This relatively HUGE region&amp;#39;s people love their shopping and clothes. They are bordered on two sides by rivers. The cultural difference with their neighbours is the size of their swimsuits. There are two major cities, June City the largest of which is located in the center of the region. They are currently troubled by intense shortage of gowns . The people are of mixed taste of clothes. They are proud of their local traditions.
