Welcome to Shakespeare Colony! We are a community based on Orson Scott Card&#39;s [u]Ender&#39;s Game[/u] universe.

Shakespeare is a region located in a solar system many light-years away from Sol. Equipped with Formic technology (the Philotic Parallax Instantaneous Communicator), we are capable of instantaneous communications with our friends back on Earth. The cutting-edge georelocation technology is similarly capable of instantaneously transporting your nation across space to this region--we checked with Max&#39;s engineers. So why wait? Join Shakespeare today!
