The puppets of the Democratic Republic of [nation]Melicorium[/nation] are kept here.

A video game company called MGM Electronics International, based in Las Vegas, owns a computer game called Moneybag Bay. In this game, you are able to play as one of four fictitious nations, which are different than Melicorium in some way or another, but they all have one thing in common: they permit private industry and a free market. This game exposes the ineffectiveness of the capitalist system, and how the workers in these four countries, all located next to each other on a small bay, are exploited by the bourgeois for their own wealth. The four countries are named Melicoria, KOnNekEr, Ezekiluwa, and Jehovahs Witneses.
