Property of [region]Libertatem[/region].

Once a military base of the old [region]The Cooperative Union[/region], the pre-2014 regime used this region as a launchpad to opportunistically seize [region]The New German Reich[/region] after it had been jointly invaded by [region]Libertatem[/region] and the [region]UCR[/region]. The stolen property was eventually returned to [region]REATO[/region]&amp;#39;s possession, and this region has been acquired as damages.
