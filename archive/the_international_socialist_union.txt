the Nations of the ISU, hereby pledge to uphold the values of Socialism (a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system) and Egalitarianism (is a trend of thought that favors equality for all people). 

&#149;all people are equal in the eyes of the law and all those found guilty of breaking this law will be judged by due process and dealt with accordingly. 
&#149;all nations are expected to uphold a libertarian-far left standing in both social and economic policies.
