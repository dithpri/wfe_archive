Welcome!

After not finding a region that wasn&#39;t too complicated or roleplay heavy or just overall busy, I, the leader of the Free State of Topucky, decided to make my own. I have literally no idea what I&#39;m doing. So if no one joins and it&#39;s just Topucky rocking it out here, so be it. 

A few rules:
-Be nice, man.
-Don&#39;t be not nice, man.
-Topucky is interested in nation states with free, open, caring governments. 
-If you are more of a extreme capitalist bad boy or dictatorship, maybe we won&#39;t get along. But it does take all kinds, right? You won&#39;t be outright removed unless you can&#39;t follow the first two rules.

Other stuff to come, probably?
