The Newly formed Region of Kolechan-controlled countries. After a swift and violent coup-de-ta the nation of Old Kolecha was able to overthrow the previous neglectful ruler known as the Innovative Dictators. They refused to make any advances to our societal region and with only their sure firepower, Old Kolecha was able to, on their own, overthrow that tyrannical, neglectful, hell spawn of a ruler.

All Hail Kolecha, All Hail the Glorious Leader!
