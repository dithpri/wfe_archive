[b][u] The Pact of Intergrated Nations[/u][/b]

The Pact is made, for Nations to further their development, and have the benefit of having other state along their backs for protection, with a simple common goal of becoming a great World Power. 
Any and all government bodies are allowed into the Pact, however the High Council, the group of representatives from each state to discuss the issues within the Pact and representative body for the World Assembly, is purely republic in nature.

If a lone state wishes to become apart of the Pact, a telegraph must be sent to Ackros, and appropriate number of one-two weeks will be used for the High Council to determine whether entry shall be permitted or not.
