[i][B]The beautiful waterfall makes you dream of what good expectations would happen in this region, but as you notice, you know that you...[/i][/B]

[i][B]Are in the Rocklands![/i][/B]

This place may be weak, but we still got many other things that make us a special and orderly region!

We have a discord that is used for nations to chat and talk with others, which is this link: https://discord.gg/jPjnFFT

We even have a role for a Delegate for someone to take, so make sure you are in the next line to take the role.

Also, since we are new, we could always need a little more help from you.

To god be your salvation,

Manaime
