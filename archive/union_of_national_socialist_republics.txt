Bolshevism is like a virulent disease that cripples then kills its host before moving onto the next host to replicate, but we have nothing to fear as long as the host nation removes the strain before it gets established. Under [nation]Der Fuhrer und Reichskanzler[/nation]&#39;s soul piercing steely gaze, the [region]Wehrmacht of the Reich[/region] will march in immaculately pressed Prussian grey uniforms on all bolshevik holdings and grind them into dust. We are a Reich, not a Republic, and stamp out democratic socialist parliamentarianism wherever we find it [/color][/b]
