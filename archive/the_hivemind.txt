Those who hunt for ones like me are precedent for a challenge.

So disabuse ,Forego,the seduction,and keep treading,until you can observe, the sun in the sky.

&quot;So riddle me this,Riddle me that,What animal has,feathers so long,wings so short,that it cannot fly,a tail so long,a head so long,no beak,but eyes of a hawk,as tall as a man,as long as a car,its ancient, long ago. Once you discover, entry is guaranteed, as the password locks, behind the key of the riddle.
