Progressian nations should:

Be dedicated to mankind&amp;#39;s intellectual and technological progress.

Hold the priority of future generations of man higher than that of the current generation. Man should serve not its government nor itself, but its future.

Have no tolerance for corruption. This is not a psychotic dictatorship haven. Dictatorships here are only so to shake the indecisiveness, inefficiency and sluggishness of democracies in order to better carry out the requirements above. Democracies are not advised, but welcome.

Be diplomatically active.

Use the New Dollar as their official currency.
