[b][color=red]&amp;#10070; WELCOME TO KAER MORHEN, SCHOOL OF THE WOLF &amp;#10070;[/color][/b][hr][hr]
Kaer Morhen is an ancient, legendary hold wherein young orphans are trained, mutated, and molded into Witchers: Beings that inhabit the world of men and monsters, never being fully either one. They protect both worlds, but not for free. If you need a problem solved that is above your paygrade, and you have the coin to afford one, a Witcher will always be the most reliable solution.
