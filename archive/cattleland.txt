Welcome to the region of [region]Cattleland[/region].  This here is a new ranching and old west themed region.  Democracy and community support reign supreme here.  When you get settled here you can found a ranch, run for public office, open a shop, or plain just settle in town and live a quiet life.  The capitol of this region is Longhorn, Wyoming.  This will be a small town,  there can be other communities that spring up too.  I really hope you all like the region.  I know this region is small right now but it has great potential.
