[b]&quot;Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart. Whoever wants it back has no brain.&quot; [i]Vladimir Putin [/i][/b]

That is why we set our eyes to Socialism, which is about equality for the people, and [b]Democracy[/b],with free speech. This combination enables us to treat everyone equaly and also to hear their voice and pleas, rather than listening only to what we think.

We are with you there, Putin.
