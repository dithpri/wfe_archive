[b]&quot;Whoever does not miss the [color=red]Soviet Union[/color] has no heart. Whoever wants it back has no brain.&quot; [i]Vladimir Putin [/i][/b]

That is why we set our eyes to Socialism, which is about equality for the people, be it worker, entrepreneur or intellectual,  and [b]Democracy[/b],with free speech. This combination enables us to treat everyone equally and also to hear their voice and pleas, rather than listening only to what we think.

&quot;[color=red][b]Socialism[/b][/color] needs [color=blue][b]Democracy[/b][/color] like the [b]Human Body[/b] needs [b]Oxygen[/b].&quot; [i]Leon Trotsky[/i]

We are with you there, Putin and Trotsky.
