[b] Say NO! to Capitalism! [/b]
Capitalism has gone corrupt in the years! Who wants to be oppressed by the rich? [b] NOBODY! [/b] Yet Capitalism doesn&#39;t care if you are poor with no insurance over anything! All they care is [color=green][b] MONEY[/b][/color]! Where are the voices of the [b]Oppressed[/b]? [b]Aren&#39;t you tired of being oppressed?[/b] All workers of all kind, are you treated [b]FAIRLY[/b]? Or are you treated [b]UNFAIRLY[/b] like what [b]most people with power do[/b]?

I hear your cries for equality, my people! I hear how much you are suffering, my people! And now I call to you, my people, [b]IT IS TIME TO RISE, AND BRING PEACE, EQUALITY, MORAL AND JUSTICE TO THE WORLD![/b]
