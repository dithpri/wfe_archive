Situated just in the southern Caribbean and the north coast of South America, the Dutch West Indies is a tranquil and prosperous region where commerce reigns and the gelder pays. Piracy is not tolerated here unless they answer to us, the VOC or the Stadhouder.

Members of this region only must pay me a small tax of waffles and fish tacos in order to be properly protected by Feltzenland&amp;#39;s massive naval squadrons of Fluyts, Race built Galleons, and Corsairs.

So sit back, enjoy some rum, and buy some wooden shoes made of coconut husks!
