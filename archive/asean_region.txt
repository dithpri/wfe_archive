Tips:
[color=green][B]1) No offensive images allowed.
2) Game gives you a new issue every 12 hours, up to 2 a day (1 per update)
3) You can have as many accounts as you want but only one can be a WA member at a time, or you get banned.
4) Pop growth is not decided by issues, and is random after 60 days.    
5) If you havent already, download nationstates++.[/B][/color]
