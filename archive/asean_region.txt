A new singaporean/ASEAN region. Since the old Singapore one is founderless and vulnerable to raiders, and I&#39;m fairly active, thought Id start this.

Tips:
[color=green][B]1) No offensive images allowed.
2) Game gives you a new issue every 12 hours, up to 2 a day (1 per update)
3) You can have as many accounts as you want but only one can be a WA member at a time, or you get banned.
4) Pop growth is not decided by issues, check here: http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=116740[/B][/color]
5) If you havent already, download nationstates++, its really useful.
