Greetings, everyone, and welcome to a new galaxy with an abundance of resources. And yet, despite its vast resources, this uncharted galaxy is war-torn, the remnants of a war between the Grand Circle and the Reverent still ring throughout the cosmos. The current factions are between the Reclaimers and the New Circle - who will you choose, or will you remain neutral?
