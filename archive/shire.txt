The Shire is a small but beautiful and fruitful land, beloved by its inhabitants. The Shire is quite densely populated in parts with many villages and a few towns, but it still is open enough to allow for wide forested areas and marshes. The Shire has no topographical borders, but rather is bounded by the ancient south and east roads.
