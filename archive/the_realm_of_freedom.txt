Greetings and welcome to the Realm of Freedom, the only region in the game that makes [b]sense![/b]! Here, your civil rights will be upheld to the best of our abilities. Provided that the NationStates Moderators do not intervene, you are free to speak your mind without suppression. The only thing that [i]will[/i] be suppressed is spam (region/raid advertisements count as spam). Unless you continue to spam or you are caught using alts to circumvent a banjection, you will never be ejected from the Realm of Freedom, so why don&#39;t you stay for awhile and get comfy?
