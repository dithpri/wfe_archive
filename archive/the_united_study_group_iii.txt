The United Study Group was once a peaceful region. They mostly focused on roleplay, and fun things. But after a tidal wave of spamming, a modpocalypse, and raiders, The United Study Group was forced away. It was born anew under [nation]The Remnants of Kobol[/nation]&amp;#39;s protective watch. Soon after, a civil war-like occurrence between [nation=short]The Remnants of Kobol[/nation] and [nation]The Risen Jaguar Warriors[/nation] caused unrest. The region closed under Kobolian authority, but [nation]Shoulgan[/nation] made this region, hoping that the USG could start again, much as Shoulgan itself had once done.
