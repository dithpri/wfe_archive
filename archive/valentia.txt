Valentia was founded during the early 14th century when a coalition of French and Venetian merchants sought to establish new trade routes in the East. After a series of maritime expeditions, they discovered an uncharted continent rich in natural resources, fertile land, and strategic location for trade. Word of this discovery reached the Shogunate of Japan, which had also been exploring new territories for expansion and resources. Seeing a common interest, the merchants and the Shogunate formed a strategic alliance.
