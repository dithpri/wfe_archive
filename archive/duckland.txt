The perfect region for ducks of all shapes and sizes!
RULES:
1. Always refer to The Rubber Ducky as (the) &amp;quot;Ducksf&uuml;hrer&amp;quot;, and not anything else.
2. Salute the Ducksf&uuml;hrer every time you log on. He is watching.
3. Never disrespect Duckland, the Ducksf&uuml;hrer, the rules, or ducks in any way. There will be severe consequences.
4. No whining or being annoying in any way. You know what that means.
5. Only one account per person.
7. Note that there is no rule number 6: 6 is the regional Unlucky Number. If you are 6th place in the World Census Report, do not talk in the RMB for that day.
8. The Ducksf&uuml;hrer is always right.
9. Always use the terms &amp;quot;communist&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;duckophobe&amp;quot; as generic insults.
10. Remember that you are in the best region on NationStates.
