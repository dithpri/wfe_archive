This region is [region]Tinga[/region] governed by the democratically elected Government of June 7, 2025, before the coup at night on the same day. Officially a [b][color=red]Marxist-Leninist-Maoist[/b][/color] and [b][color=red]Anti-Revisionist[/b][/color] region, we do allow anyone to reside here, but those seeking a position of power must comply with the ideological requirements of the Constitution. Someday, this region will be unnecessary as the Government in Exile will return to power in [region]Tinga[/region], but for now, we reside here.
