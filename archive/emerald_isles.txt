The name &quot;Emerald Isles&quot; refers to the Region&#39;s beautiful, rolling countryside and deeply shaded green hills, which contrast greatly with the cobalt blue waters of the sea, endlessly beating down on the cliffs. Albeit a small population, the Isles offer a great deal of space and utility, ranging from residence to tourism. The ecosystem is embedded into the culture with most residents, but others prefer to mine away at the cliffs for Cobalt, salt formations, and even Cavansite, which is found in basaltic rocks by the cliffs. These parts of life are what make up the Isles, so be sure to be respectful to them and enjoy your stay.
