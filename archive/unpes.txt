The United States of Power, Equality* and Supremacy is a region that will remain for as long as possible and will never again be ruled by anyone, including any [i]black-bird people[/i]. Over time our power and influence will increase with more members and our survival will lengthen. Power is assigned only to the most trusted members to avoid overthrowal, and those who are entrusted with any power will be limited in all aspects. Whatever the size and political state of this region, we will remain. [i][b]Long live UNPES.[/b][/i]
