Peaceful and welcoming, the Lennox Shire is dominated by the Ubu nation that enforces strict regional rules. State sovereignty is a cardinal principle that guides the unequivocal decisions of Ubu over the Shire. Governments are thus able to exercise their authority over their national population independent of foreign states interventions. Ubu has no interest in foreign domestic politics as long as order and civility prevails internationally. The Lennox Shire cultivates freedom for those states that foster peace and prosperity with their neighbors.
