Odinn&amp;#39;s drengr means Odin&amp;#39;s warrior in Old Norse Language. We are a league focused on fighting for our freedom from the opression of the christian rule. We wish not for blood but if blood is what you wish for then let it be so. We will be honored to die in battle and join our ancestors in Valhalla
