The British Counties, made up of the affluent highland counties - Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire - and the poorer lowland counties - Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, form a democratic United Kingdom in northwestern Europe. Ruled by the Monarch, presently Her Majesty, the Queen Elizabeth Catherine, who presides over the British Parliament of Blenheim Palace from their primary residence at Windsor Castle, the Counties are surrounded by lush forests that are inhabited by nought but wildlife and untampered resources.
