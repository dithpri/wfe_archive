We are the ERN. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.
Tonight you have been a willing participant in a training operation with ERN&#39;s finest and guests from KoGB&#39;s Marines!

Captain / Captain General Norfolk, Trigger, ERN/KoGB
