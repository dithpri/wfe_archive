[hr]
The American Colonies are a region devoted to state sovereignty, confederation, and partnership between like minded individuals. Protected under the Crown of His Majesty, the American Colonies will grow as a boisterous region with much influence as time progresses.

Take a step back into the Colonial age!

Join the region today and claim a piece of land for your own, and join the Congress as a delegate to represent yourself in the region!
