The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America[/url][/b]

It has been REFOUNDED by a true Yankee Doodle Dandy, born on the Fourth of July. And with a firm reliance
on the protection of divine providence, I do pledge to this region my life, my fortune and my sacred honor.
(And that&amp;#39;s [i]&amp;quot;honor&amp;quot;[/i] spelled without a &amp;quot;u&amp;quot; in the middle, damnit!)
