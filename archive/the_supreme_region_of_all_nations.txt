Liberty ... Honour ... Strength ... Power

These are but a few qualities the nations of The Supreme States have in common. Through a collective vision, unity even in times of upheaval and the unwavering desire to determine our destiny and that of the people we are sworn to represent, we aim to become the most powerful region there has ever been. This power is not one which we hope to use in order to gain superiority over our fellow nations, but rather the likes of which we wish to use to bring prosperity to our individual nations within our region and to all the world&#39;s people.
