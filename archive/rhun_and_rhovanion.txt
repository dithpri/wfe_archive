Rh&ucirc;n, also called The East and Eastlands in the Westron tongue, was a large region in far-eastern Middle-earth. It was the home of the Easterlings in the Second and Third Ages. It had many different groups who often fought each other but who were united by Sauron in hatred of the West, and served him in the War of the Rings.
