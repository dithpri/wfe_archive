The Greater Phoenix Alliance is a region that preserves the legacy of the former West Alliance and the Greater German Empire. It is [i][b]dedicated into fighting the liberals, the leftists and Antifa, as well as protecting fellow nationalist or fascist regions.[/b][/i] We adhere to the ideology of [b]national populism[/b], which we believe is an approachable ideology to plenty of people, as it combines patriotism, traditionalism, populism and stands against liberal and communist ideologies, as well as atheism, anarchism and globalism.
