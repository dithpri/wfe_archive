The Greater Phoenix Alliance is a Christian &amp; Third Positionist region, successor to the former West Alliance. It is [i][b]dedicated into fighting liberals, left-wing and right-wing alike, as well as protecting fellow like-minded regions.[/b][/i] As stated above, we are supporters of [b]Third Positionist[/b] ideologies; our ideals combine nationalism, traditionalism and populism, while firmly standing against commercialism, individualism and marxism, as well as atheism, anarchism and globalism.
