The Greater Phoenix Alliance is a religious and patriotic region that preserves the legacy of the former West Alliance. It is [i][b]dedicated into fighting the liberals and the left-wing, as well as protecting fellow like-minded regions.[/b][/i] We adhere to the ideology of [b]national populism[/b], which we believe is an approachable ideology to plenty of people, as it combines patriotism, traditionalism, populism and stands against liberal and communist ideologies, as well as atheism, anarchism and globalism.
