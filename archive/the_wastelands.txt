Situated in the far north, the Wastelands are a vast continent located in the Great Northern Sea. Founded in 1099 by the great marauding explorer Bjorn Hammerfell, it has been the site of multiple wars throughout the troubled and turbulent history of the lands.

In 2012, The Wastelands were finally permitted to join the World Assembly after the 40 year old civil war in the region ended with the hanging of the Old Civil Guard and the proclamation of self-rule by all the states of the region.
