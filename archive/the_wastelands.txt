The WASTELANDS, as they are called, is given its name due to it facing the full force of the apocalypse, rendering any large-scale civilization here impossible. &quot;States&quot; here- if they can even be called that, mainly consist either of wandering armies searching for new loot, anarchist communes, bandit groups, and the extremist groups-- both from the left and the right. There is no resemblance of normalcy in the Wastelands; no one group dominating another,  only constant bloodshed and fighting.
