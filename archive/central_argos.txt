The Central Argos region was discovered three-thousand years ago by nomadic humans looking for a home. There they created a region-wide Republic. For over a thousand years the Republic stood and the region&amp;#39;s sole nation enjoyed stability and prosperity. However after a devastating drought, the Republic collapsed and anarchy ensued. Eventually, 1500 years ago, a sect of people formed the Argosian Empire. Later the Republic of Korvati and the Kingdom of Jolab formed and quickly became prominent members.
