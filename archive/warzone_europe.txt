The Medjai Guard has taken this poor European warzone in the name of [region]Osiris[/region]. We promise to end the war, clean the streets, get the trains running on time, and give everyone a 4 day work-week! We require nothing in return but your adoration, and your firstborns. And chocolate. Lots of chocolate. 

Hail the Pharaoh, hail the Medjai Guard &amp;amp; NPA. Hail [region]Osiris[/region]! [b]The Golden Age of Warzone Europe has officially begun![/b]

[color=red]Attention! Attention![/color] This is a special message from the new Military Governor of Warzone Europe: Asta!  Neener neener.  That is all.
