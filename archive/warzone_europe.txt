[color=teal][b]This land has been conquered by [region]Nevthronia[/region], a region which continues to grow rapidly and expand her regional power. Today marks the day of Nevthronia&amp;#39;s first foray into exercising her military might on an interregional stage.

1st Troops:
[nation]Nevthronia[/nation]
[nation]Black Skies[/nation][/b]

[list][i]What sets Nevthronia apart from the rest of NS is our capacity for growth; here, &amp;quot;growing community&amp;quot; is not a euphemism for &amp;quot;1-man hermitage&amp;quot; - it is a guarantee for the future. For anyone interested in watching this region blossom, our doors are open![/i][/color][/list]

[b]MISSION ACCOMPLISHED ~ ALL TROOPS ARE TO RETURN TO [region]NEVTHRONIA[/region][/b]
