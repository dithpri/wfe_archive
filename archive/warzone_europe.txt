[list][i]The above description is all true. What sets us apart from the rest of NS is our capacity for growth; here, &amp;quot;growing community&amp;quot; is not a euphemism for &amp;quot;1-man hermitage&amp;quot; - it is a guarantee for the future, issued by efficient, dedicated, and experienced recruiters. For anyone interested in watching this region blossom, our doors are open. And there is no experience as rewarding as participating in such a Penn-esque Holy Experiment.[/i][/color]
