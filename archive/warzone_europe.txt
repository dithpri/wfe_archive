 I ask that you please endorse me so that I may keep your borders safe. There are only two rules here, beyond that you are free to do as you please:

[b]Rule One:[/b] No spamming the RMB, I will suppress useless messages, a warning will be issued on the RMB, if the person doesn&amp;#39;t self-delete it, I will suppress it.
[b]Rule Two:[/b] If you are an WA you must endorse me before you endorse anyone else. If you do not I will have no choice but to eject you from the region.

I don&amp;#39;t want to do it, because I want this region to be a place of freedom, but without rules there can be no freedom, so some have to be placed in order for freedom to prosper.
Recruiting and World Assembly campaigns are permitted here within reason (as in don&amp;#39;t fill the entire RMB with ads.)
