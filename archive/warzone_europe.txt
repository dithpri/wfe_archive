[color=darkred]Well, this was a particularly funny operation: it being the first time NS ever majorly glitched on me, the first time a sit through two updates worked and then having two conversations for the initial raid attempt and relaying orders and not updating for two updates and, and... Haha, this was genuinely fun. :)[/color]
