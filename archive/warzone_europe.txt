[color=990000][b]The joint forces of the Legio Pacifica, the North Pacific Army, and the Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army have paid a visit to a region where embassies with our fellow GCRs were being closed by a Userite group and removed them. 

[region]The Pacific[/region] issues a friendly reminder to invader Amestris that GCR embassies are off-limits if they want us to ignore their raids.

~Hail Pacifica![/color]
