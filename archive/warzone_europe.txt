[b][color=darkred]That&#146;s right - these guys got raided, and it can happen to you too! The NPO is a notorious regime in control of the Pacific, and allying with them makes your region vulnerable to a coup! Especially warzones. If you don&#146;t heed this warning and cut ties with the NPO, you might be paid a visit by the LazCorp legal team - and a court order..[/color][/b]
