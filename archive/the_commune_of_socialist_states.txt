The Commune of Socialist States is a region dedicated to the maintaining and spreading of Communist ideals. You may not be Communist, but that doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t welcome! We are not here to force anyone to convert to Communism. Here at The Commune of Socialist States, war is a thing of the past! We hope to use the power of diplomacy to expand our influence and size. Onward Comrades! Urrah!
