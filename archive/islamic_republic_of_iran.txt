[color=green][b]BROTHERS, The Allied troops entered Iran at the invitation of the Iranian government.

I don&amp;#39;t know how to thank all of you for helping Iran in these hard times. I really appreciate your effort and fast response.

You all left me speechless. Thanks I am truly honored for having such friends.

Thanks once again BROTHERS and Allah bless you all! :)))[/b][/color]

[color=red][b]Reforms are the best solution for Iran unrests and outside invaders&amp;#39; efforts to provoke instability and separatism which are against regional peace and security.
The future of this region belongs to its nations, and The Union of Democratic States administration should change its policies as these have failed both domestically and internationally.[/b][/color]
