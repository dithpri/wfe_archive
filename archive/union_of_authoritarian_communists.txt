[b][color=blue]The lovable rogues of [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] have decided to pay this region a visit. Just in time, too.[/color]

Prowling through the forests of update in search of suitable prey, the Wolves chanced upon this region. The victim of some strange, ideological struggle -- the nature of which was baffling --, it was in need of improvement. Who better to offer said improvement than Lone Wolves United? Say thank you, Union of Authoritarian Communists! 

[color=red]Just remember: This only happens to natives. Don&#39;t be a native. Join the raiders and never be raided again![/color]
