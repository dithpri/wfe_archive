     The United Socialist Republics &amp;amp; States (USRS) is a coalition of nations, all sharing the same ideaology of Democratic Socialism. All countries in the USRS are expected to respect the ideas and concerns of the other nations within the Union. By joining the Union, you are agreeing to the following rules, restrictions, and guidelines.

1) Respect is earned, not given.
2) No rude comments, &amp;quot;puppet nations&amp;quot;, etc.
3) Try not to make a bad country, it brings down the region&amp;#39;s average.
4) Countries should be Socialist to join.
5) Have fun! (I guess...)
