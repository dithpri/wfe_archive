That an island of such nature and size once existed is evident from what is said by certain authors who investigated the things around the outer sea. For according to them, there were seven islands in that sea in their time, sacred to Persephone, and also three others of enormous size, one of which was sacred to Hades, another to Ammon, and another one between them to Poseidon, the extent of which was a thousand stadia and the inhabitants of it&#151;they add&#151;preserved the remembrance from their ancestors of the immeasurably large island of Tyrellia.
