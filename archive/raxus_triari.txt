and mainly the people that have followed me for so long, I ask you this, will you follow me into a new world and recreate the Empire?

Unfortunatly I can&#39;t found the empire yet because my score is&#39;nt high enough, so for now I shall reside with the [url=https://politicsandwar.com/alliance/id=5318]Roman Empire[/url] until I can found the Empire, can&#39;t wait to see you here.[/color][/b]
