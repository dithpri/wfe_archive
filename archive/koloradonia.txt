The region of Koloradonia is known for its ice cold summers and blazing hot winters. The demography of Koloradonia includes a majority of white people. However if you&amp;#39;re not white living in Koloradonia is not so bad as long as you don&amp;#39;t mind large amounts of white people who think Africa is a country.

Koloradonia was once entirely controlled by the nation of Monarchova. After many years, the people of the nation rose up against the central government. A civil war ensued, but finally the government fell. The former nomes of Monarchova had no desire to form another central government and declared independence one by one.
