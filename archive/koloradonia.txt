This is a region where snow is commonplace in the summer and blazing heats consistently roll through the winter, rain is the one consistent weather type in Koloradonia as you can always count on it pouring at least once a week, in parts of the stranger isle of Koloradonia bacon has been known to fall from the sky, whether this is truth or legend is up to you to decide. The most populous part of Koloradonia is in Monarchanova. Here white people prosper and although they try to not be racsist they can be very condesending, although if you are not white its not a bad place to live, if you dont mind overflowing amounts of white people who still think Africa is a country.
