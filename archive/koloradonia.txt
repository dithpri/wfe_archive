The small continent of Koloradonia was once entirely controlled by the nation of Monarchova. After many years, the people of the nation rose up against the central government of the nation. A long and bloody civil war ensued, but finally the government fell. The former providences of Monarchova, their common enemy eliminated, had no desire to form another central government and declared independence one by one. And so, the many vastly different nations that now occupy the continent were born.
