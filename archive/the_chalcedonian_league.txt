[i][color=#BF00BF]The Chalcedonian League is an International Alliance made official with the Treaty of Gij&oacute;n in 954 and still exists till today, making it the oldest alliance to ever exist. It was made official on the Spanish city of Gij&oacute;n in Asturias on 12 of December of 954.[/color][/i]
Here, Christians reunite in order to defend Christianity world-wide, and also to purge heresies that taint Christian leaning.
