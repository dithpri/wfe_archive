The Divisive States of Quah are a group of very different nations each working towards different goals. Ranging from a capitalists paradise to a socialist enclave, we seek to encompass all ranges of economic, political, and social ideals. New nations are always welcome. We have our own Regional Congress, Free Trade Agreement, United Anti-Furry Coalition, Map, and much more.
