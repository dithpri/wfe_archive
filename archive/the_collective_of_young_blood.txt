Welcome to [color=maroon][b]The Collective of Young Blood[/b][/color]!

COYB is a region specifically catered to a group of friends and acquaintances in a certain area, but it is by no means limited in this fact. Though we all know each other in one way or another, we are all very different. This diversity is incorporated into our government and thrives through our WA Members, making us a new but eager addition of the NationStates community.

If you are interested in joining our group, it is preferred you are acquainted with one or more of our members. However, a quick chat with our Founder or WA Delegate could also grant you membership, if you so desire.
