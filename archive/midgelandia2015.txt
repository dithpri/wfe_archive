[i]Hey![/i] This is [nation=short]Morality n Chill[/nation], and it&#39;s about freaking time I became Delegate, honestly. I would thank all my classmates overall but no one wanted to let me be delegate, so I&#39;m gonna hold off on that. However, I [i]would[/i] like to thank the people who let me bribe them with candy specifically, so props to you guys. Here we go. 
P.S. Remember to say your region&#39;s motto, [color=red] &quot;Jameson is always right!&quot;[/color] , at least once a day. This is a requirement.
