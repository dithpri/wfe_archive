Midgelandia is a class project for Ms. Midgett&amp;#39;s World History classes at Archbishop Hannan High School

All countries in Midgelandia are good, I respect all of these countries as part of my new reform program.
I would also like to add that yes, I have been a bad ruler ever since I was elected but today, I will be the better leader you all elected me to be.
