[color=red][i]Hey![/i] This is [nation=short]Apple iState[/nation], the 3rd World Assembly Delegate (3rd time&#39;s the charm :) . I want to say thanks to all my supporters! I would like to recognize [nation]The Legend of Weslantis[/nation], [nation]Brennanzuela[/nation], and [nation]ClassicChevrolet[/nation]. These nations (and others) have been great supporters. These nations are especially outstanding, but they have not had much recognition on the message boards. If you have not endorsed these nations yet, make sure to check them out![/color]
