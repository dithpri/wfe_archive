Welcome to the rich lands of Gamyria and Historica.
This Region of the world consists of 2 big continental Islands, Gamyria and Historica. They have a very diversive nature, with mountain ranges, deserts, tropical and boreal areas. The countries of Gamyria and Historica are organized in an organization called the &quot;Political League of Gamyria and Historica&quot;, who votes a delegate who&#39;s the official non Executive representative of the region. All Nations in this Region have different governmental systems, and are not obligated to join the WA.
