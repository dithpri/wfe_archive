First thing&#39;s first; this region does not claim sovereignty from its home region; Westfalen Westphalia. We are in-fact an off-branch/colony of that region, and so was create to serve in the interests of the region&#39;s people. To be more specific, the purpose of this region is to provide official &quot;published&quot; material for the mother region in the form of newspapers, opinion pieces, or any separate articles that may be produced. The citizens of this region are here to either contribute to or publish their own written works to entertain and/or inform Westphalian readers. Overall this is an open, casual space for amateur writers to practice and explore. 
Sincerely, 
The Westphalian Post
