[i]Often intangible, sometimes invisible, always paranormal;[/i]
[b]The Transcended Plane[/b] is a realm that does and does not exist.
Other common names for this realm are the [b]&amp;quot;Otherworld&amp;quot;[/b], the [b]&amp;quot;space between dimensions&amp;quot;[/b], the [b]&amp;quot;Riftspace&amp;quot;[/b] and [b]&amp;quot;Limbo&amp;quot;[/b].
The technologically enhanced (recovering post-apocalypse) society of Chetkosk exists, or doesn&amp;#39;t, here - swinging between two alternate realities like a pendulum.
