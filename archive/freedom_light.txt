We support liberty, justice, and we believe that all humans are created equal, with a conscience and a mind that they can use to make decisions that not only influence themselves but also those around them. We believe that morals and character come before all else, and we will hold fast to traditional education (the practice of passing down knowledge, traditions, and beliefs from an older generation to a younger generation) and the family unit. We also believe in staying away from &quot;entangling alliances&quot;, as advised by George Washington.
