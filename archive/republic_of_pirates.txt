[b]Welcome brigands, buccaneers, raiders, pirates, adventurers, vagabonds and corsairs ! [/b]

The Republic of Pirates is the base or bastion of a confederation run by pirates. Although not a Republic in a sense, it is governed by a Pirate Code, which dictates that Republic crews vote on the direction of their ships and would treat other Pirate crews with civility. 

So land your ship and come drink a good bottle of rum ! Far from any imperialism or forces wishing to dominate you. We are free men here.
