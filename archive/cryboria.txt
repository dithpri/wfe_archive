Welcome to Cryboria, a sci-fi genre region being constructed from the ground up. Cryboris was thought up to become a sci-fi region where everyone can have unique yet balanced nations/species without being overwhelmingly powerful or we overwhelmingly weak. This is done by only using NS&#39;s population as a base score and going from there but no other NS Statistic is used. Every week you gain size and power and become more and more unique. I welcome you to join and together let us make a region welcoming and fun for all.
