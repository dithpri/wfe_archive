[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] did a slip slide and flew right smack into your region&#39;s WFE!

[color=red]Before treating us like roadkill, we&#39;re not dead![/color]

It was actually a planned jumpscare, to scare you with the power of... materialising out of nowhere! This power was only achieved with [color=#ff878d]soft fluffy toys, dried leaves, and plenty of water. [/color] 

If you would like to do jumpscares with us, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
