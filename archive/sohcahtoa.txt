Welcome to a region of mathematical precision and general experimentation.

Sohcahtoh is a new region designed for casual, at-your-own pace roleplay. The details are still being worked out.

The founder ([nation]Zomaris[/nation]) will admit to being new at this, and while for various reasons will always retain final authority, will still be open to development discussion. As long as basic humanity is respected, members should feel free to discuss any matters.

Our forum can be found [url=http://sohcahtoa.freeforums.net/]here[/url]. You&#39;ll need to join and make a map claim to engage in the forum RP.
