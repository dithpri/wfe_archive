Following the founding of New Earth after the great migration from the original Earth occurred, new nations of the world looked to a new peace-keeping organization on their new planet. Soon two organizations were founded; the United Nations, dedicated to keeping political peace, and Pinkies United at New Earth (P.U.N.E.), which focused on ending violence and helping the poor. Eventually the two organizations merged to form the New United Nations, a large peace-keeping organization focused on bringing about peace, and ending poverty and disease.
