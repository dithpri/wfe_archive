After a series of devastating wars ravaged the planet during the 21st century, no countries survived. But the survivors rose from these ashes to create a equal number of new nations, who formed the new, more efficient New United Nations, set up to prevent these wars from ever happening. In this alternate world, there are also 2 new landmasses, Gerleva and Zealandia. Along with hundreds of new islands in the oceans. It has been 100,00 years since this and the earth has entered a new golden age of Future technology and space exploration, having established colonies on most of Jupiter&#39;s moons. We have also established contact with aliens, so your nation can be Human or Alien!
