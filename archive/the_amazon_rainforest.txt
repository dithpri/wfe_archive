The Amazon rainforest, covering much of northwestern Brazil and extending into Colombia, Peru and other South American countries, is the world&#146;s largest tropical rainforest, famed for its immense biodiversity. It&#146;s crisscrossed with thousands of rivers, the most exceptional being the powerful Amazon. River towns, with 19th-century architecture dating to rubber-boom days, include Brazil&#146;s Manaus and Bel&eacute;m, and Peru&#146;s Iquitos and Puerto Maldonado.
