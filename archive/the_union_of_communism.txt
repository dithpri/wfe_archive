We must stand united in a region fighting a world of evil. we must take the greatness of  Marxism and use it as a weapon to stab poverty through the heart, and free the workers from their chains of capitalism. No leftist nations are to be oppressed here, but welcomed here. all WA nations are welcome a position of government, and are free to speak their political thoughts. we welcome all communist, socialist, and anarchist nations looking for the freedom of communism we so very value.

&amp;quot;Workers of the world, UNITE!&amp;quot;
-Karl Marx, founder of communism.
