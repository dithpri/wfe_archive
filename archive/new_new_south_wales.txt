Established in 2012, New New South Wales was created as a haven for Welsh folk dancers, disenfranchised from a world dominated by disco dance. It encourages the use of the Welsh language, clog manufacturing and steak consumption. 

While presenting itself as a liberal haven, it is a region generally recognised as coming down heavily on those who appear unsympathetic to the pleas of the Welsh language and folk dance communities, administering unusual punishments involving decorated horse skulls. 

It is a strange yet beautiful place.
