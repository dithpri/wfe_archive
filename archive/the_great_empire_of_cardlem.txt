Today [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to discuss the importance of sleep. 

Sleep is like turning a computer on and off, but with additional steps. Some hawks can sleep in the daytime, while some hawks can only sleep upside down. 

The important thing is that sleep allows the body to rest and feel refreshed!

Sleep is very important, and we encourage all of you reading this to get enough sleep.
