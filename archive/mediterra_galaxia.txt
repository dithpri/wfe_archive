Mediterra Galaxia is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located approximately 200,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way. It is approximately 3,500 light years in diameter and is primarily governed by [nation=short]The Galactic Roman Empire[/nation], with different states having jurisdiction over specific parts of the galaxy.

The Galactic Roman Empire has vowed not to interfere in the affairs of non-spacefaring civilizations, as there are several in Mediterra Galaxia, and the Empire takes steps to conceal their existence.

Several locations in the galaxy intersect with other universes in a strange phenomenon still under study by scientists, but this allows people from other realities to enter Mediterra Galaxia.
