[i]&quot;Treat the earth well: it was not given to you by your parents, it was loaned to you by your children. We do not inherit the world from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.&quot;[/i]

Welcome to the Union of North American First Nations. In the face of oppression, we have overcome all opposition, and survived our peoples darkest hour. With our rightful land inherited, we may make it whole again, and bring life back to our vibrant hills, mountains, and deserts. Come all, be you native or an ally of justice, and together we may work wonders.[/color]
