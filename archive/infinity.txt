Welcome to Infinity,
A safe, and free region, where anything goes. A region with extensive role-playing, and quarterly elections. Here your decisions make a difference. Welcome to a place where you can call home, and feel free to rock the boat.
Politics/Elections:
Elections are held every three months/quarter.
There are three branches of Government:
1. Is the Royal Family, witch is entirely comprised of New Castro, and any nation under his Majesty&amp;#39;s control.
2. The Elected branch, is what it sounds like. This is when a WA delegate is elected once every three months. The three nations that lost to the WA delegate will still be given a leadership position. Either General, Public Relations, or a Treasurer.

We are currently awaiting an election.
