Hello viewers. 

Info: East Yaggrasil is a region dedicated to becoming the ideal region for Nations who just want to have fun in NationStates in their own style. Here in East Yaggrasil you are not forced to do anything and you can be a Defender, Invader, or a neutral nation and we won&#39;t get involved in your business. Our job in East Yaggrasil is to protect our member Nations and let them run their Nation how they want to run it. 

Politics: We have a regional government that includes the Founder (who&#39;s power will not be used unless it&#39;s needed to protect the region), The Prime minister (who is in charge of the Region), and the WA delegate (who represents the Region in the WA).
