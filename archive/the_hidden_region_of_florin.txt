A small, hidden region of Nation-States, full of elves, orks, draconians, and many other beings. Florin is ruled by the 7 ancient dragons of the land. These dragons represent the moon, the seas, the sun, the storm, the frost, the plants, and the fungi. All are welcome if they pass the trials of the ancient dragons of the region. In this region, many nations have a singularly strong goal; defend yourself.
