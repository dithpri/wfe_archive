[b]Remember this:[/b] The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural.
Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks.
Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. [b]Remember that.[/b]

The day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance, will flood the banks of the Empire&#39;s authority. Then there will be one too many. One single act will break the siege.

[b]Remember this. Try.[/b]
