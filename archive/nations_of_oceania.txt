Oceania - the bastion of Freedom, Peace and Stability.

........is that really what it is?

Oceania is a land of Slavery to the State, War, Security and Order. You come here? You won&#39;t leave.
We welcome you, but we&#39;d hate you if you left. We love you, but if you do something we don&#39;t like you will be nothing to us.

So pick carefully if you want to join or stay, as it will be your fate.
