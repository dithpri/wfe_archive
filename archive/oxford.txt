Oxford, a city in central southern England, revolves around its prestigious university, established in the 12th century. The architecture of its 38 colleges in the city&#146;s medieval center led poet Matthew Arnold to nickname it the &#39;City of Dreaming Spires&#39;. University College and Magdalen College are off the High Street, which runs from Carfax Tower (with city views) to the Botanic Garden on the River Cherwell.
