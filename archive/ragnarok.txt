We are born, we live, then we die. Nothing we do can escape that cruel fate. Yet we never stop fighting, we will make every second count. We will guard those who stand behind us, we will lay down our lives for our brothers who stand beside us, and we will destroy anyone who stands in our way. We are Ragnarok, and we are the harbingers of our own fate, and the guardians of our own destiny, join us if willing, or oppose us if you dare.

-President of the United States of Armia
       Vice Delegate of Ragnarok
