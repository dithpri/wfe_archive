I, [nation=short]Derbera WA Embassy[/nation] am stepping down due to general disinterest and technical problems.  Decide for yourselves (Or not, just let it happen, again) who your next delegate is.

Due to the people on this list this region has had some events happen, and most of us either haven&amp;#39;t noticed or cared.  I&amp;#39;m keeping this list here because it works as a watch list, I suppose, not that anyone bothers watching.
