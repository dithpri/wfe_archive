[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] went on a travelling trip today! They packed their suitcases and stepped into the bus when the driver announced that they had to make a sudden stop at the [color=red]Beach[/red]. The beach was dyed red, had little water, and was not fun to visit at all. It eventually glitched beyond the 4th wall, throwing the hawks back into the bus. 
Undeterred, the hawks continued on their trip, and visited mountains, cities and even the areas of anti-hawks. We left this cute note alongside a plate of marshmallows to invite you to [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us[/url] and have fun times!
