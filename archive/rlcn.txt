[b]The Reciprocal League of Collaborative Nations[/b]

The purest of republic alliances of nations. With the founder only given emergency authority and the World Assembly Delegation given the ability of communication and representation, the RLCN take each nation&#39;s vote equal to enforce any resolution among all of the nations. Members elect for representative officials of their nations to take charge in, not enforcing, but encouraging the process of decision making and construction of topics.
