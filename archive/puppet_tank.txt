[b]Welcome to the Puppet Tank! If you have puppets that you no longer need, place them here![/b]

[i]What is a puppet?[/i]
A puppet state (in NationStates) is a country set up by a player with an active NationStates nation for anything [b]but[/b] roleplay.

[i]What can puppets do?[/i]
In RP situations, they may prove handy as &quot;allies.&quot; In NationStates, however, a higher number of puppets that a certain player has relates to more of those puppets ceasing to exist due to the fact that few players can keep track of them, even with dossiers. 

[i]Why dump puppets here?[/i]
Because we are specifically designed as a puppet storage site.
