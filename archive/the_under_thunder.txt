In The Under Thunder we stand together against the forces of the evil, fascist, multi conglomerate country &quot;The Democratic Republic of Baratopia&quot; (FYI: there&#39;s absolutely nothing democratic about that hellhole of a country)

All our residents are highly valued and each individuals personal freedoms is put first. Unless they run an evil company; then they&#39;re assembled in the town square and farted on. Repeatedly.

(WA Delegates moderation: while fascism is obviously bad, we recognize that farting in public can be seen as upsetting to some, and is best kept to ones own home or to private gatherings.)
