The ISF is a left-wing region in roleplay only. While individual members may be leftist IRL (like myself), this is by no means a requirement. The goal of this region is to establish a leftist region that isn&#39;t predicated on being a funnel for real life leftist organizing as many leftist regions on NS tend to be (or try to be at least).
