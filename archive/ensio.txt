The Anthem of Ensio (to the tune of the state anthem of Ukraine):

Ensio will never be defeated
So long as we stand
Peace liberty and freedom
In our fantastic land

Fight together as we hold each other&#146;s hands
From the mountains to the cities,
Let&#146;s protect this: the peace that we all desire
With our many securities 

Rise; salute for the land where freedom reigns
As we stand through the dawn
Raise your glasses as we recognize
Our fighters, alive and gone.

Peace and Liberty and freedom
Are the goals, far from the low
Rise, salute for our old region 
The region of Ensio!
