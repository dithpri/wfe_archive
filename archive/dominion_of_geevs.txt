Geevs was the butler of the king of the kingdom which founded the Dominion of Geevs. When naming the dominion, Geevs assassinated the king, became king himself, and hence The Dominion of Geevs was born. It is similar to the British Dominion, but with slightly more freedom for the countries within it.
