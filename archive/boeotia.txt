The Theban hegemony lasted from the Theban victory over the Spartans at Leuctra in 371 BC to their defeat to a coalition of Peloponnesian armies at Mantinea in 362 BC, though Thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of Macedon in 346 BC.
The leaders of the Theban oligarchy at the time, Epaminondas and Pelopidas, were fully committed to an aggressive foreign policy and could be relied on to win any battle and the same leaders had instituted tactical improvements in the Theban heavy infantry.
