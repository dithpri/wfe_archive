[color=blue]The Worldly Debate Region[/color] 

This region, unprecedented to the greatest extent, quarters an alliance, a league of nations of whom are dedicated to the pursuit of world peace through continuous council. The soul purpose of this regional union is to address the world-wide matters of state through civil debate, and to adhere to the practices of acceptance, in terms of our differing perspectives. 

All are welcome!
