WELCOME TO FERGANAN HALE, FORGOTTEN SAFE HAVEN OF THE LYNCHED AND FEARFUL.

We welcome governments, rulers, psychotic dictatorships, and political ideologies of every variety -- think of us as a sort of limbo between regions, where you can escape to in a hurry and stay forever, rent-free.

As of right now, we don&#39;t do much roleplaying, given that we don&#39;t actually expect any of ye nationstates to linger here for too long, but if for whatever reason this region grows, we may start in the future.
