A group of islands in the Atlantic guarded by a HUGE tesla Grid. The island containing Mendersalv also has enouph firepower to destroy a whole Military fleet all at once. The soldiers are highly trained, they will be able to take out a whole green berets team, black ops team, and spec ops teams alone. So in other words, if you invade or attack you will most likely not succeed, but if you try to bomb us, with anything, it will not work thanks to Tesla Technology. We are probably the most defended region in the world.
