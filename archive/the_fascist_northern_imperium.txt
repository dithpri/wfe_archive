[b][color=red][region]The Fascist Northern Imperium[/region] was a Nazi and Fascist region used as a platform for the Fascists and Nazis to espouse their hateful views in NationStates.[/color][/b]

[b]But not anymore. [u][region]The Red Fleet[/region][/u] as a participatory member of [region]Antifa[/region], has seized this region in the name of Anti-Fascism and Anti-Nazism, and it shall from now on be an anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi region.[/b]

[color=red][b]Of course in denying the Fascists another platform to spew their hate, what we [i]really[/i] should have done according to some, is invited the Fascists to sit down for a nice cup of tea and resolve our differences amicably, and agree futher, that defending their right to say what people they would like to see murdered is the jolly decent thing to do in the name of common decency.[/b][/color]
