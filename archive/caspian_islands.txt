 [b][color=#7751a9]The Ride of the Penny Farthings[/color]

Brave soldiers from the Empire of [region]Kantrias[/region] and dragons from the [region]Lair of the Dragon[/region] rode out on towards the battlefields on their penny farthings, the best motor vehicle since, well, the advent of time itself. With the swords out, the formidable Empiremen and Dragons tagged your region and made it rubble and ash.
