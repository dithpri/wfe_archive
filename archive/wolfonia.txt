Tonight, [Region]The Black Hawks[/Region] and some frens decided to watch anime together!

We watched arknights while raiding, and discovered that there was Arknights was mildly interesting. For example, we discovered that something called a catastrophe might be really bad, while the character named Doctor might actually be a doctor. 

It was truly a heart breaking episode and we hope to watch more next week!
