[i][b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1513525]The Associated Powers Bloc (APB)[/url][/b] has been created to function as a supranational entity, welcoming puppets and non-puppets alike under federalized oversight through the [b]Regional Message Board (RMB)[/b]. Common interests are managed through discussions in the RMB whenever the Prime Minister dictates.
[hr][color=red]No other platforms, forums included, shall be affiliated with the APB in any way as our structure does not permit us to manage or oversee them.[/color][hr]As a very young region, our intention is to be a storage haven for nations without a defined place in NS. [color=green]It shall be the duty of said nations to follow the rules and regulations of the APB internally and within the RMB[/color]; to encourage their observance and to inform the APB leadership about any rule breaking.[/i]
