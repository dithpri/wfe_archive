A defensive pact formed to stop aggressive nations. If you are in PAAN and are attacked every nation in PAAN must help you in the war effort, however, if you are the aggressor no nation is obliged to come to your aid. If you refuse to help in a defensive war you will be kicked from PAAN and will no longer gain the benefits from being apart of it.
