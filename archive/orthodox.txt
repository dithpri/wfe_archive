[b]The Orthodox Region: For Lovers of Truth![/b]

The Orthodox Christian faith is that faith &amp;quot;handed once to the saints&amp;quot; (Jude 3), passed on in Holy Tradition to the apostles by Jesus Christ, and then handed down from one generation to the next, without addition or subtraction. In Orthodoxy, following Holy Tradition means following what [b][I][u]was[/u][/I][/b], because it still [b][I][u]is[/u][/I][/b]: the truth, Jesus Christ, Who is the same yesterday and today and forever.

Join us in the Orthodox region so that together we may support each other in worshipping and glorifying the Most Holy Trinity, and cleansing ourselves through sincere repentance before our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
