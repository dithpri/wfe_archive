For the Orthodox Christian countries!
We can have Ecumenical councils and everyone who joins may get a Patriarchate in their nation, and are entitled to 7,000 Orthodox Churches completely funded, built and maintained, by the Kalashi government, in their native language under their Archdiocese
Must either have Orthodox recognised as offical religion or 70% of people be Orthodox. Does NOT include Coptic Orthodox
If you are not sure if you are eligible, post your case WITH DETAILS in the Regional Message Board and the members will vote on whether to let you in or not. If a week passes without votes, I will make the final decision
