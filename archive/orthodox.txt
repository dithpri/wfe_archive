[b]Welcome to Orthodox![/b]
The Orthodox Commonwealth is protected by the [region]Coalition of Catholic States[/region]. [b]Please endorse our temporary regional leadership[/b]:

Governor: [nation]Sergeant Biaggio[/nation]   

We are currently having a regional referendum to determine whether to stay apart of the CCS or to be independent.

If a majority vote to stay, the Council of the CCS will determine residents&amp;#39; affairs in the CCS. There will then be an election open only to natives to become Governor.

Any questions or concerns, telegram Sergeant Biaggio.
