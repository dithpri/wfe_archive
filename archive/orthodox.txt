[b]Welcome to Orthodox![/b]
The Orthodox Commonwealth is protected by the [region]Coalition of Catholic States[/region]. [b]Please endorse our temporary regional leadership[/b]:

Governor: [nation]Sergeant Biaggio[/nation]   

We are currently having a regional referendum to determine whether to stay apart of the CCS or to be independent.

If a majority vote to stay, the Council of the CCS will determine residents&amp;#39; affairs in the CCS. There will then be an election open only to natives to become Governor.

Any questions or concerns, telegram Sergeant Biaggio. 

All Orthodox nations are required to join the World Assembly, those who do not comply will be be discriminated against. This is so we will become a great region, able to compete with other regions on a world wide level.
