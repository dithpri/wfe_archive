[b]Welcome to Orthodox![/b]
The Orthodox Commonwealth is protected by the [region]Coalition of Catholic States[/region]. [b]Please endorse our temporary regional leadership[/b]:

Governor: [nation]Sergeant Biaggio[/nation]   

We are currently having a regional referendum to determine whether to stay apart of the CCS or to be independent.

Since Orthodox is currently apart of the Coalition of Catholic States, any native of the region will automatically become a CCS citizen. Since you&amp;#39;re a citizen, you may take part in joining CCS political parties.
