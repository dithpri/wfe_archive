--Originally a backup region for the [b][region]Fascist Bloc[/region][/b], the Bloc was taken over. Commies will be kicked out the communist nations if they join. Thanks [nation]Gibralteria[/nation] for making the old flag (on Jan. 9, 2018), but to remember [nation]Copavania[/nation] (Who ceased to exist Jan. 13, 2018), the flag of the Bloc will be his. Don&#39;t go rushing to join (while I doubt you will) until you have read the info factbook down below
