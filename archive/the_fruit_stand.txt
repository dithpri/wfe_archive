Greetings good nations of the interwebs.

We are the Fruit Stand, a private region consisting of a few friends (friendly nations) playing together to have a silly little time.

Rules:
1) Don&#39;t be a jerk
2) RP is not necessary, but if anyone would like to have a silly fun time and engage in a World Assembly-style debate that&#39;s totally fine!
