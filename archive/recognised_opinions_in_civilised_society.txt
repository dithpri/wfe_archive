The [b]Recognised Opinions in Civilised Society (ROCS)[/b] are a group of people who stay together, independent and disfellowshipped by today&#146;s current low level of class.

Anyone, with any opinion, political ideology, faith, can come together and be free from the fear of being left out or cast away. No one has power over another, for we are of the same blood, and though we have different opinions, make up a civilised society that can work together and function properly.

The formation of this region comes over the region&#146;s founder was told to be &#145;[kept] silent&#146; after expressing an opinion. Disgraceful! Therefore, the formation for a new order! One of civility!
