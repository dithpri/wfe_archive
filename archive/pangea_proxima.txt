Rules
---------------------------------------------------
Rule 1:No Bullying
Rule 2:Respect elected rulers (Delegates, elected nations)
Rule 3: We consider regions as planets (other wise the game would basically be overpopulated so its for self lore)
Rule 4: An on going RP (role play) we will be the regions history and main-story (ALL nations will be in it weth active or not)
(Also feel free to start own RP&#39;s just make it so it doesn&#39;t interfere with the Main storys chat. Also feel free to ask if anyone plays civ 5-6 or Hoi4 because in the end most of us in nationstates enjoy strategic and political games (mostly))
