The Union was formed in 2053 after the Free Republic of Atlas had finished its expansion. Atlas offered the African nations safety and funds for being a part of the Union. Most African nations welcomed the banner of the Union. Others were afraid of what it could become, with the United States and their allies falling due to the failure of NATO and the Communist Asian Empire gaining control of the UN. The Union undertakes many tasks for African and is more successful than the UN or NATO ever were.
