The war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous. Hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of ignorance and poverty. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects and its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or Eastasia, but to keep very structure of society intact.

~George Orwell
