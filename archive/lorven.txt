Greetings, and welcome to Lorven, a fantasy role playing region. Here the battles against orcish tribe, elven knights, and dwarven mercs can happen. Lorven is beset by a darkness from a powerful force, either aide the allied kingdoms of light to fight it or join in the legions of darkness. You may stay neutral... if you dare. Rules- 1: No one nation controls Lorven 2: Nations can pick between Orcs, Elves (High, Dark, Wood,), Undead, Dwarves, Orges. Can choose any fantasy race. 3: Regular population doesn&amp;#39;t apply, population cut down by half in RP situations. 4: Can go to war with anyone
Enjoy ,have fun, join the fight
