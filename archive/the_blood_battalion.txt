[spoiler=What is Raiding?]
[i]Raiding is how battles are fought on NationStates! Raiding involves moving nations, called puppets, into an enemy region, called a target. Once in the target all the puppets endorse one nation, called the point. If the point has the most endorsements at update, the time the game processes endorsements, then the point becomes delegate and the target is taken over.[/i][/spoiler]
