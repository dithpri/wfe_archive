[color=red]We are nomads that aren&#39;t really nomads. Just a bunch of people who wander through regions at their own whims. But wait, wouldn&#39;t that make us nomads then?[/color]
[color=orange]Our goal is to spread peace, love, and spaghetti pizza to the numerous regions of NationStates.[/color]
[color=#FFD800]Fellow nomadic nations are welcome to set up camp for a bit of time before departing for more pastures to walk through.[/color]
[color=green]For not-so-lazy nomads, you can check out these cool guys: [region]Travelling Region[/region] and [region]The Featured Region Followers[/region][/color]
[color=blue]Check out our Pizza Program dispatch for pizza price ranges.[/color]
[color=purple]Embassy requests, if any, will be accepted on any condition.[/color]

Fellow nomads get their pizza for free.
