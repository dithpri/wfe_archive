Once upon a time, the Bleeding Isles were home to several smaller nations as well as one large, powerful monarchy, once considered an imperialistic superpower that almost dominated the world. During the eighth century, the ancient Silverblood people invaded. For reasons unknown, they no longer had a homeland, having lived on the sea and trading with ports to survive for who knows how long. The running theory, however, is that the Silverbloods may have been taken over by colonists from the Bleeding Isles in the first place, and were simply returning the favor. They continuously pillaged the shores until they were finally able to invade and take over.
