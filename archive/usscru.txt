The USSCRU is a strong, soviet themed union of ten countries led by the United Socialist States of CanaRussia.

We control the following countries
-CanaRussia (SFR CanaRussia, Estonia, Georgia, Armenia and Kazakhstan)
-SFR Yugoslavia (Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia and Moldova) 


We have a very strong alliance with Roland I

Hope to talk to someone who is interested in the USSCRU soon!!
