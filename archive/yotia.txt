Yotia is a region dedicated to remaining small so that people can truly engage with each other. It also prioritizes national sovereignty and independence. Proposed policies can be voiced by any member in the Regional Message Board but are non-binding no matter how many members support them; it is up to every individual member whether they accept a proposal or not. Membership in the World Assembly is strictly forbidden for all Yotia members as member nations of the World Assembly are required to follow any resolutions passed by it, which infringes upon national sovereignty and independence and therefore is in direct violation of the ideals of Yotia.
