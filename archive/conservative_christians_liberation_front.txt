[nation]Hashishin[/nation] was unjustly kicked from the [region]Conservative Christians[/region] by a secret coalition with the region&amp;#39;s enemy: [nation]The Templar Knighthood[/nation]. Florin and Templar conspired with each other to ban us and create a dictator&amp;#39;s state, but now Templar want&amp;#39;s Florin&amp;#39;s position. We oppose both, and want to liberate the region from both power-mongers.

[b]We fight for the Liberated Conservative Christians! Join us for Freedom![/b]

This region was created in response to both Florin&amp;#39;s Purges of Bans and the Rising Templar Army in the moderate christians.
