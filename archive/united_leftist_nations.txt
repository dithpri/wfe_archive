Welcome to the UNITED LEFTIST NATIONS. 

The ULN is a constitutional bureau of the Sturozan Communist Party, responsible for representing the nation at an international level, and its delegates are elected by the citizens of Sturoza. 

Whilst this &amp;quot;region&amp;quot; exists primarily to serve Sturoza, we will open our peaceful group to any other nation that embraces our politics and can meet the entry criteria. The ULN office can be reached via telegram to [nation]Communist Sturoza[/nation].
