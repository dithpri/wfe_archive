We are a league of free states united under the principles of lassiez faire, and of the great philosophe, John Locke.  We believe that the economy can run itself better than the government can, and we are focused on the economy as a whole.  The goal for all nations in this confederacy is to get a 100/100 rating (though this is very very hard) for economy.
