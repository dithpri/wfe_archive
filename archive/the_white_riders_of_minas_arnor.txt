[color=gold]We are the White Riders of Minas Arnor. The accursed Black Riders have waged war and committed cruel deeds far to long. 

Far over the sea we arrived.

[b][i]Tall ships and tall kings
Three times three,
What brought they from the foundered land
Over the flowing sea?
Seven stars and seven stones
And one white tree.[/i][/b][/color]
