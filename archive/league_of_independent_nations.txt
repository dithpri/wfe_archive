Welcome to everyone seeking a region that respects the free agency of its member nations. We do not recognize the World Assembly, and all their agents will be deported and banned on sight.

We believe that sovereign nations have better activities with which to occupy their time, besides babysitting a narcissistic sociopath suffering from a God-complex or pretending to be the regional branch of the World Assembly&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Make-A-Wish Foundation&amp;#39;.
