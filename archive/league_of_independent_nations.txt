Welcome to everyone seeking a region that respects the free agency of each member. We do not recognize the overbearing resolutions of the WA, which is why the position of delegate has been reduced to a scratch and sniff sticker. We believe that members have better activities to occupy their time than babysitting a narcissistic sociopath suffering from a God-complex.
