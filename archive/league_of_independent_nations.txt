Welcome to everyone seeking a region that respects the free agency of each member. We do not recognize the overbearing resolutions of the WA, which is why the position of delegate has been reduced to a scratch and sniff sticker. 

We believe that members have better activities with which to occupy their time, besides babysitting a narcissistic sociopath suffering from a God-complex or pretending to be the regional branch of the World Assembly&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Make-A-Wish Foundation&amp;#39;.
