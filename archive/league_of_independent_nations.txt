Welcome to everyone seeking a region that respects the free agency of its members. We do not recognize the World Assembly, and its members will be deported and banned on sight.

We believe that members have better activities with which to occupy their time, besides babysitting a narcissistic sociopath suffering from a God-complex or pretending to be the regional branch of the World Assembly&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Make-A-Wish Foundation&amp;#39;.

Secretary General: Robert Edward Lancaster (United States of Andarro)

Secretary of Defense: Frederick Konrad (The Empire of Solvania)

Secretary of State: Richard York (The Kingdom of Euronia)

Secretary of Foreign Relations: John Henry (The Empire of Allemaughn)
