The Patientes Union is a regional political and economic alliance, bringing together diverse nations under a shared commitment to stability, economic cooperation, and collective security. While each member state retains sovereignty over its domestic affairs, the Union provides a framework for diplomatic collaboration and economic integration. At the heart of this alliance lies the Federation of Puerelia, which, despite its smaller size and limited geopolitical influence, hosts the Union&#146;s central institutions and serves as the administrative seat of power.
