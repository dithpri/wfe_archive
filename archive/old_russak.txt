Old Russak is a region comprising the remains of the former Russak National Cooperative or RNC. The RNC was a former super state that due to internal conflict and political machinations fell to ruin and separatism by various states now turned nations. In their struggle for identity, these states still cooperate on a small scale as a loosely aligned regional union and compete in any area they can. Russak is a hard region full of military holdouts and expansionist ideologies. The combined economy has seen its fair share of hardship but with the various government types coming together under the regional union, various industries have seen themselves bouncing back to pre-RNC collapse levels.
