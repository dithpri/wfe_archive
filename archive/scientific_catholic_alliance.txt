We are an organization of Catholics dedicated to promoting the sciences while preserving moral dignity.

We have several committees.
Upon joining send me a telegram telling what genre of science to specialize in.


                              God Bless,
                                    The Pope

Note:  We remain impervious to invasion by the grace of God and condemn the actions of The Black Riders and all those of their ilk. We stand for peace, and invaders, be ware, for God is with us.
