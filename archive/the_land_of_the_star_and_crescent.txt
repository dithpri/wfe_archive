A land of shadows and mist. 

The Land of the Star and Crescent is a mountainous region isolated by much of the rest of the world. Its high elevation provides a perpetual state of fog leaving many superstitious explorers succumb to the native storytelling of mysticism and magic. 

Many animals long thought fabled or extinct reside throughout the region. While brontosauruses can be spotted protruding through the canopy the tiny platypus can be seen on the long stretches of riverbanks. Unicorns are commonly seen along the beaches and on occasion fisherman off the coast claim they spotted mermaids. 

The lands vast natural resources and increasingly influential states have catapulted this land into the global arena.
