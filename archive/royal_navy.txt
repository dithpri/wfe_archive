The [b]Royal Navy[/b] (RN) is the United Kingdom&#39;s naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK&#39;s armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.

The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing the British Empire as the unmatched world power during the 19th and first part of the 20th centuries. Due to this historical prominence, it is common, even among non-Britons, to refer to it as &quot;[region]the Royal Navy[/region]&quot; without qualification. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
