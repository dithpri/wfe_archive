The Region of Ignotus is a beautiful place that does not require any experience to join. We have a Constitution, explaining the rights of the nations, and a Discord, so you can speak to Government Officials. Please take the Citizenship Exam to see if you qualify for citizenship, citizenship allows you to run for Governmental Positions, and also gain rights that people do not gain when they first join.
