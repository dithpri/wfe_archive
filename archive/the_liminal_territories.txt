The Liminal Territories are defined less by a shared history than by a shared condition. This vast continent is a patchwork of nascent and established countries, many having emerged from a period of political devolution and reorganization. There is no unifying empire or dominant ethnicity; instead, the region is characterized by its cultural, political, and economic heterogeneity. The common thread is a collective identity forged on the threshold of development, of defining a place in the world. The recent establishment of the Continental Forum in Leops City marks the first formal effort to create a permanent body for dialogue and collective action.
