Vestjord is Danish for &quot;West Earth&quot;. We are a region that holds true to the initial values of westward colonization. We value the liberty and negative rights of people, in defense against the positive rights and forced behavior/good ideology. We welcome various forms of enforcement of this. From Republic to Democratic, Anarchal to Dictatorship.
