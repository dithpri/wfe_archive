Welcome to The Balkan Adria Coalition!
You may join freely, just please follow RP properly.
Main government system is mostly Democracy. But other nations with other forms of government may also join. Please be aware that you may post issues and debates, but we have to vote on them in order to be fair. Mostly democratic nations will be elected to our government, but if others make it, then congratulations!
We are here to protect ourselves and others in need. We will update our page daily, and we will generally plan different events.
Please be professional and have fun! 
Thank you, 
Democratic Union of Serbia (Leader and founder of The Balkan Adria coalition)
