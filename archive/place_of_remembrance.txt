[region]Place Of Remembrance[/region] is a region that nations can visit to relax and talk to nations from other regions. 

Regions are free to have nuetral meetings between each other, but if the meetings get out of hand, the embassies will be canceled. 

Please be respectful at all times or it will result in you getting banned from the establishment. 

This is not a place for other nations. This region was built so nations could meet other regions as to promote regional bonding and, hopefully, establish more embassies throughout the interlocking regions of the world!
