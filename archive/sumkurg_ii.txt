The sun rises up for [region]Sumkurg II[/region], the second in line for the Sumkurg name. The first one was shut down due to low-quality post and spam flooding.
[hr]
This region has [B][u]strict[/u][/B] quality RP-ing rules so we don&#39;t get flooded again. So no more &quot;(RP)&quot;-labels! ([u]Instead, use [i]RP[/i]-label instread![/u])

(Region is in building modus, so expect some missing things)



[b]DO NOT CHANGE THE SETTING! ONLY SEC CAN SO IT AS OF NOW![/B]
