The Coral Sea is a marginal sea off the northeast coast of Australia, and classified as an interim Australian bioregion. 

The sea is characterised by its warm and stable climate, with frequent rains and tropical cyclones. It contains numerous islands and reefs, as well as the world&amp;#39;s largest reef system, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981.
