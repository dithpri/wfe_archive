Cantalia&#39;s goals are to establish peace between nations and regions. We don&#146;t want to attack or harm others in any way, and would like the same courtesy. One of the requirements of entry into Cantalia is that every nation agrees that, although we won&#146;t dictate what form or type of government / political freedoms they have, they will be tolerant and &#147;mind their own beeswax&#148;, so to speak.  Whatever they do internally is their own business, but they can&#39;t drag down the rest of the region with them.

Overall, we are a peaceful haven that imposes slight restrictions on how far evil our nations can become, but wants other players to be able to have fun while respecting others doing the same.
