We, the nations of the Federal Unity, are determined to save generations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in the rights of humanity, in the dignity and worth of humanity, in equal rights of all citizens, to establish conditions in which justice and respect for the obligations from treaties can be maintained, and promote social progress and standards of living on all lands. To this we practice benevolent tolerance and live in peace as neighbors, to unite our strength to maintain peace and security, to ensure by the acceptance of principles that militarization shall not be used except in common defense, and to employ machinery for economic and social advancement, have resolved to combine efforts to accomplish these aims.
