The&nbsp;Chinese Communist Party&nbsp;(CCP),&nbsp;officially the&nbsp;Communist Party of China&nbsp;(CPC), is the founding and&nbsp;sole&nbsp;governing party&nbsp;of the&nbsp;People&#39;s Republic of China&nbsp;(PRC). The CCP leads&nbsp;eight other legally permitted subordinate minor parties&nbsp;together as the&nbsp;United Front. The CCP was founded in 1921, mainly by&nbsp;Chen Duxiu&nbsp;and&nbsp;Li Dazhao, with the help of the Far Eastern Bureau of the&nbsp;Communist Party of the Soviet Union&nbsp;and&nbsp;Far Eastern Secretariat&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Communist International.&nbsp;The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the&nbsp;Kuomintang&nbsp;(KMT)&#39;s&nbsp;Nationalist Government&nbsp;had been driven&nbsp;from&nbsp;mainland China&nbsp;to&nbsp;Taiwan&nbsp;after the&nbsp;Chinese Civil War, leading to the&nbsp;establishment&nbsp;of the People&#39;s Republic of China on 1 October 1949.
