The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), officially the Communist Party of China (CPC), is the founding and sole governing party of the People&#39;s Republic of China (PRC). The CCP leads eight other legally permitted subordinate minor parties together as the United Front. The CCP was founded in 1921, mainly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, with the help of the Far Eastern Bureau of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Far Eastern Secretariat of the Communist International. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 the Kuomintang (KMT)&#39;s Nationalist Government had been driven from mainland China to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the People&#39;s Republic of China on 1 October 1949.
