[b] Welcome to the Scandorid Continent [/b]
This region is young, but would like to soon transition into a roleplaying region. We already have an interactive map that is waiting for individuals to join. Please message [nation]Vaalid[/nation] or [nation] Latingo [/nation] with the following items:

1. A factbook detailing your nations history
2. Requested region of the Americas and size
3. Goals of the roleplaying experience

We are very excited to get this party started! We have many things planned, but we are also open to suggestions from the respective leaders of our nations.
