[b][color=navy]V&iacute;tejte v Cesk&eacute;![/color] [color=red]Czech it out![/color][/b] (Actually, that&amp;#39;s a lot better than &amp;quot;Czech Repub[u]like[/u]&amp;quot;)

[u]The[/u] Czech Republic is designed for the Czechs, but all cultures are welcome! The main regional currency is the Czech Korun and the capital city is Prague. Delegates have full controls, but those trying to drag us into the invader game beware! 

All welcome to join. To Czech-in press any key (where&amp;#39;s the ANY key?).
