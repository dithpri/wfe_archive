A new region, built out of the ashes of a civil war, and founded upon the basic rights of humanity: the right to rule, the right to opress, and the right to rebel.
North Fairlandia rose to power soon after the Empire Incident and subsequent River Wars. Civil war tore the region apart, yet after 12 years of fighting, North Fairlandia was able to defeat the Centaeri Confederation and gain its independence. Today, it is at the forefront of the continuing War on Communism, fighting to end the oppression which controlled the region for  so many years. Only those who are willing to fight for the greater good may enter North Fairlandia and seek to call her home.
