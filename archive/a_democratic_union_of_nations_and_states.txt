A democratic region in that the World Assembly Delegate(the WA delegate being the leader will be changed to a separate representative in the future if possible) is elected by the people and the founder has permanent executive authority solely to defend against invasion and facilitate democracy. 
All who respect the democracy are welcome regardless of your nation&#39;s politics. 
(Mine is a tyranny by majority because I felt like it)
