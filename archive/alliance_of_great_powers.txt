The original Alliance of Grand Powers stood for many years as a symbol of triumph over adversity, of the power inherent in human cooperation. Now it is reborn as the Alliance of Great Powers, and seeks new members to fuel its return to glory. Will you be among them?

We ask only that new members pledge themselves to the defence of their fellow member-states, and agree to uphold democracy and human rights across their jurisdictions.
