Welcome to the Vault. it&#39;s somewhat rusty and run down, so your presence is very appreciated. we&#39;re trying to get this place working again. not sure how long it&#39;ll last. we are a roleplay region, based in a fallout wasteland covering the world, where MT, PT and FT are all welcome. come create some RPs of your own! 
enjoy the oil, rust and musty old dust of [b]The Vault![/b]
