Welcome to the Vault. It is somewhat rusty and run down, so your presence is very appreciated. We are trying to get this place working again, not sure how long it&#39;ll last. We are a roleplay region, based in a fallout wasteland covering the world, and WW2 was interrupted by a lot of nukes. Come create some RPs of your own! 
Enjoy the oil, rust and musty old dust of [b]The Vault![/b]
