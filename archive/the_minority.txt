A long time ago in a region far far away there was The Minority. Bears had friends there and then most of those friends slowly ceased.
And then Bears went into hiber-nation.
And then bears last friend, The Resident Mole, also ceased.
And bears was sad when they woke up, so they asked a favor of the strange men that would bring food and capture them and make them vote on silly things for something that the bears never understood. They asked the men to find them a place for Moles to find and call home again if their friend were to return.
This is that place.
Now the bears, for their part, must choose among the issues we bring forth for them without complaint.
