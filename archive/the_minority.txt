After a long nap the Bears awoke and found their friend The Resident Mole and the region they had shared missing.
Afraid their friend would never find them again when she returned they turned to the evil Men who would draw the bears into their traps with BBQ and make them decide &amp;quot;issues.&amp;quot;
The Bears made a deal with the Men, and The Minority stands again, a beacon of home for those who knew it before.
