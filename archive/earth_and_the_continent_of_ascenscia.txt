[b][color=darkred]The year is 1843. The Earth is changing at a very rapid pace and innovation and imperialist tendencies fill the hearts of the western world. Then, it happened. During an ordinary day, at an ordinary time the continent of Africa phased out of existence and was replaced by the Continent of Ascensia and it&#39;s surrouding islands. Africa would find a new home, away from the evils of European colonialism, as Ascenscia became confused and defencive. The world stood still in awe as new peoples stood at the epicentre of the new and old worlds. This time of profound change and ambition was pushed to a precipice. One that would change our united history forever...[/color][/b]
