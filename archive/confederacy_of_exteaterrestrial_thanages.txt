The Confederacy of Extraterrestrial Thanages is a loose-knit union of spaceborne settlements and some Earth-based factions united against the One World Empire. The alliance was originally centered around the Confederate Starsteads of Rhea, a small band of American refugees who had escaped from the Empire and into space. As more and more factions accumulated towards the CSR&amp;#39;s cause, the league became known as the Confederacy of Extraterrestrial Thanages.
