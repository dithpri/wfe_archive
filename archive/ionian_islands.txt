The [b]Ionian Islands[/b]  are a group of islands in Greece. They are traditionally called the Heptanese, i.e. &quot;the Seven Islands,&quot; but the group includes many smaller islands as well as the seven principal ones. As a distinct historic region they date to the centuries-long Venetian rule, which preserved them from becoming part of the Ottoman Empire and created a distinct cultural identity with many Italian influences. The Ionian Islands became part of the modern Greek state in 1864. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
