In the [b][i]Coalition of Sovereign Nations[/i][/b] each nation may act in its own [i][color=orange]sovereign[/color][/i] and [i][color=green]independent[/color][/i] nature.

To act as a public forum and preserve national sovereignty, within and abroad, [color=blue][i]this Coalition[/i][/color] has been established as a free and independent zone; believing none are permitted to interfere in the administration, operation, or function of another&#39;s national sovereignty through the use of corrupting organizations such as the [color=red][i]World Assembly[/i][/color].

If you are interested in our cause, or would merely like to know more, you are encouraged to telegram our founder. However, if you think as we think; if you feel as we feel; then you are urged to [color=purple][i]join the Coalition today[/i][/color]!

Show your support by applying for our [color=lightgreen][i]World Registry[/i][/color] and we can make a difference.
