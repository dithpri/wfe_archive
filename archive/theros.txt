&curren; Theros is a land where gods are real. They dwell in a place known to mortals as Nyx &curren;

~ Nyx is depicted as the land of night and home of the gods as believed by the inhabitants of Theros. As a result, dreams are believed to be messages from the gods. When the likenesses of the gods appear in the night sky, it&amp;#39;s as though the gods are inhabiting both the mortal and spiritual world at the same time. Enchantments&nbsp;are gifts from the gods, and the gods themselves are Living Enchantments. ~
