The Tactical Islands is a Tactical Friendship between islands and countries in order to calm the Tactical Lord of Darkness, K&amp;#39;ilun, from unleashing his wrath upon us after his will was ignored by a country&amp;#39;s leader, which angered Him. The Tactical Gods of light cannot stop Him alone, and need all the Tactical Friendship they can get in order to stop the Tactical Gods of Darkness and their Lord, K&amp;#39;ilun. Please do not let this world&amp;#39;s accomplishments go in vain. Join us in out effort to create equal amounts of Light and Dark Tactical Friendship in order to keep the world in balance. May The Tactical Goblin Gods bless you and your country. Amen.
