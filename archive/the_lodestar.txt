the currently small but hopefully one day thriving region, where anyone who has enough support can become leader, The Lodestar is a roleplaying region where politics work like they do in real life, anyone with enough votes can become any position they campaign for, the founder is only given enough power to keep the region going and is not allowed to have complete control over the region. this region is meant to be fun and immersive, please don&#39;t start a hate war over a certain position. If anyone would like vote for a change to the region or a new position feel free to do so if the majority of the region wants the change and it&#39;s not cruel to others the policy will be implemented by the current leader.
