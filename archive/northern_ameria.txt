[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and Frens from [region]Lair of the Dragon[/region] decided to go for a plushie observation excursion in your region

The subject of observation this time was the mythical [color=yellow]Fumo-2024[/color], not yet sighted since last year. We soared around, before setting up post on a hill in your region. 

Unfortunately this time, the mythical [color=yellow]Fumo-2024[/color] decided not to appear, so we vowed to return another day!
