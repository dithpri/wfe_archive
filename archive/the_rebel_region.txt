-First rule, ya&#39;ll can post song lyrics to your hearts content. Sorta. If you get annoying then I will supress. :) (Love ya&#39;ll xD)
-Second rule, no pitching arguments. If someone say something rude, don&#39;t worry about it Admins will suppress and kindly ask to GO AWAY!! 
-Third rule, Stay awesome BROS
-Fourth rule, be who you are, if you like to sing or talk about anime, we don&#39;t care. Just be considerate of others and stop when they ask or there will be a ban. 
-FIfith rule, don&#39;t be afraid of speaking your mind, but if do so take it up on telegrams not on the message board. If something does not stop message one of us and we will handle this.
