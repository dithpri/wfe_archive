The United Gavran States is a group of Islands known as the Gavran Islands, countaining several countries.

The Gavran Islands are a very disputed place, with many of the Gavran countries seceding the Region, mainly for the Commonwealth States of Camra.

Currently, the several countries still under the United Gavran States banner are ruled by an outside dictatorship.

War ravages the Region, with military forces from the Commonwealth States of Camra constantly clashing with military forces from Central and East Gavra. Embassies are constantly attacked, and the countries remain in current chaos, except for the ruling Dictatorship.
