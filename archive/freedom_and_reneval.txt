The region is striving for capitalism, true freedom, complete decommunisation of the world, preservation of the former existence of the monarchy, ending bureaucracy. We focus on independence, excluding social welfare and the lowest taxes possible. Let&#39;s abolish democracy because it&#39;s tyranny. Let everyone decide for themselves, not the majority. Let&#39;s find out what freedom is, let&#39;s know that it is first and foremost the right to free will, and not forcing people to call a gay couple a marriage. We say no to democracy and socialism. Let us give the green light to liberal economic policy and true freedom.
