Old WFE: The Warsaw Alliance is a socialist region for more authoritarian powers who wish to utilise the machinery of the state to push forth the human race. This is a league of Marxist-Leninist countries, No anarchists, market socialists, fascists or capitalists allowed. If you are one of the aforementioned groups and decide to join us anyways, we will kindly escort you to Siberia, and you will never see the sun again.

[B]This region has been purged by the fascist army of the Cossacks[/b]
