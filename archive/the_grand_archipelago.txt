[b][color=mediumaquamarine]We are a new region in the process of trying to build up. As we get some more nations we will begin discussing the regional government and other important topics. For now feel free to chat on the RMB about your nation issues, ideas for the region, or just anything in general.

All nations are encouraged to [u][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]Join the World Assembly[/url][/u]. If you have any questions about how to do that please ask.[/color][/b]
