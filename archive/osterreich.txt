[b][color=black]After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 at the end of WWI, Austria adopted and used the name the Republic of German-Austria, in an attempt at union with Germany, but this was forbidden under the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The name was changed to Austria (&Ouml;sterreich) and shortly afterwards The First Austrian Republic was established in 1919. In 1938 Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss unifying Austria with Germany.
