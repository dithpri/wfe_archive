[b][color=crimson]Salve, and welcome to Seven Hills![/color]

A fledgling settlement on the banks of the River Tiber, Seven Hills was founded [i]June 15th, 2016[/i] by [nation=short]Gnaeus Decius Paullus[/nation], who is King. A call now goes out to any and all who would make this place their home and contribute to its rise to strength, honor, and glory.
