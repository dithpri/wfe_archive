The region of [b]Serenwilde[/b] was founded on 15 February 2014 by [nation]Miwbastet[/nation]. It is a region wholly dedicated to a fair, open, and free society. Its members share a recognition of the importance of the environment, something reflected in their national budgets, and a sincere belief in the welfare of its inhabitants, with generous amounts of wealth spent on public services. Common borders are uncontrolled; currencies are linked. We celebrate our unity and close relations, and welcome warm relations with all other powers.

[nation]Miwbastet[/nation], on founding this region, issued a rallying cry to: [i]&#147;Send your roots deep! Spread your branches wide!&#148;[/i] a sentiment that we should all aspire to.
