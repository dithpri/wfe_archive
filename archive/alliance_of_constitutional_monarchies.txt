[b][url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven]&quot;Once upon a major update, while I raided, staying up late,
Over many a point and trigger of forgotten jumps&#151;
While I jumped, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently chasing at my raid target-
&#39;&#146;Tis some fenda,&#39; I muttered, &#39;tapping at my raid target-
 Only this and nothing more.&#39; &quot;[/url]
