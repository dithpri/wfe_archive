Founded out of necessity, the Hanseatic League was once a home for refugees from a region which had been overrun by fash larp. The community that once resided here is long gone, having merged into [region]Alemannia[/region] a year or so ago. As it stands now, the last remnants of such community have scattered as Alemannia has decided to cease function now.

This is being turned into a puppet storage and is being locked down. God bless the League.
