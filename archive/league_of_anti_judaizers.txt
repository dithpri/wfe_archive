A league for those people wishing to flee this dying world - corrupted, as it is, by Talmudic practices - and establish a safe haven for sojourners. The league is established to renew and strengthen people - creating a new man: strengthening them not only physically, but also morally and spiritually. 

The League&amp;#39;s name is in recognition that the main opposition to this spiritual renewal is Talmudic Judaism, a corruption of the Jewish religion found in the Torah. Talmudic Judaism seeks to corrupt non-Jews through decadence and immorality so that they can be more easily enslaved.
