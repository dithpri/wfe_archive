A league for those people wishing to flee this dying world - corrupted, as it is, by Talmudic practices - and establish a safe haven for sojourners. The league is established to renew and strengthen people - creating a new man: strengthening them not only physically, but also morally and spiritually. 

However, despite our apparent &amp;quot;isolationist&amp;quot; stance, we are committed to fighting the evil schemes of Talmudic Jewry worldwide, in order to free ordinary people from Jewish perversity and lead them to the light.
