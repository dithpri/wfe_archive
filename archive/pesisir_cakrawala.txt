Pesisir Cakrawala is the shoreline on the horizon, in the constructed lingua franca of the region.

We promote peace, equality, peer education, and cooperation among its inhabitants; we value humanity, well-being, interspecies education, and harmony of all components of the Gaia.

Basic plan for activities in the region is discussion and information-sharing on topics such as languages and writing systems, music and art, DIYs and lifehacks, philosophy and science, and minimalist and mindful life. Other topics and roleplays may emerge in the future based on the ongoing interaction.

All nations and regions of peace are welcome.
