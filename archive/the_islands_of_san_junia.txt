[color=purple]Welcome to the Islands of San Junia! This region is a fairly royal region, so with no doubt, call me His Evilness...
[*]We make jokes,
[*]challenge non-dictatorships or matriarchies
[*]and live our life here. 

You can find the Regional Constitution as a pinned Dispatch once it is created. 




High fives to all from the prestigious,

[/color][color=red]The High King of the Islands, [nation=short]Donok Choi[/nation][/color]
