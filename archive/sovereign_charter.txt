The Sovereign Charter is a growing and lively region. It is founded on the idea that each member nation is sovereign of its own rules and decisions. Nations are encouraged to work together to achieve common goals to achieve a cohesive, friendly and interactive community.

Typically we&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;Modern Technology&amp;quot; region as that is easier for everyone to get involved with but thanks to our multiverse other technologies are happily encouraged well. 

Any suggestions and creativity are entirely welcome.
