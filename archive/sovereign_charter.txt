Role-playing, community, culture, we have it all. Founded on the idea that every nation is their own sovereign, the Sovereign Charter is an attempt at absolute regional democracy, along with the challenges that come with it. Our goal is to have a cohesive and active region by allowing nations to interact creatively and freely.

Nations can claim their own territory, set their own story and even help craft rules for the region as a whole. Most areas are discussed &amp;quot;In Character&amp;quot; to keep things friendly and fun. Feel free to just jump straight in.

The region is set in the Modern day period.
