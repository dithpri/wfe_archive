The Sovereign Charter is a fresh region dedicated to role-playing. It is founded on the idea that each member nation is sovereign of its own rules and decision but works with the Sovereign Charter&amp;#39;s other inhabitants to achieve common goals and work towards a stable, friendly and active region.

The region typically revolves around Modern Tech as that is easiest for everyone to understand, Ancient Tech is allowed and often encouraged but to prevent abuse Future Tech is restricted. The rule of thumb is that if it doesn&amp;#39;t exist now, don&amp;#39;t use it. 

Any suggestions are entirely welcome.
