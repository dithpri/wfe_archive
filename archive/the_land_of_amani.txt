Amani means &amp;quot;peace&amp;quot; in Swahili, and this land is just that, peaceful. This land is in the West, next to the ocean. Amani has the most beautiful beaches and the best weather. We don&amp;#39;t get involved in war, unless it&amp;#39;s absolutely necessary. We believe that the outdoors is the best medicine, and all nature is beautiful. Amani is a spiritual place, and we accept all religions. So come on over, and enjoy the good life. Welcome to The Land of Amani.
