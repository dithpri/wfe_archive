We have been attacked by the Black Riders but we will prevail.
Though our identity was stripped from us, we will keep in mind what is most important.
As long as we are united it does not matter who controls us.
Being here is a gift, and those barbarians who do not recognize this.....well, they don&amp;#39;t realize what they are missing.
Amani forever.
