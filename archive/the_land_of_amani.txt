                                                               The Creed of TLA

We believe that nature is something to be respected and preserved. That no animal nor plant deserves to be abused or injured in any way. We believe that there is no need for argument over trivial topics, and fighting should only be used as a defense tactic. We believe that the tranquil and joyous occasions of our lives are the ones that we should remember and hold on to. Because those are the memories that will act as a lamp in our times of darkness. Most of all, we believe in the people. We feel that the people who have joined The Land of Amani have been given a reward, and should act in such way.
