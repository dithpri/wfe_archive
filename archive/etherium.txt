Etherium has, since it&#39;s original discovery by Sir Morgono Edwards in 1277, been a region rich in natural resources and abundant in natural ports.
The main export from Etherium is cheese.
The main imports are foreign cheeses, and Hallmark gift cards.
There are many indigenous species in Etherium, notably the Baby-Snatching Great Hawk, and the [i]Patroune pastarini[/i], a kind of grass that is akin to different styles of pasta. Spaghetti in the North, rigatoni in the East, Macaroni in the South, and Linguini in the West.
The region also has natural defences, such as the &quot;Holy Hecking Big&quot; Mountain Range, that dominates the Eastern border. The range is home to Ahimaburnin, the world&#39;s largest active volcano, which is claimed by demons who ward off UFOs.
