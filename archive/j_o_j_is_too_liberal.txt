[b]Territory of [region]Cities of the World[/region]![/b]

Preemptive founding.

[color=red]This region shall serve as a museum against the [u]Security Council[/u] in perpetuity.

Serving as a reminder that rampant invasions will not be tolerated by the brave and true men of the World. We can not allow perceived entitlement for raiding to spread among young and impressionable gamers, because it will only harm the long-term development of gameplay in NationStates and elsewhere.[/color]

We are [region]Cities of the World[/region] and we are everywhere!
