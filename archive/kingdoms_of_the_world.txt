*Draws guns* GIVE US MALPHE!!! You heard me, GIVE US MALPHE!!! That ratboi will pay for what he did!

You&#146;ve been raided by the North Pacific Army. If you give us the rat, we will leave peacefully. If not, there will be casualties. 

We will be leaving shortly, with or without your help. Have a nice day.
