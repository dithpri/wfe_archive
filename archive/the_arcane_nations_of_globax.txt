Hello, and welcome to The Arcane Nations Of Globax!

We are a proud group of nations held together by the ancient Globaxian Pact.

Here are some of the Pact&amp;#39;s Main beliefs:

- Those who betray their brethren countries in the Pact shall be ejected and banned from all of the Globaxian Nations.
- As a nation of the Globaxian Pact, you must obey the laws decreed by the High Council, and enforce tem to the best of your willpower.
- We are a region that is more focused on upkeeping our nations than engaging in endless battles. However, if another region or nation is seen as a threat, we will defend and pursue them to the best of our abilities.


--- The Founder of The Arcane Nations of Globax, and Emperor of Kyrolith,

Praetor.
