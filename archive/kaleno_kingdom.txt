No Kale, only Kake!!

As kake-eating kayaktivists, we preach Mother Kake&#39;s solem words to the world. Showing the mindless kale-consuming populace the obvious fallacies of their ways. We send a message of strength and resilience in the only true way; by parking a kayak in front, on or around it!

And as we send these foul beasts packing with our every victory, let us rejoice in the savory,sweet,crumbly folds of the all holy Kake.

kHELLnO!
