Hello, friends! We don&amp;#39;t really have any regional government yet, or any members... We would be very grateful if you would join!

Our founder, [nation]Communal Utopia[/nation], has regional control, but will only use it if necessary, like in the event of an invasion, or for tiny things like the World Factbook Entry.  Please consider moving in!

Join the Dying Empire, New Republic, or create your own government in our (work-in-progress) Star-Wars based RPG!  Stake your claim on our (WIP) Regional Map!
