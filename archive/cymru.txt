[color=red][i]If R. S. Thomas was compulsory
And Saunders Lewis was for free
Owain Glynd&amp;#373;r our history
And Dylan kept the memories
And Dylan kept the memories

But 1404 got left behind
And we were trapped and stuck in time
We had it all, we had our smiles
And 1404 got left behind[/color]

[color=green]In 1985, Orwell was proved right
Torville and Dean&#39;s bolero
Redundant as a sad welsh chapel
In 1985, in 1985

In 1985, the Civil War failed why?
Kept hidden like scars of birth
Nature unable to soften the words.[/color]
