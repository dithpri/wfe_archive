Confoederation Helvetica was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance among three cantons after securing its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499.  Its constitution allows voters to introduce referenda on proposed laws. Confoederation Helvetica is active in many international organizations and its sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major World powers.  As a result, it enjoys political and economic integration with the entire World.
