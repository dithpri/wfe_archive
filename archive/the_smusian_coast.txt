The remains of the once great nation of Antheos have descended into ruin. However, new nations have sprung up in its place. Some continue to bear the Anthean name, and some do not, bearing their own name. The Smusian Coast is full of different nations, and, provided they follow the regions rules, the nations may remain. The Smusian Coast is a region built on the belief that everybody deserves a place in this region, even those who may believe otherwise. We plan to welcome everyone with open arms. Light roleplay exists, but nobody is going to rant about the 30 page history of their nation in your face. 

THE RULES: 1. Any WA members MUST endorse our WA delegate, [nation]New Antheos[/nation]. 2. All nations must prosper and bring glory to themselves and Smusia.
