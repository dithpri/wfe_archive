The remains of the once great nation of Antheos have descended into ruin.
However, new nations have sprung up in its place. Some continue to bear the Anthean name, and some do not, holding their own nation and ideas.
Although the Smusian Coast is full of different, nearby nations, conflict is possible and expected, and the nations are not, necessarily, united.
The Smusian Coast is a region built on the belief that everybody deserves a place in this region, even those who may believe otherwise. We plan to welcome everyone with open arms. Light roleplay exists, but nobody is going to force a rant about the 30 page history of their nation in your face.
