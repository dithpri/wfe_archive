We are made for the people of Swansea and other reasonable people who want to join. We won&amp;#39;t be half full of Nazis like other regions were. The region will be run fairly and democratically. Everything will be elected and the government will do many fun things to make the game more fun. We&amp;#39;ll vote on regional laws, ministers, etc.
