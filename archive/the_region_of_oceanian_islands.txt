Tired of searching for a region that supposedly houses Oceanian islands? Well look no further! This a region where nations in the Oceania (and Pacific) can come to work together! Founded by Polynesian settlers, and then colonized by Europeans, various nations broke away to form their own unique cultures and identities! We look forward to having you here in our beautiful spot on the globe!
