[region]ASA Against Fascism[/region] is where raiders from [region]The Atlantic Socialist Alliance[/region] come together to protect the common good from fascism. 

Not long after [region]The Atlantic Socialist Alliance[/region] was founded, the founding members witnessed evil and division in the Nationstates world, often caused by fascist and alt-right regions. Thus, [region]ASA Against Fascism[/region] was created in the hope of eliminating such regions.
