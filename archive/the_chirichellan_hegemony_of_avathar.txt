Founded April 21, 2015.

The Kingdom of Chirichella had been attacked many times by raiding groups from regional alliances. Other regional alliances demanded to have a say in the internal affairs of the Kingdom, but the King denied them. He formed an independent alliance, one where nations could have complete sovereignty, yet still be protected from foreign threats. Together, these nations formed Avathar.

Several other regions have also been liberated by Avatharian forces.

We are now allied with [region=Sirius].
