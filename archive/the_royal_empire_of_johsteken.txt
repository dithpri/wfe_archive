[b][i][u][region]The Royal Empire of JohSteKen[/region][/u][/i][/b]

In order to prevent the despicable occurrence of anarchy that I have seen in other regions, nations are required to endorse [nation]JohSteKen[/nation]. This is a dictatorship for the greater good, as I have now seen that the people cannot govern themselves without struggling for power.

The goal of [region]The Royal Empire of JohSteKen[/region] is to control as many regions as possible, by reviving, raiding, or waiting. Passwords will be used after I gain control because I&#39;m one person and so can&#39;t use the WA to defend the region in a fair way. Sorry.

I&#39;m also happy to take nations that you don&#39;t use anymore but can&#39;t stand to see CTE.

This region accepts embassy requests.
