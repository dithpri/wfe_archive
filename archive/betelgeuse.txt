[b]Welcome to Betelgeuse.[/b]

Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star in Orion, is located about 640 light-years away from Earth. Its reddish hue and massive size make it a striking presence in the night sky. Betelgeuse is nearing the end of its life and is expected to explode as a supernova.

Surrounding Betelgeuse is a dynamic space filled with intricate patterns of gas and dust, shaped by the star&#39;s powerful stellar winds. These winds create complex structures visible in various wavelengths, forming glowing nebulae and turbulent shockwaves.

Betelgeuse is part of the Orion OB1 association, a group of massive, young stars. This region is a hotbed of stellar activity with ongoing star formation and frequent interactions.
