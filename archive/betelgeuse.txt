[b]Betelgeuse[/b]

Once a brilliant beacon in the night sky, Betelgeuse now flickers and flares with unpredictable energy as it nears the final stages of its life cycle. The system is a cauldron of cosmic chaos, with solar storms, intense gravitational forces, and extreme radiation emanating from the dying star.

Navigating this region is perilous at best. Ships venturing too close are subject to the deadly effects of the volatile space weather, as well as the immense gravitational pull of the star as it prepares for a supernova. Despite the dangers, the area holds immense scientific value, with Starfleet and other factions eager to collect data on the star&#146;s imminent collapse.
