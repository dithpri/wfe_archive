~The Region of Nobody Likes A Commie~

Our great region is anti- communist, and that is pretty much the only thing preventing anyone from joining.  Due to past circumstances of raids, a password is required, to get the password, you must contact Dontalia, our currently Director of Homeland Affairs.  Now, Nobody Likes a Commie is mainly right wing, but we do like to challenge other ideologies.  Just as long as you aren&#39;t communist, or socialist, you may apply to become a member of our great region!
