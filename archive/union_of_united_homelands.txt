Overview:
The Union of United Fatherlands is a confederation forged not by na&iuml;ve peace, but by the hard lessons of survival. Here, unity is an armor, and cooperation, a sharp weapon. Each member country has sacrificed a portion of its autonomy to ensure the existence of the whole, and the UPU does not hesitate to project its influence &#151; or its strength &#151; to protect its interests and expand its domain. For those outside its borders, we are an unshakable bloc; for those who dare to challenge us, the demonstration of a single and indomitable will.

&quot;Victorious warriors win before going to war, while defeated warriors go to war and only then seek victory&quot;
