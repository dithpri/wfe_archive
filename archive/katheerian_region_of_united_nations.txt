We encourage individuality and uniqueness among people, and we do so by providing a terrific amount of civil liberties and freedoms. All nations are welcome in this region, so long as they commit to working together cohesively and peacefully for the benefit of all people. We do not fight with our neighboring regions, we do not fight each other, and we remain neutral in all occurrences of war. We care about our people and the future generations of our people, so we focus on improving education, scientific and medical research, environmental protection, and many other fields that will encourage the population to prosper. We devote the majority of governmental funds to better the day to day lives of every person residing in our region.
