[b]When I was a young [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_black_hawks]Hawk[/url], my trigger
Took me into some regions,
To fly a Black Hawk Flag
He said Hawk when you grow up, Will you be
A raider of the broken, the beaten and the damned
He said will you, defeat them, the natives, and all of the defenders,
the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I&#146;ll leave you, a raider, to lead you into some regions,
