Roshar is a rocky region, with stone as the ground and highstorms swirling across the terrain. Voidbringers bring along with them terror and chaos, and the nationstate of Szeth was the first to warn of the return of the Voidbringers, also known as Aharietiam. Roshar seeks to bring order to a chaotic world and uphold democracy.
