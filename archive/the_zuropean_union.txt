[b]We would like to welcome all nations - members and non-members - to The Zuropean Union! We are a modern-tech, human-only, quality-over-quantity region with offsite forums and our own radio channel! We love to roleplay, whether it be war, sports or business. We much prefer our region to be referred to as Zurope when in-character. Thank you, and enjoy your stay in Zurope![/b]
