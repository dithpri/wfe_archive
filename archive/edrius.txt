The [b]Region of Edrius[/b] was formed by [i]Domaskus Thyvor[/i], Emperor of Thyvor, Capital of Edrius, and [i]Elendrian Darkholme[/i] of Umpyrika, Sister Capital of Edrius. It owns various corporate entities inside the two capitals. Whist Thyvor&amp;#39;s economy is thriving, Umpyrika&amp;#39;s economy is struggling massively, as it depends on farmers which illegally switch to Subsistence Farming. Join us today to immerse yourself into the intricate, difficult RP world of Edrius!
