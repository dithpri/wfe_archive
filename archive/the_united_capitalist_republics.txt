The U.C.R. Is a region for economically thriving nations looking to consolidate their strength. The U.C.R. was derived from the biased and chaotic Region, &amp;quot;The SmorgasLands.&amp;quot; The founding nations of this glorious region, Insula Ingens, Edulus, and the Sapiens, realized the tyranny that the SmorgasLands were instilling, and decided to take the initiative. Still humbled by their bringing in the SmorgasLands, they have constructed embassies with them and helping the leader get his nation back on track.
