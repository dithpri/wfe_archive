The Wirral Commonwealth is a collection of vastly varied nations. The region was formed as a way for nations who wish to conduct their affairs privately, without being judged, or influenced by others, to do so as part of a group. 

Any nations are free to join the Commonwealth, and once they have, are free to conduct their business however they see fit. Members are not required to engage with other members, but are encouraged to seek help if they need it; the Commonwealth is non-elitist, welcoming both inexperienced, and experienced members, and the founder (Whaley Lane), or others on the regions message board, will be happy to help with even the most basic of problems.
