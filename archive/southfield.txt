[color=Blue][b]Hello!

I am the original founder of this region, [nation]Wintermoore[/nation].
I know that some of the former nations of this great region have moved to different areas, and i therefore am making contact with them as much as I can, and are going to begin the process of rebuilding. 

Currently, I am taking the office of Chancellor, and am going to enact marshal law. I am going to put the region on lock-down and place it under password protection. If you wish to help, I will telegram you the password after I have screened you for threats. 

Thank you.[/b][/color]
