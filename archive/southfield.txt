[color=darkblue][b]I feel the need to explain why Wintermoore left. He had a fatal tumor. Sadly, he did not survive to be able to come back. In his spirit, I: his little brother (one year younger), wanted to continue to play his nation in his place. So here I am. I changed the flag to symbolize the transfer of control of this nation. Thank you all
