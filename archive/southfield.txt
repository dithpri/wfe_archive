[b][color=darkblue]Gruezi! Welcome to Southfield! We are an international region reforming currently after a brief absence. We are formed on the traditions of an ancient roleplay and direct democratic values based on the swiss model of government. We welcome you to come see our region for yourself! Feel free to stop by for a chat!
