The region of South Field was originally founded by the nation of Wintermoore. This nation, along with two other nations, started this region as a safe and open place for all nations to realm and be free. We will accept all nations, and we will have an elected government once the population of the region reaches seven nations. If you have any questions about the region, its laws, or policies please ask!

I hope you enjoy the lands of Southfield!
