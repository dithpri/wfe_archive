[B][u]Welcome, to The Fractured World[/u][/B]
[hr]
[color=red]Welcome to the 1960&#39;s, brave leader. Long gone is the terror of the Great War and three ideologies now stand as the testament to that long and bloody conflict. Long has the ideas of Liberalism and Capitalism ruled over this world, but the ideas of Karl Marx have won over the people and thus ousted the capitalists, yet still others have chosen the much younger and militaristic ideals of Fascism and Ultra nationalism. Some have even created unholy unions of the three.

Welcome to a world in which the Second World War is yet to reign, a world stuck in a seemly endless Cold War between three ideological giants.
