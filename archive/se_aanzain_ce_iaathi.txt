This region is the holy land for the believers of Iaathi, a small religion with devoted followers. Their beliefs guide this land to true liberty and equality, where everyone is truly able to do as they please, with the exception of hurting others, of course.
All are welcome to enjoy peace and happiness.

Se Aanzain ce Iaathi is the Iaathi language for &amp;quot;The World of Iaathi.&amp;quot;
