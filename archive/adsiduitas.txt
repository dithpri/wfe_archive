Adsiduitas is set in Alternate History. Alternate History is a type of Speculative Fiction (sometimes called &quot;Uchronia&quot; or &quot;Anachronism&quot;) set in a world where one or more historical events unfolded differently than they did in the real world. Often set some time after the event (called a &quot;point of divergence&quot;, or PoD, by fans of the genre), such stories typically describe a Present Day world vastly changed by the difference, or follow another major historical event in light of the change. Well in short what to go to mars sure go ahead, what to wage a war why not you can do it all.
