Hi, We welcome all players to join our small and humble region. Just so this entry isn&#39;t too long and I have to rewrite it again, I&#39;m going to skip to the main parts. What does our region offer?
- Friendly people
- New players, so any other new nations that join don&#39;t have to be shy and can have a voice much easier
- Elections available to everyone*
- Roleplay
* For security measures, only people we know in real life can have office positions. This will change. Our region is also password protected as you may have noticed, if you want to join, send anyone of the officers a telegram asking for the passcode, and we&#39;ll briefly look at your nation and send you the passcode. 
 
As stated above, send any questions to any officer
