[b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b]

[i]Taken on 07/08/12.[/i]

On 06/08/12, several Nazi nations from this region attempted to attack [region]The MT Army[/region], it did not end well for them...

This region is now a living museum against hate. The Nazis will never win, they can&amp;#39;t possibly stop us, diversity is strength and as long they are blind to this they will never be able to defeat us!

[nation]Vippertooth33[/nation]&amp;#39;s vision is to see the Nazi/fascists gone from NationStates forever.

These museum&amp;#39;s shall remind the world that good people always triumph over the evil ones.
