Founded in January 2012, [region]Redwood[/region] appreciates liberal, non-corporate states, but will only reject dictators or raiders. We&amp;#39;re small, so if you&amp;#39;re looking for a region that you can help build, come to [region]Redwood[/region].

We also have potential as a sporting region. There have been tournaments hosted offsite, and a few of our members have participated on the NS Sports forum.
