[b] [u] Welcome to The Coalition [/u] [/b]

The Coalition is an alliance of nations that are either capitalist, liberals, conservatives or any other right-wing nations.
We firmly oppose the ideals of Communism that suppress and deny the freedoms that peoples of the world are entitled to. 

We&#39;re currently holding elections for the position of WA Delegate - leave a post on the RMB to why you should be elected by your peers!
