The Coalition is a region who recognizes the importance of capitalism and corporations within a country. This region, or Coalition, would solely dedicate itself to increasing the rights of multi-billion dollar corporations, whether they are private or owned by the state. To join this region, a country must believe in capitalism -- believing in &amp;quot;The Invisible Hand&amp;quot;, and other capitalist ideologies. Other matters, such as the civil rights and political freedoms within a country in this region are irrelevant.
