The Warsaw Initiative ([i]Inicjatywa Warszawska[/i]) is an ideological organization built on the motive and purpose of the Warsaw Uprising, 1944. The Warsaw Initiative&#39;s purpose is to deny both radical nationalist expansionism and socialist collectivism. We protect our freedom.

Like the Warsaw Uprising, we will be taking the initiative against our adversaries. We will not rely on the help of outsiders to protect our land and our people.

Currently the structure of this organization is being sorted out. You may telegram if you have any questions.
