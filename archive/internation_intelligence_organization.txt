We are the IIO. Our goal is to have all nations focused on intelligence, technology, and education. Out key goal here is clearly technologies.

Everyone is required to have at least 1-2 things (it depends) that say your nation is &quot;technologically advanced&quot;, &quot;intelligent&quot; or something that means you have a good education here.

You are required to have a fair amount of people as well as good Civil Rights, Economy, and Political Freedom.
