The beautiful region of Franavia, ruled by the Tribunal-of-Nations, Nimerika, Hansenavia, and Lavignland, is a geographically diverse region. Comprised of windswept tundras, golden-grassed prairies, lush jungles and treacherous mountains, the region acts as a glorious example of international cooperation. The other nations within the region are treated with the utmost respect, perhaps with a shard of oppression from the rather domineering Tribunal. The region&#39;s economy hums loudly, and the banner of freedom raised high. The nations Hansenavia and Lavignland act as great counterweights to the authoritarian, but loving, Nimerikan nation and vice versa.
