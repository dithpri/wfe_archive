The beautiful region of Franavia, ruled by the Committee of Oversight headed by Nimerika, Hansenavia, Kennavia,and Lavignland, is a geographically diverse region. Comprised of windswept tundras, golden-grassed prairies, lush jungles and treacherous mountains, the region acts as a glorious example of international cooperation. The other nations within the region are treated with the utmost respect, perhaps with a shard of oppression from the rather domineering Committee. The region&#39;s economy hums loudly, and the banner of freedom raised high. Within the Committee, the Nations Hansenavia and Lavignland challenge the loving communist dictatorships of Nimerika and Kennavia.
