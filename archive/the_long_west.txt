For a LONGGGGGGG time, [region]The Long West[/region] has stood as a testament and home of humanity.  The birthplace of longkind in itself.  The home of technological marvels like the winners of the space race, artificial intelligence so lifelike its considered human, and WMDs just to name a few.  While some would leave to concoct their own versions of history, like the backwards thinking lands of [region]The Long East[/region] who legalize cannibalization, the forward thinkers of [region]The Long West[/region] reigns as the oldest region and birthplace of humanity.  We pride ourselves on being the birthplace of democracy.  Without [region]The Long West[/region], you have nothing.
