[b]RETIRED SEPTEMBER 6 2022[/b]

This region is the home of [nation]Hhh entertainment[/nation].

This region perpetually serves as a memorial for the victims of [nation]The Hurricane[/nation], [nation]Pariland[/nation], [nation]Vavlar[/nation], [region]Chicken Overlords[/region], [region]Rare Name Haven[/region], [region]Crimson Foxes[/region], [region]Archai[/region], [region]The Galactic Mafia[/region], and [region]The Pechenegs[/region]. These nations and regions have repeatedly raided this region and others, causing grief to several communities as they advance bigoted and tyrannical thought. Such actions shall not be tolerated by the brave and true of NationStates.
