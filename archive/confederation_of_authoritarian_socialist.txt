This region is suppose to be for socialist of the &quot;authoritarian&quot; type that seeks a intellectual debate. C.A.S. is against Social Liberalism and economic Liberalism. Capitalism  is still the main enemy, but so is the fascist, conservative, &quot;progressive&quot; and the social democrat. Left-wing Nationalism and Populism are supported. This place is for the leftist rejected from larger groups. This region support the self determination of individuals to establish their views freely. Think of the region as a international, but for a Newer Left. The anti-Liberal type! Lenin-Marxist are welcomed, as well as any Third Positionist that isn&#39;t racist.Religious and reformist socialist welcomed too. Anything unorthodox on the left(though authoritarian).
