I have decide to leave NationStates feeling that all of my time and research here is done.

This was an experiment to learn more about how people in groups react to a situation. I was assigned for negative behaviors in devoted groups. I have chosen UNDERTALE due to the Internet saying it is the new FNaF and aggressive fanboys. I plan out my nation, and create all the stuff. Your attacks give me data for my research for my college course in human behavior. I had so much data that I have spilt it into several different reactions. So I&#39;m sorry if I did harm your feelings.

Thank you for your participation for my college course.

P.S. No hard feelings.
