Welcome to the Military State of Deren we here support freedom, so here you can do whatever you wish as long as you keep it in your borders. here you can role play invading other nations as long as you keep it real, and not get annoying about also all manner of IRL war crimes are allowed and genocides as long as they are in your borders are okay. This is also a sci-fi server so if you have the space progrm policy you can go out and colonize other worlds, but if you are role playing a war and one side has a fleet and the other does not you cannot orbitally bombard them. Another thing is if you have an alt that does not have a space program but YOU do you can gift your ALT ships to use but only if it is your alt. Have fun!
