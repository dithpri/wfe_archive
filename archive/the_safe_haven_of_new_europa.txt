Welcome to Europa, arguably, Jupiter&#39;s finest satellite.

We are a safe haven for anyone seeking refuge from the iron fist of the once great Federation of Martian Colonies.

After the civil wars ended, and the Smackatopian rule began, the Gnome Childrenian space program relocated the entire population to this new land, free from regional corruption and wars.

We invite every single Federation of Martian Colonies occupant to join us in this new era.
