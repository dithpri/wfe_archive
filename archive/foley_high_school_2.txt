Like Foley High School but like way cooler. As always read the rules and make sure you do not break them. Roleplay is allowed in the RMB, but you do not have to. All ideals and mindsets are welcomed, and no idea shall be denied consideration. This isn&#39;t a sissy nerd party, this is a place for cool dudes/gals to come hang out and be radical. Enjoy your time and get to know everyone, and like always dont forget your [b]Grab N Go[/b].
