Gynocentric region originally founded by &amp;quot;[nation]Girls are Better[/nation],&amp;quot; but she let it lapse.
We never even knew of this region&amp;#39;s existence until then.

Unfortunate, but no problem. [b]The [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] has come to the rescue
and refounded it to keep it out of the hands of misogynists.

Region closed due to lack of interest. If you would like to join, please telegram FemDom HQ
at [nation]Femdom Empire[/nation]. Thank you, and Femmepower.
