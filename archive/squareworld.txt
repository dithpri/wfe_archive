[hr]As of March 14, 2025, this region is under the control of the Incircleporated Roundpublic (soon to change).

Squareworld originally served (and still serves) as a puppet storage region for Squarelandiuh. However, it now stands as a shining example of how the Circlist ideology can succeed, having outlived the Old Regime and living on to control the region. Glory to the Incircleporated Roundpublic!
