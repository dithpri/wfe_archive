[b]Welcome to Squareworld, a mostly puppet storage region![/b]
(As of March 14, 2025, this region is under the control of the Incircleporated Roundpublic.)

Squareworld originally served (and still serves) as a puppet storage region for Squarelandiuh. However, it now stands as a shining example of how the Circlist ideology can succeed, having outlived the Old Regime and living on to control the region.

Glory to the Incircleporated Roundpublic!

Update: The Squareworld Discord server has recently become active!
