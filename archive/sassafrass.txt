Founded in the ashes of a still-developing region, we seek to build a tight-knit community of active nations committed to its growth. With a Parliament open to all citizens, an Elder Council composed of our most illustrious members, and an Administration approved by the Council, we have many opportunities for advancement.

In order to become a citizen and have the opportunity to participate in government, please endorse our current WA Delegate, [nation=Anderkistan].[hr]
