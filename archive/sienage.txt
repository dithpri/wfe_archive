Welcome to [region]Sienage[/region]!


Here in [b]Sienage[/b], we warmly welcome nations devoted to [b]Education[/b], [b]Defence[/b], [b]Welfare[/b] and [b]Commerce[/b], but we do accept any nation with at least a fair economy.
Any nation with a [color=red]Developing, Weak, Fragile, Struggling, Basket Case[/color] or an [color=red]Imploded Economy[/color] is [u]ejected[/u] automatically by [nation]Angasana[/nation]. If that nation attempts to join Sienage back, it will be automatically [u]ejected and banned[/u] by [nation]Angasana[/nation].
