Through the foundations of Matthan and other key nations, the region is powerful in peace and alliance with others. We focus on military for peace and protection, not war. We believe in rights for all and equal pay and housing just as much as the next person. If you work for your winnings, you can become higher in pay and social life, but we gurantee that no one will ever hit rock bottom. For the betterment of the flow.

Regional leader,
President of Matthan
