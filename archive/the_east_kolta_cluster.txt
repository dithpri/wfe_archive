A scattered chain of tropical islands, dominated by three archipelagos, the largest of which is home to the Republic of Koltoria. The region recently broke free from a tyrannical dictatorship which used the notable Uranium deposits to create weapons of mass destruction, which the Koltorian Rebel Army seized and destroyed. The governments of the East Kolta Cluster seek to maintain a free and prosperous region, and to lend aid to the oppressed and weakened peoples of the world.
