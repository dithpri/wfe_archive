The mists at the edge of the world, the borderlands as they are called, a spiritual place where the dead (those not marked by the lifemark) are sent to perish. 

All born within the boundaries of the border-veil are marked by the sigil of the all-maker, except for a few exceptions, and those who are not marked are considered dead, for they are without the mark of life. The dead are not permitted to walk among the living, and therefor are banished beyond the borderlands.

Here you stand, living and dead, walking amongst other lost souls who have either abandoned life, or have been abandoned by it. Nations form amidst the mists, children are born, lives are made and broken. Welcome, deadman, to the land of lost souls... Beyond the Borderlands.
