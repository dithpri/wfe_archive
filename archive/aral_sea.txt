[b]Aral Sea[/b]: A once-large saltwater lake straddling the boundary between Kazakhstan to the north and Uzbekistan to the south. The shallow Aral Sea was formerly the world&#39;s fourth largest body of inland water. It nestles in the climatically inhospitable heart of Central Asia, to the east of the Caspian Sea. The Aral Sea is of great interest and increasing concern to scientists because of the remarkable shrinkage of its area and volume that began in the second half of the 20th century. --Encyclopedia Britannica[hr]
