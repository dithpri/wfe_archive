welcome. come and go as you please. anarchica, as the name implies, is an anarchic region. which means that your nation is welcome, no matter what your ideas of the perfect way to run a nation may be. all we ask, is that you extend the same courtesy to other nations as well. you want your nation to be a paranoid, polaroid, theocratic, scandinavian liberal paradise slave state? fine with us... you get the drift. the world is often an absurd place, we understand.
