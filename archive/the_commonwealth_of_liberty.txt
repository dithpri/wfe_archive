[b]The Commonwealth of Liberty[/b]

[i]~Welcome, to this brand new region~[/i]

The Commonwealth of Liberty is a conservative, capitalist, casual region based around inalienable freedoms and the free market. 

There are very little rules here. Feel free to talk about whatever on the RBM, in whatever languages you please. Though all government functions will be carried out in English and maybe French, should it be needed.

[b]Basic Rules[/b]
[i]Do NOT upset the moderators[/i]
[i]Don&#146;t try to cause drama, though you are allowed to debate.[/i]
[i]Make suggestions and be active - this isn&#146;t required, but is appreciated[/i]
[i]No overthrowing the government[/i]
[i]No leftists, communists (though conservative socialists may be okay)[/i]
