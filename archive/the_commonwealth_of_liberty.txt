x-x-x THE COMMONWEALTH OF LIBERTY x-x-x

  As conversation stirred in the Nunavutian
House of Parliament, Local Member of Parliament,
Cole Greenwood, flung himself from his seat and 
stated, &quot;This is an outrage! Nations such as ourselves
go unnoticed! So, in spite of that, I bring you, a 
proposal to form a free pact! A pact of liberty 
and equality!&quot;. Soon after the proposal was brought to
the floor, The Prime Minister of Nunavut announced
the founding of [region] The Commonwealth of Liberty [/region].

Ever since that day, the pact has welcomed all nations in
order to achieve their rightful place in the world and gain
an influence and pull in International Politics.
