[b]Hooray! The [nation=short]US 28th Infantry Division[/nation] has overrun the Siegfried Line![/b]

[i]Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming, the huns are running
The drums are rum-tumming everywhere
So prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We&amp;#39;ll be over there, we&amp;#39;re coming over
And we won&amp;#39;t come back till it&amp;#39;s over over there[/i]

[b]Next stop, Berlin!

To Hell with Hitler![/b]
