[b][color=red][region]The Siegfried Line[/region] has been breached and destroyed![/color][/b]

[b]This region was a Nazi and Fascist region used as a platform for the Fascists and Nazis to espouse their hateful views in NationStates.[/b]

[b][color=red]But not anymore. [region]The Internationale[/region] has seized this region, and it shall from now on be an anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi region, and will no longer be a place, home, or platform for the Nazis and Fascists to preach hate, but for washing.[/color][/b]

[b]Sing along now! Take it away George Formby![/b]

We&amp;#39;re gonna hang out the washing on [region]The Siegfried Line[/region].
