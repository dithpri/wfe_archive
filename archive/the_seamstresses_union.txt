At the Heart of the Seattle Barrens lies the Seamstresses Union; an old brownstone building which lies at the corner of &#39;illegal&#39; and &#39;opportunity&#39;, bums huddle together, gangers strut the street, and sometimes a corporate wage-slave or salaryman comes slumming. 

The building itself has been rebuilt, retrofitted, and restored so many times that it&#39;s given the building it&#39;s own unique personality; like that of an aging starlet plastering herself with too much makeup to ward off the ravages of time. The wild ivy slowly creeping from the gutters to run down the sides of the building only add to the effect.
