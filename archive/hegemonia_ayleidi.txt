After their exodus, the Ayleids found themselves on a new continent to themselves. They sent out explorers and eventually found more nations. The continent they found themselves on they named Mer&#39;Ketuna. After finding many human nations on this new world, the Ayleids isolated themselves. Not allowing anyone but a few traders in, the Ayleid Hegemony (Hegemonia Ayleidi) colonized and conquered multiple groups of islands before isolating themselves.
