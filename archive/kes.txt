An experiment in political systems.

Samirira: An exercise in what my nation could be, if only its political leaders would grow up and do their jobs, rather than engaging in playground mudslinging. Equality for all, regardless of race, gender, age, or sexual preference. Focusing on getting the job done without leaning on corruption or misguided religion.

Kestreya: What my nation is in the process of turning itself into. Blindly following religion, instead of espousing reason. Corruption at all levels. Blatant disregard for basic human rights. Narrow-mindedness. Broken promises, and rule by fear. Mistrust and suspicion of other peoples. Warmongering.

In short: Be Samirira. Do not be Kestreya.
