Hallownest is the location where Hollow Knight takes place. Once a thriving kingdom in the middle of a wasteland, it has fallen into ruin in the wake of the Infection. The land of Hallownest covers a vast network of caves and tunnels in the middle of a wasteland. They are inhabited by both sentient and wild bugs, among other creatures.
