[b][color=#20B2AA]Welcome to The Mirage Isles![/color]

The Mirage Isles is a Direct Democracy. We do have a ruling Monarch, but the Monarch gets his/her orders from the Visionary. We have a quiet little community, which will be based around our forums. You can join said forums by [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/The_Mirage_Isles/index/]clicking here[/url]. Once there, you can take part in the events, roleplays, and much more!
