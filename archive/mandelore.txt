  We are a region devoted to war. Entirely. Nothing. ELSE.
Use common sense, do not use cancerous reasoning... example: [nation]The Third Reich Continued[/nation]

  If you want to become the WA Delegate, send a telegram to [nation=short]Queens Gambit Decliners[/nation] , expressing interest in it. There will then be a poll put up for 3 days for it, and the nation with most votes, will win. All nations in the World Assembly should endorse the winner, so that person can be the WA Delegate.

  Rules for WA Delegate elections:
*Do not vote with puppet nations
*You MAY vote for yourself
*Do not rage at the winner of the election
*Poll is up for only 3-4 days
