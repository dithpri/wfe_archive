  We are a region devoted to war. Entirely. Nothing. ELSE.
Use common sense, do not use cancerous reasoning... example: [nation]The Third Reich Continued[/nation]

  If you want to become the WA Delegate, send a telegram to [nation]Derpany[/nation] , expressing interest in it. There will then be a poll put up for 3 days for it, and the nation with most votes, will win. 
  
 Rules for WA Delegate elections:
[i]*Do not vote with puppet nations
*You [color=red]MAY[/color] vote for yourself
*Do not rage at the winner of the election
*Nations must be in Mandelore for 8+ days in order to vote[/i]
