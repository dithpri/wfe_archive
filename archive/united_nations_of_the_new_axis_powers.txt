As a strong military nation, originally created on 12/4/15 between Western Germany and Waifustakistan, the UNNAP stands as a united coalition of powers devoted to taking control of States that belong to Nations other than our own. We will start small, but in time, we will take control over all who oppose us. We believe in military and police excellence, and plan on using it to expand our nations, if peaceful takeover is not an option.
