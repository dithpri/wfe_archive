As a strong military nation, we stand as a united coalition of powers devoted to taking control of States that belong to Nations other than our own. We will start small, but in time, we will take control over all who oppose us. We believe in spreading freedom and equality to the people, and defending those morals through military and law enforcement excellence, and we plan on using it to expand our nations, if peaceful takeover is not an option.
