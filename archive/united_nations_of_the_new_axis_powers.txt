As a strong military nation, originally created on 12/4/15 between Western Germany and Waifustakistan, the UNNAP stands as a united coalition of powers devoted to taking control of States that belong to Nations other than our own. We will start small, but in time, we will take control over all who oppose us. We believe in freedom and equality, and plan on forcefully spreading it across the world, if need be.
