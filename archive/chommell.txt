Welcome to the [b]Chommell sector[/b], a galactic sector located in the Mid Rim that is host to more than thirty inhabited star systems.

Straddling the Enarc Run, Chommell is notably home to the planet Naboo, homeworld of the Gungans and a human society known as the Naboo. Since their accession to the Galactic Republic over eight centuries ago, Naboo and other systems within the Chommell sector have been vocal proponents of diplomacy and humanitarian efforts in the realm of galactic politics.
