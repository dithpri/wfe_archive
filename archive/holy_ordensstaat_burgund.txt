
The Reigion itself is completely administered and operated by the Burgundian Schutzstaffel, otherwise  known as the Burgundian SS. The head of Burgundy and the Reichsf&uuml;hrer of the Burgundian SS, Heinrich 
Himmler, preaches his own ideological doctrine known as the &quot;Burgundian System&quot;. This ideology views the classic National Socialism practiced in Germany as increasingly decadent and inefficient and seeks to revitalize it based off extreme militarism and state spartanism.

&quot;May God Not Be With Us.&quot;
