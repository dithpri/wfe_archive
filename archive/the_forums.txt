Gather round! Gather round!

T&#146;is the place to speak of truths and lies, t&#146;is the time to share your voice! Only laws you must abide are engraved upon in stone.

Thou shall not speak of profanity or swear, thou shall not mention or abuse your knowledge, and thou shall not make horrid remarks! Remember, although the made rules are set in stone, there always can be room to carve more!
