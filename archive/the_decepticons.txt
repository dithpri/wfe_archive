At the very start of their faction&#39;s formation, the Decepticons may have been content with ruling Cybertron alone, but that is a notion of little value. It matters not that their creator intended the Transformers to be a race of peace. The Decepticons are the highest form of life in existence, conquerors who will bring order to a galaxy plagued by disorder and weak organics. That order is the Decepticon Empire, a reign of life&#39;s most powerful creatures and thus highest accomplishments.
