Like a clutch of eggs we are few and fragile but that shall change as more join our ranks. All are welcome here as this is a judgement free zone. However we do not tolerate bullying, scamming, racism, and other negative things. Happiness is the great rope that binds us as one. Lets not break it with negativity.
