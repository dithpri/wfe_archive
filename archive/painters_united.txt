We Paint!

This regional union was founded by Keemstar the leader of The Republic of Stan Lee, the name was derived from his love of painting. Now this great union is host to several nations of many ideologies. This union has seen great economic success, mainly due to The Republic of Stan Lee&#39;s massive economy. The union is no stranger to war of the civil variety either, as it has seen the Flynntish civil war. The union has also seen ideological conflict in the form of Fuhrans latest coup, which has seen the rise of a more democratic system of government, which hasn&#39;t been that helpful for the nation.
