Na&amp;#39;Tora is a planet billions of miles away from earth. The main inhabitants are the humans (what earthlings call vampires though we are related to brother wolf...) that live in the central continent. The south continent is controlled by dragons. The other three continents are unexplored, so who controls them are unknown. Are you brave enough to enter this world?

(Basically this is my world, customs and stuff will be witten out and help is always appreciated.)
