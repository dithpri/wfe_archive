[region]The Commonwealth of the People[/region] is a commonwealth of left-wing or democratic countries working together to empower the people of the world. It was founded on September 28, 2017 by the young socialist nation of [nation]Astaniszka[/nation]. 
The nations of the Commonwealth each have the power to choose whatever path they choose, as long as it empowers the people in some way. A generally acceptable range would be from a semi-authoritarian communist state, to a conservative democracy, to an anarchist commune. 
The Commonwealth is controlled by a council, which currently is comprised of all Nations in the Commonwealth. The delegates that control the council meet bi-weekly in Nuova Bruxelles, Il Nuovo to propose, discuss, and pass legislation.
