This region would have been named after an abandoned railroad station located in the state of San Luis Potos&iacute;, Mexico. But it&#39;s not, because NS will not accept &quot;[b]Estaci&oacute;n Catorce[/b]&quot; as a region name.

If you&#39;re one of the lucky few who have been there, I hope it was as good for you as it was for me.
