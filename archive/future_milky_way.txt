[i][b]Welcome to [region]Future Milky Way[/region]![/b][/i]
[i]We are a [b]Role Play[/b] region, so Role Play is [b]mandatory[/b], we are set in the year of 2401, where technology has advanced to the point of space colonization. You can use future tech such as Hyperdrives, Tractor Beams, Energy-Fueled Weapons, FTL velocity in space, etc... Also [u][b]stick along with your NationStates&#39; stats! For example: If your economy is very poor, try getting a better economy before building a mass spacefleet, otherwise it could be seen as FRP by the others![/u][/b][/i]

Rules:
[i]1- Do [u]not[/u] FRP/God Mod[/i]
[i]2- Do [u]not[/u] use OP tech[/i]
[i]3- Please Roleplay seriously, any nations with a [u]immature name[/u] are [u]vulnerable to be kicked[/u][/i]
[i]4- Be kind and fair to everyone, both in FRP and OOC.[/i]
