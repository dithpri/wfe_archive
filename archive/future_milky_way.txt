[i][b]Welcome to [region]Future Milky Way[/region]![/b][/i]
[i]We are a [b]Role Play[/b] region, set in the year of 2700, where technology has advanced to the point of space colonization. You can use future tech. Also [u][b]stick along with your NationStates&#39; stats! For example: If your economy is very poor, try getting a better economy before building a mass spacefleet, otherwise it could be seen as FRP![/u][/b][/i]. Make sure to join [region]Greater Arcadia[/region] for our co-RPing.
Basic Rules:
[i]1- Do [u]not[/u] FRP/God Mod[/i]
[i]2- Do [u]not[/u] use OP tech[/i]
[i]3- Please Roleplay seriously, any nations with a [u]immature name[/u] are [u]vulnerable to be kicked[/u][/i]
[i]4- Be kind and fair to everyone, both in RP and OOC.[/i]
