Keller is a region dedicated to liberty, progress and excellence, and is home to three nations which uphold these values: the District of Keller, the original city-state in which Keller was founded; Kelleran, a break-away nation which left the District peacefully; and Old Dexter, a nation which existed before the city-state but agreed to join.
