Welcome to the Citizen&#39;s Alliance of Democracy, a region founded by [nation=Masconvia] on September 3rd, 2020. The intention of the region is to be a fully democratic alliance of cooperating, although still fully independent, nations. Unlike most of NationStates, every nation is considered a citizen of the CAD upon joining the region and every World Assembly member in the region is considered a member of the government. The WA Delegate position is also different from most other regions, as any nation may legally become the delegate at any time if they acquire enough endorsements.
