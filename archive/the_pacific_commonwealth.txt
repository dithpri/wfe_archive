[b]The Commonwealth of the Pacific Nations (CPN)[/b], in Tian-wen &amp;#22823;&amp;#26481;&amp;#28023;&amp;#22283;&amp;#21332; [i]D&agrave; D&amp;#333;ngh&amp;#462;i Gu&oacute; Xi&eacute;[/i], is a supranational political and economic union of 11 member states that are located primarily on the Pacific or East Sea. CPN policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market. Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Free Movement Area only in 5 countries.

The Commonwealth was established when the Dongdi Treaty came into force 20 years ago, but its beginnings may be traced to the three founding states known as the Three Pillars (the Allied States of [nation]Ryospore[/nation], the Queendom of [nation]Sheng Wang-Guo[/nation] and the [nation]Sherldasland[/nation] Nation) establishing the East Sea Economic Union (ESEU for short).
