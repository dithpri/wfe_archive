[b]Poaching Laws[/b]
Anybody in the Alpaca Republic of Alpacas cannot poach vicugna, camelus, or lama. (Camels, alpacas, etc.)

Anybody who harms these animals (unless the animals hurt them) will be arrested. It is about the same as a bald eagle in the United States of America or a human. Anybody who is arrested for harming one of these animals will be imprisoned, killed, or slapped across the face. The same goes with turtles. (Thankfully barely anyone does this) 

[b]Parties[/b]

Being a Nazi, confederate, fascist, or a slave owner is illegal. [u]This is supposed to be a free region[/u], not a crazy slave region.
