[color=gold]The Capital of [region]The Real Middle Earth[/region][/color]
[color=gray]A hidden stronghold. A place for whispers and war councils.[/color]

Once captured by [color=purple][region]The Purple Pony Club[/region][/color] in a surprise invasion, the Capital fell into chaos and absurd tyranny. But it was [color=skyblue]liberated by a coalition led by [nation]Starship Kilo[/nation][/color], who drove the invaders out and restored order.

Now [color=green]rebuilt and more secure than ever[/color], the Capital serves as a [color=teal]private meeting place for officials[/color], a [color=crimson]refuge in times of crisis[/color], and the [color=orange]quiet heart of [region]The Real Middle Earth[/region] diplomacy[/color].

[color=darkgray]Not shown on maps. Always watching.[/color]
