Through what may be seen as no less than a divine occurrence by the hand of none other than the Matriarch herself, the region of her Crusaders has returned once more, and is stronger than ever!
You are free to join our region, and in it, we hope you find peace, we hope you find guidance, and we hope you find stability.
&quot;May the Heathens perish, and praise be those who suffer&quot;
