Bretheren,
The Matriarch has returned and is here to lead our people to enlightenment once more. To save our people from the tyranny of the Black Riders, who will prove no match for Her divine power. For the past weeks, our region has been descending into anarchy, due to the absence of our Matriarch. The Black Riders took advantage of our weakness and rode into our region. &quot;Huzzah! Huzzah!&quot; they may cry. They have chosen the path away from the Matriarch&#39;s divine teachings. Their cries will pale to the Matriarch&#39;s holy song and she will force them out to restore peace.
Continue to imbue her with our faith, for She has shown that it has paid off and returned to save us.
&quot;May the Heathens perish, and praise be those who suffer&quot;
