We heard these Amazonian brutes were sentencing men to death...by snu snu!  We just had to intervene.  We don&amp;#39;t worry about gender in Europeia and the Land of Kings and Emperors, just the size of our guns!  Our large, potent, powerful guns.

Anyone reading this is welcome to participate in the upcoming festival between the Land of Kings and Emperors and Europeia, taking place on Nov. 16-26th.  Check either forum for details.
