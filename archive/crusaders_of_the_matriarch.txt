In what can only be explained as a manifestation of the divine will of the Matriarch Herself, the hallowed ground coveted by Her Crusaders has begun to stir once more.

You are free to join Her region, and in it, She hopes you find peace, She hopes you find guidance, and She hopes you find stability.

[b]&quot;May the Heathens perish, and praise be those who suffer&quot;
