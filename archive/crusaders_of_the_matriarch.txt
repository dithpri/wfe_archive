We, as [region]Crusaders of the Matriarch[/region], have never been stronger than we are now as a collective and only our dedication has let us come to this point. We may have had troublesome times in the past, but we have emerged better as a region and live to FIGHT ANOTHER DAY!

The threat of terror is very real and approaches us relentlessly in an attempt to unseat our dominance as Crusaders. Will you be ready? Will you be ready to fight to defend our honour? To defend ourselves and others, when Fate deals us with uncertain times and circumstances to test our faith and loyalty to our Matriarch? I say, YES WE WILL!
