Nations for the Advancement of Science (NAS) is for nations committed to expansion of science.  Weather that be in development of arms (including nuclear), automobile industry and education.  Through science we can reach a better economy.

It is recommended, although not required, for countries residing in NAS to become WA members to increase our world influence.
It is also recommended to endorse others in the region so countries in NAS will be able to propose legislation.
