The Prometheus Isles is, as a collection of islands, characterized by independent decisions and choices. Each country is allowed an opinion, though the biggest decisions were originally made by the nations of Rowandel, Denfrunt (now defunct), and Monfrox, known simply as The Council. All leaders met on a man-made island that&amp;#39;s fairly centralized, called The Stretch, created by founder Rowandel.

Recently, much of the Isles has been scattered, with little more than cursory interactions between the nations within. Many believe that a war is stirring, and that the Stretch, though militarily insignificant, is now occupied by unknown forces.
