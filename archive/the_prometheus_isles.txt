The Prometheus Isles is a collective of nations who all run themselves how they see fit. Separated by expanses of sea, trade is mainly nautical. Piracy is rarely seen, since all nations have good militaries, but not unheard of.

This collection of islands is characterized by independent decisions and choices. Each country is allowed an opinion, though the biggest decisions are made by the nations of Rowandel, Denfrunt (now defunct), and Monfrox, known simply as The Council. All leaders meet on a man-made island that&amp;#39;s fairly centralized, called The Stretch, created by founder Rowandel.

Recently, much of the Isles has been scattered, with little more than cursory interactions between the nations within. Many believe that a war is stirring.
