The United Furry Socialist Republics is built by, dedicated to, and largely populated by none other than communist furries. 
We welcome all democratically run socialist states (furryism is not obligatory) as long as you support LGBT rights and keep your civil rights high. Member nations are allowed to resort to private sector and market solutions in order to develop their economy, as long as they are ultimately working to build socialism.
Members are also expected to adhere to regional treaties, that will be pinned below this entry, when answering issues and voting in the WA, risking ejection and possibly banishment otherwise.
