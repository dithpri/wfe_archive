Hello! Welcome to the [region]League of Greatness[/region]! Here we like to talk about history, science, politics, pop culture, or whatever else crosses the minds of our member-states. 

All member-states automatically become citizens with the right to vote and can run in any election they choose, though no one may hold more than one office unless there are fewer than fifteen member-states or the Constitution of the League specifies otherwise.

[i]See the Constitution of the [region]League of Greatness[/region] below for details on how the League is run, and contact the Dictator Perpetua ([nation]Magnus Regnium[/nation]) via telegram to run for office[/I]
