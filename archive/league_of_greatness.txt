Hello! Welcome to the [region]League of Greatness[/region]! Here we like to talk about history, science, politics, pop culture, or whatever else crosses the minds of our member states. Anyone is welcome until we reach around thirty nations, so join now or never.

All member states automatically become citizens with unrestricted access to the message board, the right to vote, and the right to run in any election they choose, though no one may hold more than one office unless there are fewer than fifteen member-states or the Constitution of the League specifies otherwise.
