[region]Trier[/region] is the fourth-largest city in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Once home to the Celtic tribe of the Treveri, the Roman Empire conquered the Treveri and established [i]Augusta Treverorum[/i] in 16 BCE. In the 4th century, Trier was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire. The Germanic Franks seized Trier from Roman administration in 459 AD.  In 870, it became part of East Francia, which developed into the Holy Roman Empire. It became part of the German Empire in 1871.
