The Allied Democratic Nations is a region dedicated to quality role playing and regional politics. 

All nations, what ever their ideology, are encouraged to join, create political parties and battle it out with other parties in order to gain more seats in the Regional Government. Nations are, also, encouraged to create, develop and advertise &amp;#39;RPs&amp;#39; within the region.

Finally, on a more relaxed note, all states are welcome to discuss various subjects on the regional message board.
