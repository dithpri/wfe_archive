The UADN was also founded with dictators in mind. In other regions the only &amp;#39;dictatorship&amp;#39; undertaken is the yearly beating of a few people. However, in this region all nations are encouraged to beat down their people every day. Feel that ten people is enough to beat? Then you can beat that many. Feel that another nation has beaten too many people in compared to you? Then why not up your game? 

This region offers the freedom to be evil and to beat up on the helpless. There will be competitive beating contests, with lots of screaming. There will be no elections and the only legislation is that you are the only true leader.
