Northwest Lykara is a relatively small region located at the northwestern coast of a politically dead continent.  It has mild summers and bitter winters, and is subject to long-lasting fog and drizzly rains during the summer, and sleet and snow flurries in the winter.  Its varied terrain includes pine forests, vast plains, hills, valleys, and small gorges and ditches created either naturally or by exploding mortar shells.
