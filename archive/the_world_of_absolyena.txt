I have made this role player region for fun and sumtimes boring rp&amp;#39;ing. me (deadlight) can help if u need instructions to roleplay. 
how to: 
** means to do a action, like this: *slaps deadlight* see? now im slaped! 
() or ooc, means &amp;quot;out of character.&amp;quot;

rules:
no godmodding...this means no, acting as if ur the strongest thing there is and u can destroy things in seconds...NOT HOW WE ROLL...PLAY. (lol)

K.I.A...This means u cant kill someone elses charicter without permission.

Censoring...u CAN talk dirty n stuff here, but u must have a slight censor, like: &amp;quot; ow my f#cking leg. &amp;quot;

(any other info needed, u tg me)
