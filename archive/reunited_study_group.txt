[color=green]We here in the [region]Reunited Study Group[/region] believe that any nation big or small, capitalist or communist, new or old and religious or godless has the right to enter the region[/color]

[color=blue]In the region we offer many oppotunities both in character and out of character to socialize, have fun and help out all at the same time. If you feeling like representing your own nation you can set up an RP on and off site forum, start a news network to let others know whats happening in your nation or even run for a position in parliament! If this isn&amp;#39;t your style feel free to have some causal conversations on our regional message board.

Below are a factbooks for the parliament, rules, media networks and the map![/color]
