The region of Aonghas is made up of rolling pasture lands, and shepherds tending to their flocks. Aonghas is governed by a series of ancient tribes, who attempt to maintain the peace by occasionally meeting. At the head of these tribes is the Confederacy of Culum, the most populous and largest economy in the region.
