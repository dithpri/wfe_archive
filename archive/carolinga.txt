[b]The [color=orange]Indian[/color] [color=grey]Armed[/color] [color=green]Forces[/color] have recaptured the region. This region is a former capital of [region]Genua[/region], a former fascist raider region that had disturbed India&#39;s peace. Now this is under India and this is our victory memorial. Our symbol of victory over Genua. This region was previously liberated from Genua&#39;s grip &amp; handed over to its true founder &amp; now that it ceased to exist for long, the Indian Government decided to retake this. If the owner is around &amp; wants it back, do contact [nation]Akhand Bharatam[/nation] or [nation]Indusse[/nation][/b]
