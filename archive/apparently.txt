This is my canvas
I&#39;ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I&#39;ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it *****
**** you &#39;cause there
There is no right or wrong
Only a song
I like to write alone
Be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I&#39;ve ever known
