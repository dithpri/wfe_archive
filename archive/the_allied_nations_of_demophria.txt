After breaking free of poverty in Eastern Africa in mid-2012, five nations formed a new land together. The nations were Stacramon, Colinistine, Jurania, Laerix, and Jalepille. All of these nations agreed to each become Constitutional Monarchies, and they named their new land, Jurania. Eventually, all of the nations except for Stacramon collapsed, and Stacramon came close. Stacramon claimed all of the lost land and gave citizenship to anyone in the land. Stacramon then founded all of the new land as the Allied Nations of Demophria, and they are giving away small pieces of land from Stacramon to anyone who joins. Corrupt governments are banned from the region.
