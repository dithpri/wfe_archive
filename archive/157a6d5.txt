An offshoot of a colonization project, the 157A6D5 Sigma was an experiment on the sociological principles driving people. After a simulated holocaust and genocide of the seed world, several nations began on the neighboring worlds, generally fearful and wary of each other. Within a few centuries, that had come to pass and they banded together for mutual safety from roaming bands of Space Marauders. Summarily, a task force, headed by Novi Iussus, wiped out the Space Marauders and a treaty was put into place. Novi Iussus retains executive power and authority over the other colonies due to a massive technological difference between its sister colonies and itself.
