The polar bears in the north are white and the polar bears in the south are... well, you know. I&#39;m not gonna say it. Black. They&#39;re black.

Fun Fact: The Polar Bears in the north and south are at constant war with another. The northern ones will send a nuke down on thursday, and it will arrive in the south on sunday.
