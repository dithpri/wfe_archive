Raise our slogan to the skies, We&amp;#39;ll dig their graves, and seize their lives, Proud we once lived, and proud we shall die, Our fighting, bleeding, 
shedding, and strife, Year after year, life after life, It will all end here, in this very night, We won&amp;#39;t take this oppression no more, 
We won&amp;#39;t kneel or bow any more, I know it&amp;#39;s hopeless, and I can see in you, The fear that we won&amp;#39;t make it through, But I rather die, 
tall and brave, Than living a decade as a petty slave

Together let&amp;#39;s march, 
Into our final charge.
