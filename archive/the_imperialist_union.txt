[b][i]I have made the decision to Merge with [region=The Great Conservative Alliance]. As you are citizens you should know ahead. You may stay here after the merge, but I will be leaving and will strongly encourage the nations to follow me. The inactivity problem is severe, while we have stopped growing no matter if we have the auto telegram on or off. This my position and I cannot be swayed. I thank you all for your loyal support in this journey and I hope you will join me to continue it in the GCA.[/i][/b]
