[color=red]HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE REGION OF MANCHESTER MIDDLE![/color]

Now, of course, Germany does not approve of the name, Manchester Middle.

[color=blue]We are a small nation, I mean, union, I mean, World War ridden, I MEAN, Region where everyone is free to do what they like, unless, stated in our constitution.[/color]

The Constitution can be seen [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=694149]Here[/url]
