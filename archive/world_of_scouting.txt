Welcome to the wonderful world of Scouting!

This is a region dedicated to all the things which make scouting great. If you&amp;#39;re an enthusiast like me, or just curious - be welcome!

Feel free to debate and share experiences here. 

[b]Hands wanted:[/b]
[i]Recruitment, setting up an off-site forum, resource management, and more.[/i]

[i]More construction coming soon. Want to help out setting this region up? Feel free to contact me: [nation=short]Lord Baden Powell[/nation]. If I&amp;#39;m not replying soon enough, you can try my main nation: [nation=short]Arcomo[/nation]. This region is set up by a Dutch scout and, considering our liberal ways, this region will not discriminate against any scout.[/i]
