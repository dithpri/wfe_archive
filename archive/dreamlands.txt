The Dreamlands are a safe haven for those who&amp;#39;ve lost their way and those who&amp;#39;ve never really found their way to begin with. If you&amp;#39;ve found us at all, there&amp;#39;s a good change you belong here.

Our founder will halt all invasions and expel those who come here to cause trouble. We are not concerned with size or with growing. We are concerned with the serenity and happiness of those who call the Dreamlands home.
