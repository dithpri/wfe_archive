[color=#003399][b]NWO - New Worlds Order[/b][/color]

The New Worlds Order was not born from peace, but from betrayal and defiance.
Years ago, an elite military unit broke away from the central command of the Old World. Tired of endless wars and the corruption of failing governments, they refused to obey orders that only served the powerful. Instead, they swore to create a new order one built on strength, discipline, and loyalty.

Led by high ranking commanders and hardened strategists, they established a new bastion: the New Worlds Order. Here, chaos and weakness are cast aside. Every nation that joins becomes part of an army that has turned into a nation itself.
