Hello, this is the founder of the PLAINS OF THE FORGOTTEN. This is a brand new region that we really need to get up and coming cause well being forgotten kinda sucks. We have a good economy and most political freedoms. Any ways were trying to get this nation just as good as the older ones but it might take a while. We&amp;#39;re starting to come along slowly but were coming. 

And no raiding. And no recruiting from here! 
Have a great day. :)
