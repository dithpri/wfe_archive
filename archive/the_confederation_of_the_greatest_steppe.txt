The Greatest Steppe is the world&#146;s largest steppe ecoregion, a vast stretch of land filled with savannahs, temperate grasslands, and shrublands chopped up by a vast array of rivers that flow south from the icy, Northern Mountains. The land is surrounded by mountains which have historically isolated the land from greater nations, and prior to industrialization the land was inhabited by number of tribes and nomads. From the 14th century to the 19th century, various nations have tried and failed to conquer the steppe for its prehistoric coal deposit, oil fields, and both necessary and precious metals. Alliances with the outside world later allowed the steppe to modernize up until the present day.
