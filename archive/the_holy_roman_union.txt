The [b][region]Holy Roman Union[/region][/b], a union that is founded by our great liege Ordo Teutonicus, but ruled by all. 
We strive to live secure under the banner of the Union, united even though we have differences in ideology and culture.
Like most unions, they start out small. We don&amp;#39;t hope to become the largest and greatest union of them all.
But growth is one thing we are thinking about. And we&amp;#39;re not only talking about power growth. 
What we also want is to grow as a community.

So what are you waiting for?
Come join our community today!
