[color=#ff69b4]Nim had the NPA go out on timed run to see just how fast they could go! They would have beaten the Zoom King Rom&#39;s previous record, but Bluie forgot to tie his shoelaces and tripped before crossing the finish line. Alas, we will never know just how fast we could have been. [i]Pray to the R/D gods and hope they are merciful.[/i]
