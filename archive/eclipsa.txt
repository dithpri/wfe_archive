Our history books tell of an ancient war between the Eclipsians and another race, the Luxastrians, that plunged the nation into darkness.

After decades of strife, the Great War finally ended when the Eclipsians created their greatest weapon: the Darkstar.

With the Darkstar at their disposal, the Eclipsians wiped out the Luxastrian Empire.

Centuries have passed since the Great War.

The Dominion of Eclipsus now stands proud beneath the firm hand of the mighty Governess Ravencroft.
