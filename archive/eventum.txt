The [color=green]Empire of Eventum[/color], land of Hammerism and (slightly) free people. The various governments within the Empire are free to do as they please, so long as Hammerism and the Hammergod are respected. 

The Hammer Temple is the capital in reality, but in practice does not exercise the authority and politics decide those with true power in the Empire. The immortal Demigod ruler and Emperor until death (the immortal part makes the &amp;#39;until death&amp;#39; part slightly pointless) ensures all parts of the Empire respect the Hammergod, to a minimum level, as is the one and only requirement across all parts of the Empire.
