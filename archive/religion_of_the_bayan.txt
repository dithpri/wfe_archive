The religion of the Bay&amp;#257;n is the latest divine revelation and the fulfilment of Islamic prophecy (Qur&#146;&amp;#257;n 32:5). Its commencement was at two hours and eleven minutes past midnight of the 23rd of May 1844, precisely 1000 years from the Islamic year 260 AH (anno hegira) when the last (and twelfth) Im&amp;#257;m (upon Him be peace) went into occultation.

The Bay&amp;#257;ni faith heralds the completion of the Islamic cycle and the birth of a new, but more progressive,
divine cycle. The teachings of Bay&amp;#257;n are revealed by its Founder, Seyyid Ali-Muhammad, a Persian merchant of Shiraz whose title is The Primal Point.
