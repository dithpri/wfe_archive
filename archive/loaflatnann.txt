Loaflatnann is region that consists of all the nations that are in the Great Loaf King&#39;s sphere of influence. 
If a nation is in the Loaf King&#39;s sphere of influence but does not wish to leave their current region, they can create a puppet nation to act as a state to represent them in the Loaflantann chat/community. 
If you are wondering what/who The Great Loaf King is, he is a great monarch in full control of the reasonably large state of Loaftona, in the large nation Insia, and has certainly made an impact on Insia. He is the greatest monarch in Insonarian history, and many in Insia worship him in all his glory.
