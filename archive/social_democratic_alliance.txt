[color=red][b]Hello[/b], and welcome to the Social Democratic Alliance! We&#39;re a new, laid back region of social democrats, trade unionists, reformists, social liberals, and generally centre left nations! Regardless, all nations are free to join, so long as they have adequate civil rights and political freedoms.[/color]

[b][color=green]We value Democracy, Liberty, and Equality, and work hard to incorporate these three values into the region.[/b][/color]
