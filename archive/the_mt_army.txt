[hr][color=red][b]Providing Anti-Nazi/Fascist Community Service Since [/color][color=green]June 22nd, 2003.[/b][/color][hr]

[color=purple]In 1940, The [region]Mariner Trench[/region] (MT) Army arose from the deepest place on planet Earth to find a world in peril, full of hate, oppression and intolerance.

The diverse, multicultural and truly free people of MT voluntarily dedicated themselves to become mighty warriors, fighting against those who promote hatred such as Nazis, Fascists and Dictators, whilst  protecting Democracy, Equality, Liberty and Freedom throughout NationStates.

Known as the godfathers of Anti-Nazi/Fascism military action on NationStates, our collection of Museums against hate, is one of the most extensive in the game.[/color]
