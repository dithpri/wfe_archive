Tyria, northern most continent in the known world, saw it&amp;#39;s inhabitants arrive from the rift some 3000 years ago. 

Modern Tyria consists of The Kingdom of Kryta (currently under new &amp;quot;management&amp;quot;), The Kingdom of Ascalon (currently under urban renewal due to hostility from the northern feline race, the Charr), and once upon a time, The Kingdom of Orr (blown to tiny bits and sunk by a goatee sporting mage and his big stick). And finally, laying beneath the continent proper, dwells the Asura, a race of vicious, wise-cracking mutant rabbits.
