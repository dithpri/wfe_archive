The planet Savannia was colonized when humans left earth in 2150 AD earth year, and took over 10,000 years to get to the planet while the humans were put into hibernation machines that frozen their body during the time period. Our brains were affected and took a toll on our technology, setting us back to the Stone Age but on the new planet, and it took more than 2300 Earth years(2100 savann years) since the landings to take us to the technology of earth year 2010-2020 AD
