[i]Welcome Home![/i][/color]

There is infinite Time here. We live on the edge of all possible.
We have no Rules other than Death.
True Anarchy.
As Nature intended.

Humanity will either adapt or cease, your Tolerance of other stupidity won&#39;t save anything.

The Kommissar will guide us though the Void.
Why him?
Because he is the only one left.

Now, what remains to say?
Well, I don&#39;t know.
