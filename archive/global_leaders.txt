Hello bois!

This server is entirely role play, for those belonging to NPMS. It is modern to semi postmodern, basically set to 2075. So therefore, no space extended past Mars will be available. Every week there will be a summit held in a country that rotates every week. There, we will peacefully talk about events and issues. Rules really boil down to no racism/homophobia etc and be respectful. No godmodding or trying to dictate a fight. Whatever the Gamemaster says goes.
