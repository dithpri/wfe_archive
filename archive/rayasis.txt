Rayasis is a small trio of unified factions residing on the planet of the same name. [nation]Shira[/nation]&#39;s people were the first inhabitants, but due to their reclusiveness, [nation]Iteka[/nation] took it upon themselves to oversee the other two factions and ensure the bond between them. [nation]Archusa[/nation] shares a strong political bond with Iteka but refrains from taking office among them, more concerned with their own affairs.

If you wish to join Rayasis, please TG [nation]Shira[/nation].
