[b]Colombia, officially the [region]Republic of Colombia[/region], is a sovereign state largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru

Settled by the Spanish in 1530&#39;s, the area gained its independence from Spain in 1821 under the leadership of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, but the modern state of Colombia did not emerge until after Venezuela and Ecuador (1830) and later Panama (1903) had become separate nations. Bogot&aacute; is the capital and the largest city.
