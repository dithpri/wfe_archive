Looking back I see a million little things that wrecked us
She never liked my pick up truck parked up beside her Lexus
And I never wore them khaki&#39;s like she asked me
Just trashy old blue jeans, old skoal ring
She packed up her Chanel, said &quot;go to hell&quot;, taught me a lesson
And now as far as she&#39;s concerned I&#39;m in a deep and dark depression
But it&#39;s happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
&#39;Cause my good buddy went and hooked me up with some willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain&#39;t supposed to be fun
But I&#39;m here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah
And I know she&#39;ll hear about my &#39;paint the town red&#39; gallivanting
And she&#39;ll&#133;
