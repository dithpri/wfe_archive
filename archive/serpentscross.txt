Started by a single country that split from a country because of lack of common understanding of politics although the Region itself was supposed to be a politically smart Region. Too long had the Region spouted lines of  and yet had an Emperor. In time the possibilities grew fainter and the idea of an improvable situation died. So the country left and wandered about. For some time it flitted from Region to Region but eventually settled for a Region. A region of its own.
