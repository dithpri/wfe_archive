hello Nation founder.
we have a couple of rules to follow.
1) no spamming
2) avoid EXCESSIVE CAPS LOCKS, [b]bold text[/b], and [u]underlining[/u] 
3) this is a dictatorship so voting will be a rarity (and a lot of those will be overruled)
4) i don&#39;t want no goody-to-shoes (as you can see) i encourage bad treatment but good military and economy
5) have fun make memes and no small talk
6) communism rules! (that means no food)
you will learn more as you go, so get out there and help us EXPAND!
