[color=pink][b]Welcome to Saalen! An active roleplaying region where all are welcome regardless of your age, sexuality, or beliefs![/color][/b]

[color=red][b]Saalen was founded after Savandaa drifted from region to region looking for a good home, but to no avail. The goal of Saalen is to build an active roleplaying community, built on debate, respect, creativity, and individualism. It is our mission to ensure all are treated equally here.[/color][/b]
