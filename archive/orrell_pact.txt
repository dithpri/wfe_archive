The Wiganese Islands has left the WA. Others have also left the WA. If these nations unite together, they can create an alliance stronger than the World Assembly. By raiding small, weak regions, we gain a little bit of power. By raiding powerful, influential regions, we gain a lot of power. Join us on our mission to unite all non-WA members. Orrell Pact shall be superior.
