Welcome, fellow Star Fleet Officer, to Deep Space 13, the first Federation outpost in the Delta Quadrant! 
The year is 2380, and, two years after the return of the USS Voyager from its seven year journey home, Star Fleet has sent Rear-Admiral T&#39;Espera Satine to assume command of Deep Space 13. 
She, and her handpicked crew, will face the dangers of the wild Delta Quadrant, and the challenges of becoming the first permanent Federation presence there.
