We are the Alliance For Social Democracy. We are a alliance of 8 sovereign countries that can make their own laws, have their own military, and leave the Alliance For Social Democracy if they want. We have 3 branches of government: The International Congress, The Counsel Of Presidents, and The Army For Democracy. Our ideology is Democratic, Anti Fascist, Liberal, and occasionally Socialist (but never Communist).
We work for Civil Rights for the whole world.
