Formed in 1986, the Marrian Union is an alliance between the Marrian nations: Areya, Malamada, Turlondo and Alosro. The union was formed in the hope of stopping further conflicts following the fall of Ricaria. The Marrian Parliament is situated on Claudos Island, which is jointly owned by all four nations and only inhabited by the Members of the Marrian Parliament. The currency is the Marrian Crown, formerly the Areyan Crown. The official language is Areyan.
