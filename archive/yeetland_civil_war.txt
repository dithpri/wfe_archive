Welcome. This region is rather dangerous. Why? Have you not heard the events? There are unexploded land mines everywhere, trench warfare, not very good. You see, Yeetland has been in a brutal 24 year civil war, with various factions taking parts of the country. Here, I don&#146;t have much time here, but You can be any faction you want at this point. We allow all factions here, just don&#146;t be a Nazi, as you&#146;ll make yourself a target. I&#146;m just trying to help everyone out here. Who knows, maybe you&#146;ll get stronger, this land has lots of resources, especially oil. Well here come the tanks, so we should get going.
