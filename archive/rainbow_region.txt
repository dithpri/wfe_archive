EVERYONE is loved and accepted with very few standards. founders and regional officers have the responsibility of having open arms to nations in need, real world problems, and NS concerns. stay lovely and keep and open eyes for our requirements! (listed in factbook) , along with a founder&#39;s bio, so you can get to know me a bit easier :)


there are many fun things to talk about in the rainbow region, such as bands, (mcr, fob, p!&amp;#64;td), anime, books, and many other topics.[/color]
