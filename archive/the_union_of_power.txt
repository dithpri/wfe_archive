Welcome to the Union of Power: aspiring leaders, powerful people.

Remember our motto: &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s easier to succeed if the faces of the downtrodden give you a stepping stone!&amp;quot;

The quickest way to power is through a dictatorship, through absolute control.

Remember, Friday is Youth Night!
