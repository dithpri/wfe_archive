[b][i]Welcome to the Swamp of Souls, heroes![/b][/i]

This eerie bog is where the souls of many departed people have come to rest and is the true source of the songs behind The Singing Rocks visited earlier. [nation=short]Barnaby Screwloose[/nation] has come here to attempt to capture a soul which will be required for some strange new invention of his to function properly. The eccentric young Rabbit insists the soul will not be harmed in any way, however.

Regardless of the moral quandary, whichever Clan scores the most points here will help Barnaby capture a soul and claim this region in the process!
