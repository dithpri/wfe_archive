A inter-regional alliance for those who share the monastic values of piety, moderation, thoughtfulness, and service. Members seek to foster these virtues among their populaces as well as to preserve and grow the traditional monastic communities within their lands. All members are considered brothers and sisters under God, and must treat each other as such.
