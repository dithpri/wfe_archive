[b]The ancapistan is a region where everything is permitted, the only &quot;law&quot; is not breaking the NAP. You can have your nation with any law you want, you just can&#39;t impose other people to live at your nation, if your people agree with you and stay at your nation, then it&#39;s fine.[/b]
