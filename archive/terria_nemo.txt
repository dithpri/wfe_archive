Trade capital of the far west. A medium dwarven Island that runs on the volcano that the city was built on top of. The way power is made is there are 12 flood gates and each open when the city power grows to low or the volcano becomes to active. This releases tremendous power from the steam. Which shoots up the the volcano and spinning tribines that are hundreds of feet above the magma. This area in the world is home to dwarves elvish some humans and many more.
