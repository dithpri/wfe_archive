[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to have a driving lesson in your region! It was a perfectly normal lesson, apart from the fact that we were driving with cotton candy for wheels!

The idea was told to us by our resident custom experts, who explained that [color=pink]cotton candy wheels[/color] made vehicles look friendly and more likely to get into your region.

If you would like to join us on our next cotton candy drive, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
