The Union of Broviet Brocialist Republics is an organization of Socialist, Communist, and Welfare-Oriented states devoted towards the well-being and advancement of the human race.  We are strong supporters of science and video games.  Our citizens dream of subsisting off of Pizza, Doritos, and Mountain Dew.  &quot;Dank Memes&quot; are considered a form of high art within our borders.
