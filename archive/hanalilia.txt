Hanalilia: A continental landmass, isolated from other continents but not impossible to reach. The nations of Hanalilia have great similarities but even greater differences, leading to a long and vibrant tradition of diplomacy, cultural exchange, and freedom of movement. Unless you&#39;re unfortunate enough to have been born in one of the more authoritarian states. Then you&#39;re out of luck.

The region is open to construction of embassies as a symbol of mutual goodwill.
