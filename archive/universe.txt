The observable universe contains an estimated 2 trillion galaxies. The number of galaxies could be even higher if other universes exist. 

The Hubble Space Telescope and other telescopes have helped astronomers observe galaxies.
Estimates of the number of planets in the universe are based on assumptions, and the actual number could be much higher or lower. 
The number of planets in the universe depends on the number of galaxies and the number of planets per galaxy. 
The number of planets in the universe also depends on how many stars have planets, and whether some planets are free-floating.
