Hi,
Why don&amp;#39;t youu join my region. It has a very strong economy, superb political freedoms and only few civil rights. I would like to have anyone who has a kingdom, empire, free land or anyone who is not a republic, liberterian or anything like that. So will you join my region and live a normal life or will choose another region, it&amp;#39;s up to you. 
P.S. And remember no republicans or anything like that.
Yours sincerly,
Ratbag (kingdom of Ratland)
