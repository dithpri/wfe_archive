Welcome to Haganoki! 

Prussia has replaced Astaritin (who now does not exist) as Regional co-leader, as appointed by New Timmsland. 

Founder &amp;amp; Leader: New Timmsland
Co-Founder &amp;amp; Secondary Leader: The Feared Country of The Republic of Prussia
The WA Delegate is non existant, as Bob&amp;#39;s Land of Amazingness is the only WA Member in the region.
If there is ever a WA Delegate, they are barred from regional control.
Prussia and New Timmsland hold administrative powers.
