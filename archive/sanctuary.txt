[b]Welcome to Sanctuary,[/b] [color=Darkred]founded on January 1st 2012. We are an open community free from all the typical bull that comes with saying we are an open community. Hang around, talk or don&amp;#39;t talk. We really don&amp;#39;t care what you want to do and we don&amp;#39;t plan on forcing you to do anything. So just chill out, look around, and get to know some of your region mates if you want.[/color][hr][b]Here in Sanctuary,[/b][color=Darkred] if you would like to be a part of the regional government, check out some links below. The bases of it have been set up, but at this point we can pretty much do whatever we want with it. You just have to type it out. [/color]
