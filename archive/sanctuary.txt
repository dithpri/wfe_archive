[b]Welcome to Sanctuary[/b], [color=#2554C7]founded on January 1st 2012. We are an open community free from all the typical bull that comes with saying we are an open community. Hang around, talk or don&amp;#39;t talk. We really don&amp;#39;t care what you want to do and we don&amp;#39;t plan on forcing you to do anything. So just chill out, look around, and get to know some of your region mates if you want.[/color][hr][hr]
