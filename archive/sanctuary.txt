[b][color=green]Welcome to the Conquered Region of Sanctuary![/color][/b]

[hr]

[b][i]This region has been invaded by the lovable rogues from [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] as retaliation for your founder, [nation=short]Osycia[/nation], trying to recruit several of our members directly from our region. That was very silly of him.

Let this be a lesson to all, if you recruit from a raider region, you gonna get raided.[/i][/b]

Special thanks to [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] for the pleasure of their company on this raid.[/b]
