[color=navy][b][u]FOUNDED: March 22nd, 2015 AD[/b][/u][/color]
[hr][color=green][i]Welcome to The Federation of Altador. We are a region unlike most others; we are truly free. There is no regional government, no complex laws and procedures that you must follow. All nations within TFA are fully sovereign and independent from internal and external forces. We only have 4 simple laws in order to maintain balance. We recognize that in order for their to be true freedom, central power must be limited as much as possible. We accept nations of all ideologies; we only request that you have respect for others and yourself.[/i][/color][hr][color=navy][b]We govern ourselves.
We protect ourselves.
We help ourselves.
We are ourselves.[/b][/color]
[hr][color=green][u]We await your arrival[/color][/u]
