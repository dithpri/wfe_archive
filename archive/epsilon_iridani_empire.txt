a colony attempt by the Orion Stellar Alliance was forgotten due to it being a Generational fleet, upon entering the Epsilon Iridani system the ship was attacked by a group of pirates claiming to be from the OSA and demanding payment, this was not received well and the pirates and their ships were captured, over the last 30 or so years the colony has been struggling to form but is now a local system power with slow FTL drives and it plans to take it&amp;#39;s revenge on the OSA and take over the nearby systems within it&amp;#39;s reach.
