To those who find the opportunity to create an embassy into this place just so they can advertise themselves or &#39;take over&#39; can kindly leave immediately. I have a life and I can not always be on gateguarding this world. 

All those who have taken over are banned. No exceptions.

Nations that wish to join and are interested in this region filling that space to the left side, uninterested in roleplay, and are here just to play a game and see what kind of leader you would be, are welcome. This is my last and only entry.
