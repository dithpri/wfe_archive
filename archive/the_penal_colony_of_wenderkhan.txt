This region is not like most others. We do not open our doors to anyone willingly. We are not a place to which you should desire to come.

This is a prison. Here, other than our founder, we keep only those nations that have committed a crime, that have disobeyed the laws of their region. And even those are limited. We take only those from the region of [region]Dalrawduel[/region], of which we are a province.

So come not to this place. Seek not to dwell here. You shall not enjoy your life in this region if you do.
