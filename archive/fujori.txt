[b][color=#800020]Fujori. Absurdity. The natural state of the human condition welcomes you![/color][/b]

Fujori is a small continent divided by the Straits of Sisyphus, Vesuvius, and the Vesuvian Sea; the subcontinents of Camus and Soren are home to a patchwork of peoples and ways of life. The International City of Fujori is a free territory in which people interact freely, their various nations milling about as each one pleases.

Light/casual RP oriented, though modern-tech and realism enforced.
