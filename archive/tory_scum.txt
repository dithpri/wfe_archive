This region is political satire, it is meant to show the arrogance and negligence of the UK Conservative Party. They have destroyed the UK Economy and plunged over 20 million Brits into poverty thanks to the cost of living crisis.

They have privatised every public service making them all not function and extremely expensive and inefficient.

The NHS budget has been gouged throughout the 14 years of Conservative rule.
