In 1924, World War I rages on, a never-ending nightmare of mud and blood. The trenches are vast, grim scars on a ravaged land. Soldiers, gaunt and hollow-eyed, move like phantoms through a landscape of crumbling ruins and barbed wire. The once-bustling cities are ghost towns, their streets choked with decay and despair. Resources are exhausted, and hope has become a distant memory. Governments, driven by desperation, perpetuate the war with a ruthless zeal. The world has become a bleak tableau of suffering, where the fight for survival eclipses any thought of peace.

Welcome to 1924 dust and ash have fun be nice.
