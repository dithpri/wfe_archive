Joining the game again after 18 years away. Ahh, the memories&#133;

Neo-Mattatonn, one of the first official back ups to the original Mattatonn, has been resurrected. 

We decided to bring back the original core of the original Empire of Power. We made some good memories in our teenage years, but now in our 30s, we just want to chill. Kind of. 

While we maintain this place for nostalgia, we&#146;ve moved the Empire of Power to other game servers to terrorize its players, namely No Man Sky and GTA V.
