Scald is two worlds in one; deep sweltering basins in which water should boil but doesn&#39;t, and the dusty highlands that civilisation calls home. It&#39;s a hot, thirsty world with hardy people. Despite all of the natural challenges it presents, humanity has not just survived - it&#39;s thrived!  From the plateaus, high gullies, lakes and ranges of Scald have risen a plethora of cultures and nations to which teeming millions belong.
