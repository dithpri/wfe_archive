The Big Tree towers over the slavery of the enslaved workers who built it.

A city of greed and suffering among shiny glass.

Whose Emir imprisons poets for mentioning him in verse.

[i]&amp;quot;When the biggest, richest, glassiest buildings in town are the banks, you know that town&amp;#39;s in trouble.&amp;quot;[/i]
-- Edward Abbey

May peace be upon you.
