The Crimson Crownlands are the sacred heart of Valedratharis &#151; known reverently as Valedratharis&#146; Cor. Here, crimson-hued plains and blood-veined marble citadels embody the lifeblood of the Dominion. Rivers shimmer red beneath the sun, and every oath sworn is bound in blood and loyalty. To live within these lands is to dwell at the nation&#146;s pulse &#151; where every vein flows to the Crown, and the Crown sustains all.
