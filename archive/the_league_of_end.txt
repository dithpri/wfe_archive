The early years of American history were devoted to basic survival, as the English colonists endeavored to live in the swampy,  disease-ridden Virginia colony and in the frigid, inhospitable New England colonies.  The European explorers and colonists had no idea what to expect when they reached the &#147;New   World,&#148; and the very first colonists found they were ultimately unprepared for the adventure.  Perhaps one of the biggest surprises was the fact that they were not alone &#150; in fact,  civilizations had risen, flourished, and vanished for more than 10,000 years on the North American continent.
