The semi-official nationstates region for Aethier players.

Rules:
1.) Keep the vibes positive, or something.
2.) Don&amp;#39;t overdose on dank memes, overdosing on dank memes is illegal.
3.) If folk want to RP politics, don&amp;#39;t interrupt their politics RP, I guess.
4.) Don&amp;#39;t pressure me to make better rules.
5.) I can rewrite these rules at any time.

I guess region info will come soon?
Right now I guess everyone&amp;#39;s just vastly conflicting and staring aggressively at each other, or something.
