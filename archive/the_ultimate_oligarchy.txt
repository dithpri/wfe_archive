The Oligarchy is governed by The Ten, a group of scholars who prize knowledge above all. While the values of each differ to appoint, their agreement on matters is key to the Oligarchy&#39;s survival.

Members of The Ten: Kore of Kato Kosmos, The Ocean man of Red Rock Mountain, and The Ginger Jesus of Memicus Dankus.
