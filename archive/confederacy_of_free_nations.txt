We are a confederacy of nations looking to preserve our own national and cultural identities at any and all costs. Member nations are tied by a joint defense and trade agreement. Each nation plays a pivotal role in the structure and mechanics of the running&#39;s of our alliance. Our ideologies are oriented toward social and economic freedoms. The main economic priorities of the CFN are in defense, education, spirituality, welfare and law and order.
