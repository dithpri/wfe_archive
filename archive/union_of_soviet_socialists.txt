The soviet union consists of europe, the northern half of asia, china, and japan. We are still trying to conquer America, canada, and mexico. Then we will make out way to south america. Here if you are lazy you either are sent to prison or siberia. Citizens are paid 4 Rubles an hour (0.12 American cents) no matter what you work as. You are allowed to have multiple jobs but you must go to the Czars mansion and ask for one. 
The laws: 
1: the youth must spend one tour in the military.  
2: there are no civil rights
3: no political freedoms
4: as long as you work you will eat. 
5: discrimination is prohibited

Just follow these rules and everything will be fine. And remember we might be watching you ^.^
