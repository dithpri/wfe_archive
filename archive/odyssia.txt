[color=lime]Here you can:[/color]

[color=pink]1. Run for Regional Government. You don&#39;t even need to be a citizen. Everyone is a citizen!!! All we need is a telegram explaining what you want to be!!![/color]

[color=violet]2. Meet people. Everyone has (or should have) a story. You can talk and make friends wherever you like or stay solo, it really doesn&#39;t matter.[/color]

[color=turquoise]3. Trade. Increase relations with other countries and help us get known. All you need is permission from one of the big guys.[/color]

[color=lime]So I hope you enjoy your stay, and, well done for coming!!![/color]
