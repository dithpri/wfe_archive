Welcome to THEMISCYRA, the native country of the legendary AMAZONS!
[hr]A rich and beautiful district, ever verdant, and supplying food for numberless herds of oxen and horses. 
The plain also produces a great abundance of grain, and the southern parts near the mountains furnishes a variety of fruits, 
such as grapes, apples, pears, and nuts in such quantities that they are suffered to waste on the trees.
[hr]The fertility and excellence of the countryside makes the region a natural location 
for travelers, immigrants, refugees, rogues, and all manner of creatures.

Therefore, this region will accept all EMBASSY requests and may propose one with any region. 
Casual. Game Player. Multi-species. Puppet storage. Recruiter friendly. World Assembly.
