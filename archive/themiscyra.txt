[color=#FF69B4]Welcome to THEMISCYRA, the native country of the legendary AMAZONS![hr]
[i]A rich and beautiful district, ever verdant, and supplying food for numberless herds of oxen and horses. 
The plain also produces a great abundance of grain, and the southern parts near the mountains furnishes a variety of fruits, 
such as grapes, apples, pears, and nuts in such quantities that they are suffered to waste on the trees.[/i][hr]
The fertility and excellence of the countryside makes the region a natural location 
for travelers, immigrants, refugees, rogues, and all manner of creatures.

Therefore, this region will accept all EMBASSY requests and will create EMBASSIES with any region.
