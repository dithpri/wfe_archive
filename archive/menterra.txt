Menterra was founded by [nation]Tatsoka[/nation]. Its original use was to find a cure for the zombies as soon as possible. When other countries joined, the Union for Studying Anthropology (USA for short) was temporarily founded. It was a huge success. All zombies were cured and not a single person died because of this apocalypse.
After the apocalypse, USA disbanded, but most nations remained in Menterra.
Menterra became a place for cooperation. Menterra exists now to ensure safety and economical stability.
The official bank of Menterra is located in [nation]Vyrantorum[/nation], the official army of Menterra is lead by [nation]Doketa[/nation], and the official Research Facility is directed by [nation]Pyruvate_Kinase[/nation].
