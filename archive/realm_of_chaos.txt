The Realm of Chaos, a place of dreams and nightmares, where effect need not follow cause; within its bounds anything is possible. Here there are no physical laws akin to those that dominate the mortal world. Within its confines hopes and fears become real, and reality is reborn as fevered hallucination. Gravity, shape, space and reason &#151; all are in flux and utterly mutable.
