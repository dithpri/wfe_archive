Welcome to Lewisham!It was a small village until the development of passenger railways in the 19th century.

It is most likely to have been founded by a pagan Jute, Leof, who settled (by burning his boat) near St Mary&#39;s Church (Ladywell) where the ground was drier, in the 6th century. As to the etymology of the name, Daniel Lysons (1796) wrote:

&quot;In the most ancient Saxon records this place is called Levesham, that is, the house among the meadows; leswe, l&aelig;s, l&aelig;se, or l&aelig;sew, in the Saxon, signifies a meadow, and ham, a dwelling. A Latin legal record, dated 1440, mentions a place in Kent as Levesham which may refer to Lewisham.It is now written, as well in parochial and other records as in common usage, Lewisham.
