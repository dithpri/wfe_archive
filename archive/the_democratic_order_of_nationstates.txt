DONS is a Region in which ALL Nations involved take pride in and are privledged to hold basic Political and Civil Freedoms. 

The Goal of DONS is to spread Freedoms and Rights to other Nations as well as other Regions. DONS also seeks to maintain all and any form of Democracy. If any Nation both in or out of DONS is being threatened by Non-Democratic Forces, We wont hesitate to take action. Participating Nations are encouraged to help fight and defend these Nations and in return will be provided the same service. 

Nations are also encoraged to join the WA but are not required. 

DONS accepts Non-Democratic Nations and in doing so will be helped in establishing a Free Land.
