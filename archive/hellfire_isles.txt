What if I told you there was a place that you could oppress the weak minded, treat them as you please, and become a god.

Of course, you wouldn&amp;#39;t believe me, because people are too narrow minded to imagine the truth, and only believe what they see and understand.

Now, what if I told you this was all true, would you believe, take a chance, and become what you desire? You can only find that out if you were to go to such a place, and that is what I am offering, join me in the Hellfire Isles, and become a nation above all others.
