The Region of Cometfall is a crater shaped land mass formed when a stray comet struck our planet many years ago. It is an isolated region surrounded by snowy mountains and icy winds. Inland, however, are large grassy plateaus and ranges with supple lands. Cool dry summers and snowy wet winters are expected here. Further down is the crater valley. The largest of the region&#39;s land mass and desert like due to the mountains surrounding it on all sides. Hot dry summers and warm winters are common here. In the center of the crater rests the Principality of Comithrus. A bustling, green city, built upon the ancient landing spot of the comet that formed this very land, which can be seen in the Comithron Royal Museum.
