The Apex Imperium is a multiversal empire that is extremely militaristic and imperialistic. It was formed from all the humans that migrated to Knossenion with Godslayer Dylan. Its goals are to become the most powerful empire in existence and conquer the Multiverse. Apexes aren&#39;t too fond of non-humans. Peaceful non-humans are forced to become vassals but are rewarded for co-operation, and the more hostile non-humans are slaughtered. Any humans that oppose the Apex Imperium&#39;s ways are accused of impeding mankind&#39;s ascent to greatness, branded as traitors, then either publicly executed or thrown into a labor camp, and everybody close to them will be closely watched by the Apex Polizei.
