The Apex Imperium is a multidimensional empire that is extremely militaristic and imperialistic. Its goal is to become the most powerful empire in existence. While non-humans are generally distrusted because they are seen as unpredictable threats, that doesn&#39;t mean the Apex Imperium isn&#39;t willing to try and make non-human allies. The Apex Imperium will [b]always[/b] try to make allies whenever possible. 

When it comes to war, the Apex Imperium will only attack first if they&#39;re dealing with something that poses a serious threat to either themselves or the multiverse. However, they won&#39;t hesitate to kick someone&#39;s ass if they&#39;re provoked.
