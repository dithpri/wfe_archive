The Apex Imperium is a multidimensional empire that is extremely militaristic and imperialistic. Its goals are to become the most powerful empire in existence and make humanity the dominant species. The xenophobia exhibited by its people is something to behold. Peaceful non-humans are thrown into labor camps and sterilized, and the ones that fight back are slaughtered. Only primitive non-humans are spared since they are not capable of posing a significant threat. Any humans that oppose the Apex Imperium&#39;s ways are accused of impeding mankind&#39;s ascent to greatness, and then executed, and everybody that has ever even spoken to them can expect to be closely watched by the Apex Polizei.
