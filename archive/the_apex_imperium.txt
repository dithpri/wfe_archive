The Apex Imperium is a multidimensional empire that is extremely militaristic and imperialistic in nature. It seeks to claim as much territory as possible and become the dominant superpower. Allies of the Apex Imperium are allowed to operate independently until they prove they are incapable of supporting themselves. It is very cautious towards new empires until the new empire in question proves they are trustworthy. Enemies of the Apex Imperium are referred to as vermin. Anybody who threatens the Apex Imperium or its allies will face possible extinction.

Ponies are the worst vermin of all, and are forbidden from ever being a part of the Apex Imperium!
