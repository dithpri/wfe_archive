The Apex Imperium is a multidimensional empire that is extremely militaristic and imperialistic. Its goals are to become the most powerful empire in existence and prevent the assimilation of all life. While non-humans are generally distrusted because they are seen as unpredictable threats, that doesn&#39;t mean the Apex Imperium isn&#39;t willing to try and make non-human allies.
