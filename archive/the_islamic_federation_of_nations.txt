The IFN (Islamic Federation of Nations) is a region within NationStates that binds together all the Muslim States under a single collective leadership. The IFN is a global union and spans from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Iceland to South Africa. The IFN will oversee the establishment of Islamic Law within its member-states. Member-states are self-ruling, but are part of a greater nation - the Ummah, which this region hopes to give a political entity. The elected Caliph of the IFN will represent all the Muslims in NationStates.[hr]Protected by [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=hamas][b][color=green]Hamas[/color][/b][/url] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=islamic_defense_pact][b][color=orange]Islamic Defense Pact[/color][/b][/url]
