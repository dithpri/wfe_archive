The world of Orm. It will stagnate until it grows.

I really just want to make a small region with a few role players. I don&amp;#39;t want it to be an alliance, so independent role players are allowed. I don&amp;#39;t mind some creative ideas like magic or strange technology either. Just make sure you&amp;#39;re reasonable. No invincibility and everything needs to have it&amp;#39;s disadvantages.

But I hate to take myself too seriously so if you want to roleplay but have fun with it I hope that works out.

I have a few other ideas too, but I&amp;#39;m sure no one will be flocking here any time soon so I have time to figure things out.
