[color=#00aaff][b]This is the region I use for my card puppet storage and a community... of one guy. Why make one when you can use someone else or a feeder? Well, then I won&#39;t get to decorate this region and work 2 times as much...[/color]

[color=#c6001d]As you could see I make terrible decisions. Why did I make a card region even when I don&#39;t have time to do cards! This region would probably be gone in a week &#39;cause I didn&#39;t care enough, enjoy it anyways! And also, don&#39;t you notice that I name some of my nations wrong.[/color]

[color=#00aaff]My main nation is: [nation]Holy Free[/nation], I&#39;m also acting Minister of Terrible Decisions. (The only position in this region)[/b][/color]
