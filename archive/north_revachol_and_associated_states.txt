Following the fracturing of Revachol following the events of the arrival of an RCM officer who demanded he only be recorded as &#39;Tequila sunrise&#39; and his role in the defeat of a small government militia deployed for strikebreaking reasons, North Revachol emerged from a collection of Nomadic Refugees who returned to the northern part of the city and established a small independent commune. Over the years and after varied squabbles between the member states of the Collation of Nations, North Revachol managed to secure enough Political, economic and military capital to gain international recognition as an independent nation.  

Now as North Revachol recovers, it seeks like minded allies from across the admittedly very large globe.
