[b]The NationStates Convention on Espionage and Warfare

United in a common belief that the destruction of forums and the use of illegal and otherwise dubious activities blurs the line between game actions and non-game actions to the extreme detriment of the NationStates world, we, the Signatories to this Convention, have resolved that lasting measures should be taken to prevent the use of such tactics from ever becoming an established and normal tactic in NationStates conflict, and to deter anybody who would seek to use them.
