We are the community of the Christian Nations. We are here to shelter Christians, and defend the faith. All can join, given that you can take a test given by me.
We raid, defend, and persuade in the name of Christ. We vote on every issue we face, and defend the weak.

You can apply for the army, vote, and become a vibrant part of our growing community.
