We do not, under and circumstances, interfere with each other&#39;s countries. At all. If you find that another country&#39;s political ideology does not agree with you and you cannot at all play with that nation, we recommend that you leave COFS. This is the place designed for the free-will of the Nation-states. We encourage debating, but absolutely no slandering. If caught be intentionally derogatory for the fun of it, you will be banned and kicked out of COFS. You can run your nation state, however you want, but you must at least keep an appearance of peace when talking to fellow leaders. 

This is a region for the nation-states and only the nation-states. For the states, by the states, we are the states.
