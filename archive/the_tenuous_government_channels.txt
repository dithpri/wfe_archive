Some kinda dimensional shenanigans, I tell you what.

(If you nerds want to roleplay, that&amp;#39;s fine. If you don&amp;#39;t, that&amp;#39;s fine too. Don&amp;#39;t worry about it.)
(If you actually want to bang out the setting, that&amp;#39;s fine. If you become our regional delegate, feel free to mess with this - just remember I can undo any changes you make if they&amp;#39;re extra-horribly dumb.)
(Most importantly, have fun, nerds.)
