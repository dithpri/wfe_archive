[color=#2350A1]Introduced in 1905 as a ginger ale, RC Cola [i](short for Royal Crown Cola)[/i] is a cola from Colombus, Georgia. It peaked at the third largest soda during the most competitive years of the Cola wars.

Born out of a heated argument between a Coca Cola salesman and company founder Claud A. Hatcher on sales prices, the soda has became a cult classic among many, especially in the Southern US.

The brand is currently being produced by [url=https://www.keurigdrpepper.com/]Keurig Dr Pepper[/url] within the USA, and by [url=https://www.rccolainternational.com/]RC Cola International[/url] worldwide.[/color]
