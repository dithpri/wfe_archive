We are many, and yet we are one. We are The Union of Independent Nation States, and we demand respect. For too long we have been ignored in our old regions and in the World Assembly- no longer. We are now, as we always have been, a force to be reckoned with. 
Let the founding of this region also serve as a warning to the hated Communists, the Socialists, the Whigs, the Liberals, and the Globalists. We desire not war, but an assurance of our place in this world, and of our collective be recognized as a legitimate gathering of discontented Nation-States.
                                                            Remember brothers and sisters,
                                                                       We Are Greater.
