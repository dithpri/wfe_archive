Kengfa Corp Island, is a rather large series of islands consisting of the several former tribes of Africa. A necessity for the Islands of Kengfa Corp is barcoded citizens. Each and every citizen must be given their own unique barcode, which can be traced at any time. This is in place to remove crime from the blissful Islands. 

Whether it be the pools of chemicals every few feet, thanks to The Sultanate of Big Frank&amp;#39;s Chop Shop, or the life-less  graveyard of crashed delivery drones, from The Dictatorship of Kengfa, to the treeless, and irradiated outskirts of our beautiful cities, life on the Islands is absolute bliss.
