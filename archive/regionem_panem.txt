- Note from President Snow:

To all citizens of Panem, we may have fallen into a slight dark time, however we will stand strong once more. So stand with us, while we ride out the attacks. Citizens we stand and citizens we fight.

Please, spread the word that Panem is a whole again, that we are willing to rebuild, and to fight for what we believe! We are strong, and whole. We are PANEM!
