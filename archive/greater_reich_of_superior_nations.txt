As a region we mainly look for capitalist leaning nations, who believe in free market trade, business, security and control. All are welcome (excluding communist, socialist and liberals) to join the Greater Reich and help it&#39;s influence grow. We do not shun dictatorships in the Reich, and we have particular interest in scientific and militarized nations.

The region is ran by a Supreme Leader and the High Council. To be on the high council you must be personally selected by the Supreme Leader. Join the Greater Reich today to be part of the master race.
