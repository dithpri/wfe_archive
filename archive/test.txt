Much time has been spent on the investigation and development of phenolic pultrusion systems exhibiting improved processing and higher quality designed for the recent United States Coast Guard Policy File Memorandum 2-98, Level II. Phenolic materials have been long known for excellent fire and smoke properties while processability has been lacking. Early pultruded phenolic laminates have suffered from poor surface characteristics, low structural properties, and inefficient manufacturing parameters.
