This Region has a complicated history before its creation. Before the Socialist Union of Proletariat Nations (SUPN), founding members originally resided in two opposing Regions: &quot;Sixth Comintern&quot; and &quot;Third Anti-Communist League&quot;. Both of these were Democratic Unitary Regions. They eventually made peace and united to create the large region of &quot;The International Free Union&quot;. At its peak, it contained nearly 150 Members and comprised of all ideologies in an Electoral Constitutional Union.
