All activities, including discussions and elections, happen in our Discord [url=https://discord.gg/7v7AwHg]Server[/url]

The reason why there are so little officers is that all officers are elected and served in the Discord server.

All nations and people are free to join, though only nations verified by [nation]Soviet Socialist Moscow[/nation] can participate in political activities.

This is a Constitutional Democracy, all ideologies are tolerated and no limits are set for Party creation (also only in Discord server).

The Message Board is replaced with the Announcement Channels, Political Info Channel and the General Text/Voice Channel (ALL IN DISCORD).
