________________________________________________________________________________________________________
[I]Kingdom - a realm associated with or regarded as being under the control of a particular person or thing
Valeria - a Latin word with the meaning &quot;brave&quot;[/I]

Thus we are a region ruled by our Sovereign, with the aide of the trusted Council.  
A horse on our shield to represent the bravery that all Valerians are born with, and a crown to signify the kingdom that we all serve.
