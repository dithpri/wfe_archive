Cold, the air and water flowing

Hard, the land we call our home

Push, to keep the dark from coming

Feel the weight of what we owe

This, the song of sons and daughters

Hide, the heart of who we are

Making peace to build a future

Strong, united, working till we fall

 

Cold the air and water flowing

Hard, the land we call our home

Push, to keep the dark from coming

Feel the weight of what we owe

This, the song of sons and daughters 

Hide, the heart of who we are

Making peace to build a future

Strong, united, working till we fall

 

And we all lift!

And we&#39;re all adrift

Together, Together

Through the cold mist

Till we&#39;re lifeless

Together, Together
