[b]Tokyo[/b] is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan and is both the capital and most populous city of Japan. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kant&amp;#333; region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands.

Tokyo is often referred to as a city, but is officially known and governed as a &quot;metropolitan prefecture&quot;, which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic unique to Tokyo. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
