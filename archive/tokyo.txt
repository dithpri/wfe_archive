[color=darkred]&amp;quot;The deva asked,

What is the sharpest sword? 
What is the deadliest poison? 
What is the fiercest fire? 
What is the darkest night?[/color]

[color=green]The Blessed One replied,

The sharpest sword is a word spoken in wrath; 
the deadliest poison is covetousness; 
the fiercest fire is hatred; 
the darkest night is ignorance.&amp;quot;[/color]

[color=orange]&amp;quot;This world is blind! There are so few Who see things as they truly are. 
Come, take a good look at this world, Pretty like a king&amp;#39;s chariot. 
Though fools become immersed in it, For the wise there&amp;#39;s no attachment. 
See how much it&amp;#39;s like a bubble! See how much it&amp;#39;s like a mirage!&amp;quot;[/color]
