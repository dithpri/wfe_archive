Alternate history
Within the show, many keys are given to reveal the details of its alternate history setting, which is similar to that of the novel. The point where the alternate history diverges from real life history is possibly revealed in a scene with antique store owner Robert Childan. He mentions to Frank Frink that Franklin D. Roosevelt was assassinated (possibly by Giuseppe Zangara). Moreover, SS Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer John Smith mentions that &quot;Decadence ruined this country before the war.&quot; Eventually, the U.S. had insufficient military capabilities to assist the Allies against Germany or defend itself against Japan in the Pacific. Germany developed an atomic bomb while the U.S. did not, leading to the Axis winning World War II.
