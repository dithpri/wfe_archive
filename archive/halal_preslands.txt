It has been almost two years since the Great Collapse, where for reasons as of yet unknown society fell apart in the stagnant Preslands. Many nations were lost forever, relegated to the trashcan of history, but some survived. The colossal Kevin Isle, stubborn UPSR and ingenuous Thomy sought out to reclaim fallen lands and rebuild the Preslands once again.

New countries also rose from the ashes of the old civilisations, previously unknown settlements or radical splinter movements from past empires. Tensions between the old nations and these new upstarts has intensified as of late, leading many to believe that a great clash is imminent. Surely, if such conflict occurs, will it not result in other Great Collapse? It remains to be seen.
