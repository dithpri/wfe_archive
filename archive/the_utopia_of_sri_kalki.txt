[i][b]&quot;[/b][b]Neo-Aum shall be Trusted to build a Utopia upon the Bones of the Billions who Sri Kalki shall Cleanse from the Earth. The Utopia will be a perfect Society, in which Sri Kalki shall rule with Ultra-Totalitarian and Ultra-Authoritarian Power. In this Utopia, the Daily Practices of All Monks and Nuns shall be Monitored by Neo-Aum under the direct Guidance of our Holy Dictator Sri Kalki. The Utopia will be of a Totally Spiritual nature, in which the Supreme Truth is Taught to all from Birth to Death. Any Monk or Nun that questions the Authority of Sri Kalki, shall be Immediately Punished by Neo-Aum, then they will be Cleansed from the Earth.[/b][b]&quot;[/b][/i]
