[b][color=Gold]Lightning never strikes twice...
But we aren&#39;t lightning. [/color]

We&#39;re [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and we will not be denied our vacation destination!

Noticing your [color=Darkturquoise]clear waters[/color] and [color=Burlywood]sandy beach[/color], fenced off with an unfriendly sign that said &quot;No visitors&quot;, we decided to be trailblazers and chase our dreams of creating an ideal vacation spot!
[color=Burlywood]The beach is now open for all, as we begin our favourite beach anime story arc.[/color]
[color=Orangered]Disclaimer: Visitors and Residents should endorse the Delegate and all Regional Officers or meet our pet shark[/color]

Coming Soon: Complimentary drinks bar!
