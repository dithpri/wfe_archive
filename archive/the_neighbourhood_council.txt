The Neighbourhood council contains nations that are proud to be in a region of freedom and wealth. This nation is located in Asia and is looking for nations who are:
A) Socially progressive 
B) Have a Terrible landscape
C) Have  the Barren as its main currency
This nation is reasonably new, so most of the role-play or history is up for discussion. 
Have a great day!
