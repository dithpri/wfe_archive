Join us, friend!
And together, [b]we shall paint this world in our image[/b]!

Just A Few Reminders:
~Feel free to run for any of our open positions
*We have regular elections for our different officer positions
~If you do not wish to wait until the next election, you may challenge any elected official (except Founder and WA Delegate) to a joke-
off. Both parties submit a joke to the Founder, and a poll will be created in which all members of the region have 24-hours to decide
which joke is better. Whoever submitted the winning joke of the poll will then take office, and cannot be challenged for the next 48
hours
~Feel free to post links of your work(s) any time on our message board!
