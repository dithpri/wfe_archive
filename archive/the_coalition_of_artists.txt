    [i]*We have regular elections for our different officer positions[/i]
 ~If you do not wish to wait until the next election, you may challenge any elected official (except Founder and WA Delegate) to a joke- 
 off. Both parties submit a joke to the Founder, and a poll will be created in which all members of the region have 24-hours to decide 
 which joke is better. Whoever submitted the winning joke of the poll will then take office, and cannot be challenged for the next 48 
 hours
