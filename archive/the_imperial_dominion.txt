[i]&quot;This dominion&#39;s purpose is to provide for the common interests of its nations. Its priority is to support the best interests of its members&#39; efficient reign. Our goal is to strengthen the rule of authority! We shall open the eyes of the foolish people with clouded minds. We shall do all things in the best interests of the cause of autocracy. We will not tolerate those who do not supply the best interests of efficiency.&quot;[/i]
