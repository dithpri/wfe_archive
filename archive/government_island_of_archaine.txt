The way that this will work is:
1: A representative will post a poll, which will be considered a bill.
2: Kyoto Noku decides if the bill is acceptable or not.
3: Representatives vote on the bill.

5: One all telegrams are received, the news is sent to Kyoto Noku.
6: The bill is set into action.
