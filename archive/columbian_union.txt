[nation]Terran Columbia[/nation], formally known as the [region]Columbian Union[/region], is a country located on the northwestern corner of the continent bordering [nation]Ursus Empire[/nation], [nation]Kazimierz[/nation], [nation]The Samifjod[/nation], [nation]Sargon[/nation], and [nation]Terran Bolivar[/nation].

It is a federal presidential republic governed by a national government under a modern democratic institution with three separate branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. However, the executive branch has long been occupied by its one and only president, President Mark Max, who is constantly elected back to the office due to popularity, further weakening the supposed democracy that limits the power of a head of state.
