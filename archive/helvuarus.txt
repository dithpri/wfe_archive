The Industrious region of Helvuarus is suspended in the air through a combination of giant blimps, balloons, reactors, propellers, and mainly &amp;quot;quantum levitation.&amp;quot; Sadly, expanding the region was not a thought the designers had in mind. The maximum nation limit is 500, borders will be decided by the nations themselves, and their agreements.

Our nation is heavily based off of the fictional city of Colombia from the Bioshock series. The region does have an occupant limit but thats purely for realism. I will start kicking people if it goes over 500.
