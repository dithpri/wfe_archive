There is no south of England... There&amp;#39;s a bottom half of England... but there isn&amp;#39;t a south in the same way that there&amp;#39;s a north. There&amp;#39;s no conception of the south comparable to the north. Good or bad, &amp;#39;the north&amp;#39; means something to all English people wherever they hail from... to southerners it means desolation, arctic temperatures, mushy peas, a cultural wasteland with limited shopping opportunities and populated by aggressive trolls. To northerners it means home, truth, beauty, valour, romance, warm and characterful people, real beer and decent chip shops. And in this we are undoubtedly biased, of course.
