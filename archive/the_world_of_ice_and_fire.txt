Dragon Rules: Max size for Dragons will be 45m in length. That is head to tail. 1:1:1 ratio between Head and Neck/Body/Tail is to be expected.

Additionally, any Dragons larger than this at the start cannot have any impact against other players and must be dead as soon as possible. (Don&amp;#39;t worry a certain event regarding an NPC Dragonlord named Aurion will give us all a chance). Additionally, one Dragon per house may exist until more are hatched regardless of how many you start with. (targs included. Luckily for you Balerion is already born)

More will be added if it becomes a problem.
