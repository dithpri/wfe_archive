We&#39;re back! 

As our name implies, we are a region of Christian Teens.

Here is our old forum.  Nobody really uses it anymore, but maybe we can get back into it!

[b][color=purple]Our history:[/b][/color]
[color=green] We were founded originally in 2004. Our highest population was 77 nations in 2006.  By 2009 our founder had become inactive, opening us up to a raid by [region]The Back Hawks[/region]. Shortly after this, the region ceased to exist.[/color]

[color=blue]Now we are back and ready for business! Our new founder will never become inactive, saving the region from fear of raids. [/color]
