When AEthernity overtook Sanctuary, AEthernity expanded it&amp;#39;s borders to encompass it&amp;#39;s rival nation. The result became known as The AEthernian National Delegation, which was shortened to The E.N.D. The region will request other regions that it and it&amp;#39;s member deem fit to join The End, because other regions are large and powerful, those members need to understand that nations within the End must be willing to work in  conjunction together to maintain the strength needed to succeed in the world.
