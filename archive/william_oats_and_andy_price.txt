When perusing NationStates we stumbled across a couple of insane dudes ranting about worshipping turtles, which the [b][color=blue]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republic[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color][/b] is totally okay with. So we&#39;ve come from [region]Europeia[/region] to share in your worship!

Hail Turtles! Hail Nethel!
