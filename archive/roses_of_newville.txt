We control population.

Our power over they are bigger than can even imagine, the ideology doesn&#39;t affect at all, is just a mere excuse to make they happy, even if state doesn&#39;t exist, we control every single day of their life, if alone we are strong, imagine joined....

Anyways, the idea of this nation is to empower we as nation, governments and... Population... Feel free to join, let&#39;s make a place of roses... Roses of Newville
