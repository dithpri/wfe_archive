[b][color=scarlet][u]Official NationStates Site Announcement[/u][/color][/b]

[i]This November, we&#39;ll be trialing a new feature sure to spice up Gameplay fairly and uniformly.

Starting with the major update on November 1st, every time a nation updates, there&#39;s a miniscule chance that it gets booted from the WA for a term of 48 hours. Each endorsement received slightly increases these odds, with an eventually diminishing rate of return. 

After those 48 hours, it will automatically rejoin the WA, retaining all endorsments that would otherwise remain valid. 

You&#39;re welcome![/i]
