A small sub-division of the great world conquest plot known as Mostly Harmless, Land of the Muse is a region with many individual and original views and opinions.

Of all the regions, Land of the Muse is probably the craziest. Everyone is welcome--as long as they vote Kokopelli for president! But beware, infidels and people who hate cherry-and-rubber-cement pie will be severely reprimanded, forced to eat rotting sushi, and then tossed out. You have been warned. But remember- we&amp;#39;re all Musers here!
