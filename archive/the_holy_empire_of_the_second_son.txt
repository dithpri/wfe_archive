   He who is the fleshed god shall rule all of our fleshed realm. Under one banner shall all lands be united. For all with air filled lungs shall call out in answer to the one voice, the true voice of the Second Son. We are the sons and daughters of the Second Son.

   [i]&amp;quot;For the Corporeal God! Long live the Second Empire!&#148;[/i]
