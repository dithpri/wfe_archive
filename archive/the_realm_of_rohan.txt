[b]Rohan[/b], or the [i]Riddermark[/i] (Rohirric), is a great kingdom of Men located in the land once known as Calenardhon, situated in the plains between the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains. The land of Rohan extended from the banks of the River Isen in the west, up to the East wall of Rohan and shores of the River Anduin in the east. The forest of Fangorn lay on its border, and the Elven forest of Lothl&oacute;rien lay north of the River Limlight.
