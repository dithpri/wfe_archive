Welcome the The Celestial Empire, a political roleplaying region! Immerse yourself in cunning intrigue, diplomacy and warfare as we carve new nations and identities out of a decaying Empire.

Starting with the death of the Emperor, The Celestial Empire is plunged into chaos and anarchy as warlords vie for survival and dominance throughout the shattered realm. But beware! For outside powers are knocking at the door, eager to get a piece for themselves. Will you save the Empire? Will you become the reincarnation of Emperor Ren and restore order? Or will you follow your own path?
