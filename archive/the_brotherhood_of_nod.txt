The Brotherhood of NOD:
We bring law and order into areas, that otherwise would have been left to there fate.
We distribute food to the hungry, provide emergency medical care to those who so desperately need it in this unforgiving World, and we minister to those who feel a spiritual vacuum.
And most of all inspire hope in people who would otherwise have none.
