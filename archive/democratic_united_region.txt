The Democratic United Region (or the D.U.R) Is a nice region to be in. All member states have to be democratic to join. All member states can use the regional board to propose things to the Regional parliament. Any member state can propose things on the regional message bird which is essentially the Parliament. Any nation using offensive language or inappropriateness will be sent out of the region.
