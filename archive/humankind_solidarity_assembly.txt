[b]A public message to the FRA and other Defender organizations:[/b]
[hr][i]You are intervening in a battle being fought to strengthen you. You are wasting your efforts fighting against us, rather than working beside us. You can continue to pretend that we do not pose as a threat, but you&amp;#39;re not just hurting yourselves anymore...

I have ejected a native from this region. I do not like to do this, but if you continue to fight against us, I will continue to ban natives from every region you try to stop us in. [region]The Eternal Knights[/region] are at war, and you have 1 last chance to choose a side: The Black Riders, or us. Choose wisely.[/i]
