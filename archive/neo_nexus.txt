This region is the land for the dreamer, the idealist, the anarchist, the conformist. A land where the rich and poor, noble and common till the fields together. A land where bread is broken and cups are shared at the table of brotherhood. A land where the old tables have been cast down, where the tyrant has been overthrown.
