The history of estropolis is kinda simple. In 2025 world war 3 happened and for a lot of people it was the last.  The usa, china, and russia aka old countries had a huge nuclear war that destroyed most of society and in 2060 a asteroid hit the earth sending the continents apart and destroyed. 2000 years later everything reformed and the only old continent  that survived and perfectly reformed was antarctica but now that things are back together again we hope nothing like this happens again.

Well at least that&#39;s what the ancient scriptures say.
