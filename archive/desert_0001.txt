Life is like an eternal, unhurried river,
Through time she rushes silently.
And where will the road lead her?
Either in heaven, or on another planet.

We are travelers in this strange land,
Where deceptively the days flow like a river.
We are looking for salvation, peace and earthly light,
Until the pocket becomes empty.

Sometimes thoughts wander upward,
They are looking for answers to all questions.
Maybe in heaven those graces
They are waiting for us to say goodbye weightlessly.

We will spend our eternal life,
Then we will lose everything in the world.
Salvation will be somewhere out there in paradise,
Or maybe somewhere on another planet...
