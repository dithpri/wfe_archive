[color=48D1CC][b][i]Welcome to the one and only Armesian Paradise Island.[/i][/b][/color] 
[hr]
[color=66CDAA][b]Here is the Island that will flutter the cold, crisp, and peaceful wind on your face. Out in the front, there is sandy part laid out. The tide goes in and out. The sound of the swishing tide rings in your ears. An undergrowth of trees, looking like a forest, protrudes out in the center. In the back, there are the peaks of mountains, some higher than Mt. Everest and other smaller than a dwarf, that, obviously, you can&#146;t see. People stroll around, laughing, clapping. As you step on the flaky sand, you feel a smile on your face, and you can&#146;t wait to explore your new home![/b][/color]
