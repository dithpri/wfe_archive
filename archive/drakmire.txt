Drakmire is the industrial core of the Varkharn Empire, where war fuels prosperity and obedience is absolute. Its factory cities churn out weapons, surveillance tech, and cybernetic enhancements under strict imperial oversight. Governed by the Dreadlords, political freedom is nonexistent, and military service is compulsory.  

Drakmire stands as Varkharn&#146;s war engine, expanding its grip on the world. Resistance is futile; submission is survival.
