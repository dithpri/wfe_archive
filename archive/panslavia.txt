The region of PanSlavia is free to join for any nations that are supporters of Pan-Slavism, the movement for a collective federation of Slavic lands and peoples under a unified governing state.
Please note that the ideology of Pan-Slavism does not necessarily entail the characteristics of socialism or communism as employed in the Soviet Union, nor does Pan-Slavism in itself imply support for such forms of government. However, if a nation in this region autonomously makes the decision to apply forms of socialism to its politics similar to those of the U.S.S.R., the right of that nation to do so will by no means be denied by PanSlavia.
