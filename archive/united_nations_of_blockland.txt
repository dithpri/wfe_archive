This is a region for people who play Blockland.

Things are pretty unorganized because currently I&amp;#39;m tired and won&amp;#39;t get around to editing this to be more orderly until maybe the weekend, but one policy that I would like to promote is that there is no limit to how many endorsements one can receive. If one wishes to become the delegate, then one must find a way to have the most endorsements.

Once a WA delegate is established then we can work on rp politics/regional goals but for now just bear with us, we&amp;#39;ll get the ball rolling.
