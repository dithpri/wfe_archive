regional anthem is zero to hero because we are small, but will be great soon 


the original lyrics come from zero to hero by BENEE

Let us introduce you to your regrets
You start messing with us, you won&#39;t forget
What you see is not just a pretty face
we&#39;re about to kick your butt to outer space

[Chorus]
we go from z&amp;#1077;ro to hero (Zero to hero)
You wanna tak&amp;#1077; us on? We turn the pressure up
Higher than Kilimanjaro (Kilimanjaro)
You wanna take us out? Come on and try your luck
