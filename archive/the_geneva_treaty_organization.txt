[b]History:[/b] Long ago, their was believed to be an amazing region knows as The Geneva Treaty Organization, founded by our lord and divine saviour, [nation]New Wondour[/nation]! It quickly rose up to be a popular region, until the downfall. Since the ancient era, the original Geneva Treaty was re-founded and another one was created. After the further two fails, this is the last hope for the Geneva Treaty Organization, one more chance to once again, BE GREAT!!
