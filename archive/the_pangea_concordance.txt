A geo-political alliance formed by the Confederate Union of Socialist Eurasia to bring peace and co-operation between the remaining countries of the eastern hemisphere, and other nations not under the influence of the United States of Greater America, and it&amp;#39;s imperial interests on the American continents.

The alliance stands against capitalism, and aims to create a single indestructible block of nations opposed to the USGA, while recieving the benefits of mutual trade and development. The U.S.E (by far the largest, making up more than 90% of the land mass of the alliance) acts as the chair of the Concordance, and provides military aid to all members, as well as development projects.
