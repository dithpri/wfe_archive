[color=red][b]About[/b]
Tiny Alliance for free nations. Founded in 2020. We are small union free from the influence of large nations[/color]

[color=orange][b]Flag[/b]
The flag is known as the &quot;Free Union Flag&quot; (Which the name changes all the time because the name is always bad) and has the flag of the founding nation, The Democratic States of Quruqlik, in the upper left corner. In the upper right corner is A big star representing the founding nation and below it are stars representing its other members. Every time a new member joins the region the flag is updated (may take up to 24 hours) and we didn&#39;t copy the United States they copied us! [/color]
