Founded in 2149, the original Systems Alliance was the supranational political, military, and economic face of Humanity. After the defeat of the Reapers in Battle for Earth (2186), the remnants of the species in the Victory Fleet, as all of their governments lay in shambles, banded together into the Species Alliance.

It is now 2288. Based on Citadel Station orbiting Earth, the Alliance Council is still struggling to achieve a fully united galaxy.
