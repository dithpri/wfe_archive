Founded in 2149 and based on Arcturus Station,  the original Systems Alliance was the supranational political, military, and economic face of Humanity. After the Battle for Earth in 2186, the remnants of the species in the Victory Fleet, seeing as all of their governments were in shambles, banded together into one government. Based on Citadel Station orbiting Earth, the new Species Alliance is attempting to regain territory, especially home worlds outside of Sol. Contact has also Ben made with new species.
