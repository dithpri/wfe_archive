A community of vans down by the river, where we take pleasure in beautiful canals, spinning yard decorations, roaming gnomes, a stationary bike trail, and our collection of well-worn tire swings!

*Traffic reports on the hour and half-hour by our all-seeing sages in the sky*

Every July 18th is decreed to be Gonzo Day in AVDBTR, honoring the birthday of Hunter Thompson. 

On September 12th, we celebrate the life of our late vanry solicitor [i]The Hanging Judge[/i]. 

We value our partnership with Monte Carlo Beach, but we don&amp;#39;t form alliances, host or join embassies, so don&amp;#39;t bother asking.

In fact, mind your Ps and Qs, or Gardyloo! to you!
