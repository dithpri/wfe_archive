After Accord and the European Union defeated the New Soviet Alliance at the battle of Moscow, a democratic socialist nation took its place. The new nation was named the People&#39;s Republic of Russia. This nation built up as the Accord and the European Union warred over power in Africa. After the two sides fought to a stalemate for nine years, the Treaty of Tripoli was signed. The Accords peace didn&#39;t last long until it was rushed to help the people of Russia overthrow the Socialist Regime. After the fall of the Socialists a Capitalist Democracy formed and the Russo American Axis was signed to bring a dominant force to the Pacific. Russia and the Accord are stalwart allies now and keep growing closer.
