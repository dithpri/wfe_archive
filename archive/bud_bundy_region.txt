 Bud Franklin Bundy is the son of Al and Peggy Bundy, besides being the younger brother of Kelly Bundy. He is considered the &quot;brains&quot; of the Bundy household, though they rarely give him credit for this. Unlike many in his family tree, Bud finished high school...and near the top of his class. He is also a university graduate, whereas few of the Bundy clan have even made it to college.
