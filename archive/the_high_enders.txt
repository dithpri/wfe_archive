[b]Improvisation is an art. As [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]Sparkalia[/region] and the [region]Osiris[/region] Sekhmet Legion watched on, seeing the stack of defenders coming towards them, a bright idea was hatched.

Leading this stack into Delegacies, destroying them. As then, the hawks took rest, knowing they just killed 4 years total of streaks.
