 We are the wind.
 We bring change.
 We are are sculpting out a better world.
 We are eroding the WA.

 We carry the whisper of the voice of change
 It only takes one voice
 And all that hear it will take it&amp;#39;s cry
 And soon you will have a reveloution


     I encourage evereyone to read my factbooks, especially the voice, to better understand the region.
     If you are allys with Fantasia or are helping his operations please put somone here.
