Welcome to [region]United Nations for Justice[/region]! We support justice, peace, freedom, democracy, and equality for everyone. We fight against injustice of all types, corruption of any type, and war as a means of resolving disputes and disagreements.

Any nation that has little to no freedom will eventually be ejected unless they provide good reason for being here (such as their nation did not turn out the way he/she wanted it too).
