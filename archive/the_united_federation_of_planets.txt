Into battle proudly rode [nation]New da boss land[/nation], [nation]Nuclear death land[/nation], and [nation]Kceck[/nation]!  All shall bow down to Floyd!  All of your ships have captured and all captains forced to pledge allegiance of floyd!  We have captured Kirk and Picard! Please check out our home region at [region]Alliance of Floyd[/region].  All starships have been redecorated with &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; such as profanity and grafiti.[/b]
