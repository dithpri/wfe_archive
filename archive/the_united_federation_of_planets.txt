to reaffirm faith in the fundamental civil rights, in the dignity and worth of the individual, to the equal rights of male and female and of planetary social systems large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and mutual respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of interplanetary law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom
