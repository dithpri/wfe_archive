[b]Phase 1[/b]
Phase 1 is the recruitment phase. This stage has already begun, and ends once the population has achieved a population of ten or more, not including the founder.
[b]Phase 2[/b]
Phase 2 is the selection phase. Recruiting continues as ever. Every two weeks, each member of the region gets two votes for who they want to be remain in the group. All votes are conducted by telegram. If you vote for yourself or for the founder, your vote will not be counted. All members with no votes are put up on the &amp;#39;podium&amp;#39; to defend themselves. They have 48 hours to defend themselves, and after that there is a second poll among those four members. The member with the most votes is removed from the region.
