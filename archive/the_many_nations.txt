This region is a collection of multiple nations of varying sizes, cultures, and histories that share a common geographical area but remain independent and sovereign. These nations may be united through treaties and alliances, but they still remain distinct and have their own unique governments, laws, and policies. The region itself may be divided into zones or territories controlled by different nations, with each nation having its own unique national identity and interests.
