[i][b]Hail, dictators of the world![/b][/i]

We the proud members of [color=red][b]The Malevolands[/b][/color], in order to defend the sacred tenets of despotism, and preserve our right to rule with arbitrary power, welcome all dictators to our region. Here, despots gather to discuss the subtle sciences of oppression and autocracy. Liberals beware!

Join us for tyrannical role-playing, military parades, and a place on the regional map. World domination awaits us!

[i][color=red]N.B. All members must pledge eternal allegiance to The Malevolands or risk ejection.[/color]

[b]Long live the reign of tyranny![/b][/i]
