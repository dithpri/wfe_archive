[i][b]Hail, dictators of the world![/b][/i]

We the proud nations of [color=red][b]The Malevolands[/b][/color], in order to defend the sacred tenets of despotism, and preserve our right to rule with arbitrary power, welcome all dictators, monarchs, and martinets. Here, despots gather to discuss the subtle sciences of oppression and autocracy. Liberals beware!

Join us for tyrannical role-play, military parades, and a place on the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1170995]Regional Map[/url]. World domination awaits us!
