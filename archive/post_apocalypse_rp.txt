&quot;The Golden Age of Humanity is at an end, with a galaxy-spanning empire falling into ruin, untold millions of worlds including the Homeworld, Terra itself, fall into chaos from newly formed Psychics, Cybernetic Rebellion, Nuclear Warfare and Xeno invasion. As thousands of years of history are forgotten in decades, as technology that could reshape the galaxy is lost, destroyed and forgotten over centuries, and as culture, language and society as a whole is warped and altered over many millenia, the new barbaric states of Old Earth once again come into conflict as their ancestors did so many years ago. An age of strife, terror, ignorance and darkness is upon us, and the light to free us all from it, is very far away.&quot;
