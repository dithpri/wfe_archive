This is Corras Yeltis, the first attempt by the YPGP to colonize or mine on a planet not within our solar system. It is currently occupied by 50,000 D-5 class robots and mining is constant. No-one else has reach Corras Yeltis, so only the YPGP mines here, and anyone attempting to colonize it will be forcibly removed.
