This is Corras Yeltis, the first attempt by the YPGP to colonize or mine on a planet not within our solar system. It is currently occupied by 40,000,000 D-5 class robots and mining is constant. No one else has reached Corras Yeltis, so only the YPGP mines here, and anyone attempting to colonize it will be forcibly removed. This is only here for forum RP now, it used to be for my region but things changed. Feel free to move here I guess, IDRC what happens
