All are welcome in this wonderful place dedicated to the arts of self-inducted mental revelation and the alteration of one&amp;#39;s mind. Wether it be natural, artificial, or simply the result of the so-called &amp;#39;placebo-effect&amp;#39;, whenever you&amp;#39;re feeling down or high, there&amp;#39;s always someone, somewhere on this earth tripping his balls off to the extent of very salvation. 

Take care.
