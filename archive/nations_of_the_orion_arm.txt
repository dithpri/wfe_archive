The Orion Arm, also known as the Orion Region, Local Arm or Orion Spur, is the colloquial name given to the extent of human exploration and settlement across the galaxy. It derives its name from the Orion-Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way, though in most uses refers to only a small portion of the Arm itself and areas of adjacent space. Though increasingly a misnomer as colonies are established within the Arrowhead Spur or Antares Gulf, it is still the most widely used term to describe the expansion of human civilization across the galaxy
