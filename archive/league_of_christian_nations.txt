[i]Verse of the Day: Matthew 4:1
(3) Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, &#147;If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.&#148;
(4) But He answered and said, &#147;It is written, &#145;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.&#146; &#148;
