The League of Christian Nations is an international organization that brings together people from all walks of life. We seek to create unity among Christian Nations, while recognizing the sovereignty of each. Though we are a Christian region, anyone is welcome(except raiders, y&amp;#39;all move along). We accept almost all embassies, so long as you don&amp;#39;t promote genocide or anything like that.
