[b]Featured Scripture:[/b]
The Nunc Dimittis from Luke 2;
&quot;Simeon took Jesus up in his arms and blessed God and said,
 &#39;Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,
 according to your word;
for my eyes have seen your salvation
that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,
a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
 and for glory to your people Israel.&#39;&quot;
