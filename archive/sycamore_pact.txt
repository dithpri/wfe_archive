The [region]Sycamore Pact[/region] was created in response to the decline of sovereign, traditionalist and conservative nations. 1) No nation shall have laws or regulations imposed upon them by an outside authority. Do not conform or submit to any tyranny from the World Assembly. 2) By joining the Sycamore Pact, you are joining an alliance of sovereign nations. We are banding together to remain independent. The Sycamore Pact will not impose laws or regulations on any of its allied nations. Do not trust globalism. Trust your people and your nation. 3) Gain alliances and defend your right to self government and individual liberty. &quot;Currahee!&quot; Ratified in the Governmental Town of Medicine Park. For any questions or requests, contact the founder.
