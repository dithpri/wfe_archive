   The [region]Sycamore Pact[/region] was created in response to the decline of sovereign, traditionalist, conservative and fascist nations which are being invaded by communist and left wing elements.

1. [u]We aim to defeat the globalists and communists that invade our conservative and fascist allies by proposing legislation through the World Assembly that would condemn and/or ban them.[/u]

2. [u]We hope to form alliances with our fellow conservative and fascist nations to build a large resistance against the communists and to further our cause to defeat the bolsheviks.[/u]

If you want to join our region or form embassies, please contact the Founder [nation]Wichita[/nation]
