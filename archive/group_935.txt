The region of Group 935, is a moderately sized region filled with a multitude of differing opinions. As a result the region has been known to experience fierce political tensions between the representatives and the represented nations. 
In some cases, the political differences have come from within the same country. These intra-national conflicts have known to be severe enough to cause the country to fall apart in civil war. For example our glorious founder The Empire of Ritzi has fallen into a brutal civil war with a separatist southern Nation.
