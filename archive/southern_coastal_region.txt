so guys, the back story of our countries is that Acleria was our mother country but we all broke off from her and became our own little places. Our freedom only lasted for a little while as she re-occupied our nations. Thats why everyone&#39;s flag is a bird except kiki&#39;s. Her&#39;s is the tree because that was in a sense our nest. After we were all re-occupied, we all swore fealty to her. So she is still technically our overlord. We can make alliances with each other, stay peaceful, or try and become the new master nation.
