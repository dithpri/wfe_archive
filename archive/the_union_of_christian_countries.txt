[color=blue]Hello buddy! This is a server that will contain countries with Christianity or fans of Christianity! Here, you can also talk about your problems with us, or talk with us. Don&#39;t forget to check the rules! Also if you&#39;re tired of writing &quot;The Union of Christian Countries, you can just type U.C.C (it&#39;s the same thing).[/color]
