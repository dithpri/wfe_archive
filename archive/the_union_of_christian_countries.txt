[i]Here&#146;s a report from our top reporter, [nation]Nova Dackians[/nation]:
[nation]Greek States of Balkans3[/nation], you&#146;ve annoyed us for the last time. You will [u]not[/u] call our residents h1tler. You will [u]not[/u] come into our region and demand governor. You will [u]not[/u] assume you get away freely. So, what&#146;s yours, we take. On a gentler note, Happy Birthday. This is [nation]Nova Dackians[/nation], out.
