The Red Order is built around equality, the collectivism, and opportunity to all
We seek the empower the masses and usurp the tyranny of the capitalists whose existence is to undermine the 
working class and shackle the proletariat to the crooked system that forces them to work against one another for their own best interest. 
We seek to promote the destruction of this crab mentality and create the social utopia which the working class deserve.
All deserve the right to equal education, health care, defense, representation, and work!
