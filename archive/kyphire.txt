We have officially built a Constitution with a Bill of Rights! Nice job everyone! Got ideas to add to it? Send it to the Legislator to try to make it a law! You can read the constitution down below.
If your feeling spicy, give ideas about what our Regional Anthem, Animal, and/or Flower should be!
We got a poll for the voting of our first law so make sure to vote!
