Hello this is still a new region but if you come first you could become a Duke and elect an  emperor 


This region is still a new but we could start with 7 dukes at the moment

In order to become a Duke you must be elected 
Your term is 1 month a you are a duke and a duke rules a duchy.

The duke has enough power to rule his realm.but they must share power with the council which is elected every month.

The duke is elected from the council every month.


Now the emperor, the emperor  is elected from the dukes every 5 months 

The emperor would be the most tiresome job because you will try your best to win the dukes in your favour and could possibly unite GALVADORA like it was in its glory and rule Galvadora if you win over the dukes


Good luck:)
