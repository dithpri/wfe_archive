     [b]Welcome[/b] to The Hood. We are sworn enemies with the Grand Duchy of the Hood........which i am now being informed is no longer in existence. We have no enemies except ourselves. Yay.
Our deities consist of [i]Nelson Mandela, Tupac Shakur[/i] (whose apparition has been seen), [i]Chris Rock, Bill Cosby, Nicolas Cage[/i] and of course [i]Morgan Freeman[/i] (commonly confused with Nelson Mandela).
The Hood is mainly comprised of various alleyways, unlit street corners, and gangs. If you are not a member of a gang, you are dead. There are no drug laws because drug dealing IS the economy. That and the suddenly booming brass knuckles industry.
