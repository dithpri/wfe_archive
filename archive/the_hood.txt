[b][color=green]Welcome[/color][/b] to The Hood.
Our deities consist of [i]Nelson Mandela, Tupac Shakur[/i] (whose apparition has been seen across the region), [i]Kevin Hart, Bill Cosby, Kat Williams, Nicolas Cage[/i] and of course [i]Morgan Freeman[/i] (commonly confused with Nelson Mandela).
The Hood is mainly comprised of various alleyways, unlit street corners, boyz, and gangs. If you are not a member of a gang, you are dead. There are no boyz laws because drug dealing IS the economy. That and the suddenly booming brass buttocks industry. [b] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ESyE4iXcuNFt0XBthOXTx_8PC7IAnmgFaQ49ZTiXYvs/edit[/b] - Regional Archive Link
