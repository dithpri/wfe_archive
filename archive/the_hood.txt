The Hood is not perfect, hell it can be downright awful. It has its problems but every community in America does I suppose I could say the Hood is real it doesn&#39;t try to cover up the grime and the garbage with garage sales and white picket fences, it shows you what it is from the start. It  is a  flawed community, yes but at its core, it is a community and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying for here not a perfect region hell  sometimes not even a good one but a real one and  I suppose that&#39;s the best anyone can hope for
