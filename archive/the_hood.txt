&quot;The hood&quot; is a term for a particular neighborhood in the USA where mostly poor African Americans reside. Due to the history of African Americans, and the systematic destruction of their ancestors&#39; tradition, culture, and identity, this caused the descendants of kidnapped Africans to struggle in a society where the system is against them. Educate yourselves, and learn/research the history of our disgusting and corrupt world.
