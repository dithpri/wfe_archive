Welcome to Central Europe
------------------------
Everything you need is in this World Factbook Entry. Such as how to become an officially Recognised Nation or elsewise.

Please note, we will not move our info until we officially have [b]10 Recognised Nations[/b].
------------------------
S.1 - Recognised Nations
Becoming Recognised by the Central European Council is easy. The following requirements MUST be met:
- You must be in the World Assembly
- You must have a population of 5 million+
- You must have an endorsement from the Supreme Chief or elsewise in the Officer ranks.

The best way to be endorsed by one of us is to endorse us. That way, we can create new ideas and possibly add to laws that the WA proposes.
