[i]Chao Shih-an came back from tilling
And he looked on his native land
Saw the want and the hunger of the Dra-poel people
Foreign soldiers on every hand

Chao, Chao, Chao Shih-an
Chao, Chao Chao Shih-an

Now Chao Shih-an went to the mountains
And he trained a determined band
Heroes all sworn to free the Dra-poel people
Drive invaders from the land

Fourteen men became a hundred
A hundred-thousands and Chao Shih-an
Forged and tempered the army of the Dra-poel people
Freedom&amp;#39;s Army of Red Bamboo

Chao, Chao, Chao Shih-an
Chao, Chao, Chao Shih-an

Every soldier is a farmer
Comes the evening and he grabs his hoe
Comes the morning he swings his rifle on his shoulder
&amp;#39;tis the army of Uncle Chao![/i]
