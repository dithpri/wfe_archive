BG wants it noted that the official plane of AMW is the Folland Gnat, A.K.A. the Walmingtonian Wychwood Warbler. &amp;quot;The Walmingtonian originators named it for a small bird, the Shieldian licence-builders named it for a baby horse, the Geletian sub-licence builders named it for a &amp;#39;(particularly) small dwarf&amp;#39;, and the Drapoel imitators named it for a grain of rice.&amp;quot; And then it fought all of our wars for the last half century. A &amp;#39;Modern&amp;#39; World.
