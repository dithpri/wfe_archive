[b]Today, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]The East Pacific[/region] and [region]Oikumene[/region] to pop by your region to check in on how you were doing this summer!

With the weather [color=red]getting hotter these days[/color], we left lots of ice on your WFE, and poured water on your streets to cool it down!

By staying hydrated, you have the potential to even become aquaman! [color=aqua]Everyone wants to be aquaman, because aquaman has a trident![/color] 

If you would like to become aqua-iceman with us, then [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
