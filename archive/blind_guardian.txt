[i]&quot;[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Guardian]Blind Guardian[/url] is a German power metal band formed in 1984 in Krefeld, West Germany. They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the power metal and speed metal subgenres. Their work is mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Michael Moorcock, Stephen King, George R. R. Martin and Robert Jordan, as well as traditional legends and epics. Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as travelling storytellers, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as &quot;The Bards&quot;. Blind Guardian has been referred to as one of power metal &quot;big four&quot; bands, along with Helloween, Sabaton and DragonForce.&quot;[/i]
