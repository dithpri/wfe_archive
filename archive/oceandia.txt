Oceandia covers an area of 8,525,989 square kilometres, the smallest yet the most powerful region in the southern hemisphere. The first settlers of the large islands arrived between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago, although there are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first settlers.Oceandian islands are of four basic types: continental islands, high islands, coral reefs and uplifted coral platforms. High islands are of volcanic origin, and many contain active volcanoes. The majority of people living in the region work in mining, electrical and manufacturing sectors such as producing cars, furnitures, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes.
