The Archimedes Galaxy, since the great war of the New Outer Arm of the Milky Way, has been inhabited by refugee states and other corporate trans-governments.

The first nation to grasp the Archimedes Galaxy was Atlantid, now known as the Galactic Edge, and the Galaxy is still quiet. Contact from the Archimedes Galaxy has ceased since the Galactic Edge was founded. New nations come to Archimedes seeking fortune, or a place to hide from the Milky Way&#39;s governments. The Archimedes Galaxy is also home to a number of small pirate kingdoms.
