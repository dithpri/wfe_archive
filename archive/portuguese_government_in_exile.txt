[b][region]Portugal[/region] has been taken over by far-left tyrants who want to censure and ban anyone with whom they disagree but allow communists free reign in doing what they want, even insulting people[/b]

The current government of the Portugal region is illegitimate because it was only elected with fraud, based on an election software that was controlled by the same people that now are in power.

This government in exile was formed by individuals both inside and outside of the region who are against autocracy and want liberty to be restored in [region]Portugal[/region]. 

We believe that Lusitanialand, a liberal conservative, is the legitimate delegate of Portugal. 

[b]Please support liberty and freedom in Portugal, and a pluralistic democratic government in Portugal.[/b]
