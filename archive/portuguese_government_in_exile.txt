Portugal region has been taken over by a radical left-wing group who is censuring right-wing views on the behalf of communists. Im in exile since they have banned me just for my opinions. The current government of the Portugal region is illegitimate, and was only elected based on fraud. They actually made up an election software that was controlled by the people that now are in power.

Lusitanialand, a conservative, is the legitimate delegate of Portugal, and all freedom loving people should recognise him as such.

Please support liberty and freedom in Portugal, and a pluralistic government in Portugal, freed from left or right bias.

This region has a password because they cyberbully anyone who disagrees with them. Contact me if you want access.
