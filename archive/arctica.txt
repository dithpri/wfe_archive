Welcome to Arctica, an entirely artificial climate regulated by a complex network of atmosphere-controlling weather towers assisted by an orbital solar space platform, that generally benefits from fresh breezy air and is also relatively free of the trappings of excessive tourism. The capital, Steelitania is a lush and fertile paradise where food is plentiful and people are basically free to do what they want. Due to recent expansion of the climate regulation network, new land has now become available to expedient and amiable nations.
