[b]Welcome to Arctica[/b]

Hidden away in the frozen North, Arctica is a cold, but relatively fertile region peppered by mountains and fjords. Life can be harsh here, so any nation that forms here needs to steel itself for the climate.

Arctica is home to [nation=long]Transarctica[/nation] and is divided into its subunits, [nation]Eastern Arctica[/nation] and [nation]Western Arctica[/nation].
