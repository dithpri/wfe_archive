The United Authoritarian Federation (or UAF) is a closely-knit collaborative league of authoritarian nations, monarchies, and empires alike. The two founding members, Silda and the Furred Armed Forces, are the stepping stones in the fictional universe Nezkatzi; which was the vocal and written idea of the Furred Armed Forces.
