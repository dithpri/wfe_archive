In the summer of 1967, a small community of gay men came to the island of Homoros in search of a better life. As time went by, the community attracted many people to the island and it became a very popular place for LGBT citizens to live. In 1995, Homoros became an independent nation and has continued to be a birthplace for new nations such as CannaPeace, Nudeas, Athiasia, Kreuzkia and Twinkis. Many citizens of Homoros Island hold onto the values of their founders, such as peace, equality, environmentalism, generosity and community.
