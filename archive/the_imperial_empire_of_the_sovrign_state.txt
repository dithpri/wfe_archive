   Welcome Comrades to the Imperial Empire! Feel free to look around and possibly stay if you like. As we are a developing region don&amp;#39;t expect us to have all that         fancy stuff the larger regions have like off-site forums OK? Good.

    Talk to [nation]Cervas[/nation] if you want anything or have questions.
    Also you must join the World Assembly and endorse the current WA delegate.
    I reserve the right to turn the Empire into a dictatorship to stop foreign invasions.
    Note* all nations must be part of the W.A to stay, if you make any puppet nations please alert me so I know not to eject them.
