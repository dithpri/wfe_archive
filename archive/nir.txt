Welcome to Nir, a fictional planet in a fictional universe. Enjoy your residency in this cold planet!

Founded in 2016 by Nirodia and Sothernia, the planet itself consists of an icy ring as seen at the banner, and it is a bit larger than Earth in terms of size. Nir has two natural satellites and the nearest star is called Sol.
