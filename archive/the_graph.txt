Look at this Graph! This region is dedicated to the competition of fellow Graphers against each other to create the greatest state of all. As a central administration, the Graph council does not seek to impose any regulations, limitations, or requirements upon any of the member states (shout out to the EU), however, we will ridicule any socialist hellholes.

Trade will be free, as it benefits all, as taught by the great Mr. Rupp.

War is not shunned, as we believe in survival of the fittest.

Prosper or fall. There will be no bailouts in the Graph.

May the best country rule over the rest, while keeping an emphasis on regional specialization.

Oh piss!
