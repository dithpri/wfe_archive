[color=blue][b]Welcome to the Socialist Alliance for Trade and Work![/b][/color]
Despite what the name might imply, not all of our member nations are socialist. However, we are committed to the concept of region-wide free trade and opportunities to work abroad. We are a password-protected region, but if you&amp;#39;re supposed to be here then you should know where to find the password.

[b]Unless stated otherwise, all polls are to be answered IN-CHARACTER.[/b] Nobody cares about your actual political opinions!
