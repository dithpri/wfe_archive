Welcome to The Independent Sovereign States where all nations are completely independent of one another. Our most important feature is that all nations must have economic success; therefore, we must continue to support the economy and the defense of all nations. Military protection is a necessary and having a regional military is mandatory. All nations must contribute 25% of their military. Like NATO, when one nation is at war, they have the support of the regional military, not national military. All nuclear weapons are shared continuously and none may be used in the region. (More to come)!!
