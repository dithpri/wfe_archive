[b]Welcome to the Union of Democratic Republics! The few democratic principles we follow are the right to vote and be voted, free speech and freedom of the press. We are mostly keeping authority tight by our hands when it comes to government issues, but elections are held for every office. Feel free to join us, no matter your ideology!
