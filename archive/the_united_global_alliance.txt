Roleplay as part of a realistic society. 
Country lines must not overlap. If they do, talk it out with the other nation.
No fantasy or unrealistic technology beyond what is possible in the near future (20 years).
Must include geographical location.
World Map updated every month (or whenever I feel like it).
