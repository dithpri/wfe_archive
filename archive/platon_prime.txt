[b]Platon Prime[/b] is a planet orbiting the star Alpha Centauri A of the Alpha Centauri system, and is home to the [nation]Mordigrado[/nation]. The homeworld is a hostile, harsh, desolate world covered with ice and snow, and dominated by ferocious storms and electrifying skylines. Beyond Platon Prime was a voluminous band of planetesimals, known as the [b]Platon asteroid field[/b], from which small asteroids regularly broke off, crashing onto the surface as meteorites. Over the years, the Mordigradoans have proudly embraced their formidable planet and have adapted to the dangerously toxic environment.
