[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[i][color=blue]Captured by [region]The Red Fleet[/region]: 11/08/11

Saved by [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region]: 15/07/14

Given to [region]The MT Army[/region]: 05/02/17[/i][/color]

[b][color=red]&quot;This region was a Nazi and Fascist region used as a platform for the Fascists and Nazis to espouse their hateful views in NationStates.[/color]

But not anymore. [color=red]The Red Fleet[/color] has seized this region in the name of anti-Fascism and anti-Nazism, and it shall from now on be an anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi region.

[color=red]This action is also revenge for what the [region]Alliance of The Axis Powers[/region] did to [region]The Grand Socialist Union[/region]. You took a region and destroyed it. We&#39;re doing the same to [region]Alliance of The Axis Powers[/region] in the name of Solidarity and revenge for the Left. See how you like it. Have a nice day.&quot;[/color][/b]
