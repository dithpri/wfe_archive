the fall of enemies brings joy to our eyes.
national anthem:
We are the brave,
Our soldiers fight strong,
And every person is controlled
In a land of honor and war.
We live to win, and die in peace,
&amp;#39;cause we know our land is safe.
No one challenges, because we&amp;#39;re cool
And thrive on piles of nukes.
Our lives are harsh,
But we don&amp;#39;t care,
For our nation is bright and strong!  Adopted from Burned Lands
