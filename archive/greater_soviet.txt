This is a Soviet-themed alliance. The founder, &amp;quot;China and Russia&amp;quot; is considered as an &amp;quot;Authoritarian Democracy&amp;quot;, that means in game mechanics, a communist and authoritarian state where people still live in democracy. If you want to join Greater Soviet, join whenever you want. The founder&amp;#39;ll then see if you can stay.
