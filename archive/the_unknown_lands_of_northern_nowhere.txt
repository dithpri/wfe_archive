This region is widely unknown of, and to be honest, we have no idea where it is! All we know is that it has lush, green rainforests, some uranium mines, and some small local nations around us competing for power. It also seems to be naturally warm year-round. This founded region consists of tribes and nations willing to step up and form alliances and to be heard and acknowledged by larger powers as powers of their own. All we ask of those joining is to simply have peace with one another, or reveal what wonders, views, and insights you have with other nations, or even simply to be part of Northern Nowhere for fun or other reasons!
