Welcome to Palocris Nova, the Administration Region for the former members of [region]Palocris[/region].

Here in Palocris, we accept a wide range of nation types; everything from Republican Democracies to Fascist Militarized Zones, from Anarchistic Communes to Benevolent Imperialist Empires. We are a growing community of dedicated NationStates players, who also dabble in JG (Junior General) scale artwork over on DeviantArt and role-play on our own forums.

We hope you consider staying in our little corner of the world, maybe even join us and claim your stake in [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Palocris/index/]our forums[/url]!
