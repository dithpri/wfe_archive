[b] Welcome brother !

The /rel/ region of Nationsates is a safe, peaceful and very devout region, deeply related to the [url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/ReligiouslyIntolerant2]Facebook group[/url] of the same name.
We promote the unity of every Christian (and some other religious) adults and young&#39;ns alike and provide them a safe haven.
Going to mass every week and praying a lot is an informal condition to be a real member of the region, as well as being part of the Facebook group.

May God be wih you. 
PAX + [/b]
