This Region exists to allow Cheyltrad members a place to escape hostile action and engage in military maneuvers of their own. Strict administration is to be expected, as this is a utility Region, and nothing else. Please send applications for membership to the Transhuman Combine if you are not an original Cheyltrad member. The administration&amp;#39;s decisions are final (the administration being the Transhuman Combine, and a few other select Cheyltrad members). WA Delegates will be selected from the original Cheyltrad membership.
