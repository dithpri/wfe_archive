The Alpine League is a currently small group of nations that wants to build a community around this great game. We have a discord, which you can join when you join the region.
If you would like to join us, please message [nation]Rebizond[/nation] with why you would be a nice edition to the region, why you would like to join, how you found us in the first place, and your opinion on raiders.

If you are a raider you can leave now. We have our region set up to be hard to raid, and if we do get raided we will get outside help from other regions. We Expect to be targeted by Raiders, and are ready for you.

If you are not a raider, and you would legitimately like to join, then welcome to the Alpine League!
