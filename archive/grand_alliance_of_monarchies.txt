The Grand Alliance of Monarchies welcomes nations that run on any type of monarchy or a nation run by a monarch, we are resolved to live in peace with our neighbors and when war has to happen we come together to help eachother. Placing your nation in this region means that you agree to abide by the rules in the By-Laws and the rules of the NS Game.

This region has been around for centuries, first starting on 1649 and is still running due to the rule of many kings and duke&#39;s coming together. This alliance and the countries in it are brave and loyal. Culture is strong in this alliance, different cultures and peoples live in the countries in this alliance and we love to achieve new things together.
