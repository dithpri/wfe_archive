Hey, you. You&#39;re finally awake. You were trying to implement the Treaty of Hibernation, right? Walked right into that Neo Grand Bell ambush, same as us, and that other maiden over there.

If they hadn&#39;t been looking for you, I could&#39;ve implemented the Treaty and be halfway to living in Paradise.
