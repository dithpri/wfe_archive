Hey, you. You&#39;re finally awake. You were trying to implement the Treaty of Hibernation, right? Walked right into that Neo Grand Bell ambush, same as us, and that other maiden over there. Damn you Sacred Army. Metafalss was fine until you came along. Grand Bell was nice and lazy. If they hadn&#39;t been looking for you, I could&#39;ve killed the Goddess and be halfway to creating Metafalica.
