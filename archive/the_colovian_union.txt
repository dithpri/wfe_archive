The Colovian Union is looking for new members and that could indeed be you! Yes you! Simply message our Founder or our WA Delegate for an interview and you may be approved to enter our new growing region! Certain safety precautions must be taken however due to an attempted invasion of our region by DEN (they tried, and failed). So, message for an application and you could be the newest addition to our great region!

Don&#39;t forget to endorse your WA Delegate!

Got a question or concern? Post it down below on the Regional Message Board or message the Founder or WA Delegate for an answer!
