The Colovian Union was formed on January 30th, 2016, when the Kingdom of Vantos and the Republic of Spertucus signed the Treaty of Colovia, in which the two great lands declared independence from the South Pacific, for freedom to speak for themselves when it came to issues, not just another voice in a crowd. All who wish to find a region that will support them and keep them safe from harm need look no further than The Colovian Union.
