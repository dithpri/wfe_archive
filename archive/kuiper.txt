Kuiper 
The region of the Sol (solar) system where castaway chunks of rock and dwarf planets reside. We like what NS is really about. We&#39;re also people with no lives who are definitely furthest from the sun.

We may also spam movie quotes, nerdy insights, French, and German. But, it is not allowed (except for Zoethegreat). READ THE RULES!!!!!!!
