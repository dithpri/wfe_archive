New Spain, officially the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Spanish: Virreinato de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a), was an integral territorial entity of the Spanish Empire, established by Habsburg Spain during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. It covered a huge area that included much of North America, northern parts of South America and several Pacific Ocean archipelagos, namely the Philippines and Guam. Officially created on 18 August 1521, it later became the first of four viceroyalties Spain created in the Americas. Its first viceroy was Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco and the capital, both of the kingdom and of the later viceroyalty, was Mexico City. &#151;Wikipedia
