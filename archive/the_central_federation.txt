Current date: August 20th 1995, the end of The Archyand-Tsandia war and founding of The Central Federation. 
The Central Federation is a small band of Nations who were united during and after the war against Tsandia, with almost 65% of the world&#146;s nations collapsing over the war, some of the few remaining nations decided to found The Central Federation. All nations within The Central Federation will assist one another in times of crisis and will back up each other during times of war, it was made to prevent another nation like Tsandia forming. All though The Central Federation&#146;s real intentions are far from the noble cause in which the public believes.
