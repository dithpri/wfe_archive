This region is under the protection of Caesars Republic. 

This was once a region invaded many times, due to the founders inactivity. Natives were oppressed, and the people suffered. Now though, with a strong founder and backing by Caesars Republic, this region shall be free. The regional delegate shall be elected by natives here, and he shall have all powers given to him by the Emperor of Caesars Republic, so long as it does no direct or indirect harm to the Republic. Long live the Emperor!
