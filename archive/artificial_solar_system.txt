[Color=blue]Welcome to the Artificial Solar System![/color]

 This is a left thinking region. This is YOUR region! In its center is a giant synthesized fusion reaction encased in a diamond nano tube cage. Named &amp;quot;Central Fire&amp;quot; The diameter is 100,000 times that of the sun found in the original solar system. There is room for thousands of planets!

[nation]La Te Ra Lus[/nation] all live within the Central Fires massive infrastructure to keep up on maintenance. Ask them to build your embassy and planets please.

All nations should work together for the betterment of all sentient nations and sovereign regions, and to fight the last fight. Nations unite!
