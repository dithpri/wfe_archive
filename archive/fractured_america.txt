Post civil war america.
2 blocs have appeared since the end of the war, the corporatism centered American Imperial Territories and its allies and left-leaning western Pacific Bloc. Several governments have claims to the same territories but the Regional government cracks down on any military conflict after giving the two nations a chance to duke it out for a week. While armed conflict is somewhat common, it is usually contained to large expanses of desert or wilderness and there hasnt been a civilian casualty in 36 years.
