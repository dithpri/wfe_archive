[color=#0000BF][b]Wishtonia is home to many tropical island nations that span the Wishton Sea, many formed from former underwater volcanoes. The region lies due south of the Tavlyrian and Madurin oceans in [region]Teremara[/region]. They share some cultural, historical and ethnic bonds. Most were former tribal kingdoms, then conquered colonies, and now proudly independent. Contact the founder if you think Wishtonia is for you. Thanks for visiting![/b][/color]
