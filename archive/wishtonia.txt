[color=#0000BF][b]Wishtonia is home to many tropical island nations that span the Wishton Sea, many formed from underwater seismic activity. The region lies due south of [region]Teremara[/region]. The Yarok Line, named after the famed Skartokian explorer, is the dividing line between the Southern Madurin Sea, Tavlyrian Ocean, and the Wishton Sea. Wishtonians share some cultural, historical, and ethnic bonds with each other, and their neighbors to the North. Most were former tribal realms and kingdoms, then conquered colonies of Teremaran, and other powers. Now many are independent, or protected territories with more autonomy. Membership in Teremara is [u]NOT[/u] required to be a member here. Contact the founder if you are interested. Thanks for visiting![/b][/color]
