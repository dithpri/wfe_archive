[color=#0000BF][b]Wishtonia is home to many tropical island nations that span the Wishton Sea, many formed from former underwater volcanoes. The region lies due south of the Tavlyrian and Madurin oceans in [region]Teremara[/region]. The Yarok Line, named after the famed Skartokian explorer, is the dividing line between the Southern Madurin Sea and Tavlyrian Ocean and the Wishton Sea. Wishtonians share some cultural, historical, and ethnic bonds. Most were former tribal realms and kingdoms, then conquered colonies of Teremaran and other powers, and now many are independent or protected territories with more autonomy. Membership in Teremara is [u]NOT[/u] required to be a member here. Contact the founder if you think Wishtonia is for you. Thanks for visiting![/b][/color]
