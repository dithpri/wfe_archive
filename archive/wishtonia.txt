[color=#0000BF][b]Wishtonia holds the many tropical island nations that span the Wishton Sea, and lies due south of the Tavlyrian and Madurin oceans in [region]Teremara[/region]. They share some cultural, historical and ethnic bonds. Most were former tribal kingdoms, then conquered colonies, and now proudly independent. Contact the founder if you think Wishtonia is for you.
