Here rests the&amp;#9733;[color=blue]Democratic Union of Assembled States![/color]&amp;#9733;

The [color=Red]D.U.A.S.[/color] was a region founded on the ideals of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, in which all nation&#39;s were welcome regardless of ideological alignment. It&#39;s values exploited, twisted and outright ignored by it&#39;s founder, mauricil, in his bid to gain more power. The greed and ambition that drove mauricil to commit his heinous acts of treachery and deceit eventually led to his down fall at the hands of NS moderators, and the collapse of the region.

~Lost, but not forgotten~
