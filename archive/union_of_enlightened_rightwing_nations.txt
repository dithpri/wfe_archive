I&#39;d like to welcome you in [region]Union of Enlightened RightWing Nations[/region]. 
We are enlightened right-wing thinking nations. 
We like guns, beer and wisdom. 
We seek power, wisdom, secrets of the world and we are not afraid to fight for it. 
We are the Enlightened. 

&quot;Hereby we pledge to fight together against all weak, deluded, vague and liberal nations. 
We swear to always search for wisdom. 
We swear to keep our secrets for ourselves. 
We swear to help any member in trouble. 
We swear to grab the power if offered to us. 
We swear to fight to our last breath. 
We have the power.
We have the wisdom. 
We have the secrets.
We are the Enlightened. 
We do not pity. 
We do not despair. 
We search, keep and fight.&quot;

Our motto?
&quot;We search, keep and fight.&quot;
