We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish an Independent Status in the World.

A Tyranny attacking us attempted to take our freedumbbells. We have lost it once, but now we win our liberty. We decide that we have unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. Free from these raids we are now. POLAN IS FREE!

LIBORTY! JUICETEES! AUND! FROODEEM!
