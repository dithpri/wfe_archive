We are a region dedicated to the betterment of one another. But we will not hesitate to fight even at our own expense to protect one another. Be sure you follow our rules to the letter. They are as follows: 
1) Never attempt to scheme your way to the top.
2) Don&#39;t question the authority of the officers. 
3) Vote on the matters we ask you to if you want your voice heard in the region if you don&#39;t vote then don&#39;t comment. 
4) Don&#39;t be overdramatic and don&#39;t bicker.
