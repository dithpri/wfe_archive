There are also a couple of simple rules that can be easily followed:


1: All members of the region must either be a WA member or apply
 for &amp;quot;citizenship&amp;quot; by sending me a telegram stating why you do not 
want to be a WA member.

2: All people in the region that are WA members must endorse the
 current WA delegate (As there have not been elections for positions
 yet the default delegate is me).

3: Only WA members may apply for &amp;quot;government&amp;quot; positions (Once
 there are positions).
.

[b] Failure to comply with these three rules within the first five
 days of joing the region may result in running the risk of you being ejected
