Dear great nation,
The United Federal Unions is a region based on brotherhood and unity. We here support each other, get along, make friends and build each other up. If you need a warm place to stay with people listening to your wishes, this is the place for you! We discuss opinions, send aid to each other, protect each other, and occasionally develop weapons of unimaginable mass destruction. You know. The things any nation would want. I invite you to join our quest of rising to the top and being the most powerful nations in the universe. Want the whole world to bow to you while you reign supreme with us? Come along and we&#39;ll fight for our goal.
Das Wunderlightia!
