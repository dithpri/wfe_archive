The Coalition of True Freedom (CTF) is less of a region, and more of an alliance of like-minded nations. All member states generally support limited government and/or economic conservatism to some degree. While small, the CTF is a tight-knit, brotherly group.

Founded on July 21, 2018 by Asmi L. Castor, President of Manus Libertatis, the CTF was born in the flames of desire for true individualism and freedom. We are welcoming to anyone who would like to reside within our region, nevertheless, we do uphold our ideologies. As Walt Disney once said, &quot;The first principle of Celebration is that no one is actually required to live here.&quot;
