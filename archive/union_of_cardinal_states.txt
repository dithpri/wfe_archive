The Union of Cardinal States is an union of states that share a similar social, economical and political ancestry. Originally under the influence of the NEMJ (National Egoist Military Junta), the states once puppeted by the military dictatorship formed an union to formally throw the National Egoists out of their respective governments. Officially, the now-defunct Empire of Adel Heimat ran the union and built its foundations, but in reality, the Egoist state is the government that holds true political and economical power within the union.
