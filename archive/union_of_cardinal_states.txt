The [b]Union of Cardinal States[/b] is a politico-economic union of states that share a common cultural and geographical ancestry. Most states in the union were once previously controlled by the National Egoist Military Junta (or NEMJ for short), and most states that manage to liberate themselves from its grasp tend to join the union.
