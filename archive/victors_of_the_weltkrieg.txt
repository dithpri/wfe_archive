Hallo to anyone that reads this!
This region is built upon the lore of an alternate Weltkrieg, or World War, World War One in fact. In this alternate universe, the three cousins, the British Empire, the German Empire, and the Russian Empire, as well as Italy and other small nations, team up in a Great War against the French and Austro-Hungarian empires. Here we welcome everyone. We hope that you all have fun.
Here are some of the rules!
If someone is a higher rank than you such as The Kaiser or Colonial Governor, or any of our officers, and is telling you to do something, do it!
No spam on the board!
