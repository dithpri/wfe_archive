Founded by the Federation of Coin Flart, the Populace Supervision League is a region of like-minded individuals tasked with the simple goal of &quot;supervising&quot; their populace with enhanced surveillance and control, while still attempting to balance economic, political, and military strength. By forming into a united force, these individuals are capable of sustaining a well-controlled and necessarily suppressed nation while still enjoying the benefits that come with collaboration.
