[hr][i]I&#39;ve been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don&#39;t want to admit to something
If all it&#39;s gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run[/i][hr]
