The Federation Powers is a military dictatorship similar to that of the former Axis Powers. The regime is lead by the Founder as its head of state and overall leader. I [b]Australrussia[/b] am the Supreme Founder as i rule with an iron fist similar to that of my idol [b]Benito[/b] [b]Mussolini[/b] in how he governed his subjects and subordinates. Much like that of [b]Adolf Hitler[/b], [b]Hideki Tojo[/b] held a position of power that was outside the formal rank of [b]Japan and Germany[/b]
