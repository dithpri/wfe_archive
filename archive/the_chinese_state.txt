The Chinese State Consists of the autonomous states of China.
It is a region bound by defensive pacts and thus each nation within the state must protect each other.
But most importantly, they must protect the head of the state, the ruler of the region.
The nations within the Chinese state may be autonomous but they all, in the end, must answer to the State&#39;s leader.
The Chinese State has heavy border controls and does not tolerate a revolution of any kind due to past historical events in China (now Xi Jinping dynasty)
