[color=blue]Welcome to Nadeyatsya![/color] We are a (post) modern-tech roleplaying region, set on an alternate version of Earth. We are open to anyone wishing to join the region, and are open to political debate, or discussion about pretty much anything imaginable. We&#39;re pretty laid back and friendly, and the only real rule is to be active within the region. We are looking for new members, [color=purple][b][i]so please join![/i][/b][/color] We have a detailed set of world maps and many groups within the region that you can join, such as ARTO, the World Council, the Atlantic Union, the Delian Union or the United Democratic Alliance!

[color=red] A WARM WELCOME TO THE NEW NATIONS JOINING US![/color]
