The League of Corinth, also referred to as the Hellenic League (from Greek &amp;#7961;&amp;#955;&amp;#955;&amp;#951;&amp;#957;&amp;#953;&amp;#954;&amp;#972;&amp;#962; Hellenikos, &quot;pertaining to Greece and Greeks&quot;), was a federation of Greek states created by Philip II of Macedon during the winter of 338 BC/337 BC after the Battle of Chaeronea, to facilitate his use of military forces in his war against Persia. The name &#39;League of Corinth&#39; was invented by modern historians due to the first council of the League being in Corinth. It was the first time in history that most of the Greek states (with the notable exception of Sparta) managed to become part of a single political entity.
