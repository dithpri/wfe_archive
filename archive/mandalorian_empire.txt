The divided city-states of the former Mandalorian Empire entangled loosely together under one regional government. These beginning warlike nations help each other in trying to survive their recent civil war and shortcomings, as these small nations are forced together geographically, and in their global political power.

Other nations of lesser military power serve the purpose of acting on diplomatic or other terms, but are considered to be equally important to the Empire.

Regardless of the strong emphasis on military/diplomatic might, the Empire remains relatively relaxed, staying out of mostly all conflicts, not attacking other nations or regions.
