[color=#0080FF]A memorial region to the once great region, [b]The Grand Alliance[/b]

Founded by [b]Kursania[/b] sometime in 2006.

Eventually becoming the grand work of many great nations who called, [b]TGA[/b] home. Players such as, Rocaway, 13 Colonies, Eggbiters, Thwings, Island Union, Black Back, Cwaaazy Peopoes, The CA and Grosse-Merde. 

Their [url=http://z4.invisionfree.com/The_Grand_Alliance/index.php?]offsite[/url] forum is still up and is a perfect representation of the region that once had home to 55+ nations.

We are a peaceful and welcoming memorial, anyone is allowed to stop by and offer their remembrance of this region; [b]however we do ask that military operations do not use this as a staging ground. If they do, they will be banned and reported to their proper opposition.[/b] [/color]
