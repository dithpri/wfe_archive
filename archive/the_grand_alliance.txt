A memorial region to the once great region, [b]The Grand Alliance[/b]

Founded by [b]Kursania[/b] sometime in 2006.

Eventually becoming the grand work of many great nations who called, [b]TGA[/b] home. Players such as, Rocaway, 13 Colonies, Eggbiters, Thwings, Island Union, Black Back, Cwaaazy Peopoes, The CA and Grosse-Merde. 

Their [url=http://z4.invisionfree.com/The_Grand_Alliance/index.php?]offsite[/url] forum is still up and is a perfect representation of the region that once had home to 55+ nations.

[b][color=red]Those who jump into [i]The Grand Alliance[/i] to dodge being &amp;quot;detected&amp;quot; for Raider/Defender military exercises, will be banned from this shrine.[/b][/color]
