Do you like vikings? Of course you do, anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t is a fool!
[b]NOTE:[/b] In order to fit within the lore of the region, you must fit within the criteria:
&#149;Must be a tribal nation
&#149;Must be Germanic-inspired (I.E., vikings, Saxons)
&#149;Must be a Confederacy, Federation, or Nomadic Peoples
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the mead!
