The Warmlands of Eden are a sprawling dense forest of pine, and old growth redwoods located on the western side of the continent of Eden.  It is a beautiful tangle of berry briars and mammoth-cathedral copses shaping the landscape into a mishmash of &amp;#39;impossible to traverse&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;impossible to be unawed&amp;#39;.   Despite the attractive qualities of the land itself, the people who live here are so dedicated to keeping it preserved that settlers or squatters should be pitied.
