The Warmlands of Eden comprise the southern portion of the continent of Eden.  Its landscape is dense with old growth sequoia, and wild with berries and other fruit/nut producing plants.  95% of the Warmlands are unoccupied by humanity, but home to massive elk and bison herds, wolf prides the size few regions can claim.  The people are dedicated to its preservation.  The region&amp;#39;s populace is mostly xenophobic and wants you to stay away. You are not obligated to, but [i]dont expect a grand welcome [/i].  Reputed to contain the mythical Garden of Eden somewhere on the continent.  Most likely untrue, though reflects the zealous nature of its people.
