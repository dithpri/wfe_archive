Take two after the inactivity of the old founder; 
The Isarlian Islands were originally inhabited, hundreds of years ago, by indigenous Isarlian tribespeople. After a while, a group of explorers from the nation of Heroicus (which is now no longer a world power) found the Mighty Isarlian Isles and settled on an Island in the North. This was centuries ago, now the Isarlian Isles are going to old strength. New nations are formed, with new ideals but also new treats for the once peaceful region.
