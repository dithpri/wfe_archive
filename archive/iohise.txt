Iohise is one of the four Sinker regions of NationStates, which means that nations refounded by players returning to the game respawn here. If you&#39;ve just returned to NationStates, we&#39;re glad to have you back and we look forward to having you involved in Iohise! If you&#39;re coming to Osiris from elsewhere in NationStates, that&#39;s great too and we&#39;re happy to welcome you to our region.
