The Storm is one of the most mysterious regions on Earth. Not much is known about the Storm, but rumors say that the Storm is the equivalent to the world but better. Wars don&#39;t happen, people live in peace and harmony, it sounds like the ideal place for a country to be in. Other rumors say that the Storm is the equivalent to Hell. The world is in anarchy, bombs are dropped everywhere and countless people are homeless. Nobody truly knows what the Storm really looks like because nobody has been to the Storm and has ever came back alive...or are there?
