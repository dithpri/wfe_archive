Greetings!

Welcome to [color=red]The Raiding Executive[/color] the one stop shop for all your raider needs and supplies so come on by for a visit or stay we will be glad to have you within the region. Nations carrying a World Assembly membership will not be allowed in the Raiding Executive so in other words the WA is only used for military operations.
