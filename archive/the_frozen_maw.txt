The Frozen Maw is a hyper-polar mountainous region under the sovereignty of the science nation Ayulora, defined by extreme cold, collapsing glacial terrain, and long-term environmental instability. Originally settled for cryogenic and neuro-bio-robotics research, the region is governed locally by the Liminultum Directorate, Ayulora&#146;s leading authority on advanced robotics and neural continuity.

As conditions worsened and cryogenic systems failed, Liminultum oversaw the decommissioning of cryo-vaults and authorized permanent neural transfers into machine bodies. Most transferred individuals remain fully sentient and legally recognized citizens, marking the Frozen Maw as one of Ayulora&#146;s most controversial and post-biological territories.
