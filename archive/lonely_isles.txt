The Lonely Isles is a secluded corner of the world formed at the foundation of Ordenonia.  This archipelago in the Southern Ocean is made up of a collection of large and small islands, the largest of which is claimed by the Dictatorship of Ordenonia.  Outlying islands are settled only by rare and exotic species of flora and fauna.
