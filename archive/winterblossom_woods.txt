[b][i]Welcome to [region]Winterblossom Woods[/region]![/b][/i]

Compared to the bog you have trudged through to get here, this forest is the definition of beauty. A dirt road cuts through the trees to serve travellers but it is in poor condition, with some saying the best way to not get lost in these woods is to follow the sound of the birds singing. However, everything truly worth seeing is found off the trail.

Deep within, [nation=short]Barnaby Screwloose[/nation] searches for a very special flower that only blossoms in the winter, from which the woods gain their name. While none should be ready to blossom just yet, he is hopeful to find at least one to use in a very special potion he&#39;s concocting... Whichever Clan scores the most points will find the flower for him and claim this region!
