Anakta is a very large continent, once ruled by 3 massive Empires, The Golden Sun, The Burning Sands, and The Empire of Frozen Blades. These three mighty nations went to war, a 8 year, long, bloody war. The Empire of the Golden Sun conquered them all. But the country, rendered bankrupt by the war, collapsed. The entire continent was cut into City States and tiny counties. However, many cities, after getting their economy back on track, started uniting. Little by little, they were expanding. Many of those countries went to war, many were in alliances. In an attempt to unite all nations of Anakta, Cedonnia named the continent and is inviting many of these countries to join in this community and live together in peace.
