[b]The Cygnus-5 Expanse[/b] is the dimension where a race of enormous floating heads, known as [i]Cromulons[/i] live.

Cromulons feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms. They do this by capturing planets with intelligent lifeforms on them, and transporting the planets here, and running a type of television show called [b][i]Planet Music.[/b][/i]

The inhabitants of each planet must begin to play a catchy, original song to satisfy the Cromulons. Planets that lose or disqualified are disintegrated by a massive plasma ray cannon.

The Cromulons appear to be technologically advanced as well, having built a Dyson Sphere around their nearby sun.
