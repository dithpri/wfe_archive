Hello! Welcome to the glorious territories of the Neat NEWT Union of States! Actually, never mind the welcome, we don&#39;t want random nations swarming us and messing with our glorious(?) economy.

We were founded a while back by our real neat leader, [b]the Kingdom of Eccentropolis[/b]. We do just as its leader says for the most part. Well, actually, always. For our combined prosperity and continued advancement, of course! Other notable lands here include [b]Octaviah[/b], a &quot;rather&quot; influential nation; the incredibly pro-market and unsurprisingly rude [color=red]Confederation of Heathism[/color], and [color=blue]Wedelquad[/color], a hippie&#39;s paradise.
