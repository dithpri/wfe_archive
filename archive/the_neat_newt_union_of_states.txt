Hello! Welcome to the glorious territories of the Neat NEWT Union of States! As you can see, we&#39;re pretty tiny at the moment, but we&#39;re pretty spiffy folks nonetheless. New nations, regardless of government type, are welcome here. As long as you don&#39;t mess with our glorious(?) economy, of course!

We were founded a while back by our real neat leader, [b]the Kingdom of Eccentropolis[/b]. We do just as its leader says for the most part. Well, actually, always. For our combined prosperity and continued advancement, of course! Other notable lands here include [b]Octaviah[/b], an economic powerhouse that I nonetheless would not recommend moving to; the incredibly pro-market and unsurprisingly rude [color=red]Confederation of Heathism[/color], and [color=blue]Wedelquad[/color], a hippie&#39;s paradise.
