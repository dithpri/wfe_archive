No idiots.... Perfect. Time to start a government.

A list of uncared rules followed by HLV:
&#149;When you voice your opinion people listen
&#149;Procedures are followed
&#149;Education and common sense are recommended
&#149;Veterans and seniors are most likely smarter than you
&#149;Show more respect to your seniors than to yourself
&#149;If rules were set in a constitution, those are the procedures, not your opinion
&#149;Debates occur in a respectable way and last for a minimum of 48 hours
&#149;A term of 30 days will, respectively, last 30 days.
&#149;Regional forums have good upkeep
&#149;Regional upkeep jobs are split among the people and not kept to oneself
People could learn from these. They&amp;#39;re specific for a reason.
