Hello and Welcome Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ. We are a new delegation of like-minded Catholic Christian nations who believe in supporting and defending the institution of the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church and the continued reverence of the Most Holy Trinity. We are a brotherhood created to defend our faith from a world who seeks to destroy it. We respect all nations who allow us to continue to spread or message of love and peace throughout God&#39;s kingdom on earth. We ask all those who wish to join to send a formal telegram to our founder United Socialist Ireland. Thank You for visiting and God Bless
