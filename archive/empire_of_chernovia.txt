An empire in Eastern Europe that was founded by the maniacal Vozhd. This empire is located in the western Ukraine in the Carpathian Mountains. In 1943 the Nazis butchered the Chernovians because the Ukrainians thought they were inferior to the Ukrainian &amp;quot;master race&amp;quot; and years later this backfired.
