The Ku Klux Klan is a group that was started in the southern United States on 3 March 1865. Most of its hate has been towards The MT Army and other races and ethnic minorities. We aim to keep white domination through violent acts of terrorism. The first Ku Klux Klan was destroyed by the MT and does not exist anymore. However, other groups with the same name and the same ideas have been created.
