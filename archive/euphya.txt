Hello there, humble traveller. Welcome to Euphya. Officially the Meritocratic Confederation of Euphya, whether in the cold mountains to the north, or the spawling deserts of the south, there is something here, for everyone.

We got raided in 03/07/2017.
We pushed them off less than a day later. Raiders, be warned, you will never vanquish the Euphyan Spirit.
