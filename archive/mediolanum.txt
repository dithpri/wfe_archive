[Hr][hr][b][color=indigo]Mediolanum, the ancient city where&nbsp;Milan&nbsp;now stands, was originally an&nbsp;Insubrian&nbsp;city, but afterwards became an important&nbsp;Roman&nbsp;city in northern&nbsp;Italy. The city was settled by the&nbsp;Insubres&nbsp;around 600 BC, conquered by the&nbsp;Romans&nbsp;in 222 BC, and developed into a key centre of Western Christianity and informal capital of the&nbsp;Western Roman Empire. It declined under the ravages of the&nbsp;Gothic War, its capture by the&nbsp;Lombards&nbsp;in 569, and their decision to make&nbsp;Ticinum&nbsp;the capital of their&nbsp;Kingdom of Italy.[/color][/b][hr][hr]
