Welcome, traveller, to the ancient city-state of Tsanteresht, the pearl of the Great Plains and the glistening jewel on the river Vuris.  It is home to nobles and princes, artists and merchants, assassins and thieves.  Once a proud seat of empire, it now stands alone, yet undimmed and many yet flock here to seek their fortune or shelter from the treacherous wild.
