[b][i]Founded, August 2008[/i]

Alliance of Queens was created by influential Queens of Nationstates, who envisioned to provide a haven for male and female players alike. We are a beacon of society, where great minds take respite from political strife and take pleasure in cultural exchange and intellectual endeavors.

Welcome to the Alliance. May you find gaiety and abiding friendship among our ranks. [/b]
