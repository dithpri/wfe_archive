A random region, originally founded by [nation=short]The Danish Confederacy[/nation] at November 12, 2015, then refounded by [nation=short]Valley of the Sun[/nation] on March 24, 2016. Join our friendly, laid-back international community! We are a diverse region, with players of all nationalities, ages, races, sexualities, interests, careers... if variety is the proverbial spice of life, we have quite the flavorful blend here! May justice, freedom and peace flourish throughout NationStates.

We are currently having an election! The results did not alter, and so, we had to create a new minister, the Minister of Culture! [nation=short]MaterialDesign[/nation] won the poll, so, be sure to congratulate him!
