[u]OUR GOAL[/u]: Become the most-corrupt region in NationStates!

[u][i]CURRENT[/i] minimum corruption requirement for admittance (subject to change)[/u]: [b][url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=compare/nations=new_corruptionland?censusid=51]66 Mugabes[/url][/b] [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=new_corruptionland/detail=factbook/id=243420](despite this)[/url]
(The minimum requirement will always be either whatever my own corruption level is, or [b]90 Mugabes[/b], if and when I ever surpass that. Why 90? Because 90 Mugabes was what was needed to be in the top 10 percent in the world the last time a census of &amp;quot;most corrupt nations&amp;quot; was done.)
