Welcome to Ius!
If you&#39;re considering joining or might:
*Talk to Ithreland.
*Any government type can join, so long as you&#39;re not breaking Nationstates&#39; rules or being mean.

If you&#39;re a member nation:
1) Don&#39;t be a jerk.
1a. You *can* be snarky if it&#39;s not overly mean and it would help if you would indicate the sarcasm. It&#39;s easy to read things the wrong way when not in person.

2) Bring any problems you have to Athease, Ithreland, or Toklax.
2b. Ithreland is the only one of the three of us joining the WA, as we share a computer.
3) I don&#39;t plan on having any Regional Officers besides the WA Delegate(if and when we get one).
3b. You don&#39;t have to endorse any nation whose stances you don&#39;t agree with if you are WA.
