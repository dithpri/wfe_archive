We are a Socialist and Communist region which aims to secure the freedom of speech, the liberty of life, and the openness of Government. With an aim at those on the Libertarian Left, but almost everyone is welcome to find this region their home. That is assuming of course, you are not simply hateful.

For now, I (the founder), shall hold autocratic power over the region until we get enough members to make democracy worthwhile.
