Rules:
Wars must have a good reason behind them. So no declaring war on a lark.
Role play appropriately for both your country and time period 
One should have a list of important leaders of one&#39;s country (ie royal family or cabinet) No list, no rping
One should have a detailed list of one&#39;s cities and their descriptions. No list no rping
One should have a list of one&#39;s armies and navies. No list, No Army/Navy, no warring
