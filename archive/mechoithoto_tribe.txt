As the newcomers looked for food in the old time it was time to start a new world they placed their map on the floor as they started building. &#39;We cannot have them take our land we must fight them.&#39; One of the tribe members said in a angry tone. They all facepalmed except the member. &#39;The, key is not to fight because fighting is not a answer, maybe lets talk to them.&#39; The other member of the tribe replied. &#39;Okay, fine I will keep a spear just in case...&#39; As they left out from the grass. &#39;Um, hey sir this is our land so can you get your other land to another spot.&#39; They asked. &#39;I, mean sure under one condition make this the best tribe ever.&#39;
