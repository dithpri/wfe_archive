[b]Welcome to the Empire of Outremer[/b]

A region formed from nations with a periferical lore-ubication. Jup, that&#39;s the origin of the name, there is no other reason. It is not an attemp from it&#39;s leader to extend it&#39;s power. Nop. Just your normal region, with a healthy variaty of ideas, based in good intentions, with no suspicious objectives what so ever. 

Anyways, it&#39;s a purely democratic region, with all the electors having equal power to decide.
Currently there are as much as 1 electors ([nation]Godterra[/nation]) whom democratly rule the region for themselves and the rest of members.
[hr]Please check the diverse degrees of membership of the region and the powers associated with each one
