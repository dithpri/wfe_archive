The region of New Polozia is a new land captured by refugee&amp;#39;s who escaped the land of Polozia after a civil war broke out. Soon after the war the corrupt neighboring countries of Polozia invaded Polozia and declared the land there&amp;#39;s leaving the newly claimed land by the Polozian refugee&amp;#39;s as the only remnants.

Members of New Polozia consist of Polozian territories and protectorates.

If you wish to become a protectorate please contact the Polozian mainland.
