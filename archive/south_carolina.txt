[color=01796F][b]South Carolina[/b], beautiful and free, home of the Confederacy.

[i][b]Hold up the glories of thy dead;
Say how thy elder children bled,
And point to Eutaw&amp;#39;s battle-bed.
Carolina! Carolina!

Throw thy bold banner to the breeze!
Front with thy ranks the threatening seas
Like thine own proud armorial trees,
Carolina! Carolina![/i]
