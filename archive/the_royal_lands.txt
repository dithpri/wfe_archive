[region]The Royal Lands[/region] is a region where Kingdoms, Queendoms or any other Monarchies can settle down.

We believe in human rights, protection of the environment, diversity and education, but we also believe that the population requires a strong leader to make sure that the balance is preserved.

This region just got created and its founder is still trying to figure out all that NationStates has to offer, so he is looking for people to help him building these great Royal Lands.
