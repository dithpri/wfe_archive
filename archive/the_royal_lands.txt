[b]WELCOME TO THE ROYAL LANDS![/b]

[region]The Royal Lands[/region] is a region where Kingdoms, Queendoms or any other Monarchies can settle down.

We believe in human rights, protection of the environment, diversity and education, but we also believe that the population requires a strong leader to make sure that the balance is preserved.

[b]WE ARE NEW HERE AND WE ARE STILL PLANNING THINGS[/b]

This region just got created and its founder is still trying to figure out all that NationStates has to offer, but in the meantime, [b]we gladly accept any embassy offer from other regions[/b], but not that nations move to our precious [i]Royal Lands[/i] yet.
