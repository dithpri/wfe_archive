Amalthea is a large isle located in the northern Atlantic ocean. Host to multiple countries, the region is approximately the size of Greenland, with a diverse landscape - sprawling deserts, dense rainforests, and transitional prairies and meadows in between. The land was a popular location for major western countries to found colonies - from which, the modern countries of Amalthea were formed.
