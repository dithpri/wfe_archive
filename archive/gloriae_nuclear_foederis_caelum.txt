We are most glorious alliance.  Hahaha!




Our best glorious regional anthem: 

http://www.hymn.ru/internationale/index-en.html

Arise ye pris&#146;ners of starvation
Arise ye wretched of the earth
For justice thunders condemnation
A better world&#146;s in birth!
No more tradition&#146;s chains shall bind us
Arise, ye slaves, no more in thrall;
The earth shall rise on new foundations
We have been naught we shall be all.

&#146;Tis the final conflict
Let each stand in his place
The International Union
Shall be the human race.




&quot;When the going gets tough, the tough use nuclear war&quot;
