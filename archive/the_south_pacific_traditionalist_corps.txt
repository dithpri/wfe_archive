[color=red]The Corps of the South Pacific[/color]

The Corps are dedicated to the protections of the South Pacific against any threat of communism or war. We also act as a political figure within the region with the hope of choosing the delegate that is most helpful to the region&amp;#39;s prosperity. We have a short history but we were involved in the elimination of Milograd and the rise of Brutland and Norden to the delegation. Please join us in our defense of The South Pacific.
