The Corps shall rise against the tyrannic reign of Milograd. Our men will push forth our cause and defeat and bring back the great democratic union of the South Pacific. The union we fight for is a reformed, democratic union that will allow all nations to have some effect in the way the region is governed. We must fight back. Join the Traditionalist Corps now. We are the true People&amp;#39;s Revolution. We must gain strength now before Milograd ruins the reputation of The South Pacific.
