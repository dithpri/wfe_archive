MDL - Majkin Defence League (proposed by [nation]Ohen[/nation])
Just an idea incase our region is invaded. I&amp;#39;m already endorsed by all of Majkin&amp;#39;s WA members but, if a larger group of players moves into Majkin and seizes power then we have a problem. So I suppose we formulate a plan of action. Plus that name sounds so cool!
