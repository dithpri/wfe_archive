Rather forgotten nations that lay far away from the rest of their counterparts,, the Outlyers impose true neutrality on anything that doesn&#39;t involve them. If a nation even dares to try and take a stance on anything but a regional matter then they will be cast out from our lands. We have no particular political ideology and everyone is free to say or do what they like providing it has something to do with the region.
