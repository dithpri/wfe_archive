Noarache is a region approximately the size of Greenland, settled nearly 500 years ago. Settlers came from three different areas, initially forming the nations of Campdi, Noara, and Galtoirre. However, Campdi has been a hotbed of internal conflict, breaking into the nations East and West Campdi. West Campdi continued to suffer internal strife, resulting in a secession of a small anarchic region now known Kahmda, a dialectical pronunciation of Campdi.
