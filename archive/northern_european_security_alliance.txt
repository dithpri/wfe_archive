The Northern European Security Alliance is an economic and political union of multiple subnational Republics in North-Eastern Europe, and Northern Asia. The NESA is a multiple-party union, governed by the independent leaders of the member states, with Derendizn&auml;a as its capital. NESA policies aim to ensure the free movement goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, and regional development. The organisation constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party.
