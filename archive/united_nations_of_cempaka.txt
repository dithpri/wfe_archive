Welcome and congratulations on doing what was required of you as a student of Cempaka!
Your benevolent teacher and mentor has created this region so that our nations can interact with one another.

We will be passing laws that may or may not be agreed upon, leading to sanctions, alliances, and possibly war.

I&amp;#39;ll be going over more details in class, but make sure you add your country information on the VLE so I know exactly who is who.

-Mr. Andrew
Emperor of Dzieland
