The Brandenburg Cluster was originally founded in 2542 by Christian pilgrim Mason Brandenburg and his immediate family as the Eyes of Christ, named for the binary stars of its principal solar system. The Brandenburg family slowly grew over hundreds of years, eventually expanding to other worlds in the system, then other star systems. In May 5709, the region was renamed to the Brandenburg Cluster in honor of its beloved founder, though the older name was kept for the original binary system, which housed the new capital, the Orion Dominion, in honor of Mason&amp;#39;s son.
