[b] Welcome to Poenas! [/b]

An old and inactive region, with most of its inhabitants moving on or staying under the radar. Formerly coming from another region, that is now defunct.
Issues being discussed now include:
-The encroaching black zones.
-The outcomes of several major civil wars.
-The ongoing colonization in the east.
-The revitalization of the region with meta-game mechanics.
-The necessity of geese.
