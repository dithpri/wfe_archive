A very strong nation where democracy is greatly appreciated. Features include a High Court, 3 senate seats, and a main ruler. Political parties have not been decided, but you can create them at any time. Also, you can make any laws you want. They just need approval from the Senate and High court. Monthly elections are held so you can have a say in who rules this nation. Everyone is allowed to join, and if you have anything to say, just leave a message on the board.

Long Live The Holy Empire of Farnkie!!
