A star system near the edge of the galaxy, under the control of the Confederate Systems Alliance.  Centered around the star Deikun, it contains twelve planets, a mix of rocky, terrestrial, water, gas, and frozen worlds.  Each was colonized nearly 600 years ago, and now they all have thriving populations.
