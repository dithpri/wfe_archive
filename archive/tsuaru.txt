A frozen wasteland with very little food and an unforgiving climate. The region has the occasional warm summer where you can get a glimpse of the ground naturally. 

Region is founded by a new player who could always use a helping hand. We prefer role play but you can just come casually hang out too if you wish. Anyone is welcome and diversity is encouraged. Stay safe.
