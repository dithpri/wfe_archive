[color=red][i]Dear nations, 
We have been around for quite some time. However, our system of government is just to big to work with at this stage as a region. I propose we limit the size of the government. We will still have elections, yes, but some jobs should be cut back until later. I say these positions stay: President, Vice President, WA Delegate, Minister of Internal/Foreign Affairs, and Congress. We can make the government larger as we grow, but let&amp;#39;s start out small. I would like anyone who wants to run to telegram me. Even if you have already been approved. The first 7 to apply to congress automatically win. That is all.[/color][/i]
