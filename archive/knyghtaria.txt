Knyghtaria was once a great upstart, a prosperous region. However, inactivity, poor recruitment efforts, a refoundation and inactivity by me brought Knyghtaria to its knees, but it was revived but following major flaming by a member who appears to have been a troll, Knyghtaria was again nearly destroyed, but revived.  However, following a raid, Knyghtaria died as several major players left. Thus, I have closed Knyghtaria&amp;#39;s doors but I am keeping this region alive via a puppet as an archive.
