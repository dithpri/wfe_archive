Knyghtaria was once a great upstart, a prosperous region.  However, inactivity as well as poor recruitment efforts, a refoundation as well as inactivity by me brought Knyghtaria to its knees, but it was revived but following major flaming by a member who appears to have come just to flame, Knyghtaria was again nearly destroyed but then revived.  However, following a raid, Knyghtaria&amp;#39;s last life was gone, and several major players left.  Following this, I closed Knyghtaria&amp;#39;s doors but I am keeping this region alive via a puppet as an archive and for historical purposes.
