[b][i][color=gold] We are now independent. After realizing the weakness of New Republica, embassies were closed. We are to have no further relations with that region. Who wants to be bossed around by a region full of 4 year olds anyways. This day marks the start of something fresh and new. Elections for president end tomorrow. [nation]Illiod[/nation] is currently in the lead by two votes. Congrats to [region]Zero-0ne[/nation]for winning WA Delegate, and congrats to [nation]Happy Friends Land[/nation] for winning vice WA Delegate. Please telegram [nation]Xcenanonia[/nation] for more info about you positions.[/b][/i][/color]
