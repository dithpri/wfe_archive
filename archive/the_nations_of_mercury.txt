The Nations of Mercury is an adept, civil alliance bringing together all nations, of whom reside on the beautiful planet on Mercury. The purpose of this region is to wholly and efficiently bring together and colonize the planet of Mercury, of which each of the residing nations call home. This nation harnesses the quality of political, and other aspects of roleplay (meaning no nations with unrealistic or  crude titles.) This nation is also very specific to the colonization of the planet Mercury (therefore, if your nation isn&#39;t canonically on the planet, please don&#39;t join.) Other than that, the Nations of Mercury wishes for an entertaining, passive environment.
