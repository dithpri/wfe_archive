[b][colour=red][u]WELCOME TO THE CYBERIUS CONFEDERATION![/colour][/b][/u]

[b]Sadly, upon the destruction of this hidey-hole, all prior archives of noble battles and glorious warfare under the once-hegemony of the [region]Cyberius Confederation[/region] were purged from military accounts. Nonetheless, this region&#39;s slow rebirth casts a ray of hope that one day, one day... the Confederation will rise from the ashes of ruin and transcend into sublime prominence as it once did a long time ago-[/b]

The second incarnation, a reboot, of the classic regional bastion, security station and military outpost of the [region]Cyberius Confederation[/region]. A sanctuary in times of dire circumstance, the fortress still stands all these years later, in ever-deteriorating slumber.
