Welcome to [b]Varda[/b], a [b]High Fantasy[/b] world where dwell men, elves, dwarrow, and more. Where the thunder in the air is the direct result of the motions of gods, real and quantifiable, where magic exists with a thrum in the earth, known and common. Where great kings reign and noble knights clad in gleaming mail march off to war against untold evils. It is currently the year [b]636[/b], the Enemy of the World has been across the Great Ice for generations and some, foolish and youthful, have begun to believe that he is gone forever. This is not so; as realms war, as kings squabble, his strength grows, and soon, darkness will return to the world.
