[b][i]Welcome to [region]Greenguard[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

The elders of this sleepy village consider themselves the guardians of the nearby Jade Spires forest. Ghor has come here on his way to commune with the trees&#39; spirits and stopped to speak with them elders to learn more about their way of life. Every building is made nearly entirely of bricks and stone, with what little wood being used in their construction coming from fir trees atop a nearby mountain.

The young people have heard of Elyssia&#39;s designs and want to chop the forest down to expand their village more quickly! Ghor has met with them to try to mediate the situation. Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points will assist Ghor in somehow convincing the young people to not destroy the ancient forest!
