We, the Harmonic nations of the word, have grown all too worried about how many treat each other. We aim to be peaceful but not weak, helpful but not a burden and stable, not chaotic. We look to bring friendship, diplomacy and peace to those who want it while defending ourselves from those who seek to harm us. We aim not to seek war, only global peace. If you&#39;re a friend, welcome! If you&#39;re a foe. we warn you to be careful as to who you&#39;re messing with, we do not stand alone. We are not the only ones here.
