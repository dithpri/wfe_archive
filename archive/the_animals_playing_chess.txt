Welcome! This is a modest region of chess players, but political debate and other activities are encouraged too! Each Cabinet member is named after a different chess piece and the WA delegate is the player. We do not use off-site chat, except for chess sites, and guarantee that if you decide to join our ranks, you will not regret it! Additionally, please do not raid us. The Animals Playing Chess has no official political position, but it was founded as a left/liberal and is not open to fascists or conservatives. Please endorse current WA delegate/player, [nation]Garbelia[/nation], to keep us safe from raids and to raise regional influence! Garbelia is currently not located here, but will return. Meanwhile, [nation]Farbelia[/nation] will keep watch.
