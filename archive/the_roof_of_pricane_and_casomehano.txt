[color=0066ff][b]Our Rules For Everyone:[/b][/color]

1. Howl at the moon every single full moon! This is very important!

2. Respect minorities and people who don&#146;t believe the same things as you. I don&#146;t want anyone getting offended.

3. No symbols of hate. (No swastikas or Confederate flags and that kind of stuff.)

That sums up our WFE. There isn&#146;t much else to put here, eh?
