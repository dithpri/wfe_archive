Under the guidance of Allah, the Caliphate has endured countless centuries of both peaceful and war-like existence. It is the sacred duty of all its inhabitants to preserve the culture, ideals, and the faith of the Caliphate. The Caliphate is by no means an Empire nor imperialist aggressor. All States within the Caliphate will adhere to the teachings of the Almighty to maintain peace, defense, and stability.
