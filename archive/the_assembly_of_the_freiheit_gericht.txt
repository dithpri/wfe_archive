We are all about freedom of our citizens. Your citizens build your nation, give your nation the power to be such. Without them, you cannot be. Treating them and where they live with care is the key to survival, and keeping them informed is the way to go. We are here to represent and make decision based on what is best for them, and not what is best for the leaders.
