With the fall of The Republic of North Omaha two new nation-states were born, East Omaha and Great Omaha. These nations are dedicated to keeping the history of the Omaha region alive. This Organization has been set up to keep nation-states with majority of Omahan ethnics. If in the case any new Omahan nation were to rise from the current two, the organization will have a popular vote from the citizen of member countries on whether to recognize the new state or to condemn it and demand it return it&amp;#39;s territories to the nation it seceded from.
