&amp;quot;It is every White Man&amp;#39;s duty to ensure the survival of his people and to provide a safe and secure future for his children! Our forefathers who built this land knew what it was like to face what they declared as a &amp;quot;Hostile Federal Government&amp;quot;, and gave us the Laws in which to take this authority back from those in government who are a detriment to our survival !  I assure you, that if you will stand as your forefathers once did, we will see this victory come about. To be hesitant at this hour will mean you have failed at your duty !&amp;quot;
