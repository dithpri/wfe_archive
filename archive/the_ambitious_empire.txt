The Ambitious Empire is an empire that is ambitious. Ambitious to achieve it&amp;#39;s goals of Equality, Fairness and Kindness. 

We believe that if you want to do something, you can do it, as long as you do not infringe upon the fairness of others. We work together to achieve our goals and achieve peace and prosperity. 

We are a roleplay region that roleplays a Medieval empire. However, we welcome all Tech levels.

We are also defender based. So, we look down upon Raiders and those who try and infringe on the Fairness and Kindness of regions.
