A javelin must rest in the palm, a spear gold-splattered.

A gem must be in the ring, standing high and wide.

The river must join with the waves, the tidal flood.

A mast must stand upon the ship, the sail-yard hanging.

The sword must be in the lap, the lordly iron.

The fish must be in the water, multiply its kind.

The king must wait in the hall, dealing in rings.

The bear must stand upon the heath, old and terrible.

The rivers must run downhill, flowing floodgray.

An army must stand together, a band ready for glory. 

Troth must be in the earl, wisdom in the man.

A hill must stand upon the earth, towering green.

God must be in heaven, the Judge of deeds.
