We&amp;#39;re an RP focused region, based on an original, work in progress fictional world, consisting of small city-states struggling to survive and dominate in a harsh, fantastical landscape full of magic, mystery, and the remains of a once-proud empire centered in the great city of Blackchapel. Anyone interested in joining, send a telegram to &amp;quot;The City of Blackchapel&amp;quot;, and we&amp;#39;ll get you set up as an original or already established group!
