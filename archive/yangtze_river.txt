[color=666666]The Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world. It flows for 3,988&nbsp;mi from the glaciers on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in Qinghai eastward across southwest, central and eastern China before emptying into the East China Sea at Shanghai. It is also one of the biggest rivers by discharge volume in the world.

Along with the Yellow River, the Yangtze is the most important river in the history, culture and economy of China. The prosperous Yangtze River Delta generates as much as 20% of the PRC&amp;#39;s GDP. &#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
