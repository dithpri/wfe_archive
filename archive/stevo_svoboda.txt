Hello! Welcome to the land of Stevo Svoboda, a world where storms are welcomed. We are a simple region that runs on few rules. We now, as of 6/6/14, welcome anybody to our grand region. We are currently setting up the brand-new government. This will be a great new golden age in this region, and we welcome you to join it. Our leaders are NationalDeath, Tea Party Country, the Vice Delegates, and yours truly, the Delegate. If you need ANYTHING at ALL, Telegram the Vice-Delegates, or I, the Delegate. Once the new government is formed, we will let you know. Majority of decision will be through private Delegate voting, or through a public poll. Check out the constitution! http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;amp;t=295049
