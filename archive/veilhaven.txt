A lone island shrouded in mist, surrounded by shadowy yet eerily calm waters.

As you approach its pale and lifeless shores, an unsettling chill runs over you. You look up and make out the peak of the island above you, a jagged blade of rock cutting through the grey shroud above. A circle of bright clouds surround the peak, creating a halo around its sharp point.

Below you, the dark waters yield no clues as to what lurks beneath. What looks like the shadow of a massive figure briefly begins to take shape, but you blink and the pale blue of the water remains calm and unyielding once more.

The chill down your spine returns, and you get the feeling that you are not wanted here.
