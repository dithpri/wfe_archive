In The Land of Bountiful Pandas we never go to war and we keep the Peace.  We belive that anyone can join as long as they don&amp;#39;t compromise the safety and peacew. You can have any view you want. The only types of Natoins I will not allow in my Reigon are: Ones want to cause war, ones who insult other nations for fun, and ones who bash on Pandas. (You don&amp;#39;t have to love them or like them, but please don&amp;#39;t Bash them). Hope you&amp;#39;ll join today!
