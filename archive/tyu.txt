[color=#FF8000]An island, formerly in international waters but gifted to the government of [nation=short]Tyu[/nation] by that of [nation=short]Malayan_Singapura[/nation]. About as big as Washington State, with terrain so large and diverse that you can literally go from summer to winter in a few hundred miles.[/color]

[color=#0080FF]These are the international diplomatic headquarters of [nation=short]Tyu[/nation]. We are open to regional embassies, and not afraid to request them ourselves. Please file a telegram with Tyu the nation (the founder of this region) if you desire a national embassy.[/color]
