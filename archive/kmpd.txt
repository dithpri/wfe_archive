The Land of the &amp;quot;Free,&amp;quot; Home of the &amp;quot;Brave&amp;quot; was created by people originating from the dandruff
of Karl Marx&amp;#39;s pubic hairs. They became sentient in the Paleozoic Era, fighting off giant amoeba in
a desperate attempt for survival. In that struggle, the idea for equality of the ruled was created, and
early communism occurred, and to lure the idiocy of the world in, asterisks we&amp;#39;re placeduring after &amp;quot;Free&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Brave&amp;quot; to confuse the lowlifes in the region. The region feasts on the delicacy of boiled peanuts, pickles
pickled in Kool-Aid, and Balut.
