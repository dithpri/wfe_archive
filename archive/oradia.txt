[b]Welcome to Oradia![/b]

Oradia is a relatively isolated region, in which countries are geographically and historically intertwined. The region includes a varied spectrum of countries, from democratic and dictatorial governments to communistic and capitalist economies.

The Kingdom of Naidaro, as the current leader of the region, is still consolidating her powers, and continues to set up a functional government, both domestically and for the region. However, we encourage any countries wishing to join the region to telegram the government of Naidaro, who will be pleased to help you out.
