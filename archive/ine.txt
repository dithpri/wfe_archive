 members believed that the planet Earth was about to be &amp;quot;recycled&amp;quot; (wiped clean, renewed, refurbished and rejuvenated), and that the only chance to survive was to leave it immediately. While the group was formally against suicide, they defined &amp;quot;suicide&amp;quot; in their own context to mean &amp;quot;to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered,&amp;quot; and believed that their &amp;quot;human&amp;quot; bodies were only vessels meant to help them on their journey. In conversation, when referring to a person or a person&amp;#39;s body, they routinely used the word &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot;; when shown a picture of his son in an interview, Monte commented, &amp;quot;Look, there&amp;#39;s the little vehicle.&amp;quot;
