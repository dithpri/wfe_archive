&#39;Magnum Spatium&#39; is Latin for &#39;Great Space&#39;.
This refers to the fact that we are a region located within the larger multiverse that consists of infinite universes.
Many different nations [should] make up Magnum Spatium, and the [supposedly] numerous factions and alliances divide Magnum Spatium into several sections. Yes, it has been argued, and argued with thrown chairs and thrown fists, that Magnum Spatium may as well be split into its alliances and factions, but it isn&#39;t. Yet.
