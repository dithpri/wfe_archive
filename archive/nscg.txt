 At Nations Seeking Common Goals (NSCG), We are here to help each other out in our conquest to make our nations prosperous. To keep this ideal intact, there must be two rules.
(1) Please Do Not Discriminate, Say Rasict Things, Put Down Any Nation&amp;#39;s Ideas, If you disagree on that matter, nicely state your opinion on that matter. These Items above are great ways to ruin the fun of this website. If a nation does not follow these principals, they will have a warning, the second time the nation will be voted to be banished, If 1/2 of the nation vote to not banish, the nation will not be able to take region votes for Two Weeks.
(2) Nations may can make new entry&amp;#39;s with 1/2 of the region agreeing, 3/4 of the region must agree to take down an entry.
