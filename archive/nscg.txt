At Nations Seeking Common Goals (NSCG), We are here to help each other out in our conquest to make our nations prosperous.
To keep this ideal intact, there must be six rules.
(1) Please Do Not Discriminate. This is a great way to ruin the fun of this website.
(2) Keep Racism out of any chat that is affiliated with this region, It is just rude and should be taken seriously.
(3) Do Not Put Down Any Nation&amp;#39;s Ideas. Nicely disagree and say your idea on that matter.
(4) Nations may create new entry&amp;#39;s only if 2/3 of the region agree on the matter
(5) Nations may disasemble entry&amp;#39;s only if 3/4 of the region agree on the taking down of that matter. 
(6) Every Nation Who Enters This Region Has The Right To One Warning.
