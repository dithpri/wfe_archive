This is Midian

&quot;Through arcades where the shimmering snowfall,
Lay in state with the sad and damned,
A rent lament barely flung above a whisper,
Drew Me like a ghost to the haunts of Man.&quot; ~ Saffron&#39;s Curse

Come and stay, but you will leave rather damned![/color][hr]

[b]Midian[/b] is a geographical place and a people mentioned in the Bible and in the Qur&#39;an. William G. Dever suggests it was located in the &quot;northwest Arabian Peninsula, on the east shore of the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea.&quot; Some scholars have claimed Midian was not a geographical area but a league of tribes. &#151;Wikipedia
