A dark, lonely planet orbiting a dim sun in a ragged galaxy at the edge of the universe. It is nearly barren, always practically night, nonillions of light years from the nearest nation. It is cold, lonely and only filled with the very dim light of its dying sun. We are forever trapped for it would take billions of years to reach the nearest nation. Hopefully, one day, we&#39;ll be noticed, the lonely pioneers who have settled the planet at the edge of the universe.
