The organisation was created by [i]noble[/i] politicians and their [i]generous[/i] corporate backers seeking to strengthen areas such as the [i]global economy[/i], by instituting free trade law&amp;#39;s, allowing all trade and merchant transports to enter and leave national borders as long as they have an issued license to do so. Another field was the forming of a regional [i]peacekeeping[/i] force to protect the imperialistic needs of the region.
