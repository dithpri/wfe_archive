[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] did the sneaky. 
Not satisfied with card tricks and chopping boxes into half, we decided to go on a quest to find the perfect junk food.

The perfect junk food is... healthily unhealthy.
This makes the perfect junk food a rarity.

We visited your region, hoping to find the perfect junk food, but found [color=red]healthy cabbages[/color] instead! We took them anyway and left this note.
