Welcome to the region, where you can share your politically incorrect opinions without being bullied by supporters of present political correctnes!

This region is not supporting :
1. Extremist views
2. Racism (does not count as racism when you say that there is a majority of crimes in the United States by a black minority or mentioning Rorke&#39;s Drift)
3. Don&#39;t put all people from sexual minorities in one bag. A small part of them are aware of what the movement really is and do not force their orientation on everyone. They don&#39;t even go public with it either. Same goes for races, not all blacks are criminals. 

Discord Server is coming soon, enjoy your stay here politically incorrect brothers and sisters!

You can roleplay here as well!
