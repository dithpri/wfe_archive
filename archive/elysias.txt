Elysias is a region with plenty of political discourse and interesting ideas. Located by the Pleiades, the world of Elysias is full of beautiful landscapes and diverse nations. Elysias is composed of many large islands. Although not mythologically themed, as the name might suggest, we do welcome all sorts of mythical ideas. -Although competing forces can be found on Elysias, the many different nations live in harmony. The history of Elysias is fraught with despair. Once ruled by the cruel eternal overlord of Kai Nation, the people grew tired of the oppressive life they lived. After a long civil war amongst the different people of the Elysias system and against the Kai, each nation achieved independence.
