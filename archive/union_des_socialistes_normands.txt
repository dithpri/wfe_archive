The Union of Norman Socialists is a socialist region. Its leading nation is the socialist Protectorate of Normandie Socialiste. The region is influenced by Democratic Republic of Mancelie, which has adopted Norman Socialism as well, since Socialist Normandy is under its control.

Norman Socialism is a political current which promotes orthodox marxism, council communism, and gives priority to primary and secondary sectors, such as agriculture, fishing, and industrial output. It also believes in culture as a real tool of emancipation of the people.

Main languages are French and Norman, but English is of course accepted, for practical reasons.
For historical and cultural reasons, speaking German is accepted and encouraged.
