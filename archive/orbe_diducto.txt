Orbe Diducto is a PMT continuity region that takes place nearly a third of the way into the 21st century. Political upheaval in the face of technological and social progress has led to a newly-shaped world, in the aftermath of civil strife. Governments have been overthrown, peacefully and otherwise. Now, as a new age begins, new players arrive on the stage to bring new change to the world yet again.
