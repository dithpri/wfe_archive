In the words of one Padmasa, &amp;quot;We have class, brilliance, and a proud history of nuking Godmoders&amp;quot; To join this region you must fulfill three requirements: 1: You must take RPing seriously, 2: Your nation must have an expansionist policy, 3: You must be anti-UN. Our Ally Regions: The Reich, Evermore, Crimson Sarmatia.[/i]
