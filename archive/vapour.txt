Greetings, I am Fanaglia, OP and Map Mistress of Vapor. Vapor is a steampunk RP group, as well as a region. You can visit the OOC thread, our main hub of operations, [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;t=280508]here[/url]. The world we have created for ourselves is [u]semi-realistic[/u], though some fantasy tech is allowed. 

Our story begins with an international conference on a continental railway system, hosted in Ticciano, Fanaglia, in 1885. Of course, as you should all know, time is not a strict progression of cause to effect, but [i]actually[/i], from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it&amp;#39;s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey wimey...stuff. Therefore, our narrative at any given time may be taking place in 1885, 1910, 1935, 1795, or whenever happens to suit our fancy.
