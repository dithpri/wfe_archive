[b][color=green]Welcome to City Ankh Morpork[/color][/b]

Poets have tried to describe City Ankh Morpork. They have failed. The city is rather robust for poets, who prefer daffodils and no wonder.
 Lets just say that Ankh Morpork is as full of life as an old cheese on a hot day, as loud as a curse in a cathedral, as bright and colourful as a bruise and as full of activity as a dead dog on a termite mound.
