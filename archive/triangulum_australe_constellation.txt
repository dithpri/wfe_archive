[i]Triangulum Australe is a small constellation in the far Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name is Latin for &quot;the southern triangle&quot;, which distinguishes it from Triangulum in the northern sky and is derived from the acute, almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by Petrus Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756.[/i][b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 04/05/2025.[/b]
