Two large islands separated by sea and in the middle a collection of much smaller islands. The Southern half of The Volk Isle is called South Blizz, and the northern island called the Red Forests. The middle set of islands is called the Dry land, which is now a barren wasteland after the many civil wars there took place before the two factions moved away into the two surrounding islands, leaving the wasteland. Both scarred from thee wars, but one fairing much worse than the other.
