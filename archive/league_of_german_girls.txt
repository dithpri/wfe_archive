The task of our Girls League is to raise our girls as torch bearers of the Nationalsocialist world. We need girls who are at harmony among their bodies, souls, and spirits. And we need girls who, through healthy bodies and balanced minds, embody the beauty of divine creation. We want to raise girls who believe in Germany and our Fuehrer, and who will pass these beliefs on to their future children.
