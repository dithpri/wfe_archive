AEGIS is a region for my main nation and its puppets in different realms. It recently allowed entry of New Oros, who promptly and unilaterally granted themselves executive authorities before adding other nations to the region without consultation or permission. New Oros also granted that nation executive authorities without consultation or permission. When the executive powers were removed by Cymrea, New Oros wiped the previous World Factbook entry before leaving the region with their companion nation, but without a word of explanation for any of their actions.
