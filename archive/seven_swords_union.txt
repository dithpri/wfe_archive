The Seven Swords Union was founded upon an agreement that the Seven Swords of Power cannot be allowed to fall into the hands of any single nation. Whilst through wars within the union the swords have passed hands several times whenever a nation seems to be gathering them together the rest of the union bands together to give out the swords again. The Seven Swords of Power are:
The Sword of Hope
The Sword of Harvest
The Sword of Loyalty - Held by Mythalonia
The Sword of Strength
The Sword of Fortune
The Sword of Cunning
