Welcome to the HQ of The Kameradschaft [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikorps]Freikorps[/url] visitor! 

This region follows in the proud tradition of the great nationalist hero Georg Maercker and the First Freikorps.

The Kameradschaft Freikorps is an Inter-Regional political movement, currently engaged in a number of undercover operations in the Red Bloc and looking to forge new alliances with all regions that support God, Nation and justice for the communist dogs! 

We welcome all new nations and encourage you to join the Kameradschaft organisation to expand our project for a united Right world.
