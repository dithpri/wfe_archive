[i][color=grey]According to what one of the elders said, 
taking an enemy on the battlefield 
is like a hawk taking a bird. 
Even though it enters into the midst 
of a thousand of them, 
it gives no attention to any bird 
other than the one 
it first marked.

Be thankful that in meeting our swords,
it was over so swiftly.
