[b]Welcome to the Maitai Union![/b]

We&#39;re a small group of friendly nations that all sit aside the peaceful Maitai river, where our delegates and leaders go to meet and discuss regional manners. If you&#39;ve just joined, feel free to say hello on the Regional Message Board and have a chat with some of our older members. If you&#39;re just visiting, you can pop one of our members a telegram to say hi or simply sit next to the water and enjoy yourself.

For all members: remember to endorse our WA delegate [nation]Roshar Skimbly[/nation], who is also our well-respected Minister of Silly Walks.

This region is password-protected, but if you&#39;re interested in joining feel free to send our governor-region [nation]Zalkhatann[/nation] a telegram, their diplomatic team will get you sorted out.
