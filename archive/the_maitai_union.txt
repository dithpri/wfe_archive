[b]Welcome to the Maitai Union![/b]

We&#39;re a small group of friendly nations that all sit aside the peaceful Maitai river, where our delegates and leaders go to meet and discuss regional manners (usually over tea and snacks). If you&#39;ve just joined, feel free to say hello on the Regional Message Board and have a chat with some of our older members. If you&#39;re just visiting, you can pop one of our members a telegram to say hi or simply sit next to the water and enjoy yourself.

For all members: remember to endorse our WA delegate [nation]Roshar Skimbly[/nation], who is also our well-respected Minister of Silly Walks.

This region is open to everyone, but those who join from raiding regions will be banned instantly.
