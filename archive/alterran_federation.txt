The Alterran Federation is a collective of allies who are based in the Nibaru Expanse, a vast region of space that is surrounded by several dense layers of thermobaric clouds, riddled with various anomalies, and home to a massive star forge.  Without proper guidance, the Expanse can be a hazardous place to traverse for non-native starships.

Members of The Alterran Federation are sovereign nations that work in cooperation in many matters ranging from trade and diplomacy to military drills and mutual defense.
