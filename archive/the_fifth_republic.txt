The region of the great. Those willing to work hard and work well will prosper. Those who do not will fail. This is the order of all things. We will drive the world into the next period of power. We are the tip of the spear. The capitalist and free nation that will guide our people to glory. All those here live in a region that has a time for all seasons. A time to live, a time to prosper, a time to succeed, and a time to be free.
