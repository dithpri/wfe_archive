It is nothing more than a replacement of the development of &quot;spirit&quot; (the self-movement of concepts) in Hegel&#39;s dialectics with &quot;labor.&quot; Marx attempted to liberate labor itself from &quot;capital,&quot; which is a form of labor&#39;s self-alienation, by taking &quot;labor&quot; as the subject, but in the end, this only placed the abstract &quot;laborer,&quot; an oppressive concept, as the ruler, and did not aim at the liberation of human beings. In other words, Marx&#39;s theory does not liberate humans, but only oppresses them to &quot;labor,&quot; and does not achieve self-liberation. While aiming for human liberation, Marx trivializes and oppresses humans to labor.
