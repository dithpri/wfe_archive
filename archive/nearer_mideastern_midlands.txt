After another earthquake struck the [region]Near Mideastern Midlands[/region], nearly all of its land was shifted yet again closer to the middle east.

It is effectively the same region as before, but reorganized into a standard region


The [region]Nearer Mideastern Midlands[/region] is a gameplay based region, focused more on stat building rather than deeper roleplay interactions. (This isn&#39;t to say that they don&#39;t happen, but they aren&#39;t the main focus of this region)

The current Secretariat of this region is [nation]Neprutia[/nation]

The current WA delegate of this region is [nation]Neprutia[/nation], please endorse them!
