The Dominion of Euthoria rose from the ashes of a fractured nation after years of civil war and bloodshed. Initially founded as the Euthorian Free State, its democratic ideals were swept away under Hoffman&#146;s leadership, transforming it into an authoritarian state steeped in propaganda and control. The Dominion wields its power through a web of brutal agencies, including the Benevolent Guard and the Truth Keepers, ensuring compliance through fear, surveillance, and manipulation.
