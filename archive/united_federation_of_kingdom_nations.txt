The United Federation of Kingdom Nations (2018 a.t.b.-Present) is a new coalition of states created to unite the nation of the world after the fall of Britannia. Many of its laws are centered around the United Kingdoms Charter, and obligations towards the Charter supersede the laws of individual nations. Decisions in the U.F.N. are determined by a two-thirds majority vote by the leaders of each country, with the population of each country determining their voting percentage.
