Welcome to the beginnings of the early but modern [region]United Caliphates[/region].

A bit like the [region]Arab League[/region], we are attempting to incorporate all Muslim nations, from Morocco to Indonesia, we are uniting the people under the name of religion, freedom and democracy.
You will feel safe, secure, and you won&#146;t feel discriminated against, as you would in other regions.

Join the [region]United Caliphates[/region], and help us build this dream into a reality!

[i][This region was formed as retaliation to the invasion of the region [region]Islamic States[/region], and to protect the Muslims who originally lived in the [region]Islamic States[/region] from the brutal, oppressive western regimes of [region]The League[/region] and their regional allies. Our region however has no relation to the [region]Islamic States[/region] whatsoever.][/i]
