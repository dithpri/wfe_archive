[b]Welcome![/b] to the NS Project.

We&#39;re a roleplaying region, founded on the concept of [B]collaborative roleplaying[/B]. We&#39;re here to write a cohesive, enjoyable story - one that we can all contribute to, and one that we can all enjoy. We&#39;re still getting ourselves off the ground right now, but you&#39;re more than welcome to help us forge something here, or on our Discord!
