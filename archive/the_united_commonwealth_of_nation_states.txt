The United Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states.

Member states have no legal obligation to one another. Instead, they are united by democratic principles. The head of the Commonwealth has no intergovernmental power but the WA Delegate has the duty to maintain communication, trade, and human rights. 

The Commonwealth expresses support for Life, Liberty, and Freedom, and thus supports standard Laissez-Faire Capitalism, HOWEVER socialist nations are permitted to be member-states so long as they&#39;re aware that they cannot infringe other nations&#39; rights.
