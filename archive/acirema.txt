As President We will Not Pass Laws Enforcing Our Citizens to Have Health Care And If They Don&amp;#39;t Have Healthcare,We Will Not Penalize Them and Withhold Thier Taxes From Them.The Real America Has Become A Dictatorship,And The President Will Soon Pass A Law Saying You Have To Go To Church Or You Will Be Put To Death. The Pope will also Enforce and Back His Idealogy.When They Meet In New York Be Suprised For The Most Shocking In All Of History Combined.As An American,I will not Stand For These Preposterous Ideas.
