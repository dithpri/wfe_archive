Republika Srpska, or Srpska for short, is a state in balkan created during the combined fascist-islamist offensive against the local civilian population in Bosnia. It withheld the extremist onslaught for 4 years, but was eventually forced to disarm after NATO non-provoked full-scale aggression in 1995, but the terrorists didnt win since the local population managed to preserve 50% of the territory, which is free and democratic today, although as part of western artificial state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an overt EU governor and chronic provocations from the radicalized people on the other side.
