The south central European country Slovenia stretches between the Adriatic Sea and the Alps. In 1918 the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new nation named Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though communist, distanced itself from Moscow&amp;#39;s rule. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power of the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991. Since then, Slovenia has successfully integrated into the international community and is becoming a full member of the European Union and joins NATO.
