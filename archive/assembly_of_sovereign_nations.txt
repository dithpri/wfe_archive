The Assembly of Sovereign Nations stands opposed to the consolidating and homogenizing forces of globalism. Let us forsake the visions of tyrants and fools who wish to pare humanity down to one people, one mode of thought, and one way of life. Instead, let us aspire to the righteous acknowledgement that all distinct peoples have the natural prerogative to assert their independence from universalizing designs and that all might live in harmony when practicing [i]peace, commerce, and honest friendship between nations[/i].
