Chop Suey was founded 09 March, 2013 as a region for EVERYONE. We welcome ALL forms of government and economies. We are open to all views and opinions. There is but one rule in Chop Suey and that is the Golden Rule - Do unto others! Just please be tolerant and respectful of others - Rudeness and troublemakers will NOT be tolerated. In Chop Suey we celebrate our differences and diversity!
Chop Suey is a pleasant place to park your puppet too.

We are especially monarchist friendly!
