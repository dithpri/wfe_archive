Hello neighbours!

For a mistake in the spelling of our region (&#39;devided&#39; and not &#39;divided&#39;), we will move to a new region. Please move your nations to [region]THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA[/region] as soon as possible. Of course all claims will stay as they are and nobody will loose the space on the map as long as you move over to the new region.

If a nation is not moving to the new region within three days, the claim will be free for newbies again.

I have to apologize for all the inconvenience, I am no native speaker and I hope you can excuse my mistake.

Kind Regards,
Dennis Timberman
