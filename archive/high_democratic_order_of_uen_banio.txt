The H-DOUB (H-DOOB) is a Democratic alliance ruled by the Malgeria which aims for peace, freedom equality, democracy and abolishment of weapons and ideally one day the military.
Membership is free, in the same way as the United Nations. Members should endorse Malgeria, and they will get an endorsement in return. The only &#39;idelogical&#39; requirement is to have no nuclear weapons, or be disarming them.
