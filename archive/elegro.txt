Once upon a time not long ago, layed the land of Elegro. It was a magical land where elves thrived, until the boat men arrived with their boatloads of men. These men thought the elves were dumb so they killed them and settled the land. There were these dudes who liked ice, and they said north time and founded Mrazak until Plenty of Ice was all like Mrazak dumb and left. Down in the south was El Teraro and then these old grandpas said they were Spleenis now. Then these other nations kind of exist, the end.
