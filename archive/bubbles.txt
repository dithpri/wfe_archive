Hello there. We&#39;ve been expecting your arrival for quite some time.

Haha, please ignore that! We really haven&#39;t been expecting you but we really want you to join! And guess what!? We&#39;ve saved a little (or big, depending on your nation) spot just for you in our region! Ok now that sounds like it should be on a greeting card. It&#39;s cheesy, so cheesy.

I&#39;m really not good at writing these things.

But join! If you join you will get a friendly environment, many activities, and a chance to find a place where you belong! 

Wow, I just get cheesier but the second :D 

So join. We&#39;ll be glad to have you!
