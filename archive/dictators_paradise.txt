This region is conservative, traditionalist, capitalist and far-right. A haven for corporate police states, iron-fisted consumerists, dictators, juntas, oligarchs, authoritarians, free-market paradises and right-wing utopias. The military industrial complex thrives the best here. Banking and heavy industry also remain prevalent here.
