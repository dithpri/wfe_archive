This region is Roman Catholic, conservative, traditionalist, capitalist and far-right. A haven for corporate police states, iron-fisted consumerists, dictators, juntas, oligarchs, authoritarians, free-market paradises and right-wing utopias. The military industrial complex thrives the best here. Banking and heavy industry also remain prevalent here. Oil barons, tech companies and other heavy industry are welcomed with open arms.
