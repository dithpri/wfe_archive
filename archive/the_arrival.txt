Welcome to The Arrival. Here, you will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in this history of mankind. Mankind -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can&#39;t be consumed by our petty differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. You will be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation. We&#39;re fighting for our right to live, to exist.

And should we win the day, it will be known as the day when the world declared in one voice:

We will not go quietly into the night!
We will not vanish without a fight!
We&#39;re going to live on!
We&#39;re going to survive!

Today, we celebrate our Independence!
