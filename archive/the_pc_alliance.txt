During the dark of the night, three savage raiders appeared out of their holes in the ground, taking the entire village by complete and utter surprise. Offering no resistance, the brave raiders quickly beat the helpless inhabitants into submission. However, during the middle of the night when the raid was at it&#39;s most carnage, a rogue arrow struck [nation=boys_generally_asian], never to raid again.
The three raiders were [nation=Et mors ignis] , [nation=The Savage Geeks] and the fallen knight who was mortally injured on tonight&#39;s raid, [nation=boys_generally_asian].
This region was raided courteously of [region=Darkspawn]!
