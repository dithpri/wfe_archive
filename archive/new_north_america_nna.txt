[b]Welcome[/b] to [region]New North America NNA[/region]! All nations within NNA are free to run their countries the way they desire! Once the region gets up and running, we will hold elections for different positions of power. Telegram [nation]Robinapolis[/nation] or [nation]Iludan[/nation] for more info! We are happy to help! [b][u][i]NOTE[/b][/u][/i], more offices will be created and opened up for election once the region begins to grow.
[b][i]However[/b][/i], we do request that you make your currency the [b]&amp;#39;Canadica&amp;#39;[/b]. So that our region may obtain one universal currency. If this does not appeal to you, no harm done, It is merely a hopeful suggestion.
