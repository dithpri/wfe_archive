This region (by [nation]Ukgb England[/nation]) had been slowly dying out for several months now without a password and the region&#39;s under-protected status was quite worrying to [nation]The Anglo-Celtic Ambassador[/nation]

1. It was quite obvious that we were bound to be subjected to a tag-raid eventually if we (I) didn&#39;t take action IMMEDIATELY through a refound.

2. We in TACE would&#39;ve all lost our RO positions if any potential tag-raid were to occur which would&#39;ve definitely rendered (my) will to stay here completely useless!

It is also important to note that because of [nation]Doggo Yoggo[/nation]&#39;s failed attempt to grief [region]EmbassyRegi0nia[/region] and destroy its embassies, this is what served as the final straw for me to refound and protect The Anglo-Celtic Empire from becoming a raider&#39;s toothpick.
