This region (by [nation]Ukgb England[/nation]) had been slowly dying out for several months now without a password and the region&#39;s under-protected status was quite worrying to [nation]The Anglo-Celtic Ambassador[/nation]

1. It was quite obvious that we were bound to be subjected to a tag-raid eventually if no action was taken to prevent it.

2. We in TACE would&#39;ve all lost our RO positions if any potential tag-raid were to occur which would&#39;ve definitely rendered my will to stay here completely useless

With that being said, The Anglo Celtic Empire shall be 
permanently protected from becoming a raider&#39;s toothpick. You&#39;re welcome :)
