Welcome to Axia!

If you are a big fan of Blackberry Jam, please ask to join the Order of the Blackberry. 

If you want to talk about string theory and quantum physics, then you&#39;re definitely in the right place! SOMEBODY is probably willing to discuss something Science-y. 

Please endorse our Diplomancy Officer, the Queendom of Waylaxia.

ALL ARE WELCOME HERE! Any nation who wishes to call Axia home may, as long as they aren&#39;t one of the jerks who band together to take over nations. (You know who you are.) In Axia, we are not afraid to ban those nations.

Update: Poll- week of 4/21/19
We would like to apologize for the poll this week, as some of the letters are squashed together. Please don&#39;t let this stop you from voting on the poll!
