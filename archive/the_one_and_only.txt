The One and Only is a refound of a region that has long since ceased to exist

The idea behind [region]The One and Only[/region] is to be a region that welcomed any nation willing to join. We are continuing that practice. No matter your personal or political beliefs, there is a place for you here. We like to think our tolerance sets us apart from other regions because we do not fear change. Political affiliation does not matter here. 

Together, we will forge onward, making our own history. The only question is, will you be a part of it?
