This is a nation for radicals of all types. Communists, anarchists, libcaps, fascists,(not nazis, see rule 1) and monarchists, anyone who&#39;s against the status quo. Status quo nations (conservatives, libs, socdems) are not accepted.


Rules

1: No bigoty, we&#39;ll decide if something is truly a &quot;joke&quot; or not.
2: No sectarianism, it&#39;s fine to criticize another ideology (ex: say anarchism leads to chaos) but don&#39;t accuse the others of not being &quot;real radicals&quot;.
3: Casual debate is heavily encouraged. Similarly, be prepared for someone to debunk your criticism.
4: Not technically a rule, but please suggest podcasts, literature, etc on your ideology.

Remember, be radical, have principles, be absolute, be that which your enemies call an extremist.
