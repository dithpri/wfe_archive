[color=red][b]WELCOME, COMRADES![/b][/color]
Welcome to The Third International, a region dedicated to furthering the cause of the international proletariat. Despite ideological differences, the nations of this region are dedicated to increase economic equality, give the means of production to the working class, and bring about a new dawn of freedom. All leftist nations&#151;from anarchists to democratic socialists to well-meaning dictatorships&#151;are welcome here, as long as their goal is to bring about a bright dawn for the masses and abolish capitalism.
