Welcome to Monarchist-Imperialist World

This region has many purposes:
*Firstly it is a region for monarchist versions of existing nations (Kingdom of France, Empire of Mexico, etc.)
*Secondly it is a region of fictional nations set in the real world; I thought Great Biscay up as an island nation west of France, north of Spain &amp;amp; south of the English channel. (Max Barry said that real world nations do not exist in NationStates but they do in Monarchist-Imperialist world).
*Thirdly it is a region that can be used to store colonies in.
