&quot;You see, the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the bad people. And you&#39;re good at that, I&#39;ll grant you. But the trouble is it&#39;s the only thing you&#39;re good at. One day it&#39;s the ringing of the bells and the casting down of the evil tyrant, and the next it&#39;s everyone sitting around complaining that ever since the tyrant was overthrown no one&#39;s been taking out the trash. Because the bad people know how to plan. It&#39;s part of the specification, you might say. Every evil tyrant has a plan to rule the world. The good people don&#39;t seem to have the knack.&quot; - Terry Pratchett, &#39;Guards! Guards!&#39;
