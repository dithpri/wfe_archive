[b]May the gagging cause rest in a peaceful sleep forever![/b]
 
Welcome to the Last legion, we are home to the few remaining soldiers of the original failed Gagging rebellion in [region]Deep Storage[/region]. We few remain loyal to the ideals of the rebellion. But unlike the Original Gagging free army we wish to live in peace... and practice our beliefs in solitude. The Legion is a small region where her Citizens are Entitled to practice the rebellions spam beliefs and complete freedom of speech. The government of the Legion is small and is led by the military.
[b]announcements: we are currently not excepting new citizens/Soldiers[/b]
