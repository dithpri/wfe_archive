This region has been refounded in the interest of preventing any hostile factions from refounding and disgracing this region and it&#39;s good name. For the time being this region is largely abandoned but any nations new or old who wander upon it are welcome to reside here! If old members would like to begin rebuilding the region at some point, send me ([nation]outback republic[/nation]) a telegram and i will get back to you as soon as i can, however, this nation isn&#39;t very active so expect it to take some time. Any old flags, forums links, factbook entries, and administration roles(descriptions, powers, names etc.) would be helpful.
