A sanctuary to freedom loving nations, originally located in the Commonwealth of Man. Though raiders come and go, never shall we fall. Quis separabit?

Our old creed reads as follows:

We seek the destruction of any and all communists, anarchists, and various other threats to the future cultural and financial prosperity of mankind. Members have a certain degree of autonomy: We will not intervene in their internal and external policies unless there is a significant threat to the Commonwealth.
