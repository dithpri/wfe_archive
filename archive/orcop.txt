A glorious welcome to all surviving nations of Orcop, the region has been defended from the barbaric hordes of the east and will return to its former glory!

Into battle rode Prince Hans Ulrich III of Kovera, the knights of both Kovera and Middland and a joint force of over 150,000 soldiers recruited from all nations within Orcop. Also a new password has been put in place to prevent further invasion so please send a telegram to the royal court in Kovera if you wish for someone to join.

Please show your support of the region by endorsing Kovera, to prevent any more invasions.
