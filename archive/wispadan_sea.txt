[nation]Got-Ya-Good[/nation] [color=009DFF]from [/color][url=region=Thaecia][color=009DFF][b][u]Thaecia[/u][/b][/url] came today with us and made us miss many targets! He kept making Altys lose focus smh. Oh also he was literally taking part in another tag run at the same time which explains why he came from weird regions every jump. Thankfully we didn&#39;t get chased, would&#39;ve been awkward for the chasers otherwise.[/color] [url=https://discord.gg/RYgzby8][color=009DFF][b]Join Thaecia here![/color][/url][/b]
