Mindias is a region filled with lush forests and beautiful mountains. It is a place to find peace.

The different countries around the region of Mindias share values in the importance of their faiths. This ancient land, once the home to the original Gods and Goddesses of Mindias different cultures, has survived for centuries, unbroken and undisturbed by human hands. It is one of the rare places where the faiths still hold sway, and where the value of nature, faith, culture and even silence still exist, leaving a vivid and mysterious imprint on the landscape.

And so in the hopes to keep our religions strong we must join forces despite our differences to face this rapidly changing world.
