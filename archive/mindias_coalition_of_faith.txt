Mindias is a region filled with lush forests and beautiful mountains. It is a place to find peace, and in the green light, spirits of the plants all around you.

The different countries around the region of Mindias share values in both faith and nature. This ancient land, once the home to the original Goddess, has survived for centuries, unbroken and undisturbed by human hands. It is one of the rare places where the goddess still hold sway, and where the value of nature, faith, culture and even silence still exist, leaving a vivid and mysterious imprint on the landscape.

And so in the hopes to keep our religion strong and to protect the beautiful nature around us this coalition has been formed.
