We are the people, born of fire and revolution, who seek to refine your life.  We are a people, once opressed, who have risen through our fire ever-burning and through the sheer willpower of the people.  Come to us, all who are weary of opression, and find safety here, in a realm where militaristic goals and peaceful promises unite to form a unique and loving home, where all are welcome.  Hail to the Revolution!
