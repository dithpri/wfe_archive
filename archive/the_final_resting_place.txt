Good bye everyone.

I know I&amp;#39;ve said that I&amp;#39;m leaving and I came back before, but that was back when I still had a connection to the game through DUAN. Since I haven&amp;#39;t found a new one, I&amp;#39;m taking this as a signal to move on with my life and focus more on my future, which matters more than an online game.

So thank you all that I&amp;#39;ve met and became friends with, I hope you all succeed in life and plan for the future :)

Next time you hear of me, it&amp;#39;ll be after I&amp;#39;ve developed a revolutionary medical device that allows the blind to see again or for the first time. Or, if before then, you might meet me at a great university over here in the NE.

Anyway, enjoy life, I hope it will be fulfilling!
