Welcome to all to our little oasis of Liberty in a sea of tyranny.
The Beach House is open 24/7 for Boat Drinks, and BBQ.

We are a region of true Liberty, and all that it really means. 
Commieservatives, Goosestepping Fascists, Progtarded Nannystatists, and pretentious hypersensitive Marxoids, 
will be mocked endlessly, and laughed out the door.

More Government is not the answer.

Tell me something, it&#39;s still &quot;We the people&quot;, right?
Ruby Ridge, Waco, Bundy Ranch.

Don&#39;t Tread on Us.[/color][hr]
