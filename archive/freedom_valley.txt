Welcome to Freedom and Respect for All!

In our region, we forbid member nations from any form of genocide or slavery. If a member nation is found to have committed these acts, they shall be expelled from the region. We respect other nations and our citizens with the goal of ending hatred and bigotry towards others. 

If you believe in these two acts should be banned, join us in our fight!
