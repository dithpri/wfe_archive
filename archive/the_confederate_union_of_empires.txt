The Confederate Union of Empires is an intergovernmental military alliance tasked with maintaining international trade and security between members, while also giving them full independence to rule their own nations the way they want, without much interference from fellow members and foreign powers, except during war when each and every member is tasked with defending each other from foreign threats. Members are, however, allowed to voice their opinion on what their world assembly delegate should vote on, who are no more than a representative of the Confederacy.
