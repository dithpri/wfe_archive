The Popular Front was a Spanish coalition of left wing political organizations with the goal of securing the Spanish elections in 1936 and as well as securing social reforms in the government. 

Our region aims to unite Leftists of Nationstates with the same spirit as the historical Popular Front. Wether you are a social democrat, Communist or Anarchist, all leftists are welcome.
