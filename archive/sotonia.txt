A guy walks into a bar with his pet dog. The bartender says, &amp;quot;No pets allowed.&amp;quot;

The man replies, &amp;quot;This is a special dog. Turn on the Jets game and you&amp;#39;ll see. Whenever the Jets score, my dog does flips.&amp;quot;

The Jets keep scoring field goals, and the dog keeps flipping and jumping.

&amp;quot;Wow! What happens when the Jets score a touchdown?&amp;quot;

The man replies, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;ve only had him for 7 years.&amp;quot;
