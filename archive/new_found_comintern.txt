The Communist International (Comintern), known also as the Third International (1919&#150;1943), was an international communist organization that advocated world communism. The Comintern resolved at its Second Congress to &quot;struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state&quot;. The Comintern was founded after the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference in which Vladimir Lenin had organized the &quot;Zimmerwald Left&quot; against those who refused to approve any statement explicitly endorsing socialist revolutionary action, and after the 1916 dissolution of the Second International.
