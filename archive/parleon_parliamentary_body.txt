The seat of power for the Federation of Parleon. The principality of Eleasias serves as the federal capital. 

The WA delegate is an elected office. Following an election the Capital will call upon the delegate to form a government. A government will consist of:
   Prime Minister (Official position given to the delegate)
   Vice-Delegate (Advises delegate and submits proposals on behalf of all members to the delegate)
   Minister for Parliament (Responsible for communication, polling, managing the government and calling for votes on behalf of electors)

If there is no WA delegate the Capital will form an interim government with its own representative as the Prime Minister.
