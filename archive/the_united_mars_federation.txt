[b][color=crimson]Thanks to [nation]Underhill[/nation] this region has been reclaimed by its original founder, [nation]Olympia[/nation].

This region served as a temporary home for the exiled nations of The United Earth Federation before a permanent one could be created. The United Mars Federation is part of [region]The DFN Commonwealth[/region], which in itself is a part of [region]The Japerican Imperial Commonwealth[/region], consider relocating to [region]Japerica[/region] today! ^_^
