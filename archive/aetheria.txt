Aetheria is a parallel universe inhabited by nations, both Aetherian and non-Aetherian. Aetherian nations only exist to nations which have granted them diplomatic recognition. A group of Aetherian nations have formed the Aetherian International Alliance, which is the supreme authority in determining which nations are Aetherian.
