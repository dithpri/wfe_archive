NEW ANTARCTICA- Recently, the new WA delegate, [nation=noflag]Zymal[/nation], was ousted from power because of his resignation from the World Assembly. In his place, Semi-Jeff party member [nation=noflag]FalconVille[/nation] was elected by other members of the Semi-jeff party members, namely, rabble-rouser [nation=noflag]Fyrevania[/nation]. 
&quot;I see this as only a setback. The Fopinionist party has the most members and all in all, has more power. We will have a Fopinionist in the Delegacy by the end of the month,&quot; claims esteemed Fopinionist leader [nation]Kusaie[/nation]. It seems the Fopinionist party will not stop until equality is achieved by all.
