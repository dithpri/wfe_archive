NEW ANTARCTICA- On the message board, speeches have been flying between esteemed Speaker of Congress [nation=short]Zymal[/nation] and the glorious founder, [nation=short]Atyacari[/nation]. These nations are discussing why our AWESOME region remains to have an executive founder.[hr][color=green][u]The Two Sides[/u][/color]
&quot;Once we begin to become active in interregional politics and conflicts, we will probably attract the eye of large invader regions who may respond. As long as the WA delegate has no executive or border control powers, our AWESOME region is perfectly safe,&quot; says Atyacari in favor of an executive Founder.
