-Welcome to the Union of Free and Independant States! Yeah, yeah we spelled [u]Independent[/u] wrong, but too late now. The UFIS (for short) is essentially the UN, but not the WA. This is a separate universe from the main universe of the main regions (Pacific, North Pacific, etc) and as such shares a totally different map. On January 20, 2018, we opened our gates to the outside world for the first time since November 21, after we were raided and made a puppet by [b][region]Lily[/region][/b]. Now, all nations are welcome.
