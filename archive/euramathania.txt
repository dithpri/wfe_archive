Far out in the uncharted nebulas of the unpronounceable end of the Northern Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unremarkable yellow sun. Orbiting at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think public displays of fire bending is a really neat idea.
