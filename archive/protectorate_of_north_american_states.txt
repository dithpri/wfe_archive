The Protectorate of North American States was created after the collapse of the United States following the Third World War.  Canada is Lord Protector of the Protectorate and is the only member state that joined voluntarily after the Protectorate&#39;s creation.  The Northern Rockies Autonomous States are the most active non-governing member due to it being under the administration of the Lord Protector Canada.  The Second Texan Republic, Neo-American Republic, and New-America Republic were all forced to join, but are not active participants.  Rather the three &quot;Republics&quot; are constantly at war with one another in an attempt to gain control of the Protectorate.  However, they are causing the Protectorate to destabilize even further.
