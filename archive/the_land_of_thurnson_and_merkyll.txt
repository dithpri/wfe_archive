The Land Of Thurnson And Merkyll is a region that is comprised of the Thurnson And Merkyll Island Nations. Our motto is &quot;Following the Beat Of Our Own Drum&quot; And that will be our mindset for quite a while as this fairly new nation develops, so for now any attempts to interact with this region will be rejected. See you!
