[b][nation]ClarusIllustrus[/nation] was a character. He ruled TFR. He altered the regime of [region]THE W0RLD[/region]. He was in some ways good, but mostly bad. He was condemned by [region]The Freedom Alliance[/region]. He was removed from the game. Thus ends [nation]ClarusIllustrus[/nation]&#39;s story.[/b]
[hr]
[region]The Free Republics[/region] is under [region]THE W0RLD[/region]&#39;s occupation/control. TFR is a shell of what it used to be. All of the former residents, disgraced. However, this is the new beginning. Join TFR now. We want you.
