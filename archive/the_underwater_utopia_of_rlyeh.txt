[region]The Underwater Utopia of Rlyeh[/region], led by its fearless ruler, [nation]Squagnar[/nation], is dedicated to the betterment of its people, and the eventual destruction of [region]The Demonuist Halidom[/region]. After the wrongful dethroning of [nation]Squagnar[/nation] in [region]The Demonuist Halidom[/region], our brave leader led the way to this new paradise, a land where he can live without the constant fear of sudden betrayal. Now the people of this great region live in peace and prosperity, no longer tormented by inattentive and overall worse leaders.

Praise be to Squagnar!
