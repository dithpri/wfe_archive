Anyone may join Novum Aurora but you can never declare war on fellow nations here.  We try to advocate peace and neutrality.  You may form alliances, but they may not be militaristic or imperialist or any form of arms race.  The region&amp;#39;s motto is: Populus Que Novum Aurora (People of New Dawn).
