Rezniah is a roleplay region aiming for a more modern-day roleplay. There are actually three levels of government within the region, of which one is optional.

[b]Local Governments[/b] are those of the nations.
The [b]Regional Government[/b] is the region-wide government, managed by the Reznian Council. This council consists of the (Vice) President of the Council, Secretaries and their departments, and ofcourse the nations who are simply a member of the council.
Optionally, in the near future, Rezniah might join the [b]World Assembly[/b] who will in turn also have a say in the regional and local matters.

Most of the Roleplay is done on discord over here: https://discord.gg/uk8csKt
A map is in the making, and will soon be available.
