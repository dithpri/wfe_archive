[i][b][color=red]In the Name of Almighty God,
we gather this day in reverence and awe.[/color]

[color=green]Christ is our Head,
Scripture our guide,
the Spirit our strength.[/color]

[color=blue]We proclaim:
This Church is not of man&#146;s design,
but of God&#146;s eternal will.
Here the Gospel shall be preached,
here the Cross shall be lifted high,
here the fire of the Spirit shall never be quenched.[/color]

[color=orange]We covenant:
To walk in holiness,
to love one another,
to serve the world,
to stand firm through trial and storm.[/color]

[color=brown]Therefore we declare:
This house is the Lord&#146;s.
This people are His own.
This light shall shine to the nations.[/color]

[color=purple]Glory, power, and praise
be unto the Triune God,
forever and ever.[/color]

[color=yellow]Amen.[/color][/b][/i]
