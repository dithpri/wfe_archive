The current year is [b]2151 AD[/b], over 150 years since the world engaged in the first (and last) [b]global nuclear war[/b]. Conflict stemmed from tensions between the collectivist Minsk Conference in the Eastern hemisphere and the moralist Atlantic League in the west. Now, very little remains of the pillars of the &#39;Old World&#39; - only sinking ruins of these &#39;great powers&#39; exist in a graveyard of a world.

[i]Eschaton[/i] is a [b]post-apocalyptic PMT[/b] region taking place in apocalyptic ruins of a [u]post-nuclear Earth[/u]. It is a small project, mostly focused on regional world building and character driven story lines.
