Shadowy plains that dominate much of northern Russia. This large expanse of blackened land is home to many barren villages that ceased to exist after a government accident in 1874. As time passed, people slowly began to reoccupy the ruined villages, rebuilding them. These villages gradually expanded to form the state of Akilis. As more villages were founded, a small group of people created an artificial government to create laws for the cities. Eventually, the group decided to make Akilis into a nation of its own, and the blackened plains dotted in life became Drakmoor.
