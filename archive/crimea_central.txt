This is a region created by [nation]Latin Crimea[/nation] and was entirely for his alts but now outsiders are welcome

This region supports [region]The North Pacific[/region]

Residents of Regional Embassies are able to post on Crimea Centrals Board

Rules:
-No spamming (even if what your spamming is something good like [nation]Aerilia[/nation] pings)
-No hate speech (that includes hate speech towards cheese)
-No being annoying (like my friend that won&#146;t stop saying the most annoying things ever)
-No committing war crimes
-No racial slurs
But these rules are like the speed limit on a road in the US, kind of just a suggestion, but still enforced. Still, just try to follow the rules, it would help out a lot!
-No abusing power

Have fun :D (optional)
