The Technocratic Collective of Asteron is a group of nations with the common goal of total technological superiority. The founding principle of this region is intelligence is strength, and to that end we will peruse knowledge by any means necessary. Those who would object on grounds of &#147;morality&#148; or &#147;human rights&#148; are weak&#133; and the strong will conquer the weak.
