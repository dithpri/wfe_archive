Welcome to The Giraffe Federation,

Founded Oct 20 2021, The administrative annex of The Giraffe Federation is serving as a puppet storage sanctuary for about 100 resident giraffe puppet states.

Federation&#39;s center piece is the elevated giraffeton plains, overlooking a ring of giraffe states with views of spires protecting the mainland while more distant giraffe states float as a patchwork archipelago.
