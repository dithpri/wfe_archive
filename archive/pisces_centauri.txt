**Notice**
After fruitful negotiations with the kind founder of [region]World Alliance[/region], we have agreed to merge our regions. The merger will take however long it is necessary, and anyone who wishes to come are welcome to join.

**UPDATE**
The merger is pretty much complete, and the kind founders of [region]World Alliance[/region] have no problem keeping [region]Pisces Centauri[/region] open, and members, old and new, are always welcome to stay here, and are encouraged to join World Alliance, if possible. Hope you have a great time!
