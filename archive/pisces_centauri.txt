[color=8A0707][b]*Notice to Invader Regions*:[/b][/color]
Please stop cancelling the embassies I have with the regions you invade.

[color=Green][b]*Note about Embassies:*[/b][/color] If you send Pisces Centauri an embassy request and it expires, we apologize for our lack of an immediate response; we will reciprocate in kind and send our own embassy request if we miss yours. Maybe not right away, but it will happen. Thank you! :)
