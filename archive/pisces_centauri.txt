[b]Pisces Centauri[/b] is an artificial star of spectral class F7V detonated into existence by the Plutonian Empire, just two light years away from Sol, in the constellation of Pisces.

[color=Green][b]*Note about Embassies:*[/b][/color] If you send Pisces Centauri an embassy request and it expires, we apologize for our lack of an immediate response; we will reciprocate in kind and send our own embassy request if we miss yours. Maybe not right away, but it will happen. Thank you! :)
