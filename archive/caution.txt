[b]NationStates is full of elitist regions looking to encroach on the right of freedom and democracy in smaller regions. Caution will function to alert regions to the crimes and the potential actions they may take against other regions, and will alert nations in or joining Elitist regions to reconsider their decisions. Pay caution and prevent calamity.[/b]


Contrary to the [nation]Alerter[/nation] project, Caution will continue to serve as a warning to those joining or being threatened by elitist regions. We will continue to protect smaller regions from the elitist regions.
