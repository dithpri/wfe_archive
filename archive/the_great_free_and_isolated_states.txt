You can feel free to participate as much as you&amp;#39;d like in this region, or as little as you&amp;#39;d like. Your rights here will be respected so long as you respect the rights of other sovereign nations, give your people freedom and equality, and aren&amp;#39;t an ass in world politics. You can only be ejected if your a thorn in internal politics, or your citizens are treated poorly. So go on, grow your nation &amp;#39;o great leader. Make it a prosperous, and glorious land.
