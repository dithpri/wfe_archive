The small region of Cartographia is meant to serve as the center international diplomatic and cooperative channel of the World that surrounds the small continent of Baughistan. This will serve as the place for working on the world map, making deals, having fun discussions, coordinating roleplays, and so on.

I would like to say that I hope that God and the Lord Jesus Christ can be honored in some way with this work of ours. Perhaps it can be in the use of our creative spirit, or perhaps being friendly to one another even if we have an RP war. We will stand on the truth of God&amp;#39;s word and the gospel -- that is the main rule here! So, welcome one and all!
