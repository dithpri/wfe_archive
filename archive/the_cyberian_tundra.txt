(WIP) The cyberian tundra is a harsh, desolate place, where only the strong can survive. The Tundrarians founded and terraformed the region into an impenetrable fortress where they can build their army and easily defend from invaders. Other nations are welcome to join so long as they hold to the same (or at least, similar) standards and strive for military supremacy.
