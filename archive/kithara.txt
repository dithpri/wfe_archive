Although the cold war ended decades ago, in the region of Kithara it continues between the socialist [nation]Ardelias[/nation] and capitalist [nation]Vinsania[/nation]. The conflict started a few decades ago when after years of Ardelias and Vinsiania&#39;s close alliance, Ardelias fell into a civil war that eventually led to Ardelias turning socialist. Although socialist Ardelias wanted to keep up the alliance, Vinsania condemned the new nation and cut relations between them, leading to a new cold war between the two.
