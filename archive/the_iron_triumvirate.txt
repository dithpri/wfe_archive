[region]The Iron Triumvirate[/region] was once a collection of three nations [nation]Lerabica[/nation], [nation]Mememenistan[/nation], and [nation]Germartia[/nation]. On a day now known as [i]&quot;Iscariot&#39;s Day&quot;[/i], [nation]Germartia[/nation] seceded from the coalition. The gracious leaders of [nation]Lerabica[/nation] and [nation]Mememenistan[/nation] extended a hand of friendship toward [nation]Germartia[/nation], asking if they would like to rethink the decision. This was refused. The &#39;nation&#39; of [nation]Germartia[/nation] is now in ruins, while the remaining countries prosper.
