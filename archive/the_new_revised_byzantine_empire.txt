The Byzantine Empire that all modern school children learn these days are half truth. We dug into history, the true history and found many flaws. We revised it. The Byzantine Empire shall rise again, and take back the motherlands of the Middle Eastern region of Asia. (Original Empire Erected date:May 11, 330 AD  Revised Empire: April,29,2016 AD)

Although it was long for it to reunite, we will thrive.
