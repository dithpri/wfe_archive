[color=red][i][u][B]The Uchiha clan was one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure, and was also reputed to be the village&amp;#39;s most powerful clan, producing shinobi that were exceptionally talented and battle-oriented, and in possession of the renowned Sharingan. Together with the Senju clan, they founded Konohagakure, but is now almost extinct after its downfall.

Founding - The Uchiha clan descended from Indra &amp;amp; tsutsuki, the elder of the two sons of the Sage of the Six Paths. Indra inherited the Sage&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;eyes&amp;quot;, powerful chakra and spiritual energy. When it came time for the Sage to choose a successor, he questioned the two on what course of action they would follow to bring order to the world. [/B][/u][/i][/color]
