[i][b][color=BLUE]The foolish reject what they see and not what they think; the wise reject what they think and not what they see. ~ Huang Po[/color][/b]

[color=orange]&quot;This world is blind! 
There are so few Who see things as they truly are. 
Come, take a good look at this world, 
Pretty like a king&#39;s chariot. 
Though fools become immersed in it, 
For the wise there&#39;s no attachment. 
See how much it&#39;s like a bubble! 
See how much it&#39;s like a mirage!&quot;[/color]
