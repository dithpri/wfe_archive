The Statics of Primorde are one of the largest floating among the seemingly boundless Primordian Barrens. It is currently home to the vast and ideologically illustrious Dominion of Tenebria and its slightly lesser antithetical counterpart, the Republic of Luceria, who both compete for the Statics&amp;#39; relatively abundant resources. Small rogue states, such as the Theocracy of Inferia and the Colony of Parodisia, also skirt its fringes. Recently, the Armed Republic of Belligia and the Protectorate of Halcyia have seized power in some of the more neglected territories of the Statics.
