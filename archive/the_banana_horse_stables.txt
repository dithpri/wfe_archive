[color=green]Welcome to [/color][color=blue][b]The Banana Horse Stables[/b][/color][color=green]![/color]

Here we believe that the operations of your nation/s are your business, as long as you believe the same of your fellow resident nations.
We do believe in the [u]fair treatment[/u] of fellow residents as well as in our [u]Dispatches[/u], which we encourage you to look over.

The only rule here is:[color=red] All dispatches must be followed, unless superseded by a later dispatch. Failure to do so will result in relevant consequences (See Dispatch #102).[/color]

[color=purple][b]UPDATE: [/b]Dispatch #101 will start to take effect as of midnight (Australian Eastern Standard Time) on 27/10/2017. All other Dispatches take effect immediately. For any queries, feel free to send an email or telegram to our Founder, [nation]Box Ticking[/nation] or our current WA Delegate, [nation]Qairo[/nation].[/color]
