Named after American soldier and politician William North, South North Iceland is the leading producer of ice in the world of NationStates. It is located to the South, though on the globe, everything is south of something, isn&#39;t it? The only people who can reach South North Iceland are people who already know where it is. We have no affiliation with Iceland.
