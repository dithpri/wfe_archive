Welcome to the Union of Globalized States! We are a new region currently in the process of constructing its own roleplay and government. Feel free to join if you want to have a hand in building this new region.

The roleplay is set in the year 1995, shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. Based on historical events, the challenge for the players is to navigate the political atmosphere after the end of the Cold War. The world is set in a realistic setting, so if you are interested in joining, do keep in mind that the roleplay does [b]NOT[/b] include custom nations. All of the nations in the roleplay are based on historical events and settings.
