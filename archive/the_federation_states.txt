Hello, and welcome to The Federation States! We may be small, but we have good noodles.

FEDERATION=a group of states with a central government but independence in internal affairs.

Now forming NEW regional government. Feel free to express your opinions. WE are looking to make this a better region. We want [b] YOU [/b] to be heard.

[b][color=red]Guess what? I&amp;#39;m gonna donate [nation=short+noflag]Greater Salzburg[/nation] to the nations of the region, so that they may have a safe region.
