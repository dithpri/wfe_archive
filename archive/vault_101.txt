Hello! Welcome to Vault 101!!A group of nations who just emerged from the nuclear fallout bunkers scattered across their practically barren terrain, but no longer do we live inside the damp, slimy, claustrophobic walls of the vault. Instead we live on the radiation filled wasteland with with giant green super mutants, and giant mutated rodents, vermin, and insects! I am your leader and founder Ham commanding the nation Tom Sawyer, and L.Ron is your WA Delegate ruling from the nation of Ronpaulovia. If you have any questions ask me Tom Sawyer, Ronpaulovia or Senpai Notice Me.
