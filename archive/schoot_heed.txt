Schoot Heed is a strategically significant region located in the southern part of the continent, just south of the equator. It lies between the vast savannas of the Kensiland territory to the north and the tropical coastline along the Indian Ocean to the east. The region is bordered to the south by Zambanaland and Moziqueland, and to the west it stretches into remote, largely uncharted lands, bordered by dense forests and rugged mountain ranges. Schoot Heed is known for its expansive natural resources, fertile lands, and strategic positioning as a crossroads of cultures and trade routes.
