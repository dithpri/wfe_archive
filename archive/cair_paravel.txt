[b]// A Brave New World[/b]

Smoky air settles above a newly-built community, encircled by the dark forest and ancient undergrowth. A handful of national leaders have already arrived, and the gentle murmur of everyday life in the region&amp;#39;s capital has begun to rise above the quiet of the valley. The Main Square remains largely idle, but as the population slowly increases only time will tell what kind of notable personalities may emerge to establish Cair Paravel&amp;#39;s first regional government. 

The ruins are coming to life.
