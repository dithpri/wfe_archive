[b]// A Brave New World[/b]

Smoky air settles above a small collection of thatch-built houses, encircled by the dark forest and ancient undergrowth. There has been a handful of new arrivals already, and the gentle murmur of everyday life has begun to rise above the quiet of the valley. The Main Square, however, remains largely empty. As the population slowly increases, only time will tell what kind of notable citizens may emerge, a necessity for even the most simple of governments.

The ruins are coming to life.
