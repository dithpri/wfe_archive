Do you want a government that will stand up for your kid&#39;s rights and liberties, humanize the world of work and school, give everyone, not just the top 1%, a shot at achieving their potential and living a great, happy, joy filled life with things we now only call &quot;privileges for the few, equality, democracy and republicanism? Do you want basic food (staples), water, education, and healthcare to not be privileges but a fundamental, at point human right for everyone? Well if you want all this - and much more, then I highly recommend that you get involved in Modernist Party politics by joining us and making the Royal Alliance a better place for everyone.
