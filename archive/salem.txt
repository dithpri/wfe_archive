Salem is a City on the north coast of Massachusetts above Boston. It&#39;s famous for its 1692 witch trials, during which several locals were executed for allegedly practicing witchcraft. Landmarks from this episode include the Witch House, the former home of a trial judge. The Peabody Essex Museum has a massive collection of global art and artifacts, including a rebuilt Qing-era Chinese house.[hr][b][u]Regional Links:[/u][/b]
