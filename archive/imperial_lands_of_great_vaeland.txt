The Imperial Lands of Great Vaeland is a sprawling region in which you would otherwise find modern-day Northern Europe. The Empire of Great Vaeland, and their glorious leader Empress Freyja El&aelig;na &Oslash;riana, are dominant here, technically holding all lands within the region.

The region is highly developed, especially towards the north in Scandinavia, the British Isles and Germania in which you will find the great cities of &Aring;rvalheim, Ilian&aelig;vik, J&oslash;rvik and &Oslash;raval, as well as the magnificent and splendorous Imperial Capital City, &Oslash;rianavik.
