[color=blue] [i] [region] The Unholy Alliance[/region] is an alliance between countries who have different policies but have determined that their differences do not outweigh their power if they work together. This often includes alliances between communists and fascists, communists and democrats, and others. [/i]  [/color]

These nations will often raid other regions. The Chairman of this alliance is Britain-Netherlands. Militarism will be superior. Enjoy your time.
