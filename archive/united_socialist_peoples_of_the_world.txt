Welcome to the United Socialist Peoples of the World!

The goal of the USPW is to unify socialist nations from all corners of the globe. The regional colours are red and gold but member nations do not have to use these in there nations. 
Not all nations need to be completely socialist, some degree of capitalism is acceptable.
Nations can be dictatorships or they can also be a democracy. We do not prefer either instead both are more than accepted!
