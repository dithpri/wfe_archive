The Neptunian Rift is a region beloved by its humble inhabitants.

Our region consists of two nations at this time:

- [nation]Andusk[/nation] is a rather secretive nation, but is known to be praised highly by people who say they are scared of rabid bunny pits. It is currently unknown if the country is open to tourism, but brave souls are welcome to try.
- [nation]United Fictional States[/nation] is a very new nation consisting of a people who lived in a foggy and stormy land, and did not know of the existence of the rest of the world until very recently. The country is open to tourism, but litterers will be executed.
