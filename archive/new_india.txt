Welcome to New India!

This place has got nothing to do with India. In fact, it is a barren wasteland where the air smells like regret and the horizon is painted in hues of abandoned dreams. 

Here, the mighty Grod, the God Emperor of New India reigns. He is great. He is glorious. He is beautiful. He&#39;s like the sun. So radiant.....so beautiful. He nourishes all inhabitants of this land. It&#39;s around him, all existence orbits.


New India is not just a land; it&#39;s Grod&#39;s cosmic game of Sims, and everyone&#39;s in on it, playing their part in this glorious theatrical production of divine absurdity. If you see synchronized laughter in the RMB, don&#39;t be alarmed &#150; it&#39;s just the hivemind working overtime on Grod&#39;s latest stand-up routine.
