New India is composed of Indian cities and Buddhist monks.  New India is a place to retreat when times are rough. 

Move to New India if:
You&#39;re a monk
You need a break from the rest of the world
You&#39;re being chased by Nazi zombies
You&#39;re being chased by terrorist werewolves
You&#39;re on the run from the law, and wish to be rehabilitated
A giant rat is constantly running after you with an ice cream cone and a chainsaw

Home of many iconic people:
Al Gore
Santa Claus
Iron Man
Captain Kirk
Abraham Lincoln
Steve Jobs
HAL 9000
Yoda
Joan of Arc
Pythagoras
and more!
