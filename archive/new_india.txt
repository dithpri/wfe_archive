New India is composed of Indian cities and Buddhist monks. While most of the region is Buddhist, it is very open towards other cultures. New India is a place to retreat to when times are rough. We offer part time movements as well.

Move your nation to New India if:
You are a monk
You need a break from the rest of the world
You are being chased by Nazi zombies
You are being chased by terrorist werewolves
You are on the run from the law, and you wish to be rehabilitated
A giant rat is constantly running after you with an ice cream cone and a chainsaw

We are the home of many iconic people such as:
Al Gore
Santa Claus
Iron Man
Captain Kirk
Abraham Lincoln
Steve Jobs
HAL 9000
Yoda
Joan of Arc
Pythagoras
and so much more!
