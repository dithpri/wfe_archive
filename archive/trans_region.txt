If you were born as a male, you are still a male even if you &quot;transition&quot;. You can not change your gender.  If you were born a women you are a women. You can not change your gender. 

The second thing I wanna say is about &quot;pregnant trans men&quot; is the only reason you&#39;re able to get pregnant is because you are a female. 
I do acknowledge trans people as actual people, but I refuse to lie to you regarding your preferred pronouns and I will call you male or female. One last thing is I do not believe drag queens/ &quot;trans men or women&quot; should not be allowed to teach/brainwash our young people to believe this behavior is ok in any way. Jesus doesn&#39;t make mistakes.
