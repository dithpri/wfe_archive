If you were born as a male, you are still a male even if you &quot;transition&quot;. You can not change your gender.  If you were born a women you are a women. You can not change your gender. 

The second thing I wanna say is about &quot;pregnant trans men&quot; is the only reason you&#39;re able to get pregnant is because you are and will always be a female. 
I do acknowledge trans people as actual people, but I refuse to acknowledge your pronouns except male or female and I will only call you by the gender you were assigned at birth, no exceptions. One last thing is I do not believe drag queens/ &quot;trans men or women&quot; should not be allowed to teach or publish anything accepting blatant lies on gender etc.
