[hr][b][color=4B58FB]There are many ways to find something in the dark. Imagine it now, a hand reached out, and what would it be that you pulled out of the dark. A light... and if you were to use your eyes again you would seek out that light. All the while not taking heed to the dark, you don&#39;t see it because it&#39;s an absence of what you&#39;re willing to perceive. Reach out into that dark and you won&#39;t touch anything but there&#39;s always a fear that you might. This is not a metaphor; this is an instinctual fear of something fundamental to our reality. ~Proverb 62 34
