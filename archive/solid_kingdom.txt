[color=#DF01D7]It is Easter and as not clearly stated in tradition! We are to festively decorate chickens! We are to eat deviled eggs to spite those religious extremists! We are to celebrate for the sake of celebration! And a nod to Christians, the celebration of Jesus&#39;s resurrection![/color]
[hr][url=http://wilstar.com/holidays/easter.htm][b]Did you know..[/b][/url][i][color=purple]The Czech Republic and Slovakia have several unique Easter traditions. One features the males of a family spanking females with a homemade whip decorated with ribbons. The spanking is lighthearted and is believed to bring health over the next year. The men may also dump cold water on them in some areas. It is also a day for men to pay visits to objects of their affection. ^_^ hehe[/i][/color][hr][b]This region is a chat Hall for today, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA6xFnl1pV8]May the bunny man visit you tonight[/url].[/b]
