There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man&amp;#39;s fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the NationsStates Purgatory.

The NS Purgatory is dedicated to those nations who stand at the eve of what we call limbo. These nations are not ready to face the apocalypse of destruction that all nations, in time, must face. Yet these nations also can find no region where they feel they belong. So instead, they come here to Purgatory to await the ultimate decision over their fate.
