Welcome to Deplanet, a haven dedicated towards the rights and equality of everyone in the LGBTQIA nation! It does not matter who you are, but if you believe in the same freedom we do. We would be much pleased to have you join our region, whether to chat, to play, or both. The community for equality needs a stronger voice in the world, and this is a fun, albeit virtual, mission to put that representation out there. 

Through love, through loneliness, we are all connected. Deplanet strives to unify and create an active, supportive, alliance for everyone. If our values sound familiar to you, consider becoming a part of the team!
