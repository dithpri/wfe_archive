The Grave of the Verdo-Releignian Imperium. What began as a simple Kingdom called Releign rose, struggled, and fell. In the aftermath of it&amp;#39;s destruction the Empire of Verdum rose, it&amp;#39;s lands east of Releign and it&amp;#39;s heritage identical. It too has fallen.

Now the Twin Empire, the Verdo-Releignian Imperium, shall fall here. It will do more good to let the Empire wither than anything it&amp;#39;s people have done in it&amp;#39;s existence.
