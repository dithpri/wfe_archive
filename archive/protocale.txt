[color=#C22619]Welcome to the Land of Protocal&eacute;, a growing theocratic roleplay region in NationStates![/color]

[color=#744500]This land is a Theocracy led by the God and Goddess of the region, or as we call them collectively as the Dran&iacute;&amp;#269;ek. While the region is a theocracy, freedom of religion is exercised here. The theocracy in here is just a cultural and roleplay aspect of the region, and you can even be a heretic in this region! We accept people in this region regardless of your past, your religion, and ideology, so don&#39;t worry![/color]
