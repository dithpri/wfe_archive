&quot;When the [b]Four Horsemen[/b] came and sat astride their black steeds on the hill, it was the closest thing such demons can come to happiness. There was a whole world to kill and nothing to stop them. [b]Conquest, War, Famine and Death[/b] surveyed the world with eyes that saw right to the heart of every person on earth and they were pleased. [b]Conquest[/b] would strike ideas into the nations, [b]War[/b] would make sure they fought with the most fearsome weapons modern science could offer, [b]Famine[/b] would ensure the crops failed as they focused on fighting and [b]Death[/b] would claim every last one of them.
When the dust settled, there was nothing left but [i][b]a Scar.&quot;[/b][/i]
