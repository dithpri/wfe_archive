[hr]
[color=blue]The CCN was created to give a place for conservative minds to reside and peacefully debate in a fact-oriented environment. The CCN has seen many hard times and has been parent of [region]Confederacy of Conservative Nations[/region], the [region]Federation of Conservative Nations[/region], and the [region]Republic of Conservative Nations[/region].[/color]

This region is now a monument and a tribute to the old Confederation and its role in FCN/RCN history.
