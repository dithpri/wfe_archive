[color=red]Welcome to the Confederation of Conservative Nations[/color]
[hr][color=blue]The CCN was created to give a place for conservative minds to reside and peacefully debate in a fact-oriented environment. We hope to set up times for official debate that will be moderated and fact checked by moderators appointed by the people and confirmed by the founder. Alongside debate, we will have an active political simulation going on. This means we will have elections, campaigns, a constitution, proposals, and much more.
