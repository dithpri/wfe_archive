[b][color=red]Welcome to the Confederation of Conservative Nations[/color][/b]


[hr][color=blue]The CCN was created to give a place for conservative minds to reside and peacefully debate in a fact-oriented environment. The CCN has seen many hard times and has been parent of [region]Confederacy of Conservative Nations[/region] and then the [region]Federation of Conservative Nations[/region]. 
[hr]We have survived two invasions, thanks to our conservative friends. The new goal of the founder and the government is to regain nations and start real public elections. The region is in a state of marshal law at the moment and the founder is running the show until elections start. [/color] [color=red][b]Long Live The Confederation![/b][/color]
