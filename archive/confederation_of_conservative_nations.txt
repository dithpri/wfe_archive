[b][color=red]Welcome to the Confederation of Conservative Nations[/color][/b]


[hr][color=blue]The CCN was created to give a place for conservative minds to reside and peacefully debate in a fact-oriented environment. The CCN has seen many hard times and has been parent of [region]Confederacy of Conservative Nations[/region] and then the [region]Federation of Conservative Nations[/region]. 
[hr]We have survived two invasions, thanks to our conservative friends.Currently the CCN is operating under a ratified constitution and has 5 serving members of Government (not including the WA Delegate). Elections are at the start of every month. [/color] [color=red][b]Long Live The Confederation![/b][/color]
