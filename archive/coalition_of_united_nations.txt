[b]Welcome to the Coalition of United Nations.[/b]

A place for all nations of any political, economical or religious beliefs to come together and be united under one flag. A place where people can voice their opinions freely without being discriminated against. And a place where we can come together to discuss RPs and current events.

Here you can create political parties, run for Government positions and decide on laws. All we ask is that you are respectful towards others beliefs and that you are open to new ideas. 

There are no offsite forums, so there will be no complications, just good communication through the regional message board.

Together we are stronger, united for the betterment of all nations.
