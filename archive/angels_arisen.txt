We seek only our Vengeance. Where we once stood, we will stand again, till the end of times. We are Angels, awoken from our eternal rest so that we may once again strike down our enemies and lift higher our friends.  We will take our stand together, standing unified before the ranks of our enemies, who march ever closer.
