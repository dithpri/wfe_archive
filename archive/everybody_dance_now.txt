Everybody Poops was raided by &lt;a href=&quot;/region=whitereach&quot; class=&quot;rlink&quot;&gt;Whitereach&lt;/a&gt; and liberated on 6/30/12, at 12:24am EST. This region is now under the benevolent jurisdiction of &lt;a href=&quot;/region=the_whitereach_empire&quot; class=&quot;rlink&quot;&gt;The Whitereach Empire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Everybody Poops was Whitereach&amp;#39;s first of many successful raids.&lt;p&gt;The reason this region was raided is to prove a point. In Whitereach&amp;#39;s history, a nation containing the word &amp;quot;poop&amp;quot; was deleted for &amp;quot;breaking the rules&amp;quot;, but for some reason, other places that contained the word &amp;quot;poop&amp;quot; were not deleted. No offense to the previous residents.
