Greetings, and welcome to Beyond the Genuan Rebirth! 

We pride ourselves on being a small region with a big heritage and a rich history, while not being stuck in the past.

We&#39;re kind of in a transition stage right now, so I&#39;ve set up sort of a temporary government.

President (elected):[nation]alruniea[/nation]

Vice president(elected): [nation]southern Ageena[/nation]

And yeah, for now [nation]Hrathgar Glacier[/nation]is some kind of acting emergency minister or something...

Again, this is very temporary, we will have some sort of official election soon when we&#39;re a bit better settled in.

The map is a lie!!

And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make this fancy and bold and pink very soon ;D
