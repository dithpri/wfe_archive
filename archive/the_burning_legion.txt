Let all who gather under our rein be controlled and civilized! No more can we take those who do not obey the rules and politics of regions! Let those who raid one another&amp;#39;s regions perish in their own stupidity! They do not deserve the honor to continue to live.
We are here to provide shelter for those who are victims of raids, and those who wish for revenge on them. Hail [region]The Burning Legion[/region]!
Not all understand the severity of what we are. we aren&amp;#39;t a region. We&amp;#39;re a machine, working as one for the greater good of all.
