[i]Tremble, mortals, and despair! Doom has come to this world!
Let this scar signify the first blow against the mortal world.
From this seal shall arise the doom of men,
who, in their arrogance, sought to wield our fire as their own.
Blindly they build their kingdoms upon stolen knowledge and conceit.
Now they shall be consumed by the very flame they sought to control.
Let the echoes of doom resound across this wretched world, that all who live may hear them and despair.[/i]
