NOT raided by THE CLAN
seriously whose idea was it to go under the banner &quot;The Clan&quot; but not own a region called &quot;The Clan&quot;?
god i should&#39;ve put it in all caps that would&#39;ve been funnier

[quote=I8;56505247]I have to say, my favorite part about these &#147;raiders&#148; is that they haven&#146;t made the other two regions fortresses, making them very vulnerable to both defenders and raiders.

&#147;The Clan&#148; is a disgraceful group, and their &#147;raids&#148; are pitiful attempts at attention-grabbing.

Maybe when you&#146;re older you can accomplish more than simple dead tags, &#147;raiders&#148;. Actually, thinking about it, a more fitting title would be vultures, as they aren&#146;t raiding anything, they&#146;re simply taking what&#146;s already dead.[/quote]
