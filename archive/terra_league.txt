The Terra League is a rising geopolitical federation born from the union of ancient mountain tribes and surrounding nations, forged in the aftermath of a brutal imperial invasion. Centered in the fertile valley of Axis Mundi, the League stands as a symbol of peace, shared destiny, and post-national unity.

Founded by a once-isolated confederacy of tribes renowned for their philosophy, astronomy, and diplomacy, the League now gathers like-minded states seeking cooperation over conquest. Its members are sovereign but united by the belief in shared blood, shared future&#151;the Terran way.
