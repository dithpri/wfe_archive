The SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations and objects that violate natural law. These are called &#39;SCPs&#39;. If left uncontained, the SCPs would pose a direct threat to human life and humanities perceptions of reality and normalcy. The existence of SCPs is withheld from the public to prevent mass panic and allow human civilisation to function normally.
