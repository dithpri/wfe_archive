INTRODUCTION:
Hello and welcome to the RAIDERS OF THE WILLOW! Please announce your arrival in the RMB so that I can know you. Despite the name, we are no hostile region; no one will be banned but you may be ejected as a warning. Also, I would like some help governing, so if you are interested, apply from the RMB. 

RULES:
No inappropriate language or insults or you will be ejected, talk to someone like you would in real life, and DO NOT SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION. You can challenge anyone in the region as a friendly challenge, but no boasting. I would like everyone to feel good about themselves. Treat everyone with respect and have fun!

THANK YOU!
