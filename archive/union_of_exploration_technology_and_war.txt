Welcome to UETW, also known as the Union of Exploration, Technology, &amp;amp; War. Here we explore not just new lands or the sea, but we also explore ideas, in our technology department we research &amp;amp; develop everything from new types of speakers to superweapons, our war department encompasses everything from defense to conquering, though conquering is optional, we want to welcome everyone. Our goals are not pity things like world domination, unless you would like to work toward that, but it is founding colonies, gathering land, developing new technology, and achieving dreams. We, the Empires of Lore, welcome you to the UETW, to our family.
