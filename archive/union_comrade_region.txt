Stand up! the soul of the proletarian
Workers, let&#39;s get together at last.
Stand up! the damned of the earth!
Stand up! the convicts of hunger!
To overcome misery and shadow
Slave crowd, stand up! stand up!
We are the right, we are the number:
We who were nothing, let us be everything:

This is the final struggle
Let&#39;s group together and tomorrow
The International
Will be the human race:

There are no supreme saviors:
Neither God, nor Caesar, nor Tribune.
Workers, let&#39;s save ourselves;
Let us work for common salvation.
So that thieves can repay,
To get the spirit out of the dungeon,
Let&#39;s light our great forge!
Let&#39;s strike while the iron is hot!
