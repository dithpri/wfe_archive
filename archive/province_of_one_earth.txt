Climate 
The Province of One Earth. Here is where one finds the wettest weather, tallest trees, and deepest fjords in the country. Being so close to the Pacific Ocean, the climate is extremely altered. Summers are cooler, winters more mild. Summer temperatures average 13&ordm;C, while winters average -1.5&ordm;C; there is less difference between winter and summer temperatures here than elsewhere in the country. The mountains block most of the precipitation that clouds would bring to the interior, so precipitation can exceed 4000 mm a year in the north, although some areas get far less than that. The Gulf Islands in the south by contrast receive only 600 mm a year.
