An alliance of nations forged more on diplomatic ties and less on physical proximity, the Imperium of the Four Winds is a united front with unbreakable ties even as the nations themselves have little in common.

Based on the four winds of mythology; with each presiding nation representing one each of Zephyrus (the west wind), Eurus (the east wind), Boreas (the north wind), and Notus (the south wind), though it&#39;s a topic of much scholarly debate which nation represents which.

While few seem to understand precisely what draws these nations to unite in the way they have, some ministers of the nations rumor that the Leaders occasionally meet together to play tabletop games.
