An allied island, The M.U. (Melenion Union) and the C.M. (Comintern of Melenion), were enemies of different ideologies (communism/socialism and capitalism/conservatism) but following a recent treaty the island is working its way to becoming a united nation, until then this is the best that we can do. Free-trade, Movement of people and economic/military bonds are just a few of our permanent values and bills.
