The Commonwealth of Unified States was founded out of the mere necessity and reality of war from all sides. A hope for the future lead the nations of Haeclym, Iminec, Tyraellis, and Jenuwwa to found the Commonwealth to hold a flame to the surrounding darkness. The bigger of the two nations, Haeclym and Iminec, hold sway in the course of the new Commonwealth, whilst the four allies leap together into the dark future that faced them.
