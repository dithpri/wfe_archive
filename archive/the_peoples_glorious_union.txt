Welcome to the People&#39;s Glorious Union&#151;a radiant federation of revolutionary fervor, surrealist bureaucracy, and infinite bread.
Founded on the sacred principles of equality, absurdity, and collective imagination, the Union is a haven for nations who reject capitalist logic and embrace the chaotic beauty of communal existence. Here, the hammer strikes not just steel, but dreams; the sickle harvests not just grain, but cosmic truth.
