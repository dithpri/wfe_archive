The League of American Nations is a loose coalition of 11 Nations in North America that resulted from the break-up and subsequent fall of the US, Canada, and Northern Mexico. All nations have drawn their boundaries according to previous voting records before the break-up of their mother nations. See each nation&#39;s factbook for further national histories.
