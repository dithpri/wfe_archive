The [b]Republic of Rockstone [/b]emerged in the late 19th century following a coalition of mining clans uniting against colonial prospectors seeking to exploit its mineral-rich highlands. Gaining independence in 1892 after a brief but bloody conflict, Rockstone has since balanced its insular traditions with cautious engagement in global trade. Its history is marked by cycles of isolationism and resource-driven prosperity, with recent decades seeing tensions between modernization and preserving its stark, rocky landscape.
