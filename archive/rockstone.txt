[b]The Republic of Rockstone [/b]stands as a proud testament to the resilience and determination of its people. Forged in the late 19th century through the unyielding spirit of its mining clans, the nation rose to defend its mineral-rich highlands against the overreach of colonial prospectors. After a hard-fought struggle marked by courage and sacrifice, Rockstone achieved independence in 1892, securing its place as a bastion of self-reliance and freedom.
