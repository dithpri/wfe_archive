[B]A mighty group of explorers from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were on a mission. They were searching a desert for the fabled [color=#D6BC25]golden puppet[/color]. They made their way through the sandy terrain facing such challenges as their map being incorrect, the deserts windy weather throwing sandstorms in their path, and their very [color=#5052E8]high tech[/color] tools giving them incorrect info! Throughout these many challenges, the group got some vital leads that prove the puppet is [i]more than just a fable[/i].
