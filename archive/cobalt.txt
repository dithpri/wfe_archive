Cobalt is a game about cyborgs, weapons and super slow-mo evasive manoeuvres, including combat rolls, rail slides, rocket punches and wall jumps. When your robo is under threat - thanks to incoming bullets, grenades or boomerangs - time slows down, giving you a chance to pull off some super slick badassery without requiring the reactions of a star-nosed mole. You can play in single player, co-op, and local multiplayer for as many players as you have gamepads.
