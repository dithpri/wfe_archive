[color=purple][b]Welcome (insert nation name here) to [region]Cobalt[/region]![/b][/color]

This is a new region of the NationStates world - a handful of landmasses including and surrounding that belonging to [color=green][nation]Moletropolis[/nation][/color], the founding nation. We humbly wish to welcome new nations of a democratic, social nature to what is an ambitious experiment set to grow in power and stature.

We are predominantly peaceful and pro-WA.

We have our own [color=crimson]Senate[/color] here in [region]Cobalt[/region], composed of a number of [color=crimson]SCs[/color] (each a Senator of Cobalt) - [i][b][color=burgundy](coming soon!)[/color][/i][/b]

And we would love to welcome you to the region!

Thanks for your time,
[b][color=blue]Jetrin Sparkes CMR[/b][/color]
[color=crimson]Commanding Minister of the Republic[/color]
