[b]The short form of [region]Lycan[/region] derives its name from [region]Lycaon[/region], the first of the race in old world Greece. The Race is properly referred to as [region]Lycanis[/region]

[region]Lycaon[/region] of Arcadia tested Zeus&#39; powers by serving him a strip of roasted flesh from a leg of [region]Lycaon[/region]&#39;s own son Nyctimus as part of an offering, in order to test whether Zeus had foresight. In return for this gruesome deed, Zeus transformed [region]Lycaon[/region] into a werewolf while his son, Nyctimus, was restored to health.

[region]Lycaon[/region] is also a cultural hero. He established the faith of Zeus Lycaeus and started the tradition of the Lycaean Games of which the [region]Lycan Imperium[/region] continues in our Capital[/b]
