Off the coast of Wasoka lies the isle of Bobby. There, civilians worship the all mighty Robert Jenkins through sky gazing, novel reading, and ritualistic cat petting. Though small, Bobbyland is the most popular pilgrimage site for religious Wasokans, as the Grand Leader of Bobbism, the most popular religion in our fair land, is said to have been created by the Skyfolk during Ice at Red Dawn.
