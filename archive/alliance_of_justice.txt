Since this region is dedicated to the nations that are under its flag, we are going to have a vote for the nation that is going to represent us in the World Assembly. The way one nation wins is by getting the most endorsements from our region. The two nations that are up for election are The Empire of Ninja Assassins (Kyle McLaughlin) and The Federation of Oppressed People (Tyler Harmon). To figure out the process of voting for our delegate, send me a telegram and I will explain it.

THANKS!
