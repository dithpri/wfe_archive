There is nothing new in the fact that Israel, like its patron and benefactor the United States of America, is a terrorist state. Just as the US employs the CIA, Israel uses one of its intelligence agencies, the Mossad, to carry out acts of kidnapping, torture, and assassination worldwide. Since 1967, the Mossad has been involved in the illegal detention, torture, and/or murder of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian men, women and children.

Today, the Netanyahu government continues engineering acts of terrorism against innocent Palestinians and then denies them any measure of justice, instigating implacable hostilities between Arabs and Israelis.
