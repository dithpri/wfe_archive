The North West is a region of the world where Nations have fled to for political and economic freedom. People here are happy and have rights, high powered economies aren&#146;t necessary, it is expected however that those within the region work together. The Region is small and the enemies are big, teamwork is necessary and expected. 

Welcome to the North West. Land of Greatness, Human Rights, and now; You.
