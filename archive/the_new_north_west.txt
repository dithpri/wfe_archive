[b]Europeia and Thaecia joined forces to form an empire in the name of Mannheim, Germany. This region was brought to its knees by the mighty army of Seva&#39;s Simps, and has given up its WFE space to praise him.

In all seriousness: The ERN and Thaecia bonded together for a big, juicy, tag-raid op. May this operation signify the start of a beautiful friendship that will carry us both towards many military achievements. Cheers to the future![/b]
