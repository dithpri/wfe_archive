[u]About Neutopia[/u]
Neutopia is the official successor region to [region]Brofftopia[/region] after Broff was DEATed. It was a terrible episode for our community (we lost many of our people, but they were inactive anyways), but we hope to rebuild.

Neutopia is TDF member region, this means that if you attack it, there will be serious action against you, and that this region, being a member, is very powerful and developed.

Updates:
Brofftopia was raided by thal dorthat and is now Thal&#39;s trophy region
