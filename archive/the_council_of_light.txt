The Council of Light is a mysterious organisation who aim at controlling and supervising magic in the physical plane. Members who wish to have their countries in the organisation have to make sure that magic is controlled and supervised amongst wizards and witched. The organisation also collects &#39;Dark artifacts&#39;, which are items that can potentially cause damage and can be highly dangerous due to the spells and rituals that surround them. The council also distributes and educates commoners about mysticism and esotericism in order to establish wisdom amongst citizens. It must also be noted that the organisation must not be spoken of  outside of the headquarters in the capital of Athanor.
