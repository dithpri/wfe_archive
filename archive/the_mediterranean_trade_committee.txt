The Mediterranean Trade Committee (MTC) was founded on the 2nd of October 2022 by order of His Majesty Prince Joachim-Louis II of Cismonte and ratified by the President of the Executive, Mr. Henri Padovani, with a two-thirds majority in the two Houses of Parliament. 

Formerly a member of the United Kingdom, Cismonte decided to create the MTC to avoid the taxation of the colonial powers and the lack of representation in the World Assembly.
