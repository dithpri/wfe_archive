Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea! 
West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old. 
O proud walls! White towers! 
O winged crown and throne of gold! 
O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, 
Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?
