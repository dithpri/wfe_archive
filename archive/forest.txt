[hr][color=FF007F][u]Quote of the Fortnight:[/u][/color]
[color=008b8b]&#39;&#39;I was a red man one time, 
But the white men came. 
I was a black man, too, 
But the white men came. 

They drove me out of the forest. 
They took me away from the jungles. 
I lost my trees. 
I lost my silver moons. 

Now they&#39;ve caged me 
In the circus of civilization. 
Now I herd with the many&#151; 
Caged in the circus of civilization.
