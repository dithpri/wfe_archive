[hr][color=FF007F][u]Quote of the Fortnight:[/u][/color]
[color=008b8b]&#39;&#39;To the eyes of a miser a guinea is far more beautiful than the sun, and a bag worn with the use of money has more beautiful proportions than a vine filled with grapes. The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in the way. As a man is, so he sees.&#39;&#39;
