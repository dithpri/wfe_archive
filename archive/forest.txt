[color=096309][i]&quot;&#151; Hello? Is anyone out there? This is George Faraday at radio tower TBC-R127 on the edge of Terrabod City. I don&#39;t think they saw me get inside, but I can still hear them. And the screams; I still hear them coming from the city.&quot;

&quot;If you can hear me, if anyone&#39;s left, the Government has fallen. I repeat:&quot;[/i][/color]

A manual on how to monitor and control the outbreak is [b][u][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1612679]here[/url][/u][/b].
