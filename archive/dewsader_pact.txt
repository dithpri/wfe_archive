Once a upon a time there was a great land rich with its large quantity of pure liquid Mountain Dew. But then the Evil Mountain Lightning the conquerer showed up with this large off brand army including Mello Yello the cheap. Together they were a unstoppable force of pure evil and used up the holy dew land for its rich mtn dew and enslaved its inhabitants. But then when all seemed bleak, the powerful Mountain Dew Resistance kicked them out of our home land and brought light and hope back to the Holy Land. After that everyone lived happily ever after. The end.
