The Kurai Region is home to a widely varied terrain. A large central land mass and several smaller islands scattered around is what the region consists of, the mainland&#39;s coasts being mostly mountain line with only a few natural harbors and lowland coasts. The seas around the region are rather harsh, with large whirlpools being fairly common in formation against the deep ocean bed. A fairly long hurricane season, coupled with frequent storms leaves air travel a fairly harsh deal. For those that can survive the environment though, they are greeted by an extremely resource rich land, with a healthy diversity of rare metals and crystals.
