The Geannese Isles are named after the main island known as Geanna, another older common term for the nation of Pravengria. The Isles of Geanna border just North-East of Pardes, and have been inhabited since Before the Common Era [BCE]. The Isles are indeed home to the heartland of the Pravene Federated Commonwealth, and a few old colonies that co-exist.
