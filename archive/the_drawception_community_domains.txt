IC: The [region]The Drawception Community Domains[/region] are a collection of independent nation-states in a rather strange and volatile part of the world.  All nations therein - regardless of their ideology or politics - come together to safeguard their regional interest, and all have a stake in protecting the ocean they share: the Sea of Memes.

OOC: This is a casual, neutral place for members of [url=https://drawception.com]Drawception[/url]. Due to this region&#39;s nature and the fact that we do not want new nations to be entangled in unwanted situations by virtue of being from [url=https://drawception.com]Drawception[/url], the regional administration is neutral on all external events and is solely concerned with internal affairs, though individual members may take stances. All embassies are accepted.
