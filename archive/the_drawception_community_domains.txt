IC: The Drawception Community Domains are a collection of independent nation-states in a rather strange and volatile part of the world.

OOC: This region is composed of members of the game, [url=https://drawception.com]Drawception[/url]. As we like both Drawception and NationStates, we created this region as a Drawception-themed NationStates region.
