Welcome comrade,

I made this union in opposition to the extreme left and right-wing parties. This party is still a left-wing and capitalists it&#39;s not for you. Anyone with a fascist ideology will be kicked out immediately and the same goes for anyone who leaves too far away from the democratic socialist spectrum. This is still for all leftists and centrists though and you all have nothing to fear about someone overusing their powers. You should not expect us to go to wars often as we are diplomats and we look forward to meeting you
