It is hard to define boundaries for South Kensington, but a common definition is the commercial area around the great &amp;#39;tube station&amp;#39; and the adjacent great gardens known as &amp;#39;the rest of the world&amp;#39;. Great inventions such as &amp;#39;Ice-Cream&amp;#39; and the humble &amp;#39;Melodica&amp;#39; have come from our great region, and all countries which are a part of us will no doubt ascend to greatness. 

Remember citizens, &amp;#39;Be Great, eat Ice-Cream&amp;#39;
