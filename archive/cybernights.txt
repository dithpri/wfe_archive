We are those who don&amp;#39;t give a crap about what people think about us, we don&amp;#39;t care what we look like or what people talk about us in our absence. The majority of us likes to live in hiding, being unknown to everybody except those few we must inevitably contact with. Others love publicity, they love fame. They are all known in the underground world. Their names are often heard there.

We are Cyberpunks.

We refuse to become part of the World Assembly, we will not be assimilated. We desire to be a high tech economic leader. The rest is up to you.
