[b]Welcome to The Radiant Reich--the sacrosanct lands of D&aacute;xlam [/b]

Once there was a region called The Radiant. 
It&#39;s founder was so annoying to [region]The Black Hawks[/region] about a raid in a embassied region.

A new region was refounded but we don&#39;t forget either.

The Radiant Reich shall rise!
