Moneylania was founded by the Banana Federation and Ironcastle, as a means of cross-border financial and security aid. The region has since grown to include other nations, and accepts mainly right-wing nations, although left-wings joining are not unheard of. The region is situated on the coasts of Ironcastle and the Banana Federation, with a large estuary running between them, allowing sea access to the other members.

Moneylania uses the Defense Readiness Condition (DEFCON) system to evaluate threats. We are currently at:
[b]DEFCON 5[/b]
Reason: It has been a long time since the last major diplomatic incident.
