Moneylania was founded by the Banana Federation and Ironcastle, as a means of cross-border financial and security aid. The region has since grown to include other nations, and accepts mainly right-wing nations, although left-wings joining are not unheard of. The region is situated on the coasts of Ironcastle and the Banana Federation, with a large estuary running between them, allowing sea access to the other members.

Moneylania uses the Defense Readiness Condition (DEFCON) system to evaluate threats. We are currently at:
[b]DEFCON 1[/b]
Reason: Daminy has declared war on the rest of Moneylania.

Annendum: Due to escalating hostilities, the Moneylania Regional Military Exercises will be postponed indefinately.
