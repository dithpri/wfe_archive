The Bi-Annual Moneylania Games have finished: http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=250511

Moneylania was founded by the Banana Federation and Ironcastle, as a means of cross-border financial and security aid. The region has since grown to include other nations, and accepts mainly right-wing nations, although left-wings joining are not unheard of.

Moneylania uses the Defense Readiness Condition (DEFCON) system to evaluate threats. We are currently at:
[b]DEFCON 2[/b]
Reason: Ironcastle has been attacked, there are terrorists in Banana Federation, and Daminy has threatened everyone with war!
