Moneylania was founded by the Banana Federation and Ironcastle, as a means of cross-border financial and security aid. The region has since grown to include other nations, and accepts mainly right-wing nations, although left-wings joining are not unheard of.

Feel free to write what you wish in your factbooks, but official RP content shall be determined by the Banana Federation and Ironcastle.

Moneylania uses the Defense Readiness Condition (DEFCON) system to evaluate threats. We are currently at:
[b]DEFCON 4[/b]
Reason: Small-scale rebellion in the Banana Federation.
