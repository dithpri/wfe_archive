[b]Welcome to the UACN, Province of [region]The Royal Conservative Empire[/region][/b]

The natives here have voted overwhelmingly to join the empire, and the RCE welcomes our brothers into the fold. Soon a Governor will be chosen among you and the RCE forces will return to our Capital.

You will be able to craft your own provincial government, as well as vote, run for office, and be afforded equal rights in our government. 

Please begin debate on the Governorship and how you should proceed as a Province!
