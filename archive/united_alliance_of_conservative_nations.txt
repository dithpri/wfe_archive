[b]Welcome to the United Alliance of Conservative Nations![/b]

We are pleased that you have chosen to join our region and look forward to serving you and your needs. We are in the process of rebuilding from a terrible series of traumatic incidents. However, we stand resolute in refusing to allow inter-regional terrorists to destroy our precious region. As such, until a constitution has been crafted and agreed upon, we will have a President (the WA Delegate) and Vice President to lead our region through the dark, murky waters of tension and war. We will rise above and soar high on wings like eagles.

We stand in solidarity.
