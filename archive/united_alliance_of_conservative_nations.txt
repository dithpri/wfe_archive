[b]Hello and welcome to the United Alliance of Conservative Nations! We are a place where conservative values and civil liberties thrive! We are a free region that is stable and excited about charting a new course for our future.[/b]

We are looking for new leaders to join us as Representatives, as we are lacking around three to have a full House. A great way to get involved is by posting a message to the RMB or by visiting our website by visiting www.uacn.webs.com.

Thanks again for joining us. We look forward to growing together.

In solidarity,
