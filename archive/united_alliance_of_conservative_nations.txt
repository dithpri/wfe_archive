
[B]Welcome to the [color=blue]United Alliance Of Conservative Nations[/color]

[hr][region]United Alliance Of Conservative Nations[/region] is a region governed by the Executive Council, with final assent given by the Governor-General. Upon joining, all nations automatically become full members of Parliament (i.e. the government). Most regions require nations to go through a lengthy process of establishing their credentials and then tedious elections to enable them become part of the government!
