[b]The region of Panterra is the Nation States front for a role-playing game set in an alternate universe where Human civilization was destroyed and reborn during the events of &quot;The Calamity&quot;, a catastrophic geological event which caused all the continents to be united into a single super-continent - Panterra.[/b]

[b]In the centuries since the Calamity, Human civilization has rebounded from its destruction, and though greatly changed, aims to reclaim its hold over the Earth.[/b]
