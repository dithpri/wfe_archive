The Northwest Exclusion Zone, abbreviated as N.E.Z., is a vast and desolate region encompassing the ruins of North America and Central America in the aftermath of the Great Nuclear Exchange of 2026. This area, scarred by the devastating consequences of nuclear war, is marked by its inhospitable landscapes, remnants of once-thriving cities, and the emergence of new geopolitical entities seeking to assert dominance in the post-apocalyptic world.
