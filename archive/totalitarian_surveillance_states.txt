This region is for nations that are willing to work together to promote totalitarian policies and spread worldwide.

We will achieve this goal through violent military conquest and oppression of our civilians.

All totalitarian states, regardless of how they achieve this goal, are welcome. This includes nations with a rich upper class and large wealth gap. In other words, entire oppression of people in a nation is not necessary, as long as the majority is oppressed.
