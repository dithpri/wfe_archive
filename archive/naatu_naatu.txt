Naatu Naatu is undoubtedly meant to reflect the cult of Dionysus. 

It begins with the god himself (in the form of these two imposters) entering the polis (this gathering) and bringing the women into their fold. 

When the king (that one white dude) objects to their freeing, hedonistic revels, he is vanquished (in this case, through a dance off) and is also betrayed by the womenfolk. In this sense, the white guy is analogous to King Pentheus in The Bacchae. 

Naatu Naatu is the supreme power of the universe.
