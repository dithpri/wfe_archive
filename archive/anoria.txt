An Atlantic subcontinent set northwest of the French Bay of Biscay. Commonly called the &amp;quot;Elephant Isle&amp;quot; due to its shape of an elephant&amp;#39;s head. It was found by the Western Roman Empire where it had some trading relations before being rediscovered by Viking explorers in 989.
