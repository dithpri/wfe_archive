I have gotten a long way into being rejected by other organizations, but I know how it feels to keep trying what you think your heart desires. It is not what the person who rejected you has to say. It is what motivates you more to become a defender. Don&#39;t do the wrong thing, like me, or else it&#39;s too late.&quot; -Oakrugia[/i][hr][b][color=darkblue]Please endorse [nation]Oakrugia[/nation].[/color][/b][hr][color=#b68222][&amp;#10025;] [url=https://discord.gg/BtWKeKc]Join our Discord Server![/url] [&amp;#10025;] [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Twelve_Realms/index/]Join our forums![/url] [&amp;#10025;][hr][spoiler=Something Important][i][b]Always think of your future.
