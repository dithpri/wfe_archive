Often referred to as &amp;quot;The Jewel of The West&amp;quot; by its inhabitants  Icelandia is open to everyone, from the psychotic anarchist worshiping Satan to the peace loving hippie. We do ask, however if you plan on raiding someone please do it with class, as this is a classy continent. 
  Every Nation on Icelandia is prepared to fight and die for the protection of this region. Why? Because we don&amp;#39;t want you to have it. You&amp;#39;re not good enough. Go home. 
  And yes, while the occasional nuclear warhead does get &amp;quot;misplaced&amp;quot; somewhere in foreign soil, we really aren&amp;#39;t that bad of a group. We are always willing to talk to others. 
  And remember, if you wrong us in anyway we&amp;#39;ll find you. Why? Because an Icelandian always pays their debts.
