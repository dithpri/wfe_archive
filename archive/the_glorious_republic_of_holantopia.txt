Core Values:

Respectful Rhetoric: Civil discourse is sacred. Ad hominem attacks are banished beyond the Irony Mountains.
Cognitive Curiosity: Question everything. Especially why authors make the choices they do.
Grammar Governance: There are no tyrants in Holantopia, only those who misuse semicolons.
Creative Diplomacy: Settling disputes with metaphorical duels, Socratic Seminars, and well-timed alliteration.
