     Mainly for monarchies and constitutional monarchies, the United Dunes of Xtroniayah is located in the vast, but rich, deserts. It is time for a change. We will rule the desert and surrounding sea, away from the rebellious, corrupt, tyrannic, and greedy nation leaders. For this region (in time) will begin the Congress of Dunes, where our sandy nations will address, solve, and debate issues free from fear of the corrupt, and under the safe desert sun. We are strong, kind, innovative, compassionate, and the benevolent rulers of Xtroniayah!
