A group of nations, not allied nor united, not forced to be friends, not forced to fight...
Free to make their own decisions, free to find their own way in the world, free to battle.
Equal in treatment; not in government or size or power.
Fair in that any and all could fall. Fair that every must die, one day.
Honest in its judgement because none will be exempt from justice. 
Just because none shall be oppressed.
Empires will fall, and friendships will be made. Wars will be fought, of the future that is all that one can be sure upon.
For fate and destiny do not exist, only a history to be told one day. A story which will unfold.
