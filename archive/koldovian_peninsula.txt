The Koldovian Peninsula is dominated by the Verkan Empire. In less than 10 years the  once peaceful mountain ranges and humble valleys have been transformed into a bastion of power by the Empire.All those who would seek to oppose the all powerful Autarch swiftly and brutally executed.The once serene mountains echo with the never ceasing sound of marching and the endless toiling of the mighty factories of war fill the dead valleys. The vast concrete cites ring with the tireless propaganda,the Verkan flag flies from every building.The mass graves sit silently,their occupants longing for the recognition they will never have. All Verkans stand untied under the guiding light of the omnipotent Autarch.
