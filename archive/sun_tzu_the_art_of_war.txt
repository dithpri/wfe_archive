The best region in Nationstates! (factual)

Sun Tzu the Art of War is a dignified and respectable place to have your Nationstates country. Sun Tzu is democratic sometimes, we have free speech (to an extent), but most of all we have a fun and welcoming community and an active RMB. We&#39;re also marginally less annoying than the big frontiers! 

Check out our irregularly-published newspaper the Sun Tzuer Tribunal! 
(also Sun Tzu was real by the way don&#39;t listen to those who would slander his name)

Rules:
We have general guidelines for RMB conduct, reference the pinned dispatch
Have fun!
