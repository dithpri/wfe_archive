G&amp;#39;day, mate! We are an Australian-themed region. We support democracy, equality, and imperialism. We place no restrictions on expansion, unless you start squeezing the rest of us out, we accept all theologies, as long as you don&amp;#39;t evangelize, and we only ban if you are inexcusably intolerable (or if you are French; sorry, France, I love to see you suffer). And just for safety&amp;#39;s sake, Black Rider members are not allowed. So fire up the computer, throw a shrimp on the barby, and have fun!
