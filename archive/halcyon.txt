The goal of Halcyon is to be a fun and successful region. Global thermonuclear warfare is a fairly regular occurrence here, among a few other random things. Enter at your own risk. Your comments and suggestions for this region are highly appreciated and will be taken into account. Feel free to send the WA Delegate or Halcyon&amp;#39;s founder, [nation]Stormin Mormons[/nation], a telegram!
