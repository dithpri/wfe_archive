1. The Beginnings
The Free Democratic Republics region was created by the Republic of Bro Down because it grew tired of the abuse of power from other regional leaders

The nation of Bro Down has permanent executive authority, but there are elections for governmental positions and there is no ejection of members unless a serious offense, such as attack to a fellow nation, or, treason has been done

It swears to uphold its democratic standard and freedom across the nations.
