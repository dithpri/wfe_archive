[color=red][b]Hello, welcome to the UIR![/b][/color]
The UIR is a group heavily dependent on roleplay. If you would like to roleplay on Nation-States, you&#39;ve found the right region.
First, to roleplay, you must send me a telegram containing your application to sign up. Click this [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=540156]link[/url] to find out more.
After i&#39;ve reviewed your application I will send you a telegram, about your application. I will tell you if you need to re-do anything or change anything, and or if I accept or decline your application.
YOU NEED TO APPLY BEFORE YOU CAN DO ANY SORT OF ROLEPLAYING! If you do not, you will be warned and then ejected if you fail to comply.
For an extended version of the rules, click [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=540156]this[/url] link.
