The Roma Graecia Empire rules most of Europe&#39;s southern territory. The past couple centuries have seen Roma Graecia come to dominate western Europe and the Mediterranean. 
The nomadic people of Asambier are expanding, moving outward in all directions from their homelands in northern Germany and southern Scandinavia.
After many years of war, Roma Graecia and Asambier, came together to defeat an enemy bigger than each other, thus creating The Achse Exousies, which is now among the most populous, prosperous and stable regions in the world.
