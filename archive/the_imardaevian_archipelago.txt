Created when a group of radically different (politically) islands all moved together due to a freak tectonic accident. The nations of Amonheim, The Rat Lord, and Geographically Proximate Citizenry keep a vague degree of peace between them, with Mars Victoria constantly engaged in military posturing against anyone and everyone, and Blackstone Island quietly exploding in the corner. Meanwhile, The Republic of Elsie is the favourite stop of all travellers, fugitives, and other types going through looking for a drink, or something a bit stronger.
