I&#39;ve been sleeping in a cardboard box
Spending every dollar at the liquor shop
And even though I know I haven&#39;t got a lot
I&#39;ll try to give you love until the day you drop
I&#39;ve been training like a Pavlov dog
Let my independence out to take a hike
All you got to do is activate my bell
And I&#39;ll fetch you anything you like
Going once, going twice
Every man here has a price
Over where? Over there, sold
To not a single lady in here
I&#39;ve been in like a thousand times
Dated every woman in the atmosphere
I&#39;ve been to every continent
Broken all the hearts in every hemisphere
And if I&#39;m not the type of guy you like to circumvent
Just remember not to love me when I disappear
