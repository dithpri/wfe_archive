While once a prestigious and bustling region founded by members of the Sciencemadness Discussion Board, Nations Under the Rador has been almost entirely abandoned, with the few remaining active members moving on to greener pastures. All remaining nations will be allowed to stay, but the region will be password protected from new nations. We had some good times here in Nations Under the Rador, but clearly the interest just isn&amp;#39;t here anymore.
