Welcome! Nations Under The Rador is a region that was initially begun members of [url=http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/]Sciencemadess[/url], an international online community of amateur chemists. The region is open to all that wish to join, but we do recommend you learn about our hobby. 

The region isn&amp;#39;t as active as it used to be at the moment, but all that means is there&amp;#39;s lots of room for contribution! We encourage roleplaying on our regional message board, and really going beyond the bounds of NationStates to visualize the nation your strive to create, such as by creating your own page on [url=http://nationstates.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page]WikiStates[/url].
