So quick you didn&amp;#39;t see us coming. Guess where we were hiding? Under the rador.

The [color=green]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=blue]Navy[/color] ([color=green]E[/color][color=red]R[/color][color=blue]N[/color]) and the [color=red]PRAF[/color] have stormed this region right under the rador! At first we didn&amp;#39;t know where to hide, but once we saw that rador we knew to go under it.
