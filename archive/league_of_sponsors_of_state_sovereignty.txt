This Region was created to unite all nations who believe they are free to install the government they want, and do as they see fit within their national boundaries. We will protect each other against the potential aggression of the World Assembly and its puppet institutions. We will also protest against all interventionist moves by the Terror Council (commonly known as the Security Council), and show the world that our extreme political systems are the best for our societies.
