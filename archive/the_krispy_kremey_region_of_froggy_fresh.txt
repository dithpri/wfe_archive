We are a Region that &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t even carry a gun&amp;quot; but are coincidentally leading the world in the Arms-Manufacturing Industry because we forgot. Our region has a long history of always backing down from a fight &amp;quot;but we never run&amp;quot;. Denzel Washington is idolized as a god among men and all of his &amp;quot;haters&amp;quot; are overthrown by their close family members and killed in a stampede of wildebeests. On the first day, Denzel Washington - our great Lord - created the heavens and the Earth. And on the second day, our Lord created the bolt action rifle to fight the dinosaurs and the homosexuals. FYM boy?????
