[i]The Jungle is all quiet as night falls. A lone black hawk, confused and disoriented, flies down and sits atop the treebranch. Suddenly, a mighty silverback jumps up and grabs the helpless bird, crushing it instantly. The dead bird falls, bloodied and crushed to the jungle floor. The young hawk should have known better than to intrude on the King of the Jungle&#39;s territory[/i]
