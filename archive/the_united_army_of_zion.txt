We believe that Rights are given to us by a Creator and they cannot be taken away!

We Fight for the Freedom of All Mankind and believe in the sanctity of life! We oppose Communism, Anarchy, Fascism, and Corporatism. 

We Believe in an Economic System in between Socialism and Capitalism called Incentivism. 

Incentivism is a system where the people are encouraged to do good and be upstanding citizens as opposed to forcing people to do good as in Socialist and Communist systems. This is done by lowering the taxes of the people if they do things that benefit themselves through personal independence/self reliance (Example:making a garden) and the community (Example:Volunteering).
