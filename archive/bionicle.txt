A region hidden in the deserts of Bara Magna, in the bays of Ga-Koro, deep in the archives of Onu-Metru, and in the fires of Mount Valmai...

It&amp;#39;s a region solely for Bionicle fans. If you do still love and remember Bionicle or are somehow just now becoming a fan after it fizzled out (Bionicle 2015?), then welcome! Hopefully you join and show your continuing support of Bionicle.

You can find me on Biosector01 as creation, BZPower as creation, Lego.com and MLN as Shougun70, BioMediaProject.com as itwasntjustatoy, Bionicle Wiki as Captaiin Price, and Steam as evz_nzxt.
