There is no proof that Teridax ever did anything wrong. In fact, historical records seem to show the exact opposite. One of his main acts of benevolence was the mass ejection of Toa, who were fledgling tyrants that sucked away at our resources and contributed nothing of value in their few seconds in the Matoran Universe. Teridax actively worked to improve the Matoran Universe, in fact, with his ejection of the oligarchic tyrant known as &#147;Mata Nui&#148; that masqueraded as a democratic security agent being a true example to us all of strong leadership and the beauty of our fragile democracy.
