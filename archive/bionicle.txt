A region hidden in the deserts of Bara Magna, in the bays of Ga-Koro, deep in the archives of Onu-Metru, and in the fires of Mount Valmai...

It&amp;#39;s a region solely for Bionicle fans. If you don&amp;#39;t like Bionicle there&amp;#39;s no reason for you to join. So don&amp;#39;t (no offense). But if you do still love and remember Bionicle or are somehow just now becoming a fan after it fizzled out, then welcome! Hopefully you join and show your continuing support of Bionicle.
