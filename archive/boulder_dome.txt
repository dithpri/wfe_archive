The official region of Boulder Dome consists of the wastelands on the outskirts of the dome and the shining metropolis on the inside of the dome. Gaining entry to the city is next to impossible. From the highest viewpoints in the city not much can be seen in the outside areas. Most of what remains is nothing but craters and burned forests. It&amp;#39;s not a comforting sight, but most residents don&amp;#39;t mind. The inner city is much more interesting than the wastelands outside.
