This is GAY EQUALITY!

If you are gay, or gay friendly, you are welcome here.

&amp;#39;Gay&amp;#39; is shorthand for those of us who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex.

Heterosexuals are welcome too! There are friendly straight people here already.

&amp;#39;Equality&amp;#39; means what it says.  Whoever we are, whatever our sexual outlook, we are all equal.
