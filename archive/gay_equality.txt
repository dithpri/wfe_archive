Welcome to Gay Equality! We are a relatively new nation, but are looking forward to welcoming nations, new and old, to our community. 

Gay Equality is primarily a haven for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual players, but players of all sexual orientations are welcome &#150; just respect others in this region.

A little bit about me - My name is Dominic. I am from England, UK and am gay! I do have roles and titles in other regions but I have always fancied the idea of running my own region.
