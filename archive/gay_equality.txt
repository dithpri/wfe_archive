This is GAY EQUALITY!

[color=purple][i]Where being gay isn&#39;t a lifestyle, it&#39;s a life with style[/i][/color]

If you are gay, or gay friendly, you are welcome here. &#39;Gay&#39; is shorthand for those of us who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex. Heterosexuals are welcome too! There are friendly straight people here already.  Gay equality assumes gender equality.  We are all equal.  (Welcoming, yes!  But trolls are zapped)
