This is GAY EQUALITY!

[color=purple][i]&quot;Where being gay isn&#39;t a lifestyle, it&#39;s a life with style&quot;[/i][/color]

If you are gay, or gay friendly, you are welcome here.

&#39;Gay&#39; is shorthand for those of us who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex.

Heterosexuals are welcome too! There are friendly straight people here already.

&#39;Equality&#39; means what it says.  Whoever we are, whatever our sexual outlook, we are all equal.
