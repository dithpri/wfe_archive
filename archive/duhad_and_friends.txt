Join Duhad and Friends as they play Role playing games and read amusingly bad fanfiction. Host April (Duhad) is joined by Kit (Colonel deFraug), Jadon (Balile), and others as they play tabletop RPGs like Ragamuffins, Major, Star Wars D6, and More! Delving deep into the recesses of the internet with guests such as SoundSpeed and Cabral to read hilariously terrible Fanfiction, including the infamous Living the Dream, Duhad takes you down the rabbit hole to the very bottom of the barrel of internet comedy!

You have tried the best, now try the rest, with Duhad and friends!
