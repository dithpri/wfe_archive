This region was originally created as a redirect during the mid-December 2020 operation to free The Spaghetti Land from raider hands.
One of the defender leaders made a mistake by putting the link to this region (which didn&#39;t exist at that time) instead of the real region.
So, I put up a little notice. I actually think everybody went to the real region, but whatever.
Anyway, this region is now owned by The Transitionists, which is just a bloated region with 2019-era puppets of Qawe.
For embassy collectors, don&#39;t bother doing this region. I won&#39;t accept the embassy.
Defenders forever!
