Welcome to the Persian Empire
The Persian Empire is a proud region rooted in Iranian nationalism and the legacy of Mohammad Mosaddegh&#146;s vision for sovereignty and justice. Guided by a national-religious coalition, we unite faith, culture, and progress to honor Iran&#146;s heritage and build a strong future.
