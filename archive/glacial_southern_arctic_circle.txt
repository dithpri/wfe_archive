The glacial white south. The tip of the Antarctic tundra.  The frozen bottom of the world.  The area that these nations will be calling home falls under many names. Names that all end up meaning the same thing.

A place of ice and snow. A land frozen and inhospitable to all but the most hardy of people.  

Only those people strong enough to brace the cold, to survive where none others have proven the ability to, are welcome to settle in these lands.
