The fact that this region was invaded by the [region]ACA[/region] shows just how vile capitalists are. Despite the flaw in their ways the CAC has never shown aggression to their region or attempted any type of hostile movement.

They do not support peace, only war. They are murderers that only care about how much money they can make off of someone instead of trying to provide them with the necessities to a positive and healthy life.


If you want to join the region I am looking for people to help build this region into a global power.
