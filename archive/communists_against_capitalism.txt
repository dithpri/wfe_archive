Brothers! Sisters! Do you not see what these dogs have done? These capitalists!? They cry freedom, yet they only work to keep the proletariat poor! 
So, I urge you to stand up and say that these people shall not continue to inflict suffering on the masses! 
We shall destroy them and they will not see the light of another day!!!!
