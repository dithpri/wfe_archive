A region situated on the continent of Kishman north of the former Qai&#39;lardic empire. In the far past, it was united under one imperial crown, but since those days it has split into many nations with distinct ideologies and cultures. They now unite in an uneasy alliance to maintain their voice in the World Assembly.
