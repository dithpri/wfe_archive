A kingdom once powerful was invaded by neighboring powers, but after many years of foreign rule, many groups with vastly different ideologies claim to be the rightful rulers of the Kingdom of Bogenburg. These nations reluctantly work together to keep the kingdom safe and keep their voice in the WA.

Such is life in glorious Bogenburg.

BogenBurg Council
This is the meeting of Bogenburg to start announcing regional laws. The vote will be judged by total population of the voters. Each week a proposal will be voted upon. If it gets majority vote, it will be passed. If a nation does not comply with the law in one week of it being passed, they will be impeached and possibly banished.
