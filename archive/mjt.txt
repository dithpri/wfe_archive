[color=#FF0000][b]Welcome to MJT, an equatorial island region with beautiful wildlife and fertile soil! The new name is used to differentiate MJT from [url=region=Planet Majestia]the planet[/url]. MJT is inspired by post-[nation=noflag]Floricia-Leanna[/nation] and pre-community [region]Majestia[/region] (now raided).[/b][/color]
[hr][color=#CCCC00][b]After getting displaced and sent to [url=region=The Rejected Realms]TRR[/url], [nation=noflag]Simonia[/nation]&#39;s former Simonosphere region-mates went to Majestia&#39;s alternate universe clone and passworded the region. [nation=noflag]Embassy Island[/nation]&#39;s embassy buildings have been burnt down, so we&#39;re restarting.[/b][/color]
[hr][color=#CC00DD][b]This is a casual chat Planet NationStates region. Most embassy requests will be accepted.[/color][/b]
