We are a large federation of people who enjoy the works of Tolkien, as well as Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and other types of literature, films, games etc... If you are looking for this, than you are free to join us. If not, I can still promise us to be an interesting and growing community. Your voice will be head, and we may even have weekly congresses of every single kingdom in the empire. We are ruled by a Super-Emperor, and all joining members have the rank of King. Other ranks include Imperial Ambassador, Imperial Admiral, and High King (Administrator).
