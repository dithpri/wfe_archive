[color=blue][b]Long time ago, our very existence is threatened from every side when the the Holy Region of [region]Battleship[/region] was eaten away by the Great Anarchy. Heretics and barbarians laid their eyes upon the fallen Holy Region of [region]Battleships[/region] and stripped its Holy possessions against its will.

As you can see, we&#39;ve rebuilt and is now stronger than ever. Now, the reformed Polska-Mongolian army of [region]Gaming Town[/region] has marched deep into one of its enemy&#39;s territory and razed it until there&#39;s nothing left. 

May this disgusting land be a barren wasteland until the end of time. May the Believers of Wakeism finds peace in the afterlife![/b][/color]
