[color=#358dc6]Dear NationStates,
Why do we normalize the activity of embassy collecting? Not only is it just needless spam for those of us actually trying to play the game, but it&#39;s also very hard on the site&#39;s infrastructure, not even including when said regions CTE or get raided. This isn&#39;t something that should be encouraged, it&#39;s something that should be [i]discouraged[/i].

As if that wasn&#39;t enough, the existence of embassy collectors often gives fascist regions an outlet to express their vile opinions and get away with it all because they have an antifascist &quot;community&quot; presence, though that community hasn&#39;t posted in the last month until raiders showed up.[/color]

[color=red]Stop defending embassy collectors and start making the game a better place today![/color]
