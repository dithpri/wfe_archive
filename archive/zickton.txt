[color=gold]Welcome to [b]Zickton[/b][/color]! This is a place for anyone. This is place where freedom and hospitality lives. You might want to check out the rules of Zickton. If you want to see the map you can look in the dispatches. Currently, there are positions for TZC (The Zickton Council). If you are interested or curious about it please telegram [nation]The Auglands[/nation] for info on that. If you want any land claims please telegram [nation]The Auglands[/nation] or a council member for any land you would want. Don&#39;t be greedy though, there is a limit. If you&#39;d like, you could join the WA and endorse [nation]The Auglands[/nation]. You don&#39;t have to but you should because a strong delegate means a strong Zickton. If you&#39;d like to introduce yourself in the RMB feel free to do so.
