     We are The Sunbros of WEBBISTAHN.  Our co-founders are &amp;quot;The sunbros part 2 (praise the sun)&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;WEBBISTAHN.&amp;quot;  We are looking for nations with a diplomatic, yet ready-to-take-action mindset.  Democratic Dictatorships and Holy Empires are especially welcome.  We are peaceful and are willing to discuss matters peacefully and dexterously, unless provoked.  In which case, you will be annihilated; our military is absolutely impervious.  Our citizens are free to live as they wish, within the law of course.  We are a region that takes the people&amp;#39;s opinion into account, but leaders have the final say.  We hope you enjoy life here and remember: work hard, play hard and don&amp;#39;t be mad at a Webb-Bro.
