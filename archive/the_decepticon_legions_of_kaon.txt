In Kaon we are all powerful, vicious, and ruthless. The law is kind but firm. I really dont care what you do as long as it is within logic. Every so often, I might go on a rampage and destroy of few places, but otherwose its pretty cool. If you have any ideas for Kaon, put it in the message board, and I will look at it, and tell you what I think. If you need to contact me personally, search The Empire of the Jiggles, and send me a telegram. Just remember that if I am attacked, I can boot you out.
