In Kaon we are vicious, and ruthless. The law is kind but firm. I really dont care what you do as long as it is within logic. We&#39;re pretty cool when it comes to rules. If you have any ideas for Kaon, put it in the message board, and I will look at it, and tell you what I think. If you need to contact me personally, search The Empire of the Jiggles, and send me a telegram. Just remember that if I am attacked, I can boot you out. If you need help, let us know, and either me of one of my people will assist you.
