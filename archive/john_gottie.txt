The Coalition John Gottie doesn&#39;t care about how you treat your people. You may have no civil or political freedoms in your country, no problem. Here in John Gottie, the thing that matters is that your nation supports the military, is strong, and isn&#39;t communist. You must not be too &quot;socially progressive&quot; to have a military. We are strong, and we aren&#39;t afraid to prioritize strength over comfort.
