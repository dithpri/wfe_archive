The [b]Spanish Inquisition[/b], was established in 1480 by Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms and to replace the Medieval Inquisition, which was under Papal control. It became the most substantive of the three different manifestations of the wider Christian Inquisition along with the Roman Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition. 

The Inquisition was originally intended to ensure the orthodoxy of those who converted from Judaism and Islam. The regulation of the faith was intensified after royal decrees issued in 1492 and 1502, which ordered Jews and Muslims to convert or leave Spain. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
