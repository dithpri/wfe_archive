The Rejected Soviet States is a region shaped by the remnants of Soviet influence, home to a collection of nations that have been cast aside from the broader international community. These states, once part of the vast Soviet empire, now struggle to find their place in a world that has moved on without them. Despite their rejection, they maintain a strong sense of identity, rooted in the shared history of Soviet rule and the challenges of post-Soviet existence.
