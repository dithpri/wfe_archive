If you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ve made a great choice! The English Commonwealth of Nations is very glad to have you here and we urge you to join. 
Still not sold on it? Well okay then I don&#39;t blame you. Here in The English Commonwealth of Nations we try not to lie to you, we&#39;re not by any means powerful (yet), there are others who would yearn for your membership only to gain numbers, but not us! We&#39;re only here for one thing.....power. And if you want some of that future power than join us. Of course we&#39;ll have some fun too, but as a nation just starting out I didn&#39;t want to be shackled by a ranking system and told I couldn&#39;t best other nations If you feel likewise join us.
