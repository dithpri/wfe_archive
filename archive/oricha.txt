Oricha (State) is the combination of Oricha (Prima) and Oricha Deota, along with the surrounding territories. Oricha (Prima) is the Capitol of the State. Deota is the southern, more free, counterpart to Oricha. The region was officially formed when Oricha (State) was engulfed in a civil war that left Deota to do whatever they liked as long as they obeyed the laws of Oricha (State). Orichans have very little political say.
