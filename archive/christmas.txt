  [B]Welcome[/b] to [region]Christmas[/region]. This region was found being founderless and just wasting away and a target of various raids. Now there is a coalition of region armies here to maintain the order and eventually bring this place to being refounded in the near future. The regions who have troops here are:
[Region]The Reaper Council[/region]
[Region]Irisania[/region]
[REGIOn]The Sacred Order[/region]
[REgion]The Reformed Union of Soviet Socialists[/region]
[Region]Illuminati[/region]

[B]Interested in helping us in this quest, just message [nation=short]Alpha Force[/nation] and have a WA nation ready.[/b]



Oh and [nation]Pigeonakia[/nation] stole Christmas
