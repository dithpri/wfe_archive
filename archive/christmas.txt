[b]CHRISTMAS[/b]&amp;#8207; is region was liberated and rescued by the forces of The Dirt Alliance from the tyrannical rule of DEN. * The Great Almighty Holy Empire of The Democratic Empire of Dirt says in cheesy voice: &#147;May The Dirt be with you!&#148; and &#147;A Merry Christmas for the Future!&#148;
Founded over two years ago by Santas helper.
This is now a region dedicated to Christmas, Roleplay, Minecraft and Fun, and is now also the cultural hub of NationStates for Christmas and other festivities related to winter holidays!
Merry Christmas
Unfortunately for security no WA nations or invader nations are allowed in this region any more. :( The Dirt Alliance may make a Christmas region for WA nations in the future maybe though. :)
