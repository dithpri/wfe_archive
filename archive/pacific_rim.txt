[b]&amp;#127754; Welcome to Pacific Rim &amp;#127754;[/b]
[i]&#147;Holding the line between civilization and kaiju.&#148;[/i]

&amp;#128506;&amp;#65039; Pacific Rim is a coastal frontier of nations bound together by survival, science, and strength. Born in the shadow of colossal beasts rising from the sea, we are the last line of defense between a fragile world and unstoppable destruction.

&amp;#127965;&amp;#65039; [b]A place in the regional map for all regional nations[/b]

&amp;#128220; Now Accepting New Nations
All species, ideologies, and levels of RP experience welcome. Whether you&#39;re a high-tech utopia, a rogue state, or a monster-worshipping cult&#151;there&#146;s a place for you here.

[b]Remember:[/b] In Pacific Rim, your voice matters... unless a kaiju eats you first.
