Does love to God spring from knowledge of Him, or knowledge from love? The ardour of the saints, their state of blessedness, rests on the act of vision, not on that of love, which follows after. This means the assurance of God in God which is both knowledge and love of Him is properly the result, not of wishful thinking and self-persuasion, but of the reasoned and spiritual consideration of life and reality. The virtues and functions of the angelic circles are various, but not independent of each other; they are co-ordinated and complementary, passed from the higher circle to the lower. &#39;In the angels an intensity of knowledge is love; a less intense love is knowledge&#39;
