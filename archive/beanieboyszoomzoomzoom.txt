This is a cool region, bro. We have the biannual speed walking Olympics and unlimited bread sticks. Wurst is heavily taxed within our region&#39;s borders.  We have SO many toads, one might say a plethora. The preferred punctuation of our lands is the interrobang. Also, all members must have flags depicting birds with human arms, AT ALL TIMES.
