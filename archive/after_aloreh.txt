As the world fell to pieces, independent national fleets blasted away from Aloreh in all directions, hoping to move their people and culture through the apocalypse. After 500 years of travelling in self-sufficient spacecraft, all that&amp;#39;s left of Aloreh are pictures and stories. Suddenly, the fleets of each nation simulataneously receive an interstellar ping, and their comms all go on open frequency. Every surviving nation has mysteriously been granted contact with one another over a seemingly instantaneous channel, only to find that they&amp;#39;re all within a travelable distance with each other around the star &amp;quot;J54S Jesuit&amp;quot; (renamed &amp;quot;Terth&amp;quot;). The mobile respite of their lives is at an end, and international politics are opened up once more.
