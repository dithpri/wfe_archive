Pax Eterna, located somewhere in South America, is a region of nearly 40 nations, with a huge variety of habitats, climates, flora, fauna, peoples, governmental systems and problems. Periodically, some nations try to take over others, though most have too many problems of their own for this to be a realistic option. Pax Eterna&amp;#39;s history is as troubled as its present: its greatest hero claimed that bringing democracy to the region was like &amp;quot;trying to plough the sea&amp;quot;. Like anywhere else, Pax Eterna has its share of radicals and revolutionaries, though the majority of its citizens are simply doing their best to get along.
