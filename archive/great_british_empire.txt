Welcome to the British Empire, a massive 25 percent of Earth, stretching from the island of Great Britain, to the islands in the Caribbean, and finally to the Antarctic realms. We have a brilliant culture of drinking tea whilst having crumpets and biscuits. The environment is blissful, you step out of your boat or aeroplane and you see the beauty of our environment. The economy is by far one of the strongest on the planet. We like traditional British views, whilst mixing with democracy too. Our people are very happy and hard working, but never forget these lines &quot;Rule Britannia, Britannia Rule The Waves&quot; Patriotic people are the majority, we all love our British values.
