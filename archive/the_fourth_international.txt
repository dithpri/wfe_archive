The Fourth International is a collection of countries and peoples whose main aim is to build a worker-based, revolutionary socialist, and democratic society. These countries are surrounded by other nations and entities that wish to prevent the glory of the revolution from reaching all oppressed people. The Fourth International is thus always ready and willing to bring the revolution to these people through diplomatic or military means. [color=ff0000][b]Long live the proletariat![/b][/color]
