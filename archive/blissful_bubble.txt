&amp;#8203;Blissful Bubble is a region where four distinct philosophies of state survival coexist. While Sanct&#39;s bubble is a transparent enclosure that uses the past to justify ideological control, Sphantom Waste&#39;s is a hardened shell that uses raw power to dominate its present. Sylo&#39;s bubble is an intricate web of data, and Solisora&#39;s is a sacred dome of shared belief. Each nation has created a unique reality where the state is the ultimate authority. The &quot;bliss&quot; of the Bubble is therefore a multifaceted concept: a serene bliss in Sanct, a dominant bliss in Sphantom Waste, a logical bliss in Sylo, and a sacred bliss in Solisora.
