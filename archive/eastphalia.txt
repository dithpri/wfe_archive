[color=brown]Although new, We still have the privileges to speak on own will without regional interruptions. All member nations, it is recommended that you create a separate nation to represent your Monarch in order to be added to the Royal Family! Nations without a representative Monarch may still hold a place in the Royal Family, but under strict conditions. The plot will be telegrammed to everyone later on. [/color]
