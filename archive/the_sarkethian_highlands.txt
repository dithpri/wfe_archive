The Sarkethian Highlands is a collection of nationstates with no discernible common cause, except their penchant for surviving the varied but often-dangerous flora and fauna in the diverse but universally inhospitable biomes of the Highlands: jungles, deserts, mountains, and icy tundra with but a few islands of grassland and steppe. Politically, there is no treaty requiring any form of government: Anything from a religious dictatorship to left-leaning college states to democracies are allowed. The Sarkethian Highlands exists outside of the World Assembly and ignores any of its resolutions, offering isolation and (incidentally) protection from those neighboring regions and organizations.
