Hello! And Welcome to &amp;quot;Paint the Worlds&amp;quot; this region has a map, not of one planet, a couple actually, with full maps, as realistic as possible, and small planets also, where battlefields can be placed! The WA delegate has no power! Because if he did, oh my would it suck if we all got ejected! And yes of course, futuristic technology is here! Have fun!
