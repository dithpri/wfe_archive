[i]Totenkopf[/i] is the German word for the skull and crossbones symbol. The &quot;skull and crossbones&quot; symbol is an old international symbol for the defiance of death, or a warning of danger, as well as piracy. It was commonly used by pirates as a means of demanding the target ship be handed over to them. It is also still used by modern navies.
