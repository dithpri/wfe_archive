[i]Our Region stands [color=red]AGAINST[/color] the General Assembly[/i]

Our region is against the General Assembly due to their tedious laws typically targeted towards nations that choose an authoritative power over it&#39;s people instead of allowing pure democracy. This does not make nations that choose to refute the power of the General Assembly corrupt, we simply choose to run our nation in a much more controlled environment.
