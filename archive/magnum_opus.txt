A free region where those who wish to be released from the bonds of threatening, raiding nations can find solitude from them AND the World Assembly. Nations in this region strive to maintain the freedom of their citizens and to keep the government small. Regulation is frowned upon if applied to economics and the citizen&amp;#39;s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
