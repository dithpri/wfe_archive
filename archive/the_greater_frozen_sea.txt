Encapsulating a large swath of a far northern region of Islands, the Greater Frozen Sea is home to many disparate nations trying to survive and thrive in one of natures harshest climates. Surrounded by large ice caps, glaciers, and icebergs, these scrappy Nations and their indominable populations are connected by trade and travel. Only the Strong survive. The Strongest rule.
