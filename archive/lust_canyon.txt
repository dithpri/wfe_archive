Nomads from a far off land traveled the world in search of a new land where they could enjoy the freedom to live for pleasure. They settled in a canyon, protected by the geography from easy invasion. Because of their past suffering under others, they are very cautious of strangers and admittance to the canyon is by invitation only.
