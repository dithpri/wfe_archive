On the 1st of May 2012, the incompetent fools at [i][b][region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region][/b][/i] ponced into this defenceless region. 

Thinking they had a chance at securing this easy and defenceless target (trust me, they&amp;#39;ve failed before at even easier targets), they sent out a poorly disguised [color=blue][i]&amp;quot;invasion force&amp;quot;[/i][/color] consisting of [b][i]two members[/b][/i] (the size of their military, in short). 

Their incompetence was noted by [nation=short]The Unbirth[/nation] however, who swiftly took this region with ease, to the amazement of these... [b][i]idiots[/i][/b].

[i]If you wish to know more, either about us or this attack, telegram [nation=short]The Fascist-Free Lands[/nation], and preferably in English, as that&amp;#39;s the only language he can &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot;[/i] (only barely, however).

[color=red][b]ANTI[/color]FA[/b], or as they would spell it, [b][color=red]ANTIE[/color]FAH[/b]!
