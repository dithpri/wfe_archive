[b]WE ARE ONE OF MANY, WE ARE A LEAGON, WE TAKE BRIBERYS, WE TAKE FROM THE PEOPLE AND GIVE IT TO THE RICH, WE DON&#39;T CARE FOR THE ECONOMY, WE CARE FOR YOU WHEN YOU FIGHT FOR US AND AGREE WITH US, WE FIGHT FOR THE GLORIOUS LEADER AND HIS DISCIPLES, WE TAX YOU ON EVERYTHING, WE ARE GREAT, WE ARE THE KEEPERS OF AUTHORITY...
[/b]
THE WORLD HAS FORGOTTEN THAT POWER SHOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF ONE LEADER, A GLORIOUS LEADER, AND THERE WE SHALL MAKE THIS WORLD A PARADISE, DEMOCRACY IS WEAK AND INCAPABLE OF MAKING EASY DECISIONS WITHOUT CAUSING A WAR THAT WOULD WIPEOUT 12.5% OF THE WORLD IN A HEARTBEAT, WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN, AND WE WILL NOT HAVE THAT HAPPEN.
