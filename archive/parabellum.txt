Parabellum is a mercenary group created by Rou on Day 33. Its members have a lot of different variety of races all working together as one under Rou&#39;s command which has never been seen before in the world until Rou&#39;s arrival/reincarnation to it. Usually a mercenary group at most has two or three different types/species of races, but Parabellum has more than 10 different types of species of monsters as its members. The name itself stems from the saying: &quot;Si vis pacem, para bellum&quot;, which means &quot;(if) you wish for peace, prepare for war&quot;.
