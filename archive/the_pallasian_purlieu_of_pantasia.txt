Forged in flame and bloodied steel, Pantasia stands new and proud. Its people, once the natives of Exxon and Distruzione, stride forth in the name of Pallas, and take his bloody creed; they call upon their brethren and march into those they deem nemeses and allow Pantasia to remain ever-expanding. Pantasia&#146;s doors are left ajar for all those who revel in war and chaos, and who too look towards Pallas for guidance. So, we call upon thee brothers of blood, join the mighty Pallasian region of Pantasia, and feast on an ever-lasting meal of battle and bloodshed!
