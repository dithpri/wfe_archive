That took a while, but those invaders&#39; weird plan to invade an [b]unknown[/b] region with an executive founder and spit [u]gibberish[/u] on the world factbook entry was successful, as I think spending a lot of time to do an easily reversible thing was their plan? Was it not?! I hope it was, because if it wasn&#39;t, then I would feel really, really sad. For them. I&#39;m not sure whether it was because this is a [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1147083]peaceful region[/url], and has been outspoken about invaders since it was created, whether we were just picked out of a hat. It doesn&#39;t matter though, so if you want to join us, then we are just starting up an will accept all the help we can get. Thank you. And if you are an invader reading this, then guess what the message of the week is. It&#39;s [i]funny[/i].
