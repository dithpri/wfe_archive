CEDA, (The Central European Democratic Alliance) is a loosely connected alliance between countries who share similar views in democracy. We strive to protect, preserve, and aid all nations in CEDA. Although it is not required to be an important and influential member, we suggest you are also a member of the World Assembly, as to make CEDA&amp;#39;s presence known.

CEDA is managed by its Regional Council.
