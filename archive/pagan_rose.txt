&amp;#127800; [color=#d762db][b]Greetings.[/b][/color][color=#3e4aef] This once great polythiest region which has approximately 15 followers was founded about 3 times. This may just be the final time, as I will not allow anyone to refound it. It is now protected by [region]Asclepius[/region] and [nation]Sompandinn[/nation]. This region is a neutral colony, direct your embassy requests to Asclepius.[/color] &amp;#127800;

[b]Information on Pagan Rose:[/b] Pagan Rose was actually founded a while ago by Sompandinn&#39;s former main nation. It was a replacement for another region, Capricornarius, and it ran for about 9 months or more. It was raided by a Christian region Holy Reich Of Bunicken whom painfully mistook Pagan Rose for a Femdom colony.
