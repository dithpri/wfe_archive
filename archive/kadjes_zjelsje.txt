The Zelsian Archipelago. A subtropical cluster of isolated islands, generally divided between the Inner Ring, or those islands closest to the largest and most well-known isle of Zjelsje (from whence the region gets its name), and the Outer Ring, the smaller group of less populated, relatively outlying islands. The populated isles outside the main island are grouped into three of the 27 unitary districts that form the Khymas Zjelsje, the other 24 being located on the main island itself.
