Here in our fledgling region Roarea, we cater for the strong at heart. Military is our best defense and we rule with an iron fist. But now you can have a part. Anarchist kingdoms that are in the world assembly are free to be delegates. Once a delegate is chosen I will send them a message.  Nice nations may join, but it is going to be tough... So now let me just skip to the fast facts:

+We wage war with other regions so beware

+We are developing a strong military

+And we have a person who you can always send messages to: [nation]Pavlovea[/nation].

We hope you excel here.
