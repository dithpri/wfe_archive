[color=red]You built me up with your wishing hell
I didn&#39;t have to sell you
You threw your money in the pissing well
You do just what they tell you

Repent, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Repent, that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about
Whose mistake am I anyway?

Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the Hydra
Now you&#39;ll see your star

Prick your finger it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
Angel has spread it&#39;s wings
The time has come for bitter things
