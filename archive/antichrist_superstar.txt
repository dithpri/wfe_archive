[b]Refounded for my father &amp;#64;[nation]Marilyn Manson Freaks[/nation].[/b]

~ &amp;#64;[nation]Please Understand[/nation][hr][b]They slit our throats
Like we were flowers
And our milk has been
Devoured
When you want it
It goes away too fast
When you hate it
It always seems to last
But just remember when you think
You&#39;re free
The crack inside your heart is me[/b]
