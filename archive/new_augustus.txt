Long after Rome fell, there were rumors that a blood line of the Roman&#39;s was buried, hidden away. The strong bloodline was found in a select amount of people, hidden away, grown to be very advanced in technology and every aspect possible. Advanced in science, art, culture and everything else. We are the same Rome that fell and we will show the world our true power once again. We will rise once again!! Long live the Roman Empire!!
