[b]Welcome to The Collector&#39;s Guild!

[region]The Collectors Guild[/region] was created as a space for players who want to focus on the collection and trading of NationStates cards. The goal is to form a community of collectors who value organizing decks, effectively trading, and making profit from the market, so that this region may rise in prominence and prestige. As we work together to form a likeminded and unique environment, dedicated to the processes of the trading card market, we encourage both experienced and novice collectors to join our endeavor.

May your profits be great and your collection grand,

Founder and Guild Master,
