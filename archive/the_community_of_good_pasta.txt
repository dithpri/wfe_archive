[b][color=yellow]The Community of Good Pasta[/color][/b] (or the [b][color=yellow]CGP[/color][/b]) is a region located in the Downward Hemisphere of the planet Aerth. Forged from the fires of the former region of W.A.S.T.E. Central, the CGP is currently comprised of eight nation-states, with room to grow. The nation states in the CGP range from dominating left-wing utopias to fledgling psychotic dictatorships. The region prides itself on its niceness, drug use, nudity, income equality, and rebellious youth. Our motto is: &quot;get lost Squidward!&quot;
