The previous administration was not able to sustain the life of the region due to grievances held by former members. Some of those grievances are unclear political direction, lack of sense of political authority, and blatant disregard for the agreed policies by the former heads of government.

As the new WA Delegate, I have come to try and revive this region. As you can see, I am newly-elected. Therefore I ask for your patience if I might move slowly. I encourage everyone not to leave the region as we will bring it back to its former glory and even more!
