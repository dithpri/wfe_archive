[b][color=darkblue]Welcome to the Holy Empire of Britannia![/color]

[color=crimson]Britannia may still be a young region but she has a clear vision for the future. We are a primarily Gameplay-focused region, and as such the foundations of the Holy Empire are already being formed - we&#39;ve started drafting our first regional Consitution, so feel free to head over to our regional forum and get involved![/color]
