Philosipharum has been the center of Assassin activity for over 200 years and our power needs to expand as do our ranks and with Templars making one bold move after another we need this now more than ever.

The Maxim 
Nothing is true, Everything is permitted

The Tenets
Stay your blade from the flesh of an innocent
Hide in plain sight
Never compromise the brotherhood

The Ironies 
The Assassins seek to promote peace, but commit murder.
The Assassins seek to open the minds of men, but require obedience to rules.
The Assassins seek to reveal the danger of blind faith, yet practice it themselves.
