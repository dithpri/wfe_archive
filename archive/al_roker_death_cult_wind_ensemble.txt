The Al Roker Death Cult Wind Ensemble (ARDCWE) is an economic, political, and military union comprised of member states located primarily within the Bulgarian port city of Burgas. The ARDCWE Parliament is elected every 4 years and meets every month to debate on important topics such as whether AJ&amp;#39;s mother really is as promiscuous of a woman as she seems, and to sacrifice newborn Serbian children to the god of the seas, Poseidon.
