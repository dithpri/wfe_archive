The Al Roker Death Cult Wind Ensemble (ARDCWE) - commonly referred to as &amp;quot;Rokerania&amp;quot; or simply &amp;quot;The Fatherland&amp;quot; - is a multinational union of states that are united under economic, political, ideological and military factors; member states are primarily located within the 5th circle of hell. The ARDCWE parliament is &amp;quot;democratically&amp;quot; elected every four years by citizens of the ARDCWE union to debate and vote on important issues such as whether AJ&amp;#39;s mother really is as promiscuous as suspected or (I wish) grondless speculation on the composition of lunches at a certain educational institution, and whether or not those ingredients include human excretement.
