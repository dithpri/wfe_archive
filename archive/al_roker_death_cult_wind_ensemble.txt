The Great Mujahideen of [region]Teachings of Islam[/region], led by [nation]Northern Asia[/nation] have declared [b]Jihad[/b] or armed struggle against [region]United Empire of Islam[/region](UEI). 

The UEI is a tyrannical region who ejects and bans new members from the region. To the leadership of the UEI, all new members are puppets. This shows their insecurity and stupidity. This region wishes to condemn the practices of the UEI, and seeks to welcome all nations who have been victimized by the UEI. All nations regardless of ideology or religious creed are welcome here, the only requirement is to bring down the [region]United Empire of Islam[/region]

[nation]Northern Asia[/nation] and its allies around the world are now actively involved in an armed struggle against the UEI.
