[b]It is a sad moment in our History. PSU has been unfortunately deleted and I call out to you, my Comrades, my Friends, my Brothers and Sisters, to help to save the Mother-Region. We will triumph over those who seek this as an opportunity to destroy us and show them no mercy. For the time being, I need everyone to endorse and only me in order to gain influence. Stay strong people, and we will emerge victorious![/B]
