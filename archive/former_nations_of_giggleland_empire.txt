At the end of World War III in 2032, the world was completely torn apart. Captain Giggle decided that in order to revive humanity, the Giggleland Empire needed to break up into smaller nations, especially now that the rest of the world is in ruins. Giggleland II is the only country left standing, since the rest of the Giggleland Empire&#39;s nations are just forming, and the rest of the world&#39;s countries have basically seized to exist and will be turned into new countries, or maybe even anarchist regions. So he decided to form an Alliance, in order to help the other up-and-coming nations to get on their feet and bring the world back from the edge of oblivion.
