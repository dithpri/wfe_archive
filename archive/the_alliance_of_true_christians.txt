The Laws of the Land are the laws of God Almighty. These laws can be found in the Bible, namely, the books of Exodus and Leviticus, among others. Any nation that wishes to join the Alliance must adhere to the laws laid out in the Good Book. They are free to set individual laws for their own internal affairs, but must still abide by the laws of our Heavenly Father. Amen.
