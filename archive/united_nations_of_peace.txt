The United Nations of Peace are dedicated to dealing with conflict through peaceful alternatives to war. Every nation is welcome to join our region, with the condition that it agrees to the UNP Freedom Act (which outlines basic human rights and freedoms). We look forward to working with you to create a peaceful planet.
