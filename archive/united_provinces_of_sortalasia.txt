Our great nation of the [b][u][region]United Provinces of Sortalasia[/region][/u][/b], glorious and [b][color=blue]united[/color][/b] in peace and fraternity, is a [b][color=#ff471a]Socialist [/color][/b]nations&#39; [b][color=green]utopia[/color][/b] for all nations willing to join.
We don&#39;t discriminate, we allow everyone* with the exception of nations allied to a war or invasion region. Obviously.
We accept both [b][u][color=blue]Allied countries[/color][/u][/b] symphateisers and [b][u][color=red]Karl Marx[/color][/u][/b] followers or any other type of nations.
But we only welcome Socialist, Communist, National Socialist (A.K.A Nazism) and Imperial Embassy requests.
Our capital is in Kazabograd which all of our glorious [b][u]provinces[/u][/b] share.
