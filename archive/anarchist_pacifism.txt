A region oriented on Anarcho-Pacifism, a political theory that proposes and advocates for the most ethical foundation of a humane society. This is a foundation that prioritises the most radical and intact forms of autonomy, empathy, freedom, compassion, equality, cooperation, progress, and respect for life. These ideals are impossible under the current international regime of exploitation and oppression, which is constructed upon a corrupt foundation of violence, abuse, and cruelty.

Anarcho-Pacifism guarantees the triumph of human rights, animal rights, and the well-being of the planet over the tyranny of state and corporate domination.
