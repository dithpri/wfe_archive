A region oriented on Anarcho-Pacifism, a political theory that proposes and advocates for the most ethical foundation of a humane society. This is a foundation that prioritises the most radical and complete forms of autonomy, empathy, freedom, compassion, equality, cooperation, progress, and respect for life. These ideals are impossible under the current international regime of exploitation and oppression, constructed upon a corrupt foundation of cruelty and violence.

Anarcho-Pacifism is the only ideology that guarantees the triumph of human rights, animal rights, and the well-being of the planet over the tyranny of state and corporate domination.
