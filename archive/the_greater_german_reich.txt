[b]Welcome to the ruins of the Greater German Reich[/b]

This region was once the biggest and most notorious fascist power in NationStates, but it was captured and refounded by Antifa forces after its founder ceased to exist in 2015. After years of occupation, the region eventually ceased to exist again. Since then, it has been refounded and is now under control of the ideologically centrist [region]Independent Liberation Front[/region].
These ruins shall serve as a reminder that war is never the right choice. May fascism never rise again!
