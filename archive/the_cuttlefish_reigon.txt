Hey there! We are the cuttlefish Region, a region ideal for anyone looking for a small, but active community. I am in the process of setting up a website and a region map. Our focus is on public transport, but we encourage and welcome diversity! When you move your nation here, please give us the following information on the message board:

Nation Name, and Shape (post an image). Location on the map. Anything you&amp;#39;d like your founder to know!

We&amp;#39;ll keep you updated on any happenings and news stories. Go enjoy!
