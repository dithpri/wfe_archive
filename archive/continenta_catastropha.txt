A region located on a previously undiscovered landmass within.. one of the oceans; Continenta Catastropha is an extremely bizarre land full of its own unique flora and fauna that dominante it&#39;s surface. The people of these lands are just as strange, many hailing from the landmass itself while others seem to have originated from more familiar lands only to become one with the natives of the continent.
