And as the lord gave mercy to those who have wrong, he has say. &amp;quot;Rise, my young ones; You shall follow me back to hell and beyond.&amp;quot; And as we followed him deeper and deeper into the fiery abyss; the ones who weren&amp;#39;t strong stayed down to fight the angels. As we fought towards the light, we ended up becoming the angels to arise from the depths of hell. This Lord, this man, this savior, shall lead us. He shall be our god.
