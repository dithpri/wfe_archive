The Constitution of Roma
Rome was not built in a day, but it can be burned in one. This is why we must put the protect of Roma, and her way of life, at the highest of our priorities. We must not allow ignorance or a foolish majority decide the fate of our nations. We must not allow barbarism and hideous atrocities to run rampant within our way of life. We must put our military in the highest regard, to both protect our way of life and spread it.

The Roma Federation grants new arrivals the Friend and Ally status of Rome as long as they follow the constitution. We will have an elected constitutional oligarchy to decide the issues that effect the federation as a whole. Welcome to Roma.
