Greetings!

In this community, we aspire to be patient and caring with one another. In this community, we do not hastily ban nations who have committed no wrongs. The Community of Truant Mountaineers seeks to establish a zone of equality. To that end, we will not have a WA Delegate unless by popular mandate, and that Delegate will be elected first by poll.
