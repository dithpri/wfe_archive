Welcome to the united common ground of the free and banded people of the Civil Six cluster of the universe. Forged from the fall of the Great War, the clusters have each taken their own roads to establish themselves in their own way. Being diplomatic and not resting on the laurels of the past, but seeking out a brighter future is the main goal of the Civil Six.

Together we will bring unity and dominance to the outer clusters.
