[b]We are the Militarist Confederation![/b]

Born out of a common desire to spread military realism to the NS RP forums, the Militarist Confederation was created to bring good RPers together and mentor those who may need help with roleplay. NOTE: this is an RPing region for military realism, we do not restrict entry on any type of government. You can even be a pacifist, if you want, you just have to apply.
