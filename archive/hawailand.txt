Hawaii is like no other place on earth. Home to one of the world&amp;#39;s most active volcanoes and the world&amp;#39;s tallest sea mountain. Birthplace of modern surfing, the hula and Hawaii Regional Cuisine. Former seat of a royal kingdom and home to the only royal palace on US soil. Hawaii is one of the youngest geological formations in the world and the youngest state of the union. But perhaps Hawaii&amp;#39;s most unique feature is its aloha spirit: the warmth of Hawaii&amp;#39;s people that wonderfully complements the Islands&amp;#39; perfect temperatures.
