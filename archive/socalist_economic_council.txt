The **Socialist Economic Council (SEC)** directs a centrally planned economy where **equality, sustainability, and social justice** take priority over profit. Through **state-owned industries, worker cooperatives, and five-year plans**, it ensures universal access to **jobs, housing, healthcare, and education**. Wages reflect **social contribution, not wealth accumulation**, and economic decisions are made through **People&#146;s Economic Assemblies**. The SEC promotes **green energy, global solidarity, and anti-capitalist trade** while rejecting market-driven inequality. With no poverty or exploitation, the economy serves the people, proving that **economic democracy and human liberation** are not just ideals&#151;they are reality.
