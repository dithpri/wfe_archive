In the land of [B][color=#000000]Black[/color] and [color=#FF0000]Red[/color][/B], Five Legionaries slowly rose from the dead &amp;#128128;. 
They formed a group in the &amp;#127761; [B]dead of night[/B] &amp;#127761;, ready for war, geared for a &amp;#128074;&amp;#127995; [B]fight[/B] &amp;#128074;&amp;#127995;.
With a mighty roar they charged their foe, filling native &amp;#128420; [B]hearts[/B] &amp;#128420; with grief and woe.
Not one who witnessed the Legion remains. For they became meals. [i]Yum... Brains[/i] 
For an &amp;#8987;&amp;#65039; [B]hour[/B] &amp;#8987;&amp;#65039; they feasted, These undead few who ran.[i] They had not a reason. They had not a plan.[/i]
Only &amp;#129321; [B]joy[/B] &amp;#129321; to be had. To spread terror and fear. Then back off to [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=osiris]Bed[/url]. They&#39;ll see you next year...
