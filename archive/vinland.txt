[b]Vinland[/b] is the name for North American land explored by Norse Vikings, where Leif Erikson first landed c. 1000, approximately five centuries prior to the voyages of Christopher Columbus and John Cabot. 

Vinland was the name given to North America as far as it was explored by the Vikings, presumably including both Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence as far as northeastern New Brunswick (where the eponymous grapevines are found).&#151;Wikipedia[hr]
