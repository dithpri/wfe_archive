Welcome to [b][color=turquoise][i]The[/i] Asia Pacific[/color][/b] territory, a laid back region for nations with an Asian and/or Pacific theme.

The Asia Pacific is home of numerous [color=orange][b]ancient cultures[/b][/color], [color=red][b]rapid growth economies[/b][/color], [color=blue][b]international shipping hubs[/b][/color], and, occasionally, [color=green][b]Kaiju attacks[/b][/color].

We invite you to kick back and enjoy a cocktail by the beach at one of the many tropical paradises dotting our region, take a hike through one of our hundreds of luscious rainforests, sit and meditate in an ancient temple, or sip some bubble tea at a trendy cafe in one of our bustling metropolises.
