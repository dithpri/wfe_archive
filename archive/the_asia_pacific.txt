Welcome to [color=blue][b][i]The[/i] Asia Pacific[/b][/color], a laid back region for nations with an Asian and/or Pacific theme.

We invite you to kick back and enjoy a cocktail by the beach at one of the many [b][color=red]tropical paradises[/color][/b] dotting our region, take a hike through one of our hundreds of [color=green][b]luscious rainforests[/b][/color], sit and meditate in an [b][color=orange]ancient temple[/color][/b], or sip some bubble tea at a trendy cafe in one of our [color=purple][b]bustling metropolises[/b][/color].

Asia Pacific is open to peaceful nations of all political persuasions and government styles, and hope you enjoy your stay in one of the most diverse and prosperous regions.
