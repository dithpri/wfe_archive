Welcome to the absolutely deserted land of the Greater Noobish Republics. Here, you can do whatever you want (if you like PermBans), or, you can submit to the Rogue Nation of Gramondeer. Geckiostan is a vice delegate. If you want to join, do so at your leisure, but be cautious: there are many large nations other than you. Unless you happen to be the leader.
