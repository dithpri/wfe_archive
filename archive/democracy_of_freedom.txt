This region was founded on the principle that people of the region should govern, and not the government created by the founder. Some regions promise that you have a say so in the direction the region is going, however the region&amp;#39;s government always has the final word. 

In [region]Democracy of Freedom[/region] all votes are counted equal, including the government official&amp;#39;s votes. All important decisions will be voted upon, and the constitution can be amended anytime.
