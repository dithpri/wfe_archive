A region where the world is multiple times its size with many more continents. You can regularly see dinosaurs and other extinct or mythical creatures roaming about and having a good time. The world is set in an alternate timeline where more than one planet collided with the Earth in it&#39;s beginning stages of creation, causing it to grow enormously but still support life and have a beautiful atmosphere and 2 moons.
