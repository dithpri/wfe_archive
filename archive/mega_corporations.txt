This is the future. Humanity has strayed long enough through the murky waters of the World Assembly, sentenced down as vicious by the security council, invaded, abused, and stripped of the right of free will. I believe we must change that. We will join them, yes, but control is the only real goal in any universe. I found this Region in hopes of securing dominion and capitalist control. Join me, and victory can be yours.
