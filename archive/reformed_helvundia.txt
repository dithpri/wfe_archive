[spoiler=New Iredale&#39;s Personal Letter]
From your [u]Former[/u] RP Minister,

To the nations of [region]Helvundia[/region] I made a mistake in thinking that a new region would mean a better region, it will only cause our region to be divided, I thank [nation]the socialist lands[/nation] for letting me see this and that there is still hope to unite and make this region what is truely meant to be with a division in nations. This is what is best for the Fatherland. This is what is best for You.

Sincerely,
[nation]New Iredale[/nation]
Former RP Minister for [region]Helvundia[/region]
Former Soldier of [region]Helvundian Armed Forces[/region][/spoiler]
