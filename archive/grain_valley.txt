 Greetings little natives ^.^ How lucky you are that I was here to protect you from those nasty little raiders. Please enjoy the freedom The High Priestess has so graciously granted you ^.^

[i]What[/i] is that? You wish to [i]thank[/i] Her benevolence for her charity? Well little natives, I&#146;m glad you said something, I have just the perfect idea&#133;

Perhaps you have heard of [color=pink]She Who Sleeps[/color]? Yes my little natives ^.^ She offers you a home in the Cult of [region]Simulacrum[/region]. All we ask is for your eternal devotion and the absolute surrender of your mortal body ^.^ A mere pittance before the opportunity to follow [b]Whisper[/b] into the Great Below.

Please do let us know of your interest

Sincerely, ^.^
