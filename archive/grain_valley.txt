It&#146;s a sizzling day in Grain Valley &#150; which is nothing new for a July morning in the Midwest.

The heat that emanates from the turf on the Grain Valley High School football field adds to the discomfort of the more than 200 students who are wrapping up a long, hard day of practice with Marching Eagles band director Reid Atkinson.

Yet no one seems to want to leave the field.

Atkinson takes a moment to reflect on that successful job interview, and adds, &#147;I can ruffle some feathers &#150; but it is all for the betterment of the kids. People ask me when did I know this could be a special place and I tell them I knew it at that first interview.
