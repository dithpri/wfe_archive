[b]YOU MAY BE DEAD, GATITO, BUT THAT WON&#39;T STOP ME FROM SNUGGLING UP WITH YOUR COLD, WASTING FORM IN THE INTIMATE CONFINES OF YOUR EARTHEN SARCOPHAGUS. AS WE EMBRACE EACH OTHER WITHIN SOIL DEAF TO OUR CRIES, MAY WE IN TURN BECOME PART OF THE EARTH AND PART OF EACH OTHER. YOU MAY BE DEAD, GATITO, BUT I WILL FOLLOW YOU FOREVER THROUGH LIFE AND DEATH AND HEAVEN AND HELL.

With Love,
