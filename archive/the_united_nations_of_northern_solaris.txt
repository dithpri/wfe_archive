Welcome to the UNNS!

An alliance born on the beliefs of freedom, democracy, and exploration! While it is a small group we hope that we can grow and flourish in the near future! At the moment we can&#39;t really do any role playing because of the *cough* lack of participants but I would like to be able to without being restricted by other people&#39;s rules. Nations that want to join are allowed to but must follow the following rules:

-Don&#39;t be mean
-Don&#39;t cuss
-Don&#39;t overthrow the government
-Have fun
-Or don&#39;t have fun
-You may put in a request for a position
-Yay!
