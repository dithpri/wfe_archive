Strasserism is Nazism with solidly left-wing economic ideals, closer to the original ideology of the German Workers Party. It is named after Gregor and Otto Strasser, the former of which was killed in the infamous Nazi purge of the party&amp;#39;s left wing and the SA - the Night of the Long Knives. Although *slightly* less anti-Semitic and more concerned with the general welfare than &amp;quot;Hitlerist&amp;quot; Nazism... well, being a tiny step forward from Hitler really isn&amp;#39;t saying much...
