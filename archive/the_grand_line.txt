Power will not be abused


This is the new age of pirates, brave souls go to sea searching for an old treasure that will make their dreams come true. The Grand Line is the staging ground for their adventures, and we are the island nations that inhabit it.

If you want your pirate name changed, send Atsui a tele and make factbook entries so that we actually know some stuff about your nation.

You may pin dispatches about the region to the board, but if they are found to be irrelevant, inappropriate, or inconsistent, they will be taken down until a fixed version is approved.

Seriously. Make Factbook entries for your nation.
