The Grand Line is a line of oceans in between the world, similar to the equator. Countries in the Grand Line are usually many islands Such as Fountain Land. This place is a popular lure for pirates, as the pirate king claimed to have hid his treasure here before his death, however, pirate crimes in here stay an all time low as pirates don&#39;t invade, but usually just stock up supplies before leaving for other islands in the region. There are also rumors of powerful &quot;Devil Fruits&quot; Hidden in the grand line. These fruits give the consumer superpowers, in exchange, they lose the ability to swim forever.
