Opportunity will hopefully be a place where all sorts of things can happen. Multiple roleplay maps, politics, and maybe even a military. However, it is still a work in progress, and honestly I&#39;ve no clue how to do any of it. Anyone is welcome here, whether you&#39;re a newbie or a veteran, and hopefully we can make a nice place to live.
