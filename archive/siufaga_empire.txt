After many months of negotiations with leaders of the Samoan Matai Chiefdom and the Samoan Government, The rapidly rising Siufagarian Republic sought out to unify Samoa&amp;#39;s provinces into one full democratic republic. On March 18th 2013, The Democratic Republic of Siufaga was founded. One year later, Siufaga&amp;#39;s political ways changed. After the annual 4 year elections that was held this year, 81%(80% expected for victory) of Siufagarian citizens voted for Empire-Rule over Democratic Rule. This dramatically changed Siufaga. However Siufaga still remained Democratic till now.
