This regions purpose is to uphold the creeds of nationalism and fascism; and to act as a sanctuary to all seeking refuge from liberals and communists. 
Being that we are a newborn region comprised mostly of fledgling nations, we are always open to advise and support in growing our region and spreading our message to the world. Given the amount of communist and anti-Fascist influence within the World Assembly and Security Council, we have declared them a threat to the sanctity of the Fascist Creed, and therefore; our enemies. 

 Please message our leader and founder, Yesacia, with any questions or advise.
