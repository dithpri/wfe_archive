[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]This region was once a long-standing holding of a user from [region]The Red Fleet[/region]. However, on 3/7/25, dozens of their puppets [i]([nation]Lamp Post XI[/nation] - [nation]Lamp Post XXXIX[/nation])[/i] ceased to exist. This region was subsequently seized for the state along with many other regions.

Isn&#39;t it hilarious how some people become so ideologically warped that they say [i]&quot;nazi punks f**k off&quot;[/i] in the WFE of a captured ISRAELI region? I don&#39;t think Nazis are the kind of people who are in favor of a Jewish state, genius.[/color]
