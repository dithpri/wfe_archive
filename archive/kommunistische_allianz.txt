Welcome to Kommunistische Allianz, the new socialist region within NationStates. We have Marxist views, and our vision is a world unified under a red banner. Kommunistische Allianz started off as just 2 tiny groups, one in Ireland and one in Germany. Both had communist and anti-British views.They decided to unite and form a revolution. Now most of Western Europe is united under a red banner. Our next target is Britain, and we need help. Once the United Kingdom has capitulated, the Kommunistische Allianz will be the world&#39;s new superpower, topping fellow commie China and the USA. We desperately need help. Please sponsor our cause and make a united Leftist planet.
