This is a region for players who are casual or learning the game and don&#39;t want to be involved with writing fan fic, I mean &quot;role playing&quot;. 
We do not have, and never will have, offsite forums. 
All are welcome as long as you shut the hell up and don&#39;t try to make friends. We don&#39;t have a &quot;wa&quot; because I don&#39;t know what the hell that is and we don&#39;t &quot;invade&quot; because I don&#39;t know what the hell that is and we don&#39;t vote on anything because I don&#39;t know why we would. Hang out here if you don&#39;t want to be bothered or if you are learning the ins and outs.  End of factbook entry.
