O were my Love yon Lilack fair,
Wi&#146; purple blossoms to the Spring;
And I, a bird to shelter there,
When wearied on my little wing.

How I wad mourn, when it was torn
By Autumn wild, and Winter rude!
But I was sing on wanton wing,
When youthfu&#146; May its bloom renew&#146;d.

O gin my love were yon red rose,
That grows upon the castle wa&#146;!
And I mysel&#146; a drap o&#146; dew,
Into her bonnie breast to fa&#146;!

Oh, there beyond expression blesst
I&#146;d feast on beauty a&#146; the night;
Seal&#146;d on her silk-saft faulds to rest,
Till fley&#146;d awa by Phebus&#146; light!
