East of the Misty Mountains and West of Mordor, this picturesque area is home to Lorien, Greenwood, Gondor, Rohan, and Esgaroth. Of course, the Khundolar Easterlings have laid claim to the area. No matter. They really want peace deep down, and would rather not be serving Sauron. Just make them happy and cede the Limlight and South Gondor.
