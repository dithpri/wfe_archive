[region]Save Our Planet[/region] is intended to promote discussion concerning problems and solutions that affect our Earth. The Regional Message Board will be open to all residents of embassy regions. [b]All Embassy Invitations will be accepted[/B], but to ensue that the embassy region truly desires to discuss environmental issues, or the future of our planet, this region will not actively solicit embassies by sending out embassy requests, except for the regions that are obviously ecologically friendly. Neither will this region actively recruit, since it is expected that the truly serious individuals will find their way here.

Join our region if you love the Earth, and want to [region]Save Our Planet[/region]!
