This is a Fascist region based upon Nazi beliefs, but in compliance with the game rules. For to long different organizations have been divided in name, but not in mentality. Actions from antiquity has branded our predecessors as evil and hate filled, but that is no longer the case. We are not thugs walking streets to abuse and physically harm people. The days of pitchforks and torches have changed to protests and marches. Society no longer changes through forcibly mandated actions, but by the letter of the law and public opinion. If our opinion is so wrong, and so far left, why pay any attention to it unless you realize that the more and more people we reach, the more will understand the truth behind our movement.
