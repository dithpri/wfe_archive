Kolaskyva is the biggest continent on Johorne, located right in the middle of the world. In the beginning, many countries resided in its area, Then five, main countries arose, Etha, Rolinithz, Destiny Island, Shaluach, and Atelia. Then as time passed, Atelia became the sovereign ruler of the five. But, due to different political views, they separated. But they stayed in touch, and eventually, they became friends, more or less and became a land of all those joined together by an inner bond, for now.
