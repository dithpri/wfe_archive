Welcome Comrades to most glorious Kolaskyva!

This region is filled with well meaning comrades ready to have a conversation with you anytime as well as support your nation in any time of need. It is ruled by Emperor Xaver Stavridis of Atelia and it has been demanded that in return for the safety and great community Kolaskyva provides that you abide by the three pillars of law within Kolaskyva 1. No spam 2. No flaming 3. No vulgarities or obscenities. As well as of course your complete and utter loyalty. Do to our many interactions with the traitorous Johorne region we may be commonly referred to as the loyalist.
