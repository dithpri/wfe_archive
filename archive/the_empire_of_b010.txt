Welcome to The Empire of B010, the home of Rob Butlers marvellous tutor group!

Please remember to join the WA and vote for whoever you wish to be the WA delegate.

There is a limit of 3 endorsements per person so choose your candidates wisely, choosing more than 3 results in an eject to keep the voting fair

All forms of abuse will result in a kick from the region, based on the Delegates judgement. (Excluding power abuse by me)

Vice delegate is The USSF so please endorse both him and myself

Many Thanks,
[nation=short]Bognor Regis[/nation] (WA Delegate)
