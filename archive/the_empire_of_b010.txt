Welcome to The Empire of B010, the home of Rob Butler&amp;#39;s marvellous tutor group!

Please remember to join the WA and vote for whoever you wish to be the WA delegate, although votes and endorsements can&amp;#39;t be bought or bribed.

There is a limit of 3 endorsements per person so choose wisely, choosing more than 3 results in an eject to keep the voting fair.

Players can be kicked if 5 votes are received. Votes are to be announced on the region&amp;#39;s main page. However, the WA Delegate reserves the right to step in and make executive decision about the banning of people if they fear there has been any falsification of voters or other decent reasons.

We will not tolerate any abuse in the region.

Many Thanks,
James
