[b][color=darkred]DEUS VULT[/color][/b] is a place for those who know that Heaven on Earth may not be brought about by any means other than the flaming sword of Christ.

The Great Crusade of our time is fought not on the same lands of yesterday but in a new spiritual ground that encompasses the entire world. The great enemy is global, and primarily spiritual, yet resides, controls, and defends itself with violence of the flesh. Thus- and because when violence is thrusted upon us a force of at least equal magnitude is applied in the opposite direction- it is that very same malignant flesh that we must slash and cut with our Holy Swords.
