Welcome all who come from the Fourth Hellenic Republic and Jesuitoplis.  We have recently been instated as a province of the Soverign Commonwealth of McQuaid(SCMCQ). A little notice: because we are a province of the SCMCQ, the embassies have to be everlasting. You now have these rights.
1) If you become a WA delegate, you can vote for a vice-govenor of the region
2) You can telegram any officials in the home region(SCMCQ).
3) You may use the regional forum on the regional website(nsmcq.webs.com)
I am working to see if you have the eligibility to run to be a representative of our region in the SCMCQ executive council. 

As always, you can give me ideas on how to run our region better.

Have a lovely day,
DFTBA
