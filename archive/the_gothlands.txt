The Chosen of God have been exiled from the the Holy Land, exiled from Greece, exiled from Rome, exiled from Europa, and now exiled from Albion. United under the guidance of The Fifedom of Imperator Christ, they embark on their quest to build a New Empire for God - one that knows no lies, no ugliness, no sin; only truth, beauty and purity.
