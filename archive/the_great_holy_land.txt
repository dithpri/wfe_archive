The Great Holy Land is the origin of all religions, because in this world, we all believe in the same God, with different names, with different commands, with different pantheons. But in Truth, all the religions are one and the same, with opposed and restricted points of view. This is why the Great Holy Land had created the Holy Inquisition, a powerful religious army, with the divine goal of spreading the Truth across the world and to unite the religious nations, with the authority of God himself.
