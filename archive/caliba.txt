[color=red]This region is now a colony of [region]Ainur[/region], meaning all actions completed by Ainur for the region of Caliba are done willingly, as this region was given to Ainur by the once-active government. The purpose of this region will be unveiled upon refounding. [/color]

[color=orange]World Assembly Delegate&amp;#39;s Note: Any action against [region]Caliba[/region], is an action against [region]Ainur[/region]. Any nations believed to be raiding puppets have been ejected and/or banned, those responsible for the recruiting telegram spam, and Tyler Kazakov/Nick Washington/Samuel Kudrow has been banjected.[/color]
