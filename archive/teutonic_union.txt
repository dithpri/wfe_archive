Established at Mecklenburg, Hanover by King Jeffrey II of Hanover and Grand Duke Heinrich Christoph of Brunswick, the Teutonic Union is an alliance of conservative Protestant monarchies. The Protectorate of Detmold forms the western boundary of the alliance, bordering the Orange Free States. The Principality of Upper Westphalia is still administered directly by the Westphalian Empire, and the realm is situated on the eastern end of Union territory.
