Remoteness combined with proximity to some of the most powerful and affluent western city-states make this region a desert haven for nomadic, dissident factions. First nations, anarchists, exiles, and spiritual pilgrims alike come to find peaceful solace amidst the sun, stars, sand and wind. All are welcome save for overarchingly corporate and imperialist factions.
