Just a few rules of this region:

1. Respect your fellow nations in our region
2. Remember that our mother has the right to eject, and if necessary, ban you from our region.
3. When you have earned the option to name your leader, we ask that if they are male, type Overlord and if female, type Matriarch in front of their name. This just helps keep our rein consistent.

Remember that we will enable a poll system if there is a domestic debate amongst our region. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, do not be afraid to notify [nation]Fontressmoure[/nation].

Thank you.
