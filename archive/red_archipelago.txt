Welcome to [region]Red Archipelago[/region], officially the [b]Free Association of Socialist Archipelagic Republics[/b]. The region is [i]de facto[/i] administered by [nation]Captiotia[/nation], which seeks to establish a system of mutual benefit and co-governance between member nations and encourage an effective multilateral transition to socialism/communism. The region is ideologically intended for progressive and democratic leftist nations, but anyone is allowed as either a visitor or [i]observer state[/i]. [u]Note: you may be subject to tireless efforts to foment proletarian revolution within your borders.[/u]

All arriving nations will receive a complementary cheese sample delegation from SR Captiotia.

Well wishes,
