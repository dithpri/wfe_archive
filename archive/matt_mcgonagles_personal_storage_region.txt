[nation]Matt McGonagle[/nation] just passed a vote to be allowed to exist but won&#39;t be with the other puppets, instead they will be transferred here. Call it whatever you want, its a solitary confinement area. Clearly this region belongs to [nation]The Former State of Massachusetts[/nation], so no one is allowed here, not even the other puppets! Only [nation]The Former State of Massachusetts[/nation] can come here.
