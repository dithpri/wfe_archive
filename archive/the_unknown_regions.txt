The [b]Unknown Regions[/b] comprise the westernmost region of the galaxy, largely cut off from hyperspace travel by a large gravitational disturbance on its borders in hyperspace. Making up approximately 15% of the galaxy&#39;s stellar mass, it is home to many alien cultures, such as the Chiss Ascendancy (the region&#39;s largest and most prominent civilization), the Vagaari, and the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium.

[nation]Planet Csilla[/nation] refounded the region after its previous constituent nations ceased to exist.
