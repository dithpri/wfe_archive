The United Nations facilitates world dialogue and runs some of the world&amp;#39;s largest humanitarian networks. It was established at the end of WWII in the hopes that such a global catastrophe would never happen again. Although there hasn&amp;#39;t been a WWIII, the UN has demonstrated ineffectiveness several times in its history. The nations of the world must learn from these mistakes and continue attempts to work together. Whether we like it or not, we are a global community now.
