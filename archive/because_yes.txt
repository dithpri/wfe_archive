[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]Sky Haven[/region] decided to visit your region in search of [color=yellow]precious shinies[/color]. 

We had heard the legend that this was a nice region with many [color=yellow]shinies[/color], and decided to pay it a visit to look and take some of the shiny. 

Indeed, we found [color=yellow]the shiny[/color]. Was it [color=yellow]the shiny[/color]? It was [color=yellow]the shiny[/color]. 
We left cookies in exchange, and hope to come back in future!
