The Prakrit Archipelago lies in a sweet spot near the middle of the Vedic Ocean, just beyond the reach of the nearest hurricane belt. It mostly enjoys a temperate climate, though the northernmost islands may receive snow in winter and the southernmost may tend closer to subtropical. The Archipelago is home to four independent nations, who coexist in varying degrees of harmony.

The Prakrit was recently the subject of an invasion attempt by nations from the Black Riders region, but the latter were no match for a counterattack by the mighty Upekkhan army and its North Purple Pineapple dragon allies (not to mention the magical region-founder powers).
