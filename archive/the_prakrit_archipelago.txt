Welcome to The Prakrit Archipelago!

A small chain of islands home to multiple sovereign nations, the Prakrit Archipelago flourishes in the sweet spot of the Vedic Ocean just beyond the reach of the nearest hurricane belt. It mostly enjoys a pleasant, temperate climate, though the northern islands may receive snow in winter.
