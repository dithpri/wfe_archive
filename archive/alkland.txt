             All Hail The C.O.G.! ([region]The coalition of governments[/region]) 

[i]Alkland[/i] Is a world like Lerodas, aside from the absence of other nations, Alkyn is another version of Glaedirsgrad, had certain events transpired the same way here, It would be an exact replica of [nation=short]Glaedirsgrad[/nation] and all of Lerodas. But certain events DID transpire, and all that is left from those events has left the planet of Terodas in tatters.

*Alkland Is the Alternate Universe of Lerodas*
