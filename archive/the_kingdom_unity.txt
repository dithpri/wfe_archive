The Kingdom Unity is a unity of all kinds of monarchies in the world. We also support roleplay and you can do whatever you want: start a war, establish embassies, as long as you roleplay it. We welcome nations regardless of their age and power. Anyone from an old empire to a small kingdom can join us. THIS IS NOT A DICTATORSHIP REGION. We hope to grow our region and eventually monarchy will be respected in modern world.
