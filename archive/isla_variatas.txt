A chain of virtually unknown islands located in the [color=blue]South Pacific[/color], at the West side of Costa Rica, Isla Variatas (Spanish for Island Varieties) is a rather peaceful region, despite having a [color=red]bloody[/color] past. It consists of many different islands ([b]13[/b] of which can be seen on its flag), with a [i]variety[/i] (haha get it) of different environments.

Our region map is currently work in progress, however there is a completed mini version with just Whogland and No Man&#39;s Land/Shared territory, [url=http://i.imgur.com/RNo1fHV.png]which can be found here.[/url]
