A chain of virtually unknown islands located in the South Pacific, Isla Variatas (Greek for Island Varieties) is a rather peaceful region, despite having a bloody past. It consists of many different islands (13 of which can be seen on its flag), with a variety (haha get it) of different environments. The region is (unofficially) divided into 4 sections, each based on one of the main environments, and represented on the flag by a colour: Arctic - white, desert/savannah - orange, field/swamp/taiga - green, and volcanic/rocky - grey.
