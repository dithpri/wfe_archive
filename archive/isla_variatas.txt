A chain of virtually unknown islands located in the [color=blue]South Pacific[/color], at the West side of Costa Rica, Isla Variatas (Spanish for Island Varieties) is a rather peaceful region, despite having a [color=red]bloody[/color] past. It consists of many different islands, with a [i]variety[/i] (haha get it) of different environments. 

The stars on our region&#39;s flag represent the positioning of the capital cities of the region&#39;s [b]8[/b] main nations, AKA the founders of U.N.I.V. (United Nations of Isla Variatas).
