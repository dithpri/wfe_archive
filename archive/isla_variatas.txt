A chain of virtually unknown islands located in the [color=blue]South Pacific[/color], Isla Variatas (Spanish for Island Varieties) is a rather peaceful region, despite having a [color=red]bloody[/color] past. It consists of many different islands ([b]13[/b] of which can be seen on its flag), with a [i]variety[/i] (haha get it) of different environments. The region is (unofficially) divided into [b]4[/b] sections, each based on one of the main environments, and represented on the flag by a colour: [color=white]Arctic - white[/color], [color=orange]desert/savannah - orange[/color], [color=green]field/swamp/taiga - green[/color], and [color=grey]volcanic/rocky - grey[/color]. 

Our region map is currently work in progress, however there is a completed mini version with just Whogland and No Man&#39;s Land/Shared territory, [url=http://i.imgur.com/RNo1fHV.png]which can be found here[/url]
