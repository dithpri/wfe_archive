1500, all in singles (straight up!)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
Round and round they go
Round and round they go (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pray for me
I&#39;m about to hit the Ye button
I don&#39;t wanna say nothin&#39; wrong
But it&#39;d be wrong if I ain&#39;t say nothin&#39;
Imagine if I ain&#39;t say somethin&#39;
