The history of the Tricity is an important element of the contemporary consciousness of every Pole: it was here that the strikes of 1970, 1980 and 1988 set in motion the destruction of the communist system. In 1980, [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lech_Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa]Lech Walesa[/url] led the strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, which became the cradle of the Solidarity social movement.
