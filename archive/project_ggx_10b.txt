Once, it was a joke. Now, it has turned into something way more sinister...
Streamer by the name of [b]&quot;GreekGodX&quot;[/b] made up this gang to jokingly strike fear into people&#39;s hearts - [i]but the plan backfired[/i]. [b]GGX Gang[/b] is now the most [color=red]feared faction in the world[/color](only barely outrunning [color=red]Boonk Gang[/color]), and when the [color=blue]World Assembly[/color] issued the destruction of the clan, [b][u]a few still survived[/u][/b]. [b]GGX Gang[/b] still lives to this day. And slowly, but surely, they&#39;re planning to build up enough power to [color=red]take over the world[/color], just as they had done so long ago&#133;
