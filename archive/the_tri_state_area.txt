In the bay off the coast of the Tri-State Area
Floats a country for me, and me!
It&amp;amp;#39;s new!
It&amp;amp;#39;s bright!
And it&amp;amp;#39;s founded on spite!
And it&amp;amp;#39;s everything I dreamed it would be,
Hail, hail Doofania!

There&amp;amp;#39;s a bright, shiny place
With a flag that bears my face
And it&amp;amp;#39;s floating on an inner tube
Far away from city life, my stupid brother and ex-wife!
And it&amp;amp;#39;s got an evil attitude,
Hail, hail Doofania!
