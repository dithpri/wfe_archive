Entry is open, but keep in mind that I have full authority over who gets removed, so be a decent human being.

If you&#39;re in WA, endorse Bladium. Endorsing others is not allowed until I hit 10 endorsements, at which point I will set an endorsement limit. Endorsing someone over the endorsement limit WILL get you ejected.
