Welcome to Bear Territory!

We&#39;re a young region looking to gain power and prestige among the other regions of the world. We welcome any country to come and participate. We follow a Republican government system. Our current government is planning to begin drafting a regional constitution. All countries will be welcome to become citizens and participate in the regional government. Residents are welcomed to join in RPs and regional sports tourneys.

Also make sure to endorse our WA Delegate: [nation]United Civil Republic[/nation]
