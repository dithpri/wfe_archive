A home for fans of radio host conservatives.  All thinking people are welcome, even traditional democrats.  No off-the-rails libs please.

[b]Guidelines:[/b]
1) No one will be kicked out unless you&amp;#39;re a raving loon or obvious subversive
2) I don&amp;#39;t speak much here so it&amp;#39;s a quieter area if that&amp;#39;s fine with you
3) I don&amp;#39;t deal with this World Assembly garbage, so there&amp;#39;s no one to endorse or elect

Enjoy!
