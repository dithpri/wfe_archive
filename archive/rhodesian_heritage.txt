I was born in a land where the skies are so blue,
African sunsets, flamed bright golden hue,
Communities were strong, we cared, we shared;
Problems rallied us, loads together we bared.

November 11th is Independence Day, let us raise a toast to Smith and Rhodesia on the occasion of our sovereign independence, ever mindful of the sacrifices made in defense of Justice, Civilisation and Christianity over the course of 59 years.
