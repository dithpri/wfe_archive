I was born in a land where the skies are so blue,
African sunsets, flamed bright golden hue,
Communities were strong, we cared, we shared;
Problems rallied us, loads together we bared.

Today marks 130 anniversary of the Shangani Patrol incident in which BSAC forces under the command of Major Allan Wilson were encircled and routed by their Matabele adversaries resulting in deaths of 35 troopers not least of which includes Wilson himself. 

Let us remember their sacrifice in the service of Rhodesia, now and forever
