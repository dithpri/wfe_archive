I was born in a land where the skies are so blue,
African sunsets, flamed bright golden hue,
Communities were strong, we cared, we shared;
Problems rallied us, loads together we bared.

I&#39;m proud of my heritage, my life, my homeland;
for those not born there, will not understand
If we teach our children the values we choose
They will follow and walk in the prints of our shoes

Displaced as a nation, no fault of our own,
Our children&#39;s seed in foreign lands are sewn.
No-one can take away our dignity and pride,
For that&#39;s been cherished and nurtured inside.

In our hearts and our souls, we are all kith and kin,
For we are Africans, regardless of color of skin.
So hold your head high, be proud and true
For this will continue&#133;just because of you.
