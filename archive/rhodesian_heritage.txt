Sit Nomine Digna: Rhodesia (1890-1980) 

In the heart of central Africa, a frontier spirit engendered a hardy breed. Hard work and a generous land greatly contributed to the prosperity of all the subcontinent.

I was born in a land where the skies are so blue,
African sunsets, flamed bright golden hue,
Communities were strong, we cared, we shared;
Problems rallied us, loads together we bared.
