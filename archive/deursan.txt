[b]An unknown, but extremely large distance from where you currently sit[/b], exists a land only spoke of in whispers, tall tales, and Minecraft world saves. That land is the incredible land of Deursan, a place known for it&#39;s infinite sources of creativity and conflict.

Many saw Deursan as a powder keg, unstable, it&#39;s inhabitants quick to enter fierce passive-aggressive debates. But, those few who entered ended up creating a long, vivid history, unmatched by most, if any.

Now it&#39;s just kind of here, on NationStates. No, you can&#39;t join. That time has passed. Good luck on your adventures elsewhere.
