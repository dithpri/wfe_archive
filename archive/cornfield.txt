[color=99bkb1]This region was originally created by NationState [/color][color=red][i]&quot;The Station Director of Eloise Hawking.&quot;[/i][/color] 

[color=99bkb1]It is modeled after a self serving fictional pseudo-intellectual L.A. low life from the pathetic cancelled TV series [u]&quot;Lost.&quot;[/u].  

The character is best known for manipulating then finally killing her own son with a bullet in the back.  Avoid this slop if at all possible.[/color]
