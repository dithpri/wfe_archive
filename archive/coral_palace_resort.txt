[b][color=lightcoral]~~~[/color] [color=coral]Thank you to the former residents at the Coral Palace Resort![/color] [color=lightcoral]~~~[/color]

[color=coral]It was such great fun to have you all here and to help us try to get our business up and running! Unfortunately our company has undergone a merger and our glorious hotel is being converted into a religious institution for some religion called Sickentology, whatever that is. Thank you all so much for staying, and we promise that our brand new hotel in the beautiful land of [region=Solid Kingdom] will more than make up for this inconvenience![/color]
