  Isla Perfectum is a group of large Pacific islands that once belonged to the [nation]Plamyadia[/nation]. Recently, however, they have separated from their mother nation, becoming a region with a policy of acceptance and leniency. All nations are welcome here, no matter how deplorable, and the regional government will not interfere with private international affairs. So, please, pull up a chair, stay a while, just don&amp;#39;t insult llamas and we won&amp;#39;t have any problems!
