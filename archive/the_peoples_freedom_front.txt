The People&#39;s Freedom Front was founded by Liberty, for Liberty. Founded in the 1970&#39;s to combat the war on drugs movement, it is based on the principles of personal freedom as well as economic freedom. With a reign so minuscule you can barely see it, this truly is the people&#39;s region. Join our region for debates, we believe in free speech and will not remove members for any reason, unless multiple other members raise a vote of expulsion. Join the People&#39;s Freedom Front for fun, or help us rise to the top of the ranks to bring true freedom to other regions.
