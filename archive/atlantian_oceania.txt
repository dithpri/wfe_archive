[u]The[/u] most successful region in the NS World Cup, we also compete in other sporting events throughout the NS Sports Forum and in our own Regional Championships on the AO Regional and Nationstates Forums. Atlantian Oceania&#39;s success has since spilled over into a trifecta of &quot;A&quot;+ NS Sports regions with the creation of Anaia and [region]Arrosia[/region]
