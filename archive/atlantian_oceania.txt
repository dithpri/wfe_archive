Atlantian Oceania (AO) was founded in 2004 as an active off-site RP region and has since established itself as one of the great sporting regions in history. One of the most successful regions in the NS World Cup, we also compete in other sporting events throughout the NS Sports Forum and in our own Regional Championships on the AO Regional Forum.
