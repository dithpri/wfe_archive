Officially endorsed by the Catholic Church around 1129, the Order became a favored charity throughout Christendom, and grew rapidly in membership and power. Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. Non-combatant members of the Order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom, innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking, and building many fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land.  After their betrayal by King Philip IV of France in 1307, the Templars&amp;#39; disappearance gave rise to speculation and legends.

The legends are TRUE!

We are non-masonic.
