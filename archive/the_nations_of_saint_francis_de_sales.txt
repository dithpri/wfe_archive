This is a region for nations owned by students at DeSales University. 

We encourage all member nations to follow in the way of Salesian Christian Humanism as developed by St. Francis de Sales and St. Jane de Chantal. Descriptions of Christian Humanism can be found on the DSU website or in the fact book of Salesiana. This is not mandated to be in the region.
