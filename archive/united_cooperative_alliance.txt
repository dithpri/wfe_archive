The United Cooperative Alliance (UCA) is a brand new alliance formed by the merging of EAO and UDAF. The alliance strives to help spread peace, bringing a new age of trade and diplomacy. Currently, the alliance is striving for a better future, but is unsure of its place in the world, thus resulting in a potential 4th merge with another small alliance, or UCA officially entering [region]Global Alliance GA[/region].
