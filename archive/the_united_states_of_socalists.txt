 &#148;Ask not what your country can do for you &#151; ask what you can do for your country.&#148; - John F. Kennedy

&amp;quot;Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country.&amp;quot;
 Franklin D. Roosevelt
