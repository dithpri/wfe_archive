Greetings,

If you decide to join for some reason, there is a chance you will be allowed to stay (which depends solely on the current mood of the Leader).
This region is under full control of [nation]Duchy Rhinoceros[/nation]. There are no exceptions and no plans to implement any exceptions in the future. It was created after the Leader got tired of these sociable degenerates who kept writing hundreds of meaningless messages to the Message Board every day. Therefore, any Message Board activity is outlawed.
Nations with disturbing amounts of civil rights and political freedom will be monitored closely and ejected immediately in case they try to spread their ideals into the Duchy.

Have a pleasant day, within reason.
