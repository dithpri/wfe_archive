[b]Ave, Nations whom see this. We at the [region]The Gaztin Pact[/region] are a very young and fledgling Region. I someday hope to see the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region_rmb/region=the_gaztin_pact] RMB [/url]  endlessly being added to, lore galore in dispatches and many friendships, and a power like no other. But for now we are small and diligent. This will also be a Prodominantly Fascist and Authoritarian region, Communists are welcome, but it is not recommened, you will most likely be seen as an invader.[/b]

[i][b]If you wish to help build this region do DM me.[/b][/i]
 
[b]Prejudice is also [u]NOT WELCOME[/u]. Fascism does not equal hate, nor give you the right to.[/b]

[i]Region Flag created by: [nation]Almajidistan[/nation][/i]

[b]The theme of this region will be Dieselpunk, for those nations who enjoy war and it&#39;s aesthetic.[/b]

[b][i]Well What is Dieselpunk?[/i][/b]
