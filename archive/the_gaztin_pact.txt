[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region held embassies with several fascist regions, and we all know that means ANTIFA and the red menace were going to be on the prowl for it. This region shut down for whatever reason, so I decided the name should be refounded by somebody who isn&#39;t here to &quot;bash&quot;. Despite being fascists, they supported LGBTQ, something the left doesn&#39;t want you to know is possible.
