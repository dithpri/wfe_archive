[b]Good Evening, Nations whom see this. I am not entirely sure If I&#39;m going to stay or keep this region. It&#39;s mainly a test. I have never made a region before but it seems fun. I may as well keep this region up, and maybe it will grow. But for now it is simply a project for me.[/b]

[b]This region will mainly be seen as a Fascist and Authoritarian Region. Communists are welcome, but it is not suggested. I will probably assume you&#39;re an invader[/b]

[b]Prejudice is also NOT WELCOME. This is an Anti-Racist, Anti-Homophobic region. Fascism does not equal hate, nor give you an excuse to. [/b]

[b][u]Edit: I think I am going to make this a Dieselpunk themed region.[/u][/b]

[b][i]Well What is Dieselpunk?[/i][/b]
