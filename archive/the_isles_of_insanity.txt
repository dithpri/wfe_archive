The Isles of Insanity is a less-than-sane region.

Thanks to Ivaryssia, we now have an offsite forums - for urgent matters, use the main discussion; other matters should be taken [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Isles_of_Insanity/index/]here[/url].
Also, Ivaryssia created a map. Look at it [url=http://i.imgur.com/0J7kLEZ.jpg]here[/url].
The rules here are fairly relaxed - we only kick &amp;amp; ban raiders, if they get here through witchcraft.
Raider associates will be tried. Somehow. It&amp;#39;s being worked on.
