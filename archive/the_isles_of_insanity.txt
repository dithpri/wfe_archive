Using superior administration powers, some free curly fries, and a swift kick to the face by a political activist, The Isles of Insanity have regained control over their own region and are repairing any damages done during the raid. We are still a small cluster of islands known for its lower than average sanity.
As a region, the Isles of Insanity is large and sprawling, containing an ever-growing number of major islands and a massive quantity of smaller islands. It has had a fairly short history, but in its time it has survived one so-called &amp;quot;raid&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;elite raiders&amp;quot;. If this ever happens again, it will be swiftly taken care of.
Please endorse Demongate if you are a member of the World Assembly. This is vital for preventing &amp;quot;raids&amp;quot;.
