[b]The Ode of Euros[/b]

For many days and nights my friends, Bronowski&#39;s been our home.
As we pushed and shoved each other in our race to gain the globe.

But now the time has come my friends to start fresh and anew.
In a region based on Europe, we can bid the old adieu.

The distant shores of other lands, we all can say goodbye.
For now we can all argue over Baltic, Seine, and Rhine.

So come along my olden friends, your future&#39;s in a carriage.
Use your tools, arrange the world through brains, brawn, and marriage!
