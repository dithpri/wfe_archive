Eons ago there existed two mighty factions, the faction of Reapers and there leader, Death, and a group of Humans. The group of humans have been wagging war against themselves long before recorded history. So to keep up with all the deaths, Death was forced to make Reapers to assist him in his job. After a while they had grown weary of just guiding souls to the afterlife. They started sending humans to their untimely demise by force. They kept doing this until one human decided something should be done. This human set out to create a republic that would resist against the Reapers. In the end the fighting had grown futile as one could not completely destroy the other. They had decided to make a treaty, and their regions had become one.
