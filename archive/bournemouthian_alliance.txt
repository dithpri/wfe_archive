A region just for pupils and possibly staff of Bournemouth School. This region is politically neutral, I&amp;#39;m leaving it up to you to decide what you want to do. The group is aimed at actively participating in the WA and our rep will hopefully be chosen fairly, then again I won&amp;#39;t be surprised if somewhere along the line some deals are made. Feel free to leave this region if you want, we wont judge you. But hopefully together we can be stronger!

Let the 75th fight to be WA REP begin!!

I apologise for the somewhat cheesy description. When we have a delegate they can deal with that! Play (un)fair. Play hard. This is politics.
