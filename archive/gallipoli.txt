The [b]Gallipoli[/b] peninsula is located in Turkish Thrace, the European part of Turkey, with the Aegean Sea to the west and the Dardanelles strait to the east.

Gallipoli derives its name from the Greek &quot;&amp;#922;&amp;#945;&amp;#955;&amp;#955;&amp;#943;&amp;#960;&amp;#959;&amp;#955;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&quot; (Kallipolis), meaning &quot;Beautiful City&quot;. In antiquity, it was known as the Thracian Chersonese, from Greek: &amp;#920;&amp;#961;&amp;#945;&amp;#954;&amp;#953;&amp;#954;&amp;#942; &amp;#935;&amp;#949;&amp;#961;&amp;#963;&amp;#972;&amp;#957;&amp;#951;&amp;#963;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; (Latin: Chersonesus Thracica).

The peninsula runs in a south-westerly direction into the Aegean Sea, between the Hellespont (now known as the Dardanelles) and the bay of Melas (today Saros bay). Near Agora it was protected by a wall running across its full breadth. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
