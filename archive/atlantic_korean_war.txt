 Based on a fiction where Kim Jong Un II, Kim Jong Un&#39;s son reunites South and North Korea and forms The New Korean Republic. With South Korea&#39;s economy and North Korea&#39;s military power, the NKR becomes a new superpower. The NKR invades and annexes Vietnam after several threats of a nuclear attack. The U.S, UK, Canada and several other countries assist Japan but are forced to retreat after the NKR threatens to nuke Japan and the European Union. The NKR soon overhauls its military and doubles its funding for a prolonged Atlantic campaign which would soon lead to what is known as the Atlantic-Korean War.
