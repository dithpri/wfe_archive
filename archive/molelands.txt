[b]The war between [nation=short+noflag]Valyrica[/nation] and [nation=short+noflag]Sabatonica[/nation] has ended[/b]
A recent dispute has ended between Valyrica and Sabatonica over unclaimed territory to the south-east of Molelands. Valyrica withdrew from the large island, now called Carolea, after Sabatonica used it&amp;#39;s newly-raised military budget to develop nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The two nations are now at peace with each other and were able to do so before any battles could commence.
