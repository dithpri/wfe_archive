The TST, who&#39;s precise name has been lost to time is a federative union encompassing several disparate regions. It&#39;s member states range from the totalitarian Federal Republic of Romania and the Dictatorship of Mike&#39;s Reich - to borderline neo-hippy paradises like the United States of I Do Not Care About My People.

Its many climes do it well, encompassing a diverse range of industries - notable ones being Pizza Delivery and Trout Fishing, as well as a relatively reigned in Black Market.

While young in it&#39;s formation, it is a rapidly growing union, whether the nations within it grow more entwined or become more disparate is yet to be seen.
