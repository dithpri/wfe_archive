The [region]TST[/region], who&#39;s precise name has been lost to time is a federative union encompassing several disparate regions. It&#39;s member states range from the totalitarian [Nation]Radical Romania[/Nation] and [nation]MikesReich[/nation] - to borderline neo-hippy paradises like [nation]I Do Not Care About My People[/nation].

Its many climes do it well, encompassing a diverse range of industries - notable ones being Pizza Delivery and Trout Fishing &#151; and especially mining; as well as a relatively reigned in Black Market. It&#39;s citizenry are notorious for their rudeness.

While young in it&#39;s formation, it is a rapidly growing union, whether the nations within it grow more entwined or become more disparate is yet to be seen.
