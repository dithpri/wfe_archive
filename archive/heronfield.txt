Heronfield is a unique region. We are peaceful and quiet, and we like to have intellectual conversations while sipping tea. If you are being invaded, come on over and take refuge here!
 

Any puppets or invaders will be ejected. If they return, they are banned. We have a Zero Tolerance Policy. 

Nations please recruit new nations into this region!
