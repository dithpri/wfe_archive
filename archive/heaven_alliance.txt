Welcoming all GLBT nations and straight nations who accept the GLBT community. This is a liberal &amp;quot;Democratic&amp;quot; nation where we use the message board to talk. The rules are:

1) Try to talk calm and civilized in heated discussions. If it doesn&amp;#39;t work, discuss it with the other nations for advice. If you can&amp;#39;t work it out, discuss it with the Ultimate Region Leaders.

2) Do not insult the other nations here. It is important that we mutually cooperate. 

3) Do not use the &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; word and the &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; word in any form, they are VERY derogatory.
