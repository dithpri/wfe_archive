[b][color=#800000]Welcome to Kyzikos, a laid-back region where (almost) anyone was welcome.[/color][/b]

[i]- Founded by Ballotonia, and then ran by Unibot, then maintained by Solm, then Mahaj and safeguarded by Ravania[/i]
[hr][hr][b][color=#800000]This region was home to two defender groups:[/color]

[url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/UDL/index/][color=#1B4636][u]The United Defenders League[/u][/url][/color][/b]

[hr][hr][b]Kyzikos or Kyz [color=#db0000]was used as a defender jump point from February 17, 2012 to October 20, 2013, when the update order was shuffled. [/color]

[color=#927519]Kyzikos was formerly the latest updating region, peaking at around 900 switchers in April 2013.[/color]

[color=#800000]This region now serves as a memorial to that era.[/color][/b]
