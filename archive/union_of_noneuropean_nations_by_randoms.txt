The [b][color=#FFCC00]Union of Noneuropean Nations by Randoms[/color][/b] is a region with a lot of history (check pinned dispatch). [nation]Noneurope[/nation] decided to re-found the region, as the nation that oversaw it CTE&#39;d.

We are directly affiliated with the [b][region]Noneuropean Union[/region][/b], and we [b][i]are an open region[/i][/b]. Anyone can join, but we&#39;ll kick right-wing nations if they do not comply.
