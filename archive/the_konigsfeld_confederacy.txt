Welcome to the [B]Konigsfeld Confederacy[/B], a land ruled by a [i]benevolent king[/i] which governs his [i]faithful citizens.[/i] If you are an aspiring monarch, president, or archduke and wish to join us, please, feel free to move in! Our newly founded Imperial Court has many free seats ready to accept ministers, so your voice will definitely be heard. Alternatively, you can stay at home and [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=konigsfeld]negotiate an embassy[/url] with our ruler, Emperor Ryan Ortenstein of Konigsfeld, but then you would just be acquaintance of the region.
