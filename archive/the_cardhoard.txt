The [color=orangered][b]CARDHOARD[/b][/color] is a world made entirely of cards. An endless realm where mountains rise from layered decks pressed tight by ages. Valleys cut deep through strata of playing and tarot cards, each layer a history of forgotten games and fortunes. Lost souls of the multiverse end up here, making this strange land their home. They build cities and castles among the stacks. Streets wind through valleys of stacked cards, where marketplaces of gift and greeting cards trade in memories, promises, and luck. The Cardhoard is both sanctuary and labyrinth, a paper-built paradise where life is reshaped from what was once discarded.[hr]
