Palmyra Atoll is located on the equatorial pacific and is just downright, awesome to live in. The police are so friendly they check in on you in the middle of the night! We all have food and everything is perfect the teachers sometimes let school out early just so the police can check on them. Everyone has a job and its so awesome to live there people just disappear from the awesomeness!
