Following the international Green Politics movement, the United Greens is a coalition of nations and Green parties dedicated to or supporting of four values:

[b]I. Grassroots Democracy[/b]
[b]II. Ecological Sustainability[/b]

This is a new and relatively quiet region with the goal of building a Green network. Any nations who are striving for or support our goals are welcome to join or open an embassy with us.
