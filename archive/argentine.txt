[color=darkblue]WELCOME EVERYONE TO [b][region]ARGENTINE[/region][/b][/color]

[color=black]Jose San Martin and Ernesto Che Guevara fought for freedom and unity of Latin America. Anyone who thinks they are heroes Argentines. They are heroes [u]Latinos[/u]. This region is founded with the purpose of making a protest against the arrogant attitude and isolacionist of the region&#39;s official. How would Chavez, however we have different ideals, Latin America must always be united. You are playing in the trash the work of our heroes past and present.[/color]
