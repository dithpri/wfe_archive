The United Socialist States of Tobicka is a regional federation that capitalizes socialism (no pun intended) with a hint of capitalism. We are intended to create peace and equal rights for all people. It incorporates small states to allow capitalism for those who want major corporations, but USST is essentially socialist. Send request telegram to join. Capitalist countries wanting to join may join, but must turn socialist within 5 months unless wanting to be shrekd with the banhammer. We do not attack other regions but do promote socialist uprisings but do not help nor fund. Leninist/Marxism socialism (communism) is HIGHLY banned because it leads to mass chaos.
