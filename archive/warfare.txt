&quot;My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEN_9HpF0Fw]When the rich wage war,[b] it&#39;s the poor who die[/b]&quot;[/url]

[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUeBMwn_eYc]&quot;War isn&#39;t hell, war is war and hell is hell, and of the two, [b]war is a lot worse.[/b]&quot;[/url]

&quot;Mankind must put an end to war [b]before war puts an end to mankind.[/b]&quot; - John F. Kennedy

&quot;Have you no honor? Have you no soul?
What is it they&#39;re dying for? Do you really even know?
Have you no backbone? Have you no spine?
