[i][b]We are the Cobalt Network, and we are proud to be of Cobaltia.[/b][/i]

The Network is a collection of many unique, fascinating, and amazing people that have grouped together to firm a very tightly held community, and if you wish to be part of said community, we need to know that you are dedicated, loyal, and will never stop trying your hardest. We are a family, an odd, and at times, difficult family, but we are a family none the less, and in the end, we stick with each other. 

Glory to Cobaltia!
