The Cobalt Network is a close community of RPers from all branches, that looks to expand until it&#39;s goals are achieved. It may be hard to get into, but once you are part of the region, you aren&#39;t just part of a region, but a close brother/sisterhood of dedicated members.

Glory to the Cobalt Network!
