The great desert planet, Arrakis. Home of the geriatric spice Melange, and fought over by the many houses of the Landsraad, both major and minor. Roleplay is very much encouraged in this region, different and new houses welcome. 

This region is intended to act as a roleplaying space for Dune (hence why I&#39;ve created the Harkonnen as a nation)
