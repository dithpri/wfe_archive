[b][color=scarlet][u]Notice of Change in Moderation Policy[/u][/color][/b]

[i]After heavy debate behind the scenes, NationStates has decided to ban destructive acts of raiding. Outsiders forcing themselves into regions to burn them to the ground is simply not acceptable, and will be banned. Basic tagging is still allowed. Everything in between will be a judgement call based on intent. Violation of these rules is punishable by instant DEAT.

Additionally, we&#39;ll also be removing the activity-stifling influence from the game, to encourage (totally still legal) internal power struggles. All regions will also become founderless to help this process along.

Moderators will distinguish internal power struggles from outside invasions on a case-by-case basis.

Have fun![/i]
