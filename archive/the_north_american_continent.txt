The North American continent has been the envy of the world since its discovery and many nations have been founded here. Major world powers call this land mass home along with the tiny nations who those world powers depend on. The Continent is a thriving ecosystem and a habitat for diversity. The North Americans also have a very independent mindset as well and that has led the vast majority to oppose the World Assembly. While there are still some who have joined the global alliance, it is uncommon for thise in this region to do so. Instead, North America has its own Union where the nations convene to do things their way. To be apart of this regional government, contact Prince Joffrey Velaryon of [nation]Jaede[/nation]
