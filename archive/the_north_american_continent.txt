The North American continent has been the envy of the world since its discovery and many nations have been founded here. Major world powers call this land mass home along with the tiny nations who those world powers depend on. The North American continent is a thriving ecosystem and a habitat for diversity. The North Americans also have a very independent mindset as well and that has led many of them to oppose the World Assembly. While there are still some who have joined the global alliance, it is uncommon for this region. Instead, North America has its own Union where the nations convene to do things their way.
