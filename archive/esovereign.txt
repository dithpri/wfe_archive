Esovereign is a galaxy containing more then an dozen civilizations, most of which have the same unknown origins. According to legend, life on the civilizations home worlds all came from a single planet in an unknown system and location somewhere in the galaxy. Most of the people of this galaxy believe its mostly a work of fiction, but the legend is far from it. Also this is a puppet region for my nation&amp;#39;s to just hangout in.
