Welcome to the Free United States! We accept all, and have freedom of speech! (just no hate speech) Our motto is: &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;. We are also very democratic. Also, our leader, New Tussia, is usually out of the region for diplomacy.

Regions we have an embassy with: notify us of any ambassadors you are sending.
Lastly, to all moderators, we will decide if something is offensive. We will warn them to delete, and if they don&#39;t, they will get banned, and said message will be suppressed.
