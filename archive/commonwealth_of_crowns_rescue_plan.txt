This is a holding region for COC loyalists [Painvox is a Norengland gag region from years and years ago, game doesn&#39;t seem to allow me to make a new nation just for this]

Set this up as a holding action to gather loyalists until we decide a plan of action together during my 15 minute break at work.

I&#39;ll issue a statement using Norengland when I have the time later tonight but the obvious thing is that Osberg as a founding nation account has been scrubbed and that region is beyond saving in its current state.  We must refound.

I hope this region serves as a useful jumping off point.  Please have patience, this one is going to be a team effort...
