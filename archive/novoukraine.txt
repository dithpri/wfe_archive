Each day we will be ranked on one issue and #1 nation will get a small trophy, you can go even deeper and compare your nation in every aspect in your nations homepage.
Also, I highly recommend joining the &amp;quot;World Assembly&amp;quot;, its some sort of a UN/EU where you vote on issues that are applied internationally and may propose an international law your self, this is an interesting way to influence and play some international politics.[/color]
