Welcome to the Ferian Entente!

We accept all kinds of governments and opinions. We value self-determination and will not push our WA policies onto member nations. As the region continues to grow, more opportunities will appear. More officer positions, elections, roleplay, a constitution, and a regional map are all being considered.
For now though, the Entente is a safe place for developing nations to grow and learn more about the game
Good Luck!
