Adaria is a star located in the Eddormea Galaxy, some 400 million light-years from the Milky Way. The name is often used to refer to the planet Adaria-3, a planet in orbit around the star Adaria. 

The Adaria system contains several planets: 

Adaria-1, a barren, rocky planet orbiting very close to its star. It is tidally locked, with one side being constantly blasted with heat, and the other one being exposed to the cold of space. 

Adaria-2 is capable of hosting life, however, it is not a prime planet for life to exist. The harsh conditions, such as its very thin atmosphere and somewhat elliptical orbit make surviving on Adaria-2 a very difficult task.
