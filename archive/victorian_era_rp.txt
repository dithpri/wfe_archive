[color=purple][i]Welcome to Victorian Era RP![/i][/color]

[color=purple][b]I know the Victorian Era isn&#39;t the most roleplayed era in NS, but hey for those who want to RP the colonization era and mark the set up for the modern times. I think that would be neat! well also I know most of this RP will be based in the Paradox strategy game Victoria II, most of the mechanics will come from that game, along with the technology tree. if you&#39;re a fan of Victoria II and you&#39;re wanting for Victoria III to come out (LOL, not any day soon) you&#39;re also welcome! for those who don&#39;t enjoy RP as much, it&#39;s OK. we have plenty of things to do.[/b][/color]
