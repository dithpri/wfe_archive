Welcome to Victorian Era RP 2!

I know the Victorian Era isn&#39;t the most roleplayed era in NationStates, but hey for those who want to RP the colonization era and mark the setup for the modern times. I think that would be neat! Well, also, most of this RP will be based on the Paradox strategy game Victoria II. If you&#39;re a fan of Victoria II and you&#39;re waiting for Victoria III to come out (LOL, not any day soon) you&#39;re also welcome here! For those who don&#39;t enjoy RP as much, it&#39;s OK. We have plenty of other things to do.
