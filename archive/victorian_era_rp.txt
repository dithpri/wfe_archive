[color=purple][i]Welcome to Victorian Era RP![/i][/color]

[color=purple][b]I know the Victorian Era isn&#39;t the most roleplayed era in NationStates, but hey for those who want to RP the colonization era and mark the setup for the modern times. I think that would be neat! Well, also, most of this RP will be based on the Paradox strategy game Victoria II. Most of the mechanics will come from that game along with the technology trees. If you&#39;re a fan of Victoria II and you&#39;re waiting for Victoria III to come out (LOL, not any day soon) you&#39;re also welcome here! For those who don&#39;t enjoy RP as much, it&#39;s OK. We have plenty of other things to do.[/b][/color]
