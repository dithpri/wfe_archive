[b]Why should we put up with the present evils in our society? As opposed to the society we are visualizing, the present one can be described as a diseased one. The Lily regions are there on all levels, international and national, and even within the smaller units such as towns and families. Of course, the disease did not appear like a bolt from the blue, either yesterday, or last year. These consist of cringe, unreadable colour patterns, lies, deceit, and illiteracy. Each and all of these have been left to us as evil heritage from the past.
