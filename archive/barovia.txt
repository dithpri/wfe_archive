Barovia&#146;s early history is murky and incomplete, yet it is without a doubt the oldest nation of the core. The fact that the world calendar is based off of the Barovian Calendar (BC) is proof of this.  

Strahd von Zarovich, eldest son of Barov, vowed to drive the barbarians from Barovia and rebuild his parents&#146; nation at all costs. After twenty-seven grueling years, Strahd did just that, though his parents did not live to see the day. In their honor, he constructed Castle Ravenloft (named after his mother Ravenovia), and called to his family to settle in the castle.
