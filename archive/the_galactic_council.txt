This region was created to relieve the tensions of four intergalactic regions:
[nation]Swodan[/nation]
[nation]Free Lancashire[/nation]
[nation]The Christian Society of Warton Village[/nation]
[nation]Aidatronia[/nation]

Other regions decided to follow in their footsteps and join as well, causing extension of [region]The Galactic Council[/region].
Our government consists of the founding regions that are mentioned above, with other officers being elected by those founding regions.
