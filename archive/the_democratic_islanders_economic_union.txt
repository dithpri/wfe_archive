Founded in 2015 by the fledgling Federation of th Aviationist Leagues, DIE-U was originally intended to boost the economy of the nation as well as increase its sphere of influence to nearby countries in the Pacific. The desolate island nation of Riztenburg agreed to join the union, only under the stipulation that its government would remain unchanged aside from being a part of the Union.
