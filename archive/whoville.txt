Every Who down in Whoville hated deleting the EBC a lot, but the HEM, who lived just north of Whoville - loved it. The HEM loved deleting the EBC - the whole EBC deletion season. Now, please don&#39;t ask why; no one quite knows the reason. It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. Or it could be that his head wasn&#39;t screwed on just right. But I think that the most likely reason of all... may have been that his jorts were two sizes too small. But, whatever the reason, his jorts or his shoes, he stood there on EBC Deletion Eve hating the Whos. Staring down from his cave, with a sour grinchy frown, at the warm, lighted windows below in their town. For he knew that every Who down in Whoville beneath was busy now, missing the EBC.
