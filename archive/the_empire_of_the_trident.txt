After a long and global war against one another the nations of the Laurentian Coast, Lineistan and Mastonia decided to stop the fighting and unite in a single empire which would help spread democracy and liberty across their region. Over a period of a few years the Empire opened its doors to new and prosperous nations. The Empire continues to grow as more and more turn to the Trident.
Two of the original three, the Lines and Mastonians split from the Empire in pursuit of Fascist ideals.  They formed the ATINHN, a confederation of terrorist states.  These separatists will not bring down our way of life, they will not harm our people and this rebellion will only prove that the weak are undeserving of the Trident.
