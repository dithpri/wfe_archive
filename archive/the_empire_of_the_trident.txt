After a long and global war against one another the nations of the Laurentian Coast, Lineistan and Mastonia decided to stop the fighting and unite in a single empire which would help spread democracy and liberty across their region.  The Empire is very isolated from foreigners and is untrusting of those who they don&amp;#39;t know. Over a period of a few years the Empire opened its doors to new and prosperous nations, such as the Gyurgyakians, Libirasians, Theans, and Tankonians.  The Empire continues to grow as more and more turn to the Trident.
