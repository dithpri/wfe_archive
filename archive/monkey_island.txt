[b][color=blue]Monkey Island[/color][/b] is a peace-loving region, which welcomes any nation wishing to join us. Our only rule is to treat each other with respect. We&amp;#39;re friendly and pretty easy-going, so please visit with us on our RMB.

We&amp;#39;ve been around since (almost) the beginning and are proud to have been a part of NationStates for so long. More details on our regional history can be found on our [url=http://z1.invisionfree.com/forums/Monkey_Island/]forum[/url].
