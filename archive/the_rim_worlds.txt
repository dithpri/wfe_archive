In the far off year of 5500, in the far off fringes of space, there are the Rim Worlds. Planets virtually untouched by petty things like interplanetary governments, modern technology, and ethics studies. These planets are truly special places, where backward tribals, enclaves of industrial traders, ruthless pirates, tombs of Glitterworld explorers, and remnants of ancient mechanoid hives meet. The delicate political ecosystems of these planets are often smashed by new arrivals, ship wrecked survivors, stranded Glitterworld explorers, or a budding tribe.
