Welcome to [region]Newingtonia[/region]!  This region was a former territory of [region]Invicta[/region] before it was colonised by the Interdimensional Community. Now that Invicta is rebuilding, the region will be governed by an officer from said region as a sign of peace. The nations of Invicta originated from here, with them eventually moving due to founder tyranny.
