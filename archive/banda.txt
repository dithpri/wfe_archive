[b]Whereas freedom is a genuine right of all and any form of tyranny in any form should thus be erased from the world as not in conformity with humanity and justice, 

Whereas the struggle of the people&#146;s power movement has created an independent region-state which shall be united, sovereign and just,

Urged by the lofty aspiration of the blessed and proud people to exist as a free region,

Now, therefore, the people declare herewith their voice, to be a free region, proud of their blood,

Pursuant to which, in order to form a government that shall protect the whole people and its interest, the Convention hereby declares World Factbook Entry to be the first gate to the region[/b]
