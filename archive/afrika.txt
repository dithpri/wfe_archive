[region]Afrika[/region] is the world&#39;s second largest continent. At about 30.3 million km&sup2; including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth&#39;s total surface area and 20% of its total land area. [region]Afrika[/region] contains an enormous wealth of mineral resources, including some of the world&#146;s largest reserves of fossil fuels, metallic ores, and gems and precious metals. This richness is matched by a great diversity of biological resources that includes the intensely lush equatorial rainforests of Central Africa and the world-famous populations of wildlife of the eastern and southern portions of the continent.
