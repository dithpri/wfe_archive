This is the region dedicated to the ongoing progress of the Cyrian Civil War between North Cyria, ruled by Her Majesty Eliana I and her Royalist government and South Cyria, ruled by Premier Henry Gardner and his Communist government which seized the southern provinces in a three year long military campaign. 

Ever since the assassination of His Majesty Arthur V at the hands of a communist assassin, the Kingdom and the Communist Rebellion have been fighting for five years with no end in sight as the two vie for control of the border provinces.
