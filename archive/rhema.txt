Rhema is a small continent located somewhere in the Eastern side of the globe, away from all other land.
It is home to 5 nations as follows: Mecha-Germany, Ardekreig, Laviette, Pritis, &amp;amp; Pudiland.

Pudiland was once the most powerful nation, regardless of the fact that the leader was a complete imbecile. However, due to the fact that it was defying the laws of nature, Mother Nature got srsly pissed off and Pudiland fell to natural disasters. The land is now being fought over by two nations completely ignoring the fact that it&amp;#39;s practically how the Middle East will be in 20 years at this rate over there. Leveled and dead.

An open letter to Pudiland: [i]Communism will always fail, you dunce.[/i]
