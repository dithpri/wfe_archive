Some decades from the present day, the United States government experienced a full on collapse. The federal government shattered across the nation, leaving towards civil unrest, crime, fighting, looting, etc. Now, after the situation has calmed down, new nations are being founded all across the former US. Remnants of the federal government are sure to remain somewhere, but there are rumors of all kinds of different governments being formed. City-states are common, but so are isolationist libertarians living all throughout the mainland. What kind of nation will yours be?
