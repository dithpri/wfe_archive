Discovered in the Pacific early 1900&amp;#39;s this region has seen many years of war an chaos. Yet the [b]Gernovians[/b] decided the wars should end after the [b]Uninova[/b] gas bombings in 1999 making half of [b]Sysnova[/b] unusable for 6 years. In 2005 the states made peace in the capital of Gernova, agreeing that if war breaks out it won&amp;#39;t be among them. Tensions have lowered majorly and continue to lower to this date. In 2011 a large group of people with Russian heritage moved from Gernova to a nearby island, they called this island Rusnova. We hope that these Russians didn&amp;#39;t make the wrong choice. Many islands still need to be discovered in this region.
