A small island in the Pacific, somewhat southeast of Japan and the East Asian continent. Geographers, historians, and anthropologists still occasionally disagree on whether or not the land mass is considered part of East Asia or part of the Pacific islands. In the few timelines in which the island exists, it is generally settled by Japanese in the twelfth or thirteenth century before becoming a breakaway state that in the 1980s invents videocassettepunk technology.
