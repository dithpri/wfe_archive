[color=green][b]Heard of Team Hoyt?[/b][/color]

[b][color=red][i]One day a son asks his father:
&amp;quot;Daddy, will you run the marathon with me?&amp;quot;
The father answers yes and both run their first marathon together.
Then one day the son asks his father:
&amp;quot;Daddy, will you run the Ironman with me?&amp;quot; 
(the Ironman is the toughest...it requires a 4km swim, 180km biking and 42km running).
The father says yes again...[/i][/color][/b]
