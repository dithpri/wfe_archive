The Grand Empire of Sumdall is a large bountiful region dominated by Monarchical Nations that collectively assemble under the Emperor of Izmere. While the Emperor is the Divine Ruler of the region, each nation is encouraged to establish it&amp;#39;s own government that is, to an extent, independent. The Monarchs have substantial say in the rule of government and upon the death of the Emperor, they take council and appoint a new Monarch from their own ranks.

The whole of Sumdall is united by their high view of Democratic-Monarchy where the Monarch holds the majority of the power and by their regional religion to the Nine Divines.
