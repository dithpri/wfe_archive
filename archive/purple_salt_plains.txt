Long before there were nations there stood a great expanse. A flat region that seemed to go on for enternity. The land was harsh and inhospitable, a dry, salted wasteland where none but the saltiest survive.

Today it houses the mighty salt nations who thrive on the injustice of their situation, who flaunt the destitution of being birthed on the salt plains.

These are the salt plains and this is the tale of nations whose struggles and friendship were forged by salt.
