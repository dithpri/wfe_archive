The Zoral Union is a unifying force for the greater peace of NationStates.

The two red line represent the first Great War the Zoral Union fought from the Randrus Empire that conquered and enslaved the unprotected peoples of Arensod for many years(larger line). And the war fought against The Black Riders who wished to overtake our union in it&amp;#39;s entirety(thinner line). With a white line showing our overcoming of the two for peace.  

This region shall only accept nations who truly wish to play the role of head of their region aka no &amp;quot;the Kitten Republic of Rainbows&amp;quot;
