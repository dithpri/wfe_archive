A small town, located near Aberdeen. We roleplay a lot and have fun.

[u][b]Reasons to join our &quot;li&#39;l Town&quot;[/b][/u]

I: the region has a complex history


II: Fun



III: We are all friends



IV: easy to be yourself



Many say we&#39;re similar to [region]Ridgefield[/region], but we try not to get a copyright strike :/

During RP, we may speak in Old or Early Middle English as it is the official language and every day is a year

current year: 1 ARCR (after region creation)

Have fun!
