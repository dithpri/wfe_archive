The Takarrian Continental Alliance aims to assist nations just starting out to earn a great economy, and World Benchmark political freedoms. We treat our trade partners as siblings, and our allies as dearest friends. Note that wording, by the way. So, if you are a new nation looking for a quick take-off, come here, and get your start. Notice: You do not have to be a small upstart nation to exist in the T.C.A., but small nations are more recommended.
