Give me the Irish Republican
Give me the green white &amp; Gold Every time
Give me the three-leafed shamrock of
Ireland the land I love so fine
We&#39;ll Send the brits back home to where they came from
They&#39;re going to run from our brave fighting men
Give me the Irish republican army
We&#39;ll make our land a nation once again

Side by side our heroes died
Pearse and the great Wolfe Tone
Bobby Sands, James Connolly
And the brave Sean South from Garryowen
And though they&#39;re gone, we&#39;ll carry on
We&#39;ll make our country free
Give me the Irish Republican Army
We&#39;ll make our land the land of Liberty
