The Lia F&aacute;il was thought to be magical: when the rightful High King of Ireland put his feet on it, the stone was said to roar in joy.[1] The stone is also credited with the power to rejuvenate the king and also to endow him with a long reign. According to Lebor Gab&aacute;la &Eacute;renn, C&uacute;chulainn split it with his sword when it failed to cry out under his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Lugaid Riab nDerg - from then on it never cried out again, except under Conn of the Hundred Battles.
