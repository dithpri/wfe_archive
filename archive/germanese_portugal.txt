We are a bloc of Communist nations that maintain a strict international status of armed neutrality, until we decide otherwise.  We refuse to engage in efforts of the spread of global imperialism.  Our official languages are German an English, with Portuguese strictly forbidden.  Also, we&amp;#39;re not in the Communist bloc.  We kind of do our own thing, until, again, we decide otherwise.  Good day to you.
