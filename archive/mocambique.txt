[i]If I should die on the ol&amp;#39; drop zone
Box me up and send me home.
Place my wings upon my chest
Tell Ian Smith I did my best.
Blue job, blue job, don&amp;#39;t feel blue
You can join the commando too.

They always say, so it&amp;#39;s been said,
A policeman&amp;#39;s badge is made of lead.

They always say, so I&amp;#39;ve been told,
A commando&amp;#39;s badge is made of gold.[/i]
