[i]Don&amp;#39;t let me cross over the Mocambique border.
It belongs to FRELIMO, it will never be ours.
Well I don&amp;#39;t mind dying for a Rhodesian cause
But I don&amp;#39;t wanna die in no f*cking pork wars.[/i]

[i]Well the choppers are lifting, we&amp;#39;re leaving today.
I&amp;#39;m left quite astounded, there&amp;#39;s nothing left to say -
The orders have come true, our land falls behind
Oh, what has become of f*cking mankind?[/i]

[b]Dedicated to the brave men and women in the Rhodesian Security Forces, patriots of every race, creed, and colour - who gave their all for their country.[/b]
