Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] brought out their young cute hawklings out for a quick flight in your region! 

With the weather getting hotter these days, we decided that paying your region a quick house visit was in order to make sure that you were still fine.

We brought along cookies, drinks, and as a bit of harmless fun, spray painted your walls because it seemed like a cool thing to do!

We hope you like this redecoration, and if you would like to see more of us, feel free to [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
