For all those Fallout nuts out there, this region is for you! Here in the Wasteland Alliance, we fend for each other, and we have voting to who is in the High Council. I, however, must be in the Council because of reasoning. We do allow freedom of Religion, but we must put a few regulations on it: No crime, no killing anyone without proper reason. Every week, I shall post a new thing, whether it may be news, an election thing, or a poll. We hope you join quickly! There are only a few spots left!
