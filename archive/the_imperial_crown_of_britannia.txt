[b]From the cold and barren lands of Jotunheim to the shiny and rich valley of Asgardia, Britannians will never surrender. Let them come, but if they want our land, they&#39;ll need to march through hell to. Our region might be small, but it isn&#39;t unworthy enough of surrendering.

Burn us to ashes, we will come back.[/b]

Spread the word. The Imperial Crown of Britannia will not fall to any other region ever again. Invite nations to the region. Join the WA. Look out for any suspicious activity. Watch out for any attacks. 

The Imperial Crown of Britannia will last for a thousand years.
