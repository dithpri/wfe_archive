[b]Welcome to the BLUE MOON Bar &amp; Grill[/b]

Blue Moon was originally founded in June, 2003 as a Raider region.  The original native nations eventually moved on to other things, and abandoned Blue Moon in the middle of the desert.

In 2024, the ruins of Blue Moon were discovered on the Wayback Machine by [nation]One for the Gipper[/nation] of the [region]Pacific Defenders[/region].

Gipper elected to resurrect BLUE MOON as a &quot;nostalgia region&quot; and refurbish it as a Bar and Grill for old-time Nationstaters and other weary travelers - Defender and Raider alike.

[b]ALL ARE WELCOME - JUST BEHAVE![/b]
