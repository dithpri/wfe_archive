I hear voices in my head
They council me, They understand
They talk to me

I see darkness falling
I hear voices calling
I feel justice crawling
I see faith has fallen

You got your rules and your religion
All designed to keep you safe
But when rules start getting broken
You start questioning your faith

I hear voices crying
I see heroes dying
I taste blood that&amp;#39;s drying
I feel tension rising

I hear voices in my head
They council me, They understand
They talk to me
