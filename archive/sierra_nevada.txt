The Sierra Nevada is a mountain range in the Western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Great Basin. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California. This region was a previous holding of regional ally [region]IMPERIAL EARTH[/region], and it has been protected under the green banner to keep it out of the hands of evil.
