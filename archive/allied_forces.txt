This region has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

Although we should be grateful that the Allies won World War II, it is important to remember [i]all[/i] the victims, including Axis victims of Soviet camps and British or American firebombing. This region will stand as a memorial both to the heroes of that awful war and to its innocent victims.
