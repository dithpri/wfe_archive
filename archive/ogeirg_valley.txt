Parua stultorum stultorum ducens

1. So anybody that wanted to run for delegate left for the Mountains.... I&amp;#39;ll stay for another month I guess. If you feel like running in next election, do tell me.

2. A history writer of some sort would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.

3. Map making will be done soon!

4. NEW: Guys, if you want a special place on the map, telegram Kavadevo. I&amp;#39;m just going to tell him to put everybody who doesn&amp;#39;t have a request wherever he wants.
