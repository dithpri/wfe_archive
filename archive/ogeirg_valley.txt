Parua stultorum stultorum ducens

1. So anybody that wanted to run for delegate left for the Mountains.... I&amp;#39;ll stay for another month I guess. If you feel like running in next election, do tell me.

2. A history writer of some sort would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.

3. Map making will be done soon!

4. NEW: A Skype group for the region is being made. If you&amp;#39;d like me to add you, TGM me your Skype name, and I shall add you.
