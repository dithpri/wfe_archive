Heyo! 
Alrighty, goals for now are:

1. Figure out a person to make a flag and what the flag would look like. Suggestions are welcome.

2. Try and get more people. I&amp;#39;ve asked people who I know play the game but aren&amp;#39;t intending to stay in MTTE. (Also, I would like to know the person) 

3. If we want a motto or anything, tell me. 

4. A factbook writer would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.

Have fun!
