1. NEW: Elections for WA delegate will start probably next Sunday and last throughout the week. If you&amp;#39;re interested in running, telegram me. Only one person has done so.

2. A history writer of some sort would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.

3. NEW: Map making will be in progress soon!
