1. NEW: So anybody that wanted to run for delegate left for the Mountains.... I&amp;#39;ll stay for another month I guess. If you feel like running in next election, do tell me.

2. A history writer of some sort would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.

3. Map making will be done soon!
