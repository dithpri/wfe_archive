1. NEW: It&amp;#39;s looking like the vote for the flag has passed, so thanks to Kava for making it!

2. NEW: WA Delegate elections will be coming! Telegram me if you want to run. If nobody wants to run, I&amp;#39;ll end up staying as delegate for about a month or so.

3. NEW: Since we voted yes on a motto, telegram me ideas. If I don&amp;#39;t get anything good by Saturday,  I&amp;#39;ll make it something stupid or League related.

4. A history writer of some sort would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.
