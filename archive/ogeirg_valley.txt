Parua stultorum stultorum ducens

1. NEW: That election was abysmal guys. Only 6 people voted. I&amp;#39;m going to make a new election at the start of the new year, till then, I&amp;#39;ll stay delegate.

2. NEW: If you&amp;#39;re a WA nation, endorse me if you haven&amp;#39;t already, I don&amp;#39;t really care that much, but two endorsements is just plain silly.

3. A history writer of some sort would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.
