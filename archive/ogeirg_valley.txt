
1. Figure out a person to make a flag and what the flag would look like. Suggestions are welcome.

2. Try and get more people. I&amp;#39;ve asked people who I know play the game but aren&amp;#39;t intending to stay in MTTE. (Also, I would like to know the person) 

3. If we want a motto or anything, tell me. 

4. A history writer of some sort would be cool, however I do want very good grammar. Any ideas for region history is welcome.

I made a forum. I ask any active community members to join or at least check it out. I spent a good twenty minutes on this. Link: http://ogeirgvalley.boards.net/

Feel free to make threads and all that junk.
