The UCR (Union of Conservative Republics) was founded by Ozolland on April 17th of 2023.

The UCR is an inclusive, yet conservative region, with a regional government and functioning legislature. 

Economy is the main priority. Try to get your nation&#146;s economy up as high as possible for the most success.

All nations are welcome, but conservative nations are highly recommended.

Fascism is not tolerated in this region, but imperialism is. You can go to war with someone just to gain more land.

Map and Government coming soon!
