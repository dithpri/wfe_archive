[b]The Griffonian Reichwealth of Gryphons[/b] is centralizing its authority. However, if you seek to establish embassies with us, your request will be rejected if your nation &#151; or the average of your region &#151; upholds the following negative policies:

[list]
[*] Slavery
[*] Child Labor
[*] ID Chips
[*] DNA Harvesting
[*] Gun Control
[*] Banning Same Sex marriage
[*] Geronticide
[*] Human Sacrifice
[*] Cannibalism
[/list]

It is our divine understanding that nations engaging in such policies are immoral and reprehensible, and therefore do not possess the privilege of communicating with our united Reichwealth.

Our will and beliefs are defined by our God-Kaiser: Grover Lavernius Eisenhart VI.
All who reject this sacred will are immoral and threats to our spiritual security.
