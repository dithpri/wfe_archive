The Blackhome Invasion Alliance Pact has been formed. In the event of a invasion that threatened all nations in the region, all conflicts will enter a state of cease-fire and form a temporary alliance. The Black Riders have been put on the Pact&amp;#39;s Death List. The Black Riders are to be either broken, bisbanded, or exterminated whenever possible.
