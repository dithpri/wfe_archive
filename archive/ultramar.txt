The Realm of Ultramar is the feudal interstellar empire within the Imperium of Man&amp;#39;s Segmentum Ultima that is governed by the Ultramarines Chapter of Space Marines and governed directly by the Ultramarines&amp;#39; Chapter Master who holds the Imperial noble titles of Lord Macragge and Lord of Ultramar. One aspect of the Ultramarines Legion that survived the Second Founding was the close relationship between the Space Marines and the populations of the surrounding planets. During the Great Crusade the worlds around the Chapter&amp;#39;s homeworld of Macragge provided young recruits for the Ultramarines.
