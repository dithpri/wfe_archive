[b]Once home to the most arrogant, unprofessional and dishonourable raider army to ever disgrace the battlefield.[/b]

In spite of their numbers, their hilarious cluelessness in the arts of raiding brought them plenty of failures. To avoid more and more humiliating defeats, they associated themselves with the [i]absolute worst[/i] griefer groups of their time: The Raiding Network and The Macedonian Empire.

Unlike other Crasher groups, they would not invade to show their prowess and humiliate defenders.
All their conquests - no matter their history or their community - were set for destruction (in the process burning targets that could have been valuable to other invaders).
