Once home to the most unprofessional and dishonourable raider army ever to disgrace the battlefield.
In spite of their numbers (making them one of the largest groups of their day), their hilarious cluelessness in the art of raiding brought them plenty of failures. To avoid humiliating defeats, they chose to associate themselves each time with the least honourable invader groups of the era - The Raiding Network, the Macedonian Empire, the Black Hawks.

Arrogant
Unprofessional
Dishonourable
