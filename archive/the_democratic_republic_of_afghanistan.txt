This region, named after the communist government in Afghanistan from 1978-1992, has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b]. [b][color=green]Taliban[/color][/b], [b]al-Qaeda[/b], and other extreme Islamists are not welcome.

For an Afghanistan free from both foreign and inner tyranny!
