[b]The Initiative exists to defend against [color=red]ANTI[/color]FA, a movement that has passed beyond the realms of anti-fascism and into the realms of delusion, paranoia and hypocrisy.

The Initiative is not a friend to fascism; we believe that those who are against it have strayed off course from fighting it, and should return to their roots.
