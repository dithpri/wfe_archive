Young fighters of our region. We are the last remaining from years of gruelling hardships. We faced off against Raiders and survived. We faced the fall of our founder nation and made it through unscathed. The ones who have fallen were weak and no longer needed, because alongside I, New Pandonia, we can rise again, to be something better than we used to be.
