Assorted members of Weishund, I the Head of the Commonwealth of Astrariaa, have decided that in light of recent events we shall not sit idly by. I for one will not allow the atrocity committed against our region to be taken lightly. Our region must take up arms and strike preemptively; for the only way to prevent another raid on our region is to work actively to disrupt other regions. I urge you to aid us in bringing forth a new world power, The Phoenix of Weishund. Remember from our ashes will rise. Thank you.
