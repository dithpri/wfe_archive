[b]Welcome to the Union of Socialist and Anarchist Communes![/b]
We, as the citizens of the Union of Socialist and Anarchist Communes, unite in the struggle of the working class around Nationstates. The new region has risen from the ashes of many former, and the citizens stand united to create a leftist region that promotes freedom and fairness across Nationstates.
We stand against Fascism, Capitalism, and any forms of hegemony. The USAC is a union of State Socialists and Anarchists, and thus we will never force our comrades to adopt a tendency, we shall always promote the free flow of leftist ideas within our region.
