This is an alliance of nations that are remnants of Captain Giggle&#39;s great empire. After the world war of 2066 and the defeat of the Chinese by the Americans in Anchorage, Captain Giggle decided to divide his empire in Eastern Europe and his colonies into different countries and give the people their freedom to choose by themselves what is best for them locally. The nations themselves though have struggled alone, but Giggleland II, where the capital of the original empire is located within, has thrived, and has decided to create an alliance between themselves and the new countries that Captain Giggle&#39;s greatness allowed to be created.
