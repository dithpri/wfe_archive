[b]Republic of Russia[/b]

[list][i]This region was created as a gift to [nation=short]Commander Putin[/nation], but due to language difficulties or some other issue, it seems that we have broken off relations, as a result, this region will stay in the camp allied with [region=United States of America] and [region=Ionia].

As a result, this is now an associated region of [region=United States of America].[/list]
