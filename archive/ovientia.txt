Named after the Ovient family, who have always been the Supreme Overlords of The Great Samsonia and the founders of Ovientia, the region began in 1245 B.C.E., when Heimlich Ovient (Supreme Overlord XXVII) decided The Great Samsonia, for all its strength, could only be made stronger with allies on its side. After a vigorous search for allies, at last Ovientia was formed, and The Great Samsonia and the other Ovientian Allies (many of which had previously fought about three wars every twenty years) has since only been challenged once in the many years since 1245 B.C.E.
