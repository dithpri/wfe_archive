An Obscure place amongst the crevices of NS. Feel free to come settle down and become part of something greater, whether it&#39;s for detailed worldbuilding and roleplay, or just friendly banter and joking!

We are hoping to start a RP here and to have this be a friendly, casual worldbuilding/nation rp! 
It would be greatly appreciated to have anybody with cartography/map making skills settle here! There are also plans for a regional government here once this region has enough people to pull it off!
