We are the Warriors of the Mountain. We will conquer and spread our rules. We will triumph and as my motto says &quot;Arttia rain conukumeuk our zajar&quot; or &quot;Gold rain consumes our fire&quot; meaning that the gold that we take will help us in the end goal. This is whatever you want it to be, your home or your enemy. You decide your fate.
