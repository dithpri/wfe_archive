Welcome to the Re-Established Axis Powers
[u]Our region is a nest for far-right ideologists. Centrist and democratic ideologies are accepted, but must be on the right side of the political scale.[/u]

[b][i]The Axis Powers, a dream of a united Europe in both ideology and race, that had to be taken down by [u]immoral corrupt democracies[/u]. This dream has now passed to our generation, and we are the ones that should complete it. No mercy to cowards, traitors, communists and LGBTQ groups. Humanity can fare well without them.[/b][/i]
Republics and democracies are welcome
