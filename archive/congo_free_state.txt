[color=#ED4719]I originally intended to be the first owner of this decrepit place, only to find that [region]KAISERREICH[/region] and [region]The Leftist Union[/region] had already set foot here, no surprise. This region has been refounded to prevent misuse by any radicals of either side.

The Congo Free State was a colony personally administered by King Leopold II of Belgium, placing it under a personal union with the Belgian homeland in 1885. It was officially annexed by Belgium in 1908 after international pressure. It was a site of terrible atrocities and crimes against humanity. [/color]
