[b]Indecency is the plague of the XXI Century[/b] 

We&#39;re in the middle of a war and we&#39;re the good guys.

Come help change the world. These are our values : 

- Personal and social virtue 
- Good government &amp; Reform, Law and Order
- Catholic Social Teaching
- Animal Welfare
- Tradition 
- Family Values and Complementarianism 
- God created Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve. Thus, Marriage is a Union and a Contract between a man and a woman [b]only[/b].
There&#39;s no place for you here if you disagree. 

The Decency Street Project is a friend and an ally of [region]The New Social Movement[/region]

[i]The true friends of the people are neither revolutionaries, nor innovators, but traditionalists  [/i]
