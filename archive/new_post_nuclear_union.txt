This region is set in the year 2120, (at first) almost eighty years after the world was devastated by a global war which ended with the use of a great many nuclear weapons and conventional bombs. This, in turn, set off volcanic eruptions, sent up a great deal of ash, much of which was radioactive, burned many millions to death, and starved many more. Civilization was pushed back to the level of towns, cities, and some groups of smaller administrative divisions. Now, the sky is clear, soil is being tilled, and bricks and mortar are being layed. It&#39;s time to begin rebuilding.[hr]
