The Kanto region is home to a lot of Pok&eacute;mon and has a rich history of creating Pok&eacute;mon with technology.
Researchers of Kanto have been great at their job. A researcher working for the evil organization Team Rocket cloned Mew through its genes and created the Genetic Pok&eacute;mon Mewtwo. Porygon, the Virtual Pok&eacute;mon, was also created by humans in Kanto.
