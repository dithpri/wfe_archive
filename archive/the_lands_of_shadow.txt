A cold and fierce land steeped in mystery. Largely made up of forested and rocky terrain the Lands of Shadow is home to the dangerous Shadowmist Mountains, a mountain range full of jagged snowcapped peaks. Though most of the land is forest (which should be traveled after sunset with extreme caution) there are many lakes and waterfalls to be found. This region is home to many strong willed and honor driven people who may be seen as evil by most but merely believe in a different kind of good. If you run into any of them make sure to be respectful or it might be the last mistake you ever make.
