[b][color=red]Welcome to the [region]Confederation of Athis[/region][/color][/b]
~ [i]Founded the ELEVENTH day of NOVEMBER in the year of our Fasces TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN[/i] ~

A region focused on sci-fi roleplay within a Fascist galaxy-cluster. All nations are represented as their own planets with some being large enough to have galactic empires. This region was formed to unify fascist/authoritarian nations together and in arms against the Red Menace. As one, we are weak but if we come together, we are strong like a fasces.
