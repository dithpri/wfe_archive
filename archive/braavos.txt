Braavos is the wealthiest and likely the most powerful of the Free Cities, in part due to the wealth and influence of the Iron Bank. The Iron Bank lends money to foreign nations, including the Seven Kingdoms.

Braavos is located in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos, where the narrow sea and the Shivering Sea meet. Braavos is comprised of a hundred islands linked together by small stone bridges spanning the many canals throughout the city. -- [url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Braavos][color=663333]Braavos[/color][/url][hr]
