Greater Asia Prosperity Sphere, otherwise simply known as United Asia informally seeks to deepen ties between Asia countries and other pacific and oceanic countries. 

The UA seeks to establish world trade and project global power by allowing all Asia countries to speak under one umbrella, The Greater Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. 

We welcome all countries of Asia ideology, citizens, commitment and interest to join this wonderful region, as we attempt to reestablish world dominance. Together, we will lead the next century!
