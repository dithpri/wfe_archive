Welcome to the [b]Federative Republic of Great Samila,[/b] also known as the Samilan Republic, or just as Samila. Our goal is to establish multiparty democracies in our region and in as many others as possible.

We plan to hold elections on the 1st of every other month. This will decide the Governor. To prevent coups, an executive WA Delegate has been put in place as a failsafe.
