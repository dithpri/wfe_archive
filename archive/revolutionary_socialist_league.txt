[B]Democratic Centralism[/B]
Democracy in discussion &#150; Centralism in action.
This is the governing principle of this region.

The Revolutionary Socialist League is a safe space for radical leftists of all stripes. We are a feminist region dedicated to social justice, and support the struggles of all oppressed and marginalised peoples of the world.

[B]Honesty [/B]among comrades can hardly be measured in value. It is by far the most valuable commodity any two people can share. It is the foundation of any positive relationship. Something to be respected and cherished. Never accept a fake, deceiving smile when you can receive honest, fair criticism instead.
