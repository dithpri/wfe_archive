The [B][color=red]Revolution Socialist League (RSL)[/color][/B] is a serious region emphasizing discussion of leftist politics, history, and contemporary events.
Our region generally takes a Marxist perspective. However, we strive to be non-sectarian in outlook towards other leftists. The RSL is fundamentally feminist, anti-racist, and pro-LGBTQIA+.
