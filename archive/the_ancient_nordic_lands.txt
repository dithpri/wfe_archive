If you can not find a region that suits your needs, you are not alone. In the Ancient Nordic Lands we have no off-page regional forums or election-systems that are too difficult to understand. Everything takes place on this page. 
In the region role-playing (RP) is the main form of interaction. We want to simulate real nations and diplomacy. National sovereignty is the basis of the Ancient Nordic Lands, and we want to be a region that listens to our member nations. Therefore regional elections will take place on the main page here on NationStates. The founder will select a committee that will select candidates for election. Please endorse the regional World Assembly Delegate!   
Changes to the regional Senate and election systems may come!
