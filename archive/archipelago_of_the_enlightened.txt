The first island to appear in this region was Astrocand, which was soon founded and developed by Corleone and other spiritualists. Other islands still bubble up from the ocean floor even today. Far off the coast of New Zealand, islands have diverse climates ranging from below freezing temperatures in the south and hot temperatures farther north. 

Governments of this region have a strong emphasis on spirituality, be it religious or not. Other than that, they can vary in the way they govern their people.
