Welcome to Drangleic, a Dark Souls themed region! Invite yourself in, take a clean mug, and take a seat next to the fire. The goal of this region is to set up a hardy Constitutional Monarchy where the King and Premier act as the executive powers and the Proctors of the Chamber act as the legislative and judicial powerhouse.

If you enjoy Dark Souls, or even if you know little to nothing about the game, why don&amp;#39;t you consider helping us Praise the Sun?
