[color=#0000FF][b]!!ROLEPLAY INFORMATION!![/b][/color]

[color=#0000FF][b]Roleplays are willing to be scheduled, but will take time as we play off a time based system.[/b][/color]

[color=#0000FF][b]War roleplays are based on a point and shoot system, meaning that based on your population &amp; military size you may only deploy a certain number of troops, armed with gear based on your country&#39;s technology size.[/b][/color]
