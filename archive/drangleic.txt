At the dawn of Drangleic, the great King Vendrick built the kingdom on the souls of the four great ones. With the help of his elder brother Aldia, Vendrick made Drangleic into a prosperous and powerful nation. Vendrick was eventually approached by Nashandra, who claimed to be a visitor from a far-away land. Nashandra warned Vendrick of the looming threat of the Giants, and convinced him to invade their lands before they could strike at him. Vendrick did so, and used the knowledge that he gained from the captive Giants who were brought back to his kingdom to manipulate souls on an unprecedented level, allowing him to create the Golems, which he would use to further develop the region.
