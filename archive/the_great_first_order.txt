Today is the end of the Republic &#151; and of all who dare stand against us!
The end of regimes that acquiesce to disorder!

At this very moment, beyond our borders, hostile powers lie to the world while secretly supporting treachery and subversion against us.

This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate &#151; and the rest of their detestable institutions!
To their cherished forces!

All remaining nations will bow to the Great First Order!
And they will remember this&#133;
as the last day of the Republic and all who stood against us!
