[b][color=#DF1995]Welcome back to Hinduism[/color][/b]
A region of the Minoan Collection

Founded by [nation=short+noflag]Minoa[/nation] on 29 October 2011
Refounded by [nation=short+noflag]Charlotte Ryberg[/nation] on 3 April 2016

Welcome back to Hinduism, refounded by [nation=Charlotte Ryberg] after it became too difficult to prevent raids when I tried out having two regions with the same founder.

The [region=Funen] region, recently returned to me in the aftermath of the [url=https://nsindex.net/wiki/Predator_script_controversy]Predator script controversy[/url], is now the responsibility of [nation=Joana].

We are a non-political region that accepts all embassy requests. I am more interested in preserving NationStates history rather than the R/D stuff.
