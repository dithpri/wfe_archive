Hi, I had to close this region temporarily due to extremely poor mental health, following a tag-raiding incident on 24 November 2015.

My current state of health means that it is not possible to maintain two open regions at once, but at the same time, loneliness keeps me glued to the website.

No one has been banned from the region, although the region was emptied in fury over the raid: I apologise for any inconvenience caused.

Everyone is free to move in when I fully recover (if I ever will, due to the welfare cuts in the UK and doubts over whether I am willing to stay in the UK after July 2016). If I move to a new country the region will be updated to reflect my new home country.
