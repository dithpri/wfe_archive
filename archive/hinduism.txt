Founded by [nation=short+noflag]Minoa[/nation] on 29 October 2011

Succeeded by [nation=short+noflag]Joana[/nation] on 12 January 2024

Welcome back to Hinduism, refounded by [nation=Charlotte Ryberg] after it became too difficult to prevent raids when I tried out having two regions with the same founder: this was before the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=news/2023/04/18/index.html]succession reforms[/url] in April 2023.

We are a non-political region that accepts all embassy requests. I am more interested in preserving NationStates history rather than the R/D stuff.
