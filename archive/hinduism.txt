This region is intended for countries with Hinduism as a state religion, or countries with a high percentage of Hindus like Minoa and the UK: however, there&amp;#39;s no need to argue over a minimum percentage.

TL;DR - The Hinduism Region: No gimmicks, seriously, but racism or recruitment TGs will not be tolerated.
