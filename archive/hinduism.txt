[color=DeepPink][b]Welcome to Hinduism![/b] (sorry that the WFE couldn&amp;#39;t parse Punjab text and that&amp;#39;s really annoying!)[/color]

This region is intended for countries with Hinduism as a state religion, or countries with a good percentage of Hindus like Minoa and the UK: however, there&amp;#39;s no need to argue over a minimum percentage.

TL;DR: The Hinduism Region: No gimmicks, seriously, but racism or recruitment TGs will not be tolerated.
