Hello! We are a casual, silly, fun region. We strongly support freedom of expression, and encourage political debate and discussion of any topic. Posts will rarely be suppressed and nations will rarely be ejected. We will tolerate teasing, however we will not trolling, hate speech, and flaming and we will give a warning and suppress your posts. If it continues, we will ban you. If it continues to continue, I will report you. Why do I keep saying we instead of I? I don&amp;#39;t know. Just have fun!

We would like to have embassies with as many regions as possible, so don&amp;#39;t be afraid to request embassies!
