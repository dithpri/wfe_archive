We are a tightly woven alliance of sovereign states that all hold religion and spirituality as a high priority. We welcome nations of all beliefs, theological and political, as long as they do not interfere with our Code of Belief. We work together to achieve a common final goal: Bring faith, glory, and salvation to the secular world.
