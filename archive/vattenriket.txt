This is the region of Vattenriket.

Based on a real place; the biosphere reserve of Vattenriket around the city of Kristianstad, Sweden.

A great place for picnic, hiking, fishing, birdwatching and exploring.

For more information about the real place, visit [url=https://vattenriket.kristianstad.se/other-languages/english/]vattenriket.kristianstad.se[/url].

Welcome to experience nature.

We are not interested in embassies at this point in time.
