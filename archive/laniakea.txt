The Laniakea Supercluster (Laniakea; also called Local Supercluster or Local SCl or sometimes Lenakaeia) is the galaxy supercluster that is home to the Milky Way and approximately 100,000 other nearby galaxies. It was defined in September 2014, when a group of astronomers including R. Brent Tully of the University of Hawaii and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Courtois of the University of Lyon published a new way of defining superclusters according to the relative velocities of galaxies.
