Named for its steel mills and relative close proximity to bandit strong holds, the private company eventually pulled out after losing major profits from bandit raids. The workers and prisoner banded together and built Fort Anderstand named after Jace M. Anderstand, one of the steel mill manger and inspiring architect. Banded together they grew into a powerful country naming Mr. Anderstand Grand Prince. With most of the Region still in bandit territory Anderstand has been helping create smaller countries that will help fight the bandits and make Steeledge a more civilized and economical power.
