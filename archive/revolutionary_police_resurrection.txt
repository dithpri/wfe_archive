In early 2013 a once peaceful nation, The Revolutionary Police, was hatefully destroyed in his own region by a group of others who disagreed with him. RP traveled in hordes across nation states until his people abandoned him. Then, in March of 2014 a new darkness, an evil resurrected, was found brewing in the depths of nation states&amp;#39; regional abyss. [b]RP was back. RP is back.[/b]

[b]LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTIONARY POLICE![/b]

Honorable mention to:
The former nation of [i]Theranistan[/i], may you rest in peace ally.
