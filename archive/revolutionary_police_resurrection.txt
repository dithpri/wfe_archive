In early 2013 a once peaceful nation, The Revolutionary Police, was hatefully destroyed in his own region by a group of power-hungry communist thugs. He vowed revenge and put up a fight and had many allies to back him up. He founded his own region yet sadly it too was destroyed. RP traveled in hordes across nation states until his people abandoned him. Then, in March of 2014 a new darkness, an evil resurrected, was found brewing in the depths of nation states&amp;#39; regional abyss. [b]RP was back. RP is back.[/b]

[b]LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTIONARY POLICE![/b]

Honorable mention to:
The former nation of [i]Theranistan[/i], may you rest in peace ally.
