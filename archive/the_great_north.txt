[i]An advisor approaches you with a piece of parchment with the seal of House Ellenburg broken. &#147;You will want to read this, My Lord!&#148; the advisor says. You take the parchment and begin to read: &#147;My Lord, This is Great Lord Ellenburg. The King is dead and the Southern Kingdom is in chaos giving us a chance to break free. From this day forward, I reclaim the title of the King of the North. [b]The Great North[/b] will rise again!&quot;[/i][hr]
