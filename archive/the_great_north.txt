The door opens up to your castle; the wind blowing in the snow. An advisor approaches you with a piece of parchment with the seal of House Ellenburg broken. &#147;You will want to read this My Lord!&#148; the advisor says. You take the parchment and begin read &#147;My Lord, This is Great Lord Ellenburg, King Alban is dead and the Southern Kingdom is in chaos giving us a chance to break free from their oppressive yoke. From this day forward I will reclaim the title of the King of the North and The Great North will rise again.&quot;
