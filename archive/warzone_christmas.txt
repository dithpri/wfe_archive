[b][color=#b20000]Welcome to Warzone Christmas, where it&amp;#39;s Christmas all year round![/color]

[color=#013300]The rules of Warzone Christmas are very simple:

1. The Founder won&amp;#39;t interfere in any temporary R/D operations in this region.
2. The Founder will only stop passwords and refound attempts, so don&amp;#39;t do it.
3. The Founder won&amp;#39;t stop a native population from forming and creating a government, but won&amp;#39;t do anything to protect it. Ever.[/color]

[color=#b20000]Merry Christmas and let the games begin![/color][/b]
