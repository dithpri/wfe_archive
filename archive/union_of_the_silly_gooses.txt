[b][color=purple]Malice Arrives...[/color][/b]
[i]Did you hear that?[/i]
Of course you didn&#39;t - the assassins of [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region] are far too quiet for that. But silent or not, we have visited your region all the same, and left in our wake a trail of gloom and Malice. 
But who knows? Maybe you too can learn the ways of malice. There&#39;s only one way to find out - step into [url=https://discord.gg/brotherhoodofmalice][color=purple]our lair[/color][/url], and perhaps the Overseer will smile upon you...
