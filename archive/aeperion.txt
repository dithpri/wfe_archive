Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in history. Today we found a new world based on the element of Infinium. When an electric current is applied to a refined nanogram of Infinium-238 it creates an infinite loop of energy. Oddly enough it creates a link to an alternate reality creating a portal to previously unknown land.

We are the first settlers. Vivere explorationem!
