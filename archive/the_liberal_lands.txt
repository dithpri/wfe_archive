[color=green]A liberal region that is very new![/color]

[color=blue]This region seceded from [region=The_Swanson_Isles] because bad things were happening. This new region, created by [nation=short]Land_of_cream_puffs[/nation], is meant to be very liberal (as the name implies), with very quick legislative action and faster governmental process than the Swanson Isles.[/color]

[color=red]Please be respectful and read the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=752335]basic rules dispatch[/url].[/color]

Also, the kick process is [i]faster[/i] here than in the swanson isles.
