[color=#660099][b][region]Ardach[/region], a land of diversity, founded on the 27th of May, 2014.[/color][/b]

[color=#003366]Ardach is an emerging democratic region in NationStates, with strong elements of both in-game regional government and role-playing. It&amp;#39;s a region whose members&amp;#39; nations have long and storied pasts, and who can unite under the Ardaki banner to lead their region and its reputation to glory.[/color]

[color=#003399][b][u]Short-term objectives:[/u][/b]
- Recruit; getting the population above 10 is a critical goal.
- Generate a map; this is a region with an RP community, after all.
- Foster a sense of community; this will be achieved both through recruitment and by the establishment of regional forums.
