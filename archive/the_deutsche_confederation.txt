    History: After the many wars with the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia was losing a lot of men    
    and money. This would eventually lead to total bankruptcy and lack of fit men. Due to the instability of the 
    Austrian Empire, they soon also collapsed into many war lord states. This would mean the Deutschland 
    would not be united under one force. Leading it into a time of great anarchy and war, ending soon into the     
    1940&#39;s after the Rhineland called for the creation of the Confederation.
