History: After the many wars with the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia was losing a lot of men and money. This would eventually lead to total bankruptcy and lack of fit men. Due to the instability of Prussia from this they soon also collapsed into many war lord states. But Hungary managed to break free from Austria, leading to the collapse of Austria. This would mean Deutschland would not be united under one force, leading to the Confederation.
