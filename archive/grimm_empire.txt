The Grimm empire is run by Grimm Skull, the Sporian god of madness, chaos and death. he is also a self proclaimed god of neutrality and he&#39;s the personal Thane of Sporia. Grimm Empire is run at the side by his beloved, the goddess of mischief, chaos and life. she has been given exactly half of everything Grimm takes over. the council of Grimm Empire is run by several talking ponies, a genocidal Cyborg, a 13 year old, an alcoholic, one peace keeper, a teenage robot, some other psychopaths, and a bunch of Mercenaries. the goal of the Grimm Empire is to kill, genocide and take over as many civilizations as they can, and enforce their will upon the world... equality for all. everyone accepting everyone. and anti tank riffles for all :3
