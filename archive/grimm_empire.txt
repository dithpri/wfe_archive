The Grimm empire is run by Grimm Skull, the Sporian God of madness, chaos, and neutrality. the council (which is still looking for more members) is run by a Demented cyborg, a thirteen year old girl, an alcoholic, a Pegasus, a teenage robot, and one notoriously peaceful Hunter tribe woman. the main founder of the region, known as Grimm Skull the Mad, does not try to control any of the other regions in his Empire, in fact he couldn&#39;t care less. in his countries, he replaced most of his people with robots, gave Honey Badgers citizenship, and has destroyed several civilizations just because the leader disrespected him, their soldiers wore out their welcome, or simply because he was bored. many of the other world leaders are just as crazy.
