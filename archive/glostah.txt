The historical region of Glostah contains several nations under rule by the glorious nation of Moswal. All nations adhere to all policies created by Moswol. Moswol can ban any nation at it&#39;s own discretion.
The founder of Glostah has less power than the World Assembly Delegate, which in turn means Moswol is the true leader of this glorius Region!
