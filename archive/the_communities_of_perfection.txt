Welcome, citizens. By accepting our invitations, or joining without being invited, you have taken a step towards a brighter future. After all, you all want to be pretty, don&#146;t you? You don&#146;t want to be ugly, like all the other nations that dare reject our hug of friendship and perfection! So, again, welcome, and please wipe your feet at the doormat. This has been a PSA from the glorious Capital of Autoville. 

We are all safe here.
