Museum of political history dedicated to an academic examination of [i]classical Fascism[/i] as a mature social and political movement, the Italian Fascist regime of [B]Benito Mussolini[/B] (1922-1943 era), and the various neo-fascist organizations that have inherited its philosophical underpinnings.

This work is in succession to that of historian A. James Gregor in our efforts to demonstrate that [i]Fascism[/i] -- as a theoretical framework -- possesses an intellectual complexity and revolutionary legitimacy equal to any other comparable political theory of its time.
