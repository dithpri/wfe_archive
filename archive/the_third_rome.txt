Museum of political history dedicated to the academic examination of [i]classical Fascism[/i] as a mature social and political movement, the Italian Fascist regime of [B]Benito Mussolini[/B], and contemporary organizations which are the inheritors of its ideological underpinnings.

This work is in succession to that of Gregor in our efforts to prove that [i]Fascism[/i] -- as an ideological framework -- has always had as much theoretical depth and validity as any other comparable revolutionary political theory of its time.
