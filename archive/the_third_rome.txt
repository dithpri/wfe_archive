Museum of political history dedicated to an academic examination of the Ardito-Futurist movement as a mature social and political phenomenon, the Italian Fascist regime of [B]Benito Mussolini[/B] (1922-45), and the various neo-fascist organizations that have inherited their philosophical underpinnings.

This work is in succession to that of historian A. James Gregor in our efforts to demonstrate that [i]Fascism[/i]&#151;as a theoretical framework&#151;has an intellectual complexity and revolutionary legitimacy equal to any other comparable political theory of its time.
