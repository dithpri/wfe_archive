In the northern part of Vul-Sahqon there is an ancient place in the mounters of fire.

A circle in the ground that display the star map from the sky with massive circles of stone around the place that slowly move around the middle. 

Its a way, I crossroad to another world say the ancient scroll. And there my friends are the meeting on the ancient circle stone map.
