My Secret Valley is a region where nations of the world can come together to discuss issues, resolve conflicts and drink milk-shakes (because milk-shakes are nice!).

Almost all nations are welcome (MSV is distinctly anti-fascist, anti-racist and generally liberal) and all points of view are welcome, provided you can express them politely and with respect for everyone else&#39;s point of view as well. 

So - come to My Secret Valley, a place where your national animals can frolic in the open fields, and your children can grow up in a quiet, calm, relaxed atmosphere :)
