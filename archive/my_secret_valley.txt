My Secret Valley is a happy, friendly place where you can come to enjoy a social atmosphere. 

We welcome almost every nation, but are distinctly anti-fascist and anti-racist, but that aside, we will be happy to welcome you.

So come to MSV, where you can raise your children and your national animals can frolic in the luscious forests.

Administration : If you want to discuss the Council, or apply for positions (Minister for Communications, Minister for Research, Minister for Prettification or The FCO) contact Calladan or Covenstone via Telegrams or The RMB and we will be happy to talk about it. For the time being, executive authority stays with me (Covenstone) but that may change in the future.
