[nation=short]Jonahland[/nation] declares petty war on [nation=short]North Butkovich[/nation] and four others as excuse for regional domination and execution of a &quot;Forever Heitman&quot; plan similar to Nazi Germany&#39;s thousand year Reich/The fourth Reich which led to the holocaust. War is expected to end with nothing lost or gained from either side due to both nations being the regions only super powers.
