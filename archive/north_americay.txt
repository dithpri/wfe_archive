North America, the third-largest continent, extends from the tiny Aleutian Islands in the northwest to the Isthmus of Panama in the south. The continent includes the enormous island of Greenland in the northeast and the small island countries and territories that dot the Caribbean Sea and western North Atlantic Ocean. In the far north, the continent stretches halfway around the world, from Greenland to the Aleutians. But at Panama&#146;s narrowest part, the continent is just 50 kilometers (31 miles) across.

North America&#146;s physical geography, environment and resources, and human geography can be considered separately.
