Morrowind - formerly known as Resdayn, and Veloth. The land of the Dunmer, Morrowind is home to Five Great Houses, however there are many smaller houses. Come - which house will you join? Will you join House Dagoth, the Sixth House? Or perhaps you shall be the one to bring House Hlaalu back to Great House status? Perhaps you shall be the Head of your own House? The choice is yours in [region]Nations of Morrowind[/region].

Join us, friends - the Red Year is gone, now let us pull in a new age of glory for Morrowind.
