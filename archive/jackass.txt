In the UK the average bank robbery of &pound;20,000 &#151; on average it involved 1.6 bank robbers. The return was only about &pound;13,000 per bank robber. That&amp;#39;s about half the average UK full-time wage of around &pound;26,000. So our bank robber would not be set for life in wanton luxury in the Bahamas &#151; all they get is a modest lifestyle for half a year. But associated with each bank robbery is an 80 per cent chance of not being caught.In plain English, after three bank robberies, the chance of getting caught by the cops and ending up in jail is 50 per cent. After four robberies, it&amp;#39;s 60 per cent. As a career path and an economic activity, robbing banks is rubbish.
