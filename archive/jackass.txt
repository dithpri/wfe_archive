Over 30,000 people signed a petition calling on the US government to secure resources and funding and begin construction of a Death Star by 2016.
Paul Shawcross, head of the White House budget office&amp;#39;s science and space branch, said building a Death Star would simply be too expensive.
&amp;quot;The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to cost more than $US850,000,000,000,000,000,&amp;quot; he said.
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re working hard to reduce the deficit, not expand it.
&amp;quot;The Administration shares your desire for job creation and a strong national defence, but a Death Star isn&amp;#39;t on the horizon. 

&amp;quot;The Administration does not support blowing up planets.&amp;quot;
