Repeatedly trying to undo the shoelaces of rival players during NBA games has cost New York Knicks guard JR Smith $US50,000 ($A56,000).

The league imposed the punishment upon the 28-year-old American on Wednesday after he attempted to untie an opposing player&amp;#39;s shoes Tuesday during New York&amp;#39;s 89-85 home victory over Detroit.
