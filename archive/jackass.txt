Globally, Europe is home to the biggest drinkers, with some of its countries having particularly high rates of harmful drinking.

A study published earlier this year found that a quarter of all Russian men die before they reach their mid-50s, largely from drinking to excess. Some men in that study reported drinking three or more bottles of vodka a week.

The WHO said global trend analyses showed that drinking has been stable over the past five years in Europe, Africa and the Americas, but it is growing in south-east Asia and the western Pacific.
