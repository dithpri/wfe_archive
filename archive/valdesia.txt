Valdesia is an proud and ancient region of NationStates, where the oil-rich sands run red with the blood of martyrs. Originally founded in 2005 on the principles of isolationism, militarism, radicalism, and contempt for all peoples, Valdesia stands once again as a monument to the mighty empires that once populated our desert haven. Urinating on the monument carries the pain of catapult.
