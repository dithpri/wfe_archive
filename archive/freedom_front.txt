[color=red]EMBASSY NOTE:[list]We are currently setting up our puppet regions to play a game with NSEmbassy Oracle.
The goal is to have as many regions as possible to create an embassy string or chain connecting all of my regions.
In order to make this work, all of my participating regions will need to close all but two of their embassies.
The two embassies will be with the region above and below on my list of regions set to the order that the regions are updated.
All other embassies will be CLOSED or ABORTED.
A few regions will not be participating, such as this one.[/list][/color][hr]
