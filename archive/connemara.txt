Connemara is a cultural region in County Galway, Ireland. The most common definition of the area is that it consists of West Galway; that is to say the part of the county west of Lough Corrib, contained by Killary Harbour, Galway Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Because of it&#39;s association with a traditional Irish culture and the view of it as the &quot;most Irish&quot; part of Ireland, it has been a tourist destination for some. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
