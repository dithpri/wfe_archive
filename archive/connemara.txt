Connemara lies in the territory of Iar Connacht, &amp;quot;West Connacht&amp;quot;, which is the portion of County Galway west of Lough Corrib. Connemara was traditionally divided into North Connemara and South Connemara. The mountains of the Twelve Bens and the Owenglin River, which flows into the sea at An Cloch&aacute;n/Clifden, marked the boundary between the two parts. Connemara is bounded on the west, south and north by the Atlantic Ocean.
