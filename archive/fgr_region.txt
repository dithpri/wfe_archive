The FGR region FGR (Federation of Greater Russia) is a demographic, communist, and imperial region. Doesn&amp;#39;t make since? Well, take all the pros (most anyway) of those 3 governments and throw them together. Still makes no since? It would take a while to explain, but those are the bare basics. Other countries can vote and have opinions, and even make ideas that could be put in. But, authorization from the FGR. All countries are free to run their government, but the FGR is still in control of the region. And always will be. Any questions of the region or FGR can and may be answered by contacting Vladislav Hunter, the emperor of the FGR. (just send me a message...)
