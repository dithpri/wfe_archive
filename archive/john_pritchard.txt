The first school in what is now North Kildonan could have been operating as early as 1817 by John Pritchard, a Hudson Bay Company employee who was very likely the first settler in this municipality. It was a private school mainly for the sons of the Hudson Bay Company employees and was located in the Pritchard home on the east bank of the Red River on or near the present site of John Pritchard School at a place called &quot;The Elms&quot;.
