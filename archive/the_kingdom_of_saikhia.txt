        Welcome to The Kingdom of Saikhia where the only rules are you&#39;re nation must be called a Fiefdom. (if you want an exception please send me a telegram) Spy&#39;s will be ejected and banned. If you come from a certain region you are not allowed in. (if you really want to get in but you are from one of those banned regions send me a telegram explaining why you should be allowed in) In times of war each Fiefdom will be required to supply a draft of soldiers for the Saikhian Royal Army. Nations with medivial themed names will be allowed in so if you want to join please try to have a medivial sounding name but if not you will still be allowed in. 

Glory to Saikhia! Glory to the King!
