International affairs can get pretty grim sometimes, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m pleased to announce the first ever [b]Global Trade Fair.[/b]

For a limited time, nations are invited to view and collect a range of goods, which you may stash and display in your regions.

Unlike all those other world events, this will be a celebration of [b]love and co-operation![/b] And to keep it that way, there will be [color=crimson]inspections and confiscations[/color].
