We hold sacred our oath to the constitution&#151;an oath to the rule of law, and the rights of every citizen, and we are explicitly anti-fascist and anti-Trump. We are a forum, however, open to nations of all political perspectives. We mainly talk about current American politics, so if that sounds like your kind of place, jump in; we&#146;re glad to have you.

Politics can get messy, and while all political statements are allowed, personal attacks and violent speech are [b]not[/b].
