Ello, explorer, bandit, soldier, president or whoever the hell you are, to the New World, not the &#39;Darkened Ages&#39; you thought you had walked into. So, what happened, how did the world get this way? Well apparently is all started hundreds of years ago, because of something called World War Three. What is this &quot;World War Three&quot; you ask? Well, basically a bunch of nations got into a BIG war... then the nukes came out. That my friend is how we all got &#39;ere. Just kiddin&#39; that was just some crap I found on the internet, [b]can you believe it?![/b] So grab a drink, sit down and enjoy your time in the wonderful world of the Darkened Ages.
