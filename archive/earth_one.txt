[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to play blackjack in memory of [nation]Zizou[/nation] and [nation]New Republic of Roman[/nation] (BearBear), who both lost exorbitant amounts of money playing blackjack.  They went around playing poker, slots, roulette, and, of course, blackjack at your casinos, until they had lost even more than Ziz and Bear combined.
