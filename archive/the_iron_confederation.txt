[color=darkred][u][b]Welcome to The Iron Confederation[/b][/u][/color]

[hr][color=darkred]The Iron Confederation stands for a new conception of the state, one where the people share a common interest, willpower, and conscience binding all in common faith, under a hierarchy of mutual obligations and reciprocal responsibilities organized to direct all activities toward specific productive goals. We stand opposed to the liberal-democracy, which wastes resources on bribing constituencies and staging asinine rituals to falsify the renewal of the public&#39;s confidence. We also oppose the oligarchy of powerful democracies and GCRs that collude to monopolize power over the Security Council and guard their selfish tyranny through layer upon layer of information control and opinion-manufacturing.[/color]
