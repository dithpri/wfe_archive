[color=darkred][u][b]Welcome to The Iron Confederation[/b][/u][/color]

[color=darkred]We state our goal clearly and plainly: To smash the forces of liberal democracy and international socialism alike and replace all competing ideals with the monolithic absolutes of the fascist totalitarian state! Our region was inspired by the historic example of [region]The Iron Confederacy[/region]. We oppose materialism, egalitarianism, feminism, and fanatic individualism in all their forms. Bolshevism and capitalism are equally our enemy. We do not seek for moral value in the concepts of self or humanity, but revere the organic unity of the nation as the highest worldly ideal. Through great strivings may we one day dwarf our predecessor and become empire.[/color]
