[b]Welcome to the Alliance of Shattered Lands! [/b]

The mission of the SLA is to unite nations facing the challenges of dystopian governance and societal collapse in the hopes of a better future.

Because this is an alliance, and not a region, there is no governing body. However, endorsements are considered valuable. whoever has the most endorsements gets to create a new rule for the duration of their time as the most endorsed. For instance, if I were to be the highest endorsed, i could say &quot;EVERY MESSAGE IN REGION CHAT MUST BE IN ALL CAPS&quot;.

To-do list:
- Expand membership to include additional nations
- Encourage worldbuilding and writing
- Increase player activity within the region
- Develop a good community for worldbuilding, chatting, and fun!
