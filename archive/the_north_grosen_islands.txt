The North Grosen Islands is an archipelago of islands north of Emeria. Formed millions of years ago when the incredibly huge underwater volcano of Uliktenhasen exploded and volcanic salts created the archipelago of islands. As a cause of this, most of the islands have black-sanded beaches due to volcanic dust.
