Hello and welcome to the Stesteran Union!
Here are some things you can do to get started:
1. Apply for an officer position!
Send me a telegram (your application) that meets the requirements: 
State why you want the position, what authorities you want control over (2 max) and an intro/conclusion, and we will review your application.
===================================
Any applications that do not abide with our requirements will be rejected.
2. Turn recruitment telegrams off.
