Wait, why are you here? Well, give me the password and come on in. However, if you can&amp;#39;t access it, too bad, go and buy yourself the world&amp;#39;s smallest violin. While you are at it, get yourself a nice two kilobyte potato to replace 500 of your 100,000 monkeys that work to keep your internet running. The potato is also a good source of starch, so eat one as well. Have a nice day! :D (If you were having a bad day, sorry to possibly make it worse, but to feel better go watch ponies, they do wonders as an antidepressant, also, they are just plain awesome.)
