Founded in 1960 after the growing political upheaval in several surrounding territories, the FTK (Free Territories of Kalyin) initially began with several small federalist, socialist, and nomadic peoples to encourage freedom of trade without borders, the refusal of secret treaties within the different territories and the allowance for people to move through the connected countries without fear of being ejected for reasons attached to ethnicity or the like. Since it&amp;#39;s foundation, the FTK has held together much of the region with a balanced, universal currency and delegation to report to the World Assembly to address concerns within the varying countries.
