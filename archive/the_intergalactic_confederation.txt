There are 5 political party slots just ask an executive to make a party. every political party has a founder and five members, they get a fancy title and some powers. every two months (starting from 8/4/22) there is an election to choose which political party is the most popular and the founder of the most popular becomes the new President. the hierarchy goes: WA delegate, Founder, President, Member of political party, Nations of The Intergalactic Confederation. The President can decide how to run the region but with at least the Founders approval
