**WE NOW HAVE A REGIONAL FLAG! YAY!!!! (Totally not my old flag or anything.)**

If all members could join the world assembly and endorse [nation]really evil[/nation], we would be greatful. 

You&amp;#39;re welcome to join if you don&amp;#39;t know what we&amp;#39;re talking about here... Just don&amp;#39;t expect to be dealed in right away.... Or at all... Just lower your expectations right now.
