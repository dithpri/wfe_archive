The idea of this region is to eliminate excess chat in the [region]Hell[/region] RMB. The best way to participate in this RMB is to create a new nation that can be identified as a spin-off of your main nation. Why I recommend this is so that you don&#39;t need to switch regions and don&#39;t lose your [url=https://www.nationstates.net/detail=trend?censusid=80]residency[/url] stat. I also realized you could just keep your nation in [region]hell[/region] and post through the embassy.
