[color=blue]HISTORY CHECK[/color]
 Okay so once long, long ago this girl named Asia founded
 a great Region we know as [b][color=brightorange]ACOG[/color][/b]. So anyways Resh &amp;amp; Castitas
came in and helped her out and [color=red]BAM![/color] our region was formed.
Then many moons passed, and the group grew and grew.
Then one day everybody left and took a couple month sabbatical, 
and now were back for [b][color=blue]Season ll[/color][/b] :D
