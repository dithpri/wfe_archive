North Canadia is a tough, rugged region full of tough, rugged people. The blisteringly cold winds dissuade all but the most determined from ever setting foot here. Many do though, and are surprized when they find it&amp;#39;s not as bad as they first thought.

North Canadia follows a fascinating cultural practice of painting the inside of their dwellings bright green to mimic the look of actual plant life, which is rare, if not non-existent, in the barren wastes. Curiously enough, the only plant that seems to grow in great quantities is the coffee tree; most citizens agree that a hot cup of joe is the best way to fight off the bitter cold.
