[color=orange]A region where wholesomeness is the rule of law! Let&#39;s be honest, NationStates can get a bit toxic. True you can&#39;t expect too much on a game that caters to political extremes that people take way too seriously. Sometimes you just want a community that&#39;s not constantly arguing with itself or warmongering against regions they have minor disagreements with. Y&#39;all need to let it go every once and awhile.[/color]
