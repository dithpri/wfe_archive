The Conference of the New Emerging Forces (CONEFO) was an effort by President Sukarno of Indonesia to create a new bloc of &quot;emerging countries&quot; that would be an alternative power centre to the United Nations and to the &quot;old-established forces&quot;&#151;a category in which Sukarno included both the United States and the Soviet Union. It was intended to build on the legacy of the 1955 Bandung Conference and assert the interests of the Third World and a neutral posture towards the Cold War.
