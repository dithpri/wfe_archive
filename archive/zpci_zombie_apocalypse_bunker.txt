&amp;gt;Welcome to the ZPCI Zombie Apocalypse Bunker!
&amp;gt;This is a safe haven for those that want to stay safe from the incoming zombie blight!
&amp;gt;The rules here are simple. Respect your Bunker Managers and [b]DO NOT EMBRACE THE HOARDS.[/b]
&amp;gt;Failure to do so will result in exile, and you will be sent to the wastelands outside.
&amp;gt;We are a Cure and Kill region. We also have systmatic rulings on exile.
&amp;gt;Don&#39;t violate any rules, and you can stay here, safe from the Apocalypse.
&amp;gt;Rember to respect not only your Bunker Managers, but each other.
&amp;gt;Or Else...
&amp;gt;Anyway, have fun!
