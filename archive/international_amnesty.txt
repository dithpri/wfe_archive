International Amnesty is a region founded with the purpose of ensuring the fulfillment of human rights and ending the abuses inflicted on them. Our main goal is to ensure that each and every citizen of NationStates receives a properly and fair treatment and the liberty to exercise their rights with freedom within a just and egalitarian society.
