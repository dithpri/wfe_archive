join our [url=https://discord.gg/JywUMh4]Discord[/url]

if you follow these quick guidelines you&#39;ll succeed, for having to read a factbook for rules is dumb
RULES:
-Your flag isn&#39;t the default flag, unless you tell me that you want that flag
-You&#39;re not insane and unreasonable
And lastly:
-You don&#39;t betray the staff

Next:
we are EXTREMELY ANTI RAIDER
we&#39;ll counter raid other regions and help the regions get set back up
but we might funnel the people into our region... just to become stronger and more anti raider
