A hamburger is a sandwich with a cooked patty of ground meat, typically beef, served in a sliced bun, often with toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles, and condiments such as ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise. Variations include cheeseburgers (with cheese) and bacon burgers, and while its origins are debated, it&#39;s strongly linked to Germany and the United States, becoming a global fast-food staple.
