A vast continent bathed in sunlight and mystery.

The western coast, known as The Shimmering Strand, stretches for a thousand leagues of pale sand and coral cliffs.

To the east, the land climbs into the Sunspine Mountains, jagged peaks crowned with snow that burns gold in the morning light. 

At the heart of the continent sprawls the Verdant Expanse, a lush rainforest where trees grow taller than castles and rivers sing with echoes of lost civilizations.
