[color=Orange]Welcome to the Sikhism, home of Guru Nanak. Fifth largest organised region in the world. All faiths welcome.[/color]

Founded by the Minoan Regions project, Sikhism is a completely neutral anti-extremist region with no defender/invader alliances but just ordinary no-nonsense friendships.

Region members are advised to disable recruitment telegrams to avoid annoyances.

Orange is the main colour, just so you know.
