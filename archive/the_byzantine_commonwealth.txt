[color=maroon][b]Welcome to The Byzantine Commonwealth!

The Byzantine Commonwealth is a new democratic region themed on the Byzantine Empire. We are an active region for both gameplay and roleplay enthusiasts. We are currently writing the Constitution of the region.[/b][/color]

[color=purple][b]Please note that we are only themed on the Byzantine Empire. Our region is completely democratic and we don not believe in the &quot;God Emperor&quot; nonsense. 
Also note that we are not a Christian region. We are completely secular.[/b][/color]
