The Church of the Children of Atom is a religious movement that worships a deity known as Atom. They also revere radiation, which they call &quot;His Glow&quot;. The Children have sent preachers to various areas outside Pairington, although the outcome of these expeditions are not always peaceful, as travelers who cross paths with the Church are often met with suspicion and hostility.
