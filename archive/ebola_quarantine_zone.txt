A new outbreak of a virulent, deadly form of Ebola has begun, and the countries in the [region]Ebola Quarantine Zone[/region] are being quarantined by the rest of the world, with no people allowed in or out, except for doctors and other professionals from various charities such as Doctors Without Borders who then have to be quarantined for 30 days after returning to their home countries. But for the vast majority of people who are not medical professionals, nobody is being allowed in or out of the Ebola Quarantine Zone countries.

All nations with Ebola outbreaks [b]MUST[/b] join this region, for the safety of other regions. Nations may only leave once cleared as being Ebola-free for at least 30 days. Embassies will be kept safe using careful scientific precautions.
