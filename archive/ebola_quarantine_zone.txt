Hi, welcome to the Ebola Quarantine Zone, where nations with Ebola outbreaks are safely quarantined from the rest of the world! Here we roleplay Ebola outbreaks as well as all sorts of other terrible disasters or anything else that is fun or interesting to roleplay, and very often the roleplaying has sci-fi or fantasy elements to it.

We are trying to have as many embassies as possible, we accept all embassy requests and never close embassies, and are open to having embassies with any region at all. Don&#39;t worry, we contain Ebola inside our region, other regions can&#39;t get infected.

Any nations are welcome here except if you embrace zombie hordes. Nations here can do whatever they want except violate our embassy policy or embrace zombie hordes.
