The League of Defenders is a region for anyone who wants to flex their military muscles. We wish to help any region affected by the [region]black riders[/region]. We plan to take back each region taken over by the black riders, and we need your help. Please come, join a task force and help take back Nationstates. Everyone is welcome, but WA nations are the nations who can take back the taken over regions.
