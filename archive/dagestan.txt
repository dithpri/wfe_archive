[color=green]Suppose you can recite a thousand holy verses from memory.
What are you going to do with your ego self, the true mark of the heretic?
Every time your head touches the ground in prayers, remember,
this was to teach you to put down that load of ego
which bars you from entering the chamber of the Beloved.

To your mind feed understanding,
to your heart, tolerance and compassion.
The simpler your life, the more meaningful.
The less you desire of the world,
