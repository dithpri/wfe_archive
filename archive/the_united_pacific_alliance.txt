[b]Hello![/b] Welcome to the [color=blue]United Pacific Alliance[/color]

This alliance is for players who want a safe and interactive environment to be a part of. Here you can vote and impeach representatives and council members,run for positions such as those for yourself, and propose and vote for region-wide reforms and laws. We accept and help new and old players and provide a realistic atmosphere to play in. Feel free to send telegrams or talk to us in regional chat. Also, we would like it if you joined the World Assembly and endorse our delegate and regional owner. Role-plays will also be held!
