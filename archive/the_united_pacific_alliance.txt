[b]Hello![/b] Welcome to the [color=blue]United Pacific Alliance[/color]

The United Pacific Alliance is for inhabitants of the [color=blue]Pacific[/color] only. This alliance is for players who want a safe and interactive environment to be a part of. Here you can vote and impeach representatives and council members and even run for positions such as those for yourself. We accept and help new and old players and provide a realistic atmosphere to play in. Feel free to send telegrams or talk to us in regional chat. Also, we would like it if you joined the World Assembly and endorse our delegate and regional owner. If you want to join, or we have sent you a telegram asking you to join our alliance, we will send you the password.
