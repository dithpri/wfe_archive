The Long March was a military retreat undertaken by the Red Army of the Communist Party of China, the forerunner of the People&#39;s Liberation Army, to evade the pursuit of the Kuomintang army. The Communists, under the eventual command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers (5600 miles) over 370 days. The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, then north, to Shaanxi.
