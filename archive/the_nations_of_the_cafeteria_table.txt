Greetings to all and everybody in The Nations of the Cafeteria Table!
I have set up a map for our glorious nations... soon I hope to obtain many more, and to bring over our original table crew... but until then, pull up a chair, grab a martini, and watch the German guy obtain sleep deprivation. xD

Oh, and remember to bring bread.
here is the link to the map, hope everybody likes it. :)
