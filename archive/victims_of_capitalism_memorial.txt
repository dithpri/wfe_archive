&quot;We reject the Capitalist system, which disregards
the needs of the people, dehumanizes private
property, and transforms the workers into shapeless
masses that are prone to misery and despair. Our
spiritual and national awareness likewise repudiates
Marxism. We shall channel the drive of the working
classes, that are nowadays led astray by Marxism,
by demanding their direct participation in the
formidable task of the national State.&quot;[/b]
