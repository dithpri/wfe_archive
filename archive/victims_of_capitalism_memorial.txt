[b]The true evil is not communism; it is capitalism. There has never been, and never will be, 
a social system more murderous, corrupt, and bloody than capitalism. History is still 
being rewritten by the capitalists to cover up this fact, even as capitalism claims
 tens of thousands more victims every single day of every single year.

From the feudal wars of Europe to the genocide perpetrated upon the indigenous peoples 
of the Americas, from the African slave trade to the current global orgy of mass murder 
called &amp;quot;the war on terror&amp;quot;, capitalism is the greatest killer of them all.[/b]
