[u][b]THE WEHRMACHT HAS BEEN DEFEATED[/u]

REFOUNDED on Memorial Day, 5/25/2014.[/b]

Founder nation named in honor of [u][b][url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Rose]General Maurice Rose[/url][/b][/u], the highest-ranking Jewish-American soldier of World War II, who was often regarded as the war&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;greatest forgotten commander.&amp;quot; Being the son and grandson of rabbis, no American commander had a greater zeal to fight the evil of Nazism, and General Rose always led Patton&amp;#39;s Army from the front. Unfortunately, this also caused him to be the highest-ranking American soldier killed in action in the war.

But here on NationStates, General Rose will live forever as the man who vanquished [region]the Wehrmacht[/region].
