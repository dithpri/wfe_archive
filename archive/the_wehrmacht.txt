[color=cccccc]Former Founder: General Maurice Rose
Former WFE: THE WEHRMACHT HAS BEEN DEFEATED

REFOUNDED 5/25/2014.

Founder nation named in honor of General Maurice Rose, the highest-ranking Jewish-American soldier of World War II, who was often regarded as the war&#39;s &quot;greatest forgotten commander.&quot; Being the son and grandson of rabbis, no American commander had a greater zeal to fight the evil of Nazism, and General Rose always led Patton&#39;s Army from the front. Unfortunately, this also caused him to be the highest-ranking American soldier killed in action in the war.

But here on NationStates, General Rose will live forever as the man who vanquished the Wehrmacht.[/color][hr]
