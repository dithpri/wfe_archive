[color=cccccc]Former Founder: General Maurice Rose
Former WFE: THE WEHRMACHT HAS BEEN DEFEATED

REFOUNDED on Memorial Day, 5/25/2014.

Founder nation named in honor of &amp;amp;#65532;General Maurice Rose, the highest-ranking Jewish-American soldier of World War II, who was often regarded as the war&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;greatest forgotten commander.&amp;quot; Being the son and grandson of rabbis, no American commander had a greater zeal to fight the evil of Nazism, and General Rose always led Patton&amp;#39;s Army from the front. Unfortunately, this also caused him to be the highest-ranking American soldier killed in action in the war.

But here on NationStates, General Rose will live forever as the man who vanquished the Wehrmacht.
