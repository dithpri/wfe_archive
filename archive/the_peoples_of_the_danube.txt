This region has long been populated by Slavonic and Germanic tribes. In modern times there are several prominent ethnic groups. The Oestian&amp;#39;s of Oestlant just suppressed a viscous uprising by an anarchist faction, and the nation is now recovering. Neighboring the still united Oestlant, is the new Slavic country of Bohkranya. Before the revolution, the ethnic Bohkraynian&amp;#39;s were being racially segregated and punished by the Czech Republic. Therefore under their socialist leader, Petr Kurtenosky, the ethnic Bohkraynian&amp;#39;s fought for the freedom and formed the new socialist republic of Bohkraynia. Tensions are high between the two nations.
