In the early 19th century, as political powers sought to expand their territories and influence across the globe, the nation of Azalea Isle embarked on an expedition to establish a foothold in the distant lands of the northern hemisphere. Led by explorers and settlers, they ventured forth into uncharted waters and icy tundras, eventually reaching a vast and rich region nestled between the great Eurasian landmass and the Arctic Circle.
This region, dubbed North Eurasia, was rich in natural resources and teeming with diverse flora and fauna.
