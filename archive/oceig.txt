Located at &amp;#9608;&amp;#9608;.&amp;#9608;&amp;#9608;&deg;, -&amp;#9608;&amp;#9608;.&amp;#9608;&amp;#9608;&deg;, Oceig is an island of former Eurasian colonies, seemingly forgotten by their masters and left to fend for themselves. Researchers from the EU and US have briefly made contact with the inhabitants. Though some of their customs and attire seem to be a bit... outdated, somehow their technology is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of the mainland. Only two successful trips have been made to this strange island; all others have found only shallow seas with high radiation levels. Additional research has found that there are no historical records of this landmass existing.
