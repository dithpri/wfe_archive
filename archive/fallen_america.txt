In 2020, outrages by the election results, both political parties of the US at the time begin arming and the nation embarks in a civil war.

The nation does not survive this. 

The nation splits in 50, not able to cope with the rising dissident and the President abdicates. some areas are still in anarchy but most are stable. The old days of the United States of America are gone, and now many separate nations remain.

In total violation of the Monroe Doctrine, European countries are starting to sent some troops to colonize the region. The states have to band together in an uneasy alliance to save what was America.

Welcome to a Fallen America.
