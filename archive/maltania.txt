Maltania is a huge area once dominated by the oppressive empire of wallaliam. The Charonite people were a minority in the Wallaliam empire which was dominated by the Walla people who were an aggressive warlike people. After centuries of oppression the Charonite people began to fight back estalishing an armed rebel movement backing up an aggressive civil rights movement. Unsurprisingly the ruling Walla emporor reacted with violence burning Charonite villages and beggining an ethnic cleansing campaign determined to eliminate the Charonite people. But the Charonite people retreated to the mountains and began an insurgent campaign to break the walla empire.
