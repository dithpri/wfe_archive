The U.P.I.R is a region dedicated to upholding the vital values of honesty, knowledge(roll tide), and civil rights (except for to those darker skinned citizens, roll tide).

We are a new but progressive region, most known for our secret military fighting squadron, The Minoriteam.

Whether you seek out a can of Skoal every morning (Roll Tide), fried chicken for lunch (Bonfire at 7:00 tonight. All of you welcome!), excessive amounts of money (you Jew!), or even borders to jump (Hola! do I even have to point you out?) the U.P.I.R is the Region for you!

All are welcome with open arms :)
