[nation]Victoria Venusia[/nation] is a misandrist nation.
[nation]Big Chocolate[/nation] is a misogynist nation.

Any issue that favors one sex over the other, they rule according to their respective sexist philosophy. All other issues they rule the same way. So the only variable making any difference between them is the misandry/misogyny. (And, of course, the order they receive the issues!)
