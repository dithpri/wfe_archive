The Cool Guy Club is a new region founded by the former Holy Empire of the Raging Stiffy, before it&amp;#39;s destruction after not calling the doctor after 4 hours of prolonged erections. Only nations deemed to be &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; are allowed in, with all else being named &amp;quot;squares&amp;quot;. Also, after much debate among the member nation (i.e Lezvie), an international decree was made, that all nations must amend their constitution to say that &amp;quot;Robert, amongst all things, has a really tiny genital region&amp;quot;.
