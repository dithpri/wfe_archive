Fire in the disco
Fire in the taco bell
Fire in the disco
Fire in the gates of hell

Don&amp;#39;t you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It&amp;#39;s my desire, It&amp;#39;s my desire, It&amp;#39;s my desire

Don&amp;#39;t you want to know how we keep starting fires?
It&amp;#39;s my desire, It&amp;#39;s my desire, It&amp;#39;s my desire

Danger! Danger! High Voltage!
When we touch, When we kiss
Danger! Danger! High Voltage!
When we touch, when we kiss
When we touch
