Welcome to [color=Red][b]The Montanese Axis[/b][/color]! We are a mighty region that has conquered all of [color=black]the world[/color]! At least in this universe. Don&#39;t ask. We are a neutral region centered around Roleplay and such. So have fun, I guess.

Big thank you to [nation]Nilrahrarfan[/nation] and his allies for merging [region]Axis of Storms[/region] into the Reich.

[nation]Second Traffia[/nation] designed our flag.
