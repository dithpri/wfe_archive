A small but crowded (and rich) region of Athraea which houses a host of squabbling nations.

This region is primarily made for worldbuilding, so it [i]will[/i] be expected of you to contribute if you join. If you don&#146;t feel like that joining a larger region is probably a better idea.

(I mean it&#146;s probably always a better idea to join a larger region because they&#146;re safer and all that but shhhhh)
