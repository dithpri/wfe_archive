The nation of Aberehadi was formed out of common yearning for peace and equality among its people. This can only be achieved through liberty and freedom, both personal and economic. At the same time, it is much more difficult to achieve at a global scale, with a potential influx of people who do not share the same sentiment, born out of hard work on the Aberehedian soil. Afraid of the negative influence from outside, the nation devolved into isolationist tendencies.

While the contact with the outside world is not cut completely, both in terms of exchange of goods and politics, the nation of Aberehadi prefers to be left alone to its own devices in the steppes of Aberehadi (the region).
