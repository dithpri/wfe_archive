[i]There once was a nation so hated they were banned from 4 regions. They found a refuge and moved in. After the holder of the refuge gave a grant to this refugee, the refugee then betrayed the refuge and moved to another region as refuge from that one. After they were suspecting that one of the users supporting his removal from those regions would invade that region and destroy it after an embassy request was sent, sending the aforementioned nation once again to [region]the Rejected Realms[/region]. They were then assured by that region&#39;s delegate to the World Assembly, that ejection from embassy RMB links is impossible. That nation then vanished and returned months later.[/i]
