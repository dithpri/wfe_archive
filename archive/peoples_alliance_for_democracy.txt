[B]People&amp;#39;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD)[/B]

The People&amp;#39;s Alliance for Democracy; PAD (also the &amp;#39;National Liberation Alliance&amp;#39;, the Thai Patriots Network or commonly, the Thai Yellow Shirts) is a Thai far right-wing political and pressure movement that opposes the government of Thaksin Shinawatra and any Thaksin-affiliated parties. We also oppose the left-wing United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (who are the supporters of Thaksin) or the Thai [color=red]Red Shirts[/color].

We welcome all nations of any ideology that are progressive, meaningfully democratic and not corrupt.
