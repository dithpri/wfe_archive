Any nation within the Eupaxian Isles must abide by Eupaxian law or be promptly eliminated. Eupaxian Law is as follows:

1. Do not abuse or attack any other member of the union.
2. You must not perform any actions that deliberately hinder the development of your nation.
3. The name of your nation must utilize proper English grammar rules. Please note that standard British English is preferable to American English, and it is advised that British spellings are to be used.
