[nation]Terran Victoria[/nation], formally known as the [region]Victorian Empire[/region], is a country bordering [nation]Kazimierz Alliance[/nation], [nation]Ursus Empire[/nation], and [nation]Leithanian Empire[/nation] that occupies the vast fertile basin of the continent&#39;s central region.

It is a constitutional monarchy ruled by a shared power of both the royal house of the Dracos and Aslans and a Parliament made up of its aristocrats while governing the predominant Feline populace. The Victorian throne, however, has been vacant for more than twenty years in the aftermath of a civil unrest, resulting in the Grand Dukes vying to take over it behind the scene.
