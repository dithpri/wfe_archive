I mean.... who doesn&#39;t like [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=chicken_overlords]chickens[/url].

Raiders, if you really want to raid the chickens, then please don&#39;t use this region to mess with triggers. It can be a pain in the [region]Artificial Solar System[/region].

Fendas *do* have the right to use this region if you are messing with the trigger so.... yeah sorry about that
