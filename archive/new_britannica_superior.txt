Following the secession of four traitorous nations, New Britannica Superior is on a hostile war footing with &#39;Powers of the Novus Imperium Romanun&#39; whose secession is illegal and will be challenged at the World Assembly. New Britannica Superior endeavours to embody and embrace the very spirit of empire, that with hard work and aggressive military expansion, anything is achievable. It is time to reclaim our rightful place at the head of the international community, and in the world assembly.
All member nations must be recognised officially as &#39;Colonies&#39; in order to attain membership of New Britannica Superior.
