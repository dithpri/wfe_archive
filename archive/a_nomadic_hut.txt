[b]Oh why hello there
I am [nation]Sail Nation Travellers[/nation], resting here taking a break from travelling for a few days. 
Right now, I&#39;m adjusting my policies on how I choose which regions to visit.

Like all good nomadic huts, this one is only temporary and will be deconstructed once I&#39;m ready to start travelling again[/b]
