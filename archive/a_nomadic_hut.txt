[b]Oh why hello there
I am [nation]Sail Nation Travellers[/nation], resting here taking a break from travelling for a few days. 
Right now, I&#39;m adjusting my policies on how I choose which regions to visit.

[color=red]If any [u]experienced[/u] travellers/nomads/wanderers have any suggestions on how I decide what regions to visit, then please TG me[/color]

I will begin travelling again shortly, hopefully in the next few days.[/b]
