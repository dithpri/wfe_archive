Once upon a time there was a dream: an organized region of like-minded individuals. Individuals with the same hopes, the same dreams. Perhaps, even, the same genders. Perhaps, even, they&#39;re all girls, and perhaps, even, they&#39;re all transgender girls. Would this be a paradise? Could this even be possible? Just maybe. All you actually need sometimes... is hope.
