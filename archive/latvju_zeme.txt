It is meant as a place to stand shoulder to shoulder for our ideals, not lose them in mindless infighting. The only time we take up our arms is when the whole Latvju Zeme is threatened. Every member state is respected and welcomed with joy.

All regional matters are settled adhering to the basic principles of democracy as we understand it:

1. mutual respect - unity;
2. one nation one vote - equality;
3. complete freedom in all internal matters - liberty.
