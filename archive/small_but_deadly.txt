Small but Deadly is very new and we need people in leadership positions such as the World Assembly delegate. This is a great opportunity for new players, such as myself, to learn alongside me and our other members. This is also a great chance for veteran players to teach new players such as myself. Powerful positions will be open, and I will be deciding who is in each position based on polls that I will be holding. So what do you say, are you in?
