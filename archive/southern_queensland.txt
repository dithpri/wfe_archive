The &#39;Better than any other Commonwealth&#39; Commonwealth of Big Bell enjoys peace and quiet.  So to get away from the hustle and bustle of the other regions of the world we set up shop in the wide open spaces of Southern Queensland.  The Australian government doesn&#39;t seem to mind.

Anyone is welcome to join, although this is a backwater with little-to-no activity going on so who knows why anyone would want to.  The founding, and probably only, member is the aforementioned Big Bell.
