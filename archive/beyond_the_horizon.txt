Greetings, traveler, and welcome to our corner of the multiverse!
Oh, what do we do here? Well, quite a few things, actually- we could start up some regional roleplay, make preparations for events like N-Day, or, y&#39;know, just relax! The whole point of this region is to be a thriving community, so we should have options for everyone in order to best achieve that goal. Oh, you can also participate in WA activity I guess, like endorsing our Delegate, who is yet to be determined... that one might have to wait until we get going in terms of population.

Make sure to read the rules (will add later) before posting on the message board, and have fun!

Warmest regards,
[nation]The Astral Mandate[/nation]
