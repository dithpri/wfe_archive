Greetings, traveler, and welcome to our corner of the multiverse!
Oh, what do we do here? Well, quite a few things, actually- we could start up some regional roleplay, make preparations for events like N-Day, or, y&#39;know, just relax! The whole point of this region is to be a thriving community, so we should have options for everyone in order to best achieve that goal. Oh, you can also participate in WA activity I guess, like endorsing our Delegate [nation]Azmeny[/nation].

Make sure to read the rules (will add later) before posting on the message board, and have fun!

Warmest regards,
[nation]The Astral Mandate[/nation]
