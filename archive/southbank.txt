[b][i]Welcome to Southbank, heroes![/i][/b]

This small settlement, as the name implies, lies in the south of Armello. Founded at the bank of the Rabbit River delta, [nation=short]Brun Oakbreaker[/nation] is hopeful it will become a robust trading port in time. However, the [nation=short]King of Armello[/nation], with his mind twisted by the Rot, has sent his Royal Guard to bully the villagers until they hand over their gold coins in new &quot;taxes&quot;.

Southbank needs heroes like you to drive out the Royal Guard! Whichever Clan does so (by scoring the most points), will be granted dominion over the region! To show its loyalty, Southbank will raise the shield of that Clan as its flag for all to see forever. Good luck to all Clans as you take your first step toward ruling Armello!
