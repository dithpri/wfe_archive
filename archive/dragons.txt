[color=red][i]Currently the region of [region]Dragons[/region] is a small region that accepts new nations as long as they are apart of the cause that this region is a free region but we have strict guide lines that you must follow if not you will recive a warning and may be banned or evicted out of the region.[/i][/color]

[color=yellow][i]For now [region]Dragons[/region] is currently accepting new members but you could post new rules or elections to start a all around voting this is after all a free region.[/color][/i]

[color=purple][i]Now everyone who will join [region]Dragons[/region] must be either a WA member or a normal member but since I myself am not I would request you to endorse other nations that are WA members until so that we have a WA Delegate in the nation[/color][/i]
