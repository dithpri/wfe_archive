[color=red]Paradise where Dragons and Dragons only could call home, as well as their limitless supply of human snack-slaves for three meals a day. Dragons here also use human souls as the main currency for exchange between nations of Dragons after consuming their flesh and bones.

This region is only for nations who truly acknowledge in the natural sublime superiority of Dragons over so-called &amp;#39;evolved&amp;#39; shaved apes (all others are not welcome, so stay away!). The Great Elder of All Dragons created humans to serve their purpose as edible slave-toys to serve Her other, more perfect creation in Her image.
