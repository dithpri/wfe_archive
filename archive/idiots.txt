Hi to all!

This is [nation]Rustdorp[/nation] happy to report that this test has gone perfectly!

We have successfully spiced up the life of a small region sadly abandoned by [region]The Black Hawks[/region].

They are welcome to come back and reinstate their rule if they wish- it won&#39;t be hard, and you don&#39;t have to ban us if you don&#39;t want to. 

So that&#39;s all for now, friends! See you in some other abandoned region. 

...I guess we&#39;re like those [nation]Migrating Geese[/nation] people, except we sorta-raid small abandoned regions.
