[b][color=blue]The Society for Political Advancement[/color][/b]
---
The SFPA is a council made up of nations to work for peace, regardless of government.
Dictatorships, Republics, Free Lands, and the like. All are welcome here.
Our main goal is to promote progressive cooperation between nations without interfering with each others&amp;#39; politics.

---
We do not allow inter-region arguments or wars.
- Any nation(s) caught causing dissonance will be removed from this council.
If a group attempts to join, but is in a war with another region member, they will not be allowed to join until the conflict is settled.
- Other region members will help to settle the conflict. We strive for peace and unity.
