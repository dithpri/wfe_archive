This region has been protected by the forces of [nation]Northern Mount Celestia[/nation]! This occupation occurred because of the current volatile political situation in the aftermath of the Dinnertime War, and the potential risk of an unfriendly refound by either [region]Lasagna[/region] or [region]The Gray Wardens[/region]. 

If the original owner, [nation]Burgermond[/nation], wants this region back, they can contact this division, my Ravanan ambassador [nation]Southern Mount Celestia[/nation], or my main account [nation]Northern Mount Celestia[/nation].
