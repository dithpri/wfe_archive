The Alternate Lands of Potatia is a surreal, multi-timeline region united by shared culture, interdimensional politics, and a blend of serious governance with structured absurdism. Spread across parallel realities - from fertile farmlands to digital pseudo-territories and diverse Potatian nations cooperate through shifting councils, delegates, and imperial systems while navigating issues like immigration, ideological balance, and many others. Known for our resilience, humor, and experimental political traditions, this region thrives on a unique mix of agricultural symbolism, constitutional evolution, and vibrant regional identity.
