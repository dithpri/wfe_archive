Spread across parallel realities&#151;from fertile farmlands to digital pseudo-territories&#151;its diverse Potatian nations cooperate through shifting councils, delegates, and imperial systems while navigating issues like immigration, ideological balance, and many others. Known for its resilience, humor, and experimental political traditions, the region thrives on a unique mix of agricultural symbolism, constitutional evolution, and vibrant regional identity.
