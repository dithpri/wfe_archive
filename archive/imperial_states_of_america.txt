Welcome to the [b][color=red]Imperial[/color] [color=gray]States[/color] of [color=blue]America.[/color][/b]

Seeking the establishment of a [b][i]new and greater[/i][/b] American Century, the ISA follows the principles of Enlightened Imperialism. With a mutual respect between Americana and those regions we engage through diplomacy and annexation whilst respecting the right to self determination of all peoples the foundations of our Century shall be unshakable. Our world yearns for guidance and leadership, a void the light of Americana shall fill.

Sovereignty can only be guarded by the might of the Empire, liberty ensured by the will of the Emperor, and justice upheld by his sword.
