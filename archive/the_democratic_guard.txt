Attention everyone! Elections for President will be held this Sunday! If you want to register a Party/Candidate (s) please telegraph me. I will also be resigning from my party because as the founder I will be the supreme court and feel resining is best in order to avoid conflict of interest accusations.
Feel free to contact me thru telegraph or threw our brand new discord server! (if you don&#39;t have the access code telegraph me for it)  

Sincerely New Kadressa
