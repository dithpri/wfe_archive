The Society of St. Pius X (SSPX) is a traditionalist Roman Catholic priestly fraternity, founded by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in 1970, dedicated to preserving Catholic tradition, especially the Tridentine Mass (Latin Mass) and pre-Vatican II practices, resisting modernist changes from the Second Vatican Council, and operating semi-independently with Rome, leading to canonical tensions and controversy, though we claim loyalty to the Pope, we view tradition as a higher authority when Rome conflicts with it.
