The Comintern is a world organization that advocates for a Communist and/or Socialist world.
We are mostly peaceful, but we will not refrain from attacking nations we find in a condition that is against the will of the proletariat. We hold Congresses every so often to vote on major decisions, and elect a General Secretary when the need arises.

Workers of the World, Unite!
