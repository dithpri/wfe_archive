Marhaban, traveler, and welcome to the New Arabia - an Arabian peninsula free of the scourges of tyranny, tribalism, and religious extremism. Enjoy your time in this oasis of tolerance and compassion at the intersection of East and West, explore one of our souqs and take in the sights and smells of gold, coffee, frankincense, myrrh and spices. Stay a while, have some date cookies, Arab tea and a puff of the hookah.
