Alt Right Knights is a casual region, founded by [nation]Montagne is bad 2[/nation] and [nation]Wharthursk[/nation]
Alt Right Knights is not a serious group, we (the founders) are not alt-right, but they are welcome here too

This region is for nations who want to be in a right wing region, but don&#39;t want to be in a serious region filled with role-players and such

You can do pretty much anything you feel like doing, as long as it doesn&#39;t break any of the rules

We will accept embassies from any right wing regions
