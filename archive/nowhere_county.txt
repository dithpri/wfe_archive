Nowhere is a very distant place...
Its land is barren and lifeless, Its inhabitants are few.
A Couple of seemengly endless roads and railways connect the region.
The only features of the landscape are a few small hills and lakes dotted araund... 
A strange town is to be found in the center of nowhere... It houses a avarage, corrupt goverment. It&amp;#39;s also an Industrial hub that keeps the region rolling.
Not much else is known abaut nowhere...
