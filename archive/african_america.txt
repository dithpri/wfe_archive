[color=E92a2e][b]Welcome, to the official board of the African American Union - AAU[/b][/color]

[b]The African American Union was founded in 2021 after multiple, long uninhabited Islands located in the North Atlantic Ocean have been populated by newly formed governments.[/b]

Due to the big ideological differences of these new nations, it became clear very quickly, that avoiding a nuclear disaster was only possible if the governments formed diplomatic ties early on.
Hence the formation of the [i][b]&#149; African American Union - AAU &#149;[/b][/i]

The 5 founder nations of this Union are:
[list][*][b]the PRLCF[/b]
