The Islands of Leaders are a group of islands in which leaders dwell to help create a better world in NationStates. It is given the name &amp;quot;Islands of Leaders&amp;quot; because every individual island in this region possesses a leader that will attempt to benefit specific things such as political freedoms, civil rights and economy. This leader can be a president, prime minister, queen, king, emperor, holy emperor or even a dictator. And although it is necessary to have 750 million citizens in a nation to unlock a leader of a nation, it isn&amp;#39;t in The Islands of Leaders. Here, you can simply state the name of your leader and what type of leader they are on your fact book entries. It&amp;#39;s your island, and your leader!
