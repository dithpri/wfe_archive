[color=purple]The Borderlandic Resistance may be small and only one of the 1,000+ regions. However, What makes us different from all the others is that we are active and close. We vote on all things we do concerning the Region and its Members. We try to include everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts and ideas. You will not be left out in anything we do.[/color]
