We believe that one day, people all over the world will unite the community and no discrimination will be avoided. I am Muslim and believe in God. However, I am not against any religion that believes in one God. The Christian religion is dear to me, Judaism like him. However, the religious struggles of people trying to leave and the creation of a united around God and the power to understand. Welcome to our region.
