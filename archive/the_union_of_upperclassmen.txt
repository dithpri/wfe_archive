Developed from a band of nations seceded from The United Nations of CCTL and other small and corrupted regions, The Union of Upperclassmen developed their own region to establish a safe haven for countries to develop their own governments free from all corruption and lobbyist influence.

We seek to give all nations the full NationStates experience and strongly encourage regional nations to participate in discussion, voting for the regional delegate, and participating in the World Assembly.

The Union is founded on the principles of education, intelligence, peace, and political involvement.
