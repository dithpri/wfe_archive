Yoyleland was founded sometime in September, and hasn&#39;t been featured yet. It&#39;s also a region that is based off of a popular web series known as Battle for Dream Island, or BFDI.

This region is a region for BFDI fans and OSC members, has a lot of yoyleberries, borders the [region]Union of Conlang Nations[/region], and is an embassy haven.
[hr]If you haven&#146;t watched BFDI, you should definitely watch it! It&#146;s a great show and I really recommend it! (The voice acting in season 1 is kinda bad tho, I just skipped to BFDIA after 5 episodes lol)
