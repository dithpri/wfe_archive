This region is a region for BDFI lovers (I guess). And it has many berries, border [region]Union of Conlang Nations[/region], and is an embassy haven.[hr]If you haven&#146;t watched BFDI, you should definitely watch it! It&#146;s a great show and I really recommend it! (The voice acting in season 1 is kinda bad tho, I just skipped to BFDIA after 5 episodes lol)
[spoiler=Former WFE]This is a region based off of BFDI.
BFDI lovers galore!
