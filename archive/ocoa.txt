[b]Welcome to OCOA (Operation: Coat of Arms)![/b]
&#147;[i]Good things don&#146;t have to come to an end[/i]&#148;[hr]OCOA is a region for refugees from dying regions that still want to preserve their old lifestyle!

However, anyone that is just looking for a region to live in is also welcome to OCOA![hr][b]MEMBERS OF OCOA[/b]:
[region]Roleplay Republic[/region][hr][url=http://ocoarpforum.boards.net]Roleplay Forums (HUGE WIP)![/url]



Sadly, due to low amounts of activity not only here but across NationStates, OCOA will be shut down. Don&#39;t worry, OCOA can be re-established if multiple regions decide to reside in OCOA with my permission. At least 2 regions.
