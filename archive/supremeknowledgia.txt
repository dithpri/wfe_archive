Greetings and salutations, my fellow knowledge seekers. 
In Supremeknowledgia, we take pride in asserting that we&#39;re constantly fighting to obtain absolute knowledge of the world. If you have any contribution to give to our educational database of nations, we would highly appreciate you joining in with us.
The rules are quite simple: have a very education-focused government; have sufficient policies that prevent crime; utilise your military only as a means of discovering more knowledge, regardless of the method. All shall bow down to the true leaders of tommorrow. 

Intelligence shall reign!
