The year is 2020. A white flash has wiped out all traces of human existence on Earth say for a few surviving groups of people. The survivors don&#39;t know the world that preceded them, yet are curiously aware of modern concepts like medicine, crafts, art and literature. These people are confused and scared, yet are determined to make new modern societies from what little supplies that survived with them. The first among them may not survive the test of time, such as The Sky Peoples, who send pioneers out into the fresh untouched world to rebuild the earth.
