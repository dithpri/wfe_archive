may socialism and democracy prevail over the third world system we are. there have been leaders who rose and fell for the good or bad, but no exact reflection of socialist freedom exists present day. come, join us in our struggle in a world of poverty, whether you are an Arab from the north or a Nubian of the Sudan. if you are from the deepest heart of south Africa, you are a comrade of third world socialism and must serve the third worlds rights to socialism. we will make your African nation into a socialist superpower to remember. may Allah bless the African union!
