[b]Bear-Boi took some Hawks and new Hawklings on a training run. A simple run was expected but along the way they had to grapple with an update that still hadn&#39;t recovered from #deruuu-gate. In spite of that, everyone performed admirably - even Hwan. If you&#39;d like to get in on some update antics then come say hello on our [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]discord[/url] and sign up to our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]forums[/url].
