[color=b59411][u]1 John 5:1-3 {CSB}[/u][/color]
[color=Steelblue][I]Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of him. This is how we know that we love God&#39;s children: when we love God and obey his commands. For this is what love for God is: to keep his commands. And his commands are not a burden.[/I][/color]
