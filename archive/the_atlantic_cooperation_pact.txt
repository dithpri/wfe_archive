Founded on February 28, 2021.  The Atlantic Cooperation Pact or ACP is an alliance of various Atlantic nations that wish to preserve or create diplomatic ties and cooperation with other nations, and maintain a relatively non-aligned or neutral stance in overall world politics except for when action is necessary.  Nations are free to join the pact so long as they adhere to it&#39;s rules and bring benefit to the overall pact through any appropriate or valid means.  

The ACP was founded in order to maintain and strengthen the position of what would other wise be weak and diplomatically isolated nations through sheer strength in numbers.  As well as repel foreign influence and intervention into our politics.  

Your support, would be appreciated.
