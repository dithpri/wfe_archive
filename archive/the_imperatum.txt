The Imperatum is a region of unity, where smaller countries can become States and unify under one flag. No matter of religion, or government, everybody is equal and free to join. 
Once joining the Imperatum, your country will become a &quot;State&quot;. It may have country attributes, but if going to war, all other states in the Imperatum shall join the war. 
You may give the title of your State as Protectorate or Disputed Territories.
We hope you will join our glourious nation to help with being the next powerful union of NationStates!
