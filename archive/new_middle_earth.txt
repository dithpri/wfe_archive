Hello to all and may a pint be raised to you. [b]We are under new management[/b] now that Sauron has been taken care of, I know I for one will sleep easier knowing there is not a big eye watching me. Here at new middle earth [b] we welcome everyone and anyone whether they be a constipated Orc or a disturbingly tranquil elf. [/b] once you join you will be free to claim a piece of land (not too big) and live unperturbed by the troubles of society. Lionel Richie couldn&amp;#39;t have put it better my region, our region is truly easy like Sunday morning.  So join us today.
