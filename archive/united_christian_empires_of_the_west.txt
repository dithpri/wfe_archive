&amp;#10013;&amp;#65039; [color=#6E0DED] For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God. (St. James I:20)[/color]

&amp;#128330;&amp;#65039; [color=#A901DB] [/color] I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will teach you all truth. For He shall not speak of Himself; but what things soever He shall hear, He shall speak; and the things that are to come, He shall shew you. (St. John XVI:12-13)  &amp;#128330;
