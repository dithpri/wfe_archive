[b][i]Welcome to From The Ashes![/i][/b]

This is a region based on a discord server called From The Ashes, where, instead of warmongering, worldbuilding and depth nations are the norm, along with an effective system to prevent powerplayers along with a lore located in a 1950s fictional world, that featured 2 global powers going into a nuclear war that left the world destroyed. After this, new nations rose up. After the war, the world now starts in 1XX, and ongoing from there. The goverments of the world now try to not repeat the same mistakes as the 2 alliances. Or are they? Find out and join the discord. https://discord.gg/g98yYnPBWF
