[color=limegreen]Workers of the World, unite![/color] [region]The Union of Proletarian States[/region] is a region founded on the pure basic principles of [color=purple]Marxism[/color].  We are now returning this region to pure communist principles, as it has been corrupted and its leaders have conspired with fascist regions, going so far as to accept an embassy with [region]Skinheads[/region]!

Reject such anti-communist principles and join us as we pursue the calling of creating a world of equality and acceptance for all, united as one under the red flag.  Down with fascism!  Down with capitalism!  Long live the Communist Party!
