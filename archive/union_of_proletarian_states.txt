[color=red][b]Workers of the World, unite![/b][/color] The Union of Proletarian States is a region founded on the basic principles of Marxism, and supports the liberation and protection of all nations from Imperialism. We are growing a new, and fun community! We welcome any nation, regardless of political affiliation or tendency provided it is not fascist in nature. If you would like to get involved in the founding of our regional government, or have questions about registering on our offsite forum below, please do not hesitate to ask.
