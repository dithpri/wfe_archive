The Dark Continent can be the Region for anyone as long as peace is maintained. Internal conflicts must not be trifled by other Nations and outside forces, peace must be the ultimate goal for every Nation in this Region, war is no place for this Region unless the Nations have no choice. Those who declared War will be removed from The Dark Continent.
Your authority in your own Nation will not be questioned as long as it stays within your borders.

Rules:
1. Be an active member.
2. Never question and meddle with one&#39;s authority within their Nations. 
3. Always be open to trades.
4. The size of your land will be moderated and decided by the Governor with supervision of his Delegates.
5. Never seek or declare war with your neighbors.
