[color=orchid][b]Amethyst Alliance![/color][/b] [b]a region for refuge seekers and others as well. Here we judge you not by your past, but by your future.[/b]

How and why are we here? Our path as a region started in early 2020, when we cut free from [region]Confederation of Corrupt Dictators[/region] for good. Now, we are looking to be a community in which roleplay flourishes, people can become friends, and everyone can find home and safety.

We do, [b]keep in mind[/b], discourage any OOC political or religious talk, due to this being able to lead to debates and arguments. So if you do for some reason do that, remember to keep it civil and polite. 

Hopefully you will have a fine time here! Welcome!
