This is the land of Laissez-faire.  A ruler determines the destiny of his or her own nation, but is HIGHLY discouraged from interfering in the affairs of one&amp;#39;s neighbors.  Osso Meade is a loose confederation of nations that respects the autonomy of sister nations, yet it is incumbent upon those nations to band together to defend what we hold dear--independence.  Because of our desire to remain unconstrained by restrictions or rules created by those who neither value nor understand our fierce commitment to self-governance, our region chooses to have no affiliation with the World Assembly.
