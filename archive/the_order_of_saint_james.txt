The order of St. James is a large variety of Christian Nations from all Christian branches. The order was first created under the command of Prince Isaac I of Kevalia in 2073. The Order&#39;s purpose was to reclaim the Holy Land from the Arab Caliphate that had seized the lands of Israel, Jordan and Syria in 2050. The Holy Lands of Jerusalem and the Promised Land now remain under the control of Muslims, just like the European countries that had falled to the Islamic invasions of 2036. The Order is the only hope to the Christian restoration of the world, and if not, total Islamic dominance of the globe.
