The Drodomo is made up of the triangle 3 regions: Roswoode, Blodskog, and Zamesiane. The word Drodomo is taken from DRO, which refers to Dystra-Reaper-Oneni, and the subset word of domo which means &quot;large land&quot;. This three word inclusion comes from the shape of each region as follows: 

Roswoode is like a reaper reaching out for a fleeing spirit. 

Blodskog is like a snake with a rattle tail, flicking its&#39; tongue out.

Zamesiane is like a tree with a branch nearly breaking off.
