The Glaarkian Legion was one of the few N-day[sup]8[/sup] factions to end with a positive number, being tied for 39th.

The Glaarkian Legion also helped [region]OrangeJuice[/region] during N-day under the alias of the &quot;Rustic Defenders&quot;.
As the Rustic Defenders, the legion created 1201 radiation from nukes.
