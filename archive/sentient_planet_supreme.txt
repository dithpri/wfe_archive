The Sentient Planet Supreme is a living celestial giant. Its gravitational field is approximately twice the strength of Earth&amp;#39;s, rendering its inhabitants with comparatively superhuman physical limits. The planet&amp;#39;s core is composed of a perpetual energy engine, an anomaly that is yet to be analyzed in detail. This energy core is syphoned by the planet&amp;#39;s inhabitants, and serves as these society&amp;#39;s primary source of power. The consciousness of this mysterious giant is currently dormant, though recent activity has been reported. The first human encountered the Sentient Planet Supreme in the year 2007, when a scout ship of the TRIAD Tea Company accidentally encountered a spacial rift that opens up near the planets orbital path.
