[hr][hr][color=darkgreen][b]Weeks Auto Repair in Wray Heights gained short-lived fame across Malton in the mid-70s with its local radio advertising campaign slogan, [i]&quot;If your car needs repair - it&#39;ll take Weeks to fix it!&quot;[/i] This slogan made the most of the repair shop&#39;s reputation for slow, meticulous work, often involving waits of weeks or even months even for apparently trivial jobs like getting new footwell carpets fitted, or replacing fluffy dice ornaments on a rearview mirror.

Since the outbreak, the queue of cars awaiting repair has remained steady, but waiting times have gone up to 4-5 years, with no new spares likely to arrive [i]&quot;until at least 2010&quot;[/i], according to the new proprietor, Dedfer Weeks.
