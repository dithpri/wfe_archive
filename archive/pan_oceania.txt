Welcome to our humble nation.

War is Peace

Freedom is Slavery

Ignorance is Strength

Currently at war with Eurasia, Maintaining peace with our closest ally Eastasia.

[i]Strong and peaceful, wise and brave;
Fighting the fight for the whole world to save
We the people will ceaselessly strive
To keep our great revolution alive
Unfurl the banners, look at the screen;
Never before has such glory been seen

Oceania, Oceania, Oceania, &#39;tis for thee
Every deed, every thought &#39;tis for thee
Every deed, every thought &#39;tis for thee[/i]
