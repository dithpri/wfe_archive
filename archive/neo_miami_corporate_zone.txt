The Neo Miami Corporate Zone, founded in the year 1987, is the common name for a small patch of land that was created after a massive asteroid impacted the Earth. Many corporate CEO&#39;s, artists, political leaders and more flooded this new land for the chance to create something new. A new life.

As of now, the only nations inhabiting the Neo Miami Corporate Zone are [nation]Reeseus Puffs[/nation], [nation]The Eight Miles[/nation], and [nation]Mankind Led by the God emperor Jeb[/nation].
