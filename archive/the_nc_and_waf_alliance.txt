A great and powerful region, with whom you really should construct embassies with.
We have many extremely powerful nations dwelling here, who should not be messsed with.
If you are lucky enough to enter this region, you must observe the following rules, which are:
1. (No debating about this) No Swearing or Profanity 
2. You must endorse the current WA Delegate
3. If you are ejected, you must go on your way and not harass any other nations
4. Do not use the message board to argue with someone, use the telegrams
5. You will be warned if you are about to be ejected, so nobody can say that it wasn&amp;#39;t fair (this one isn&amp;#39;t really a rule, just a fact)
INSTRUCTIONS:
Move to where West Atlantic Federation is, and endorse him
