If you somehow find this, no one can join, sorry! I&#39;ve always been a geography nerd, so Fridge is an imaginary country I&#39;ve had since I was young. Named Fridge, because that was the name of my favorite stuffed animal when I was younger- not because it&#39;s cold, quite the opposite actually. I made this region to see how accurately this site portrays may vision for each state, and I&#39;ve got to say, it&#39;s pretty accurate!
