If you somehow find this, no one can join, sorry! I&#39;ve been a huge geography nerd for as long as I can remember, so naturally I have my imaginary world. It&#39;s name is Fridge, because that was the name of my favorite stuffed animal when I was younger... not because it&#39;s cold. I made this region to see how accurately this site portrays my vision for each state, and I&#39;ve got to say, it&#39;s pretty accurate!

If you wish to learn more about Fridge/the twenty-three Fridgean states, feel free to check each nation&#39;s factbook (though I refer to the nations as states). From there, you can assess how much of a life I have!
