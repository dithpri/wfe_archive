If you somehow find this, no one can join, sorry! I&#39;ve been a huge geography nerd for as long as I can remember, so naturally I have my imaginary world. It&#39;s name is Fridge, because that was the name of my favorite stuffed animal when I was younger... not because it&#39;s cold. I made this region mostly to have some form of a wiki, as well as to see how the states compare to each other.

If you wish to learn more about Fridge/the twenty-three Fridgean states, feel free to check each state&#39;s factbook, though bear in mind, it&#39;s a work in progress. Further information about the country itself can be found below.
