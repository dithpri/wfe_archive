Somewhere in the world, where it is always cold
Bears rub their backs at the Earth&#39;s axis
The centuries come along, the seas sleep under the ice,
Bears rub their backs, the Earth is turning around

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
The Earth is turning faster
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
The Earth is turning faster~
