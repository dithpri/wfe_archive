[i]Confederation of the Mediterranean[/i] is a roleplay group originally based around Earth&#39;s Mediterranean Sea before unforeseen circumstances occurred, whether that be warfare, economics, or poor decision-making. Nonetheless, the group is well-maintained and totally never breaks the rules. [b][i]No swearing![/i][/b]
