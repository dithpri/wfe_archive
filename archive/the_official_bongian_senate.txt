[color=#4CBB17][b]The United Bongo States of the New America&#39;s federal legislature is made up of the Official Bongian Senate.
It gathers annually to deliberate on and adopt government-related proposals and regulations. It gets together to talk on proposals put out by President Rise and his cabinet.
By implementing rules that are worthwhile to the populace, the region, and the Bongos nations, it maintains stability in the Bongos United region.
Only in a scenario of a tie does the vice president of the UBSNA contribute a vote in the Senate.
