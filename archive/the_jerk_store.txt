[b]With the Ides of March coming up, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to re-enact some of their favorite plays! While opposing militaries went to [region]Sleep[/region], the Hawks reigned terror upon a handful of large regions and one small hamlet. With no one to stop them, the Hawks descended upon these regions like a mighty tempest. Unfortunately for these regions, the Hawks worked with precision - there would be no comedy of errors this update. 

But you don&#39;t have to just watch our plays - you can [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Come Join Us.[/url] Come see what raiding is all about, and play the game as you like it. Shape the game yourself.
