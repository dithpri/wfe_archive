Welcome to the Region of Qieldin. This regions was founded approximately 344 years ago in Sandail&amp;#39;s time period 1974 (CE or AE). After previous attempts at reorganizing this planet, it became a barren snowy wasteland. Which is filled with snow, ice, and water all over. Right now there are small but subtle surviving towns and cities spread all about with outdated technology. 

Their Tech stagnated 300 years ago, thus keeping the entire planet in a downhill struggle to stay alive. After about a couple centuries later (Now present time period) things are starting to come along at a slow pace. Current time is Dasanfas, 300 AC (After Collapse)
