UPDATE: Some refugees from the recently raided [region]Galaxies of Euphova[/region] made a bunch of new nations, signed them up to the World Assembly                     (which is against Nationstates rules) and raided us. Our region was full of stupid memes for two days, but everything should be fine now. 

We&#39;ll be back to normal in no time!
