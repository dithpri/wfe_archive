If you feel like raiding here, please accept my gift of a region ban.

P.S for raiders: I went ahead and removed most powers from the delegate that you might use, so don&#39;t bother with that stuff
P.S for &quot;real&quot; nations/delegates: If you get elected as delegate legitimately, you may telegram the founder with a list of role titles, corresponding permissions and role appointees. Should the founder deem you to be legitimately elected as delegate, appointments will be made per your request.
