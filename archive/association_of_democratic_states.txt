The Association of Democratic States (ADS) is a political and economic organization of ten democratic countries, which was formed on 19 February 2015 by The Democratic Union of European States. Its aims include accelerating economic growth, social progress, and sociocultural evolution among its members. Indeed, ASD misses few opportunities to meet to discuss issues.

Free trade initiatives in ASD are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASD Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and Agreement on Customs. These agreements are supported by work done by several sectoral bodies to plan and execute free trade measures.
