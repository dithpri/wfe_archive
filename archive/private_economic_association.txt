- The Private Economic Association has been created to suit the needs of those with industrious, private run economies.

- We aim to enforce our policies in having a WA delegate as well as a strict, invite only, or password locked organization. This is to assure nations wishing to join are focused around a private economy, specifically 90% or more. 

- I do hope nations interested will pursue this opportunity. You may send a telegram to the founder to confirm your wishes.
