Welcome to The Caf&eacute;, a land of chit-chat, coffee and biscuits. (They are very nice biscuits... y&#39;know the ones with chocolate in the centre? Yeah, those.) 

Anyway, I&#39;ll be your barista- sit back and relax, there&#39;s plenty to do here! Order a drink- perhaps something to eat- and enjoy a conversation with a fellow customer (as long as it isn&#39;t about me!). Feel free to tip at the end of your stay. Now, do you want any sugar?
