The island archipelago of Panau, previously ruled by a ruthless dictator, Pandak Panay. After an American sponsored mercenary named Rico Rodriguez pulled the regime down, the country split between warring factions. A group of communists named the Reapers, a large criminal organisation named the Roaches and a nationalist organisation named the Ular Tribe. Eventually a new government was founded, built over the might of a large private army named The Enforcers. The factions are still fighting to this day.
