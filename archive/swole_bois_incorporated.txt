Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down, and I&#39;d like to take a minute, just sit right there.I&#39;ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. In West Philadelphia, born and raised on the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin&#39; out, maxin&#39;, relaxin&#39; all cool and all shootin&#39; some b-ball outside of the school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good started makin&#39; trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said &quot;You&#39;re movin&#39; with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.&quot;
