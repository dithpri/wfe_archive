The goals and dreams of Team Rocket live on once more! Even after our defeat in Kanto, and our subsequent revival failure in Johto, we persevere. Our venerable leader, Executive Bruxxa, has dragged Team Rocket out of the ashes and shown a new light upon our glorious cause. Gone are the days of cult worship of Giovanni, the apostate founder of our great organization. He hath abandoned the cause, and as such we abandon him to sour to new heights. We will, as Jessie and James have said many a time, &quot;extend our reach to the stars above.&quot; And so too will we extend our reach to every corner of the world. Long live Team Rocket! Long live the cause!
