&quot;We have to remember what&#39;s important in life: friends, waffles, and work.  Or waffles, friends, work.  But work has to come in third.&quot; - Leslie Knope

Pawnee is a region based on the idea that a sense of community, being there for your friends, enjoying the quirky things in life, and having a good laugh while accomplishing a task are what makes life worth living and a place worth living in.
