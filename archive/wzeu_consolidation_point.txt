We are here to consolidate and hold together the damaged community of Warzone Europe in these troubled times. I am confident that in the end, the Warzone will come out on top, as will her Majesty Empress [nation]Astarial[/nation]. For now, trying times must not break us.

Long live the Empress and long live Warzone Europe.
