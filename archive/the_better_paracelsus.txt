We are a staunchly progressive, atheist and spiritual region.
We&#39;re just like a hippie town but on a regional scale
Marijuana, euthanasia, abortion and same-sex marriage should exist.
Sexism, racism, nationalism, nootism, fascism, homophobia, homomismia and any other form of discrimination should not exist.
