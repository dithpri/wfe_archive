This is a WWII styled role play region, with custom nations on earth.  You don&#39;t have to be a nation from the actual WWII, but the technology should be such. You won&#39;t be kicked because you beat a more powerful nation with special authorities, because the announcer is the only one with the authorities and he only kicks and/or bans if the specific rules are broken.

We are very passionate about roleplay since it&#39;s the only reason this region was founded in the first place.
