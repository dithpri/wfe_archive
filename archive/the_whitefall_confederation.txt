When the Imperial Commonwealth of Malkyer fell during the Glass Revolution of 2010, many of the newly independent colonies and constituent states joined together to form the Whitefall Confederation, a supranational economic, military, and political alliance attempting to retain some of the power and prestige of the old Empire. Member states retain internal autonomy, while the Confederate government controls foreign affairs &amp; trade, and defense. The Kingdom of Malkyer is no longer the [i]de jure[/i] ruler of its former empire, but its large population, vast wealth, and powerful military serve to keep it in a preeminent position within the Confederation.

The current President of the Confederation is Robert Campbell, of the Unity Party.
