[b][u][color=lime]Welcome to Planet Kerbin![/color][/u][/b]

If you couldn&#39;t tell already, this region is based around Kerbal Space Program. &quot;What can I do?&quot; You may ask. Well! You can claim a spot, show off your insane KSP creations, the sky isn&#39;t the limit! Please do note that in order to participate in regional roleplays, you must have a spot on the map.

The difference between the Nation Map and Region Map are that the Nation Map displays the nations and the Region Map displays the regions of Planet Kerbin.

Planet Kerbin isn&#39;t to be treated as a NS Region, it&#39;s to be treated as an entirely different planet.
