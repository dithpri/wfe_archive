You are a scientist, sent here to work your way from the bottom to the top. Here, you are placed in charge of the SCU (Special Containment Unit) of several scientific anomalies. Your employer is bound by law not to tell you the researched assets. It is up to you to contain and protect the rest of the world from this scourge...before it eventually escapes from custody.
