The Comintern ML (Marxist-Leninist) is a new, growing region dedicated to anti-revisionist Marxism-Leninism. The region was founded to counter reactionary, petty bourgeois and revisionist influence in other regions across the world and after our old region, THE BOLSHEVIK UNION, was hacked. Our members preserve the Marxist-Leninist ideals so that other nations can be liberated from their bourgeoisie-led governments and have a region that is tolerant, just and disciplined.
