The [B]Communist International - Marxist-Leninist (COMINTERN ML)[/B] is a new, growing region dedicated to anti-revisionist Marxism-Leninism. The region was founded to counter reactionary, petty bourgeois and revisionist influence in other regions across the world. Our members preserve the Marxist-Leninist ideals so that other nations can be liberated from their bourgeoisie-led governments and have a region that is tolerant, just and disciplined.
