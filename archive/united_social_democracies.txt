Social democracy is a libertarian centre-left ideology. It uses a capitalist form of economy while regulating the economy to protect consumers and workers. Social democracies tend to have income redistribution, regulation of the economy and welfare. Some real life examples of this ideology in practice are the Nordic and Scandinavian countries. Social dmeocracy is frequently mixed up with democratic socialism (though countries following this ideology are welcome here).
