With 21 nations so far (including canon political parties), our regional government is run in 3 departments; executive, legislative, &amp; judicial. 
Executive: The Cabinet (every nation with a role), the world assembly regional council (WA delegate and a vice-delegate), &amp; the Founder (Agife).
Legislative: the &quot;Concilium Septentrionale&quot; (northern council), with 120 deputies elected at large, structured like Real-life New Zealand&#39;s Parliament.
Judicial: the Supreme Court (run by the Head of the Judiciary), &amp; the courthouses (can be run by any nation selected by the H.J or Founder).
The Judiciary must remain separate from the Executive, but The founder &amp; W.A delegates &amp; vice-delegates can hold a cabinet position
