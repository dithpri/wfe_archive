Apathy-Land is a budding oasis of non-caring, in a desert of nations that just try to be, you know, whatever.. If you want, you can run for an office. It&amp;#39;s cool. We don&amp;#39;t care. We try to keep up a standard of &amp;quot;Whatever.&amp;quot; And when people try to make it care, they get banned. Basically, you can do whatever you want. Or don&amp;#39;t. But don&amp;#39;t force other people to do stuff. I mean, we don&amp;#39;t want to be, you know, like that, but, it&amp;#39;s like, you know, you shouldn&amp;#39;t do that either. But, you know, I don&amp;#39;t care that much. I mean, that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s all about, and that never fails to amuse and entertain.
