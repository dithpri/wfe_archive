Dispatchia is now under [u]new management[/u] and will be continuing with its original purpose of acting as a [b]dispatch and communications hub[/b] with resources for [b]small and medium-sized social and RP regions[/b]. 

We also hope to build a vibrant community of our own and have a wide variety of things to offer such as: [list]
[*][b][color=4169E1]A sports league (coming soon!*)[/color]
[*][color=20B2AA]Regional cabinet posts and other government offices[/color]
[*][color=9370DB]Since we are a new region, if you&#39;d like to see something done you can ask and most likely it will happen![/color]
[*]And most importantly... [u][color=blue]A whole lot of dispatches![/color][/u][/b][/list]

[color=gold][b][u]&amp;#65279;ALL EMBASSY REQUESTS ACCEPTED![/u][/b][/color]
