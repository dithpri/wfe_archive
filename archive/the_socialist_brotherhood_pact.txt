The Socialist Brotherhood Pact is a region led by the workers with the mission to help construct the final stage of  human society free of class, hate, reaction, poverty, and hunger: Communism

This region is a democracy ruled by the workers and all of it&#39;s nations have been freed from the chains of monarchist, capitalist, and fascist oppression. We are a far-left region that opposes revisionism and any thing that poses as a threat to the journey towards the Communist future.

The region&#39;s capital, Minsk, is where the workers and trade unions work tirelessly to ensure that the rights of the poor in all corners of the world are protected and honoued.

Long live the Revolution!
