Peruse is the temporary unification between a few minor Nations that prefer to be left out of external world affairs. Peruse was formed for a myriad of reasons, one being similar goals between nations, and another being for increased protection. It is a very secular and isolationist region, choosing to avoid most foreign conflict to better itself through advancements in technology.

Essentially, our group just enjoy writing lore in a pointless flashy and overly detailed manner. We generally focus on writing articles on future-tech, and monitor this through detailed linkbooks. We mostly use Dispatch, however, other programs may be used if they are easily linked and implemented.
