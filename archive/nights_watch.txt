[b][i][color=grey]&#147;Night gathers, and now  our watch begins. It shall not end until our death. We shall take no wives, hold no lands, father no children. We shall wear no crowns and win no glory. We shall live and die at our post. We are the swords in the darkness. We are the watchers on the walls. We are the shields that guard the realms of men. We pledge our lives and honor to the Night&#39;s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.&#148;[/color][/i]

The Night&#146;s Watch is a military willing to accept any Brother or Sister who wishes to serve. A member may join one of three orders: Rangers, Builders, and Stewards.[/b]
