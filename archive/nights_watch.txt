We are the [b]Night&amp;#39;s Watch[/b].

[i]Night gathers, and now my watch begins. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night&amp;#39;s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.[/i]

The Night&amp;#39;s Watch is the military wing of the [region]Kingdom of Westeros[/region]. It is commanded by the Lord Commander. Currently that post is vacant, so direct all queries to [nation=short]Petyr Baelish[/nation].
