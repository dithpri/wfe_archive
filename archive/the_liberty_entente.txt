     This region is a fairly new region compared to other regions, having been founded in mid-2018 by one John Dude, leader of [nation]Makatuna[/nation]. At that time, Makatuna was still a fledgling nation, with a population of around 200 million people. Shortly after, the [nation]Shiblands[/nation] joined, at the personal request of John Dude. Over the years, many nations have come and gone, but Makatuna and Shiblands have remained the two powerhouses of the region.
