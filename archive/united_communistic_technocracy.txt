The United Communistic Technocracy (UTC) is a collection of islands above Russia in the Atlantic Ocean. The UCT was created by the Technocratic Syndicate some time after they broke free of Russia in a civil war caused by the population wanting to become communists again. After the split from Russia the Technocratic Syndicate created large amounts of new technology and other new nations wished to share in some of the Technocratic Syndicates technological superiority, thus creating the United Communistic Technocracy in an attempt to bring communism and technology to the world.
