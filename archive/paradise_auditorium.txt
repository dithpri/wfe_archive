The Paradise Auditorium, founded on the 25th of July, 2023, hopes to become a region of acceptance, kindness, and safety. Its founders embrace the notions of harmony, liberty, hope, equality, individuality, and love, which are known as the Central Pillars of the region.

After going through thorough and careful review, the Constitution of the Paradise Auditorium will soon be officially published; it is currently in draft form.
