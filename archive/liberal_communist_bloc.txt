The Liberal Communist Bloc is here to give Communism a better name with our updated version of modern communism. This modern liberal version of communism has new ideology behind it, we believe in Ortegaism which states that a truly communist country should accept all people, while eliminating the social classes still. Ortegaism believes in excessive rights for LGBT people and is in favor of same-sex marriage the region bans all members that revert to Stalinist policies as well as Countries that violate the rights of the population, the times are changing and communism has to change with it.
