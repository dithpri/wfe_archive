The government is friendly and democratic. We listen to the people of our region! We try our best to involve our nations in role play or any other event! The regional map has been set up and is updated daily. The nations in the region are usually active! All things that majorly change the region are voted on and everyone has the right to vote! A regional blog is to come, all nations will be notified when it is up and running!
