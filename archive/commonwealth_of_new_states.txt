Commonwealth of New States (CNS) is for new players who just created accounts and don&#39;t know what to do with them. Our ideologies are Anarchism, Democracy, Oligarchy, Autocracy, Communism, and Socialism. No need to ask to join. Here are our stuff:

1) Daily news, weekly events, and elections for who gets what role like regional officers for example. And also, every two weeks we choose leader of the region.

2) Free use of forums and message boards, but with rules of course. (go to bottom for more details.)

3) I haven&#39;t come up with a third feature, sorry. BTW I might open a discord chat room some time.
