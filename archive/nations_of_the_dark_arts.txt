Founded by Duststorm, a Nation broken off from the Kingdom of Ultimalia so Spirit-Human Hybrids would have their own Nation in which they could practice Dark Magic, Nations of the Dark Arts is a Region of Nations that believe that all Humans on Earth and beyond should have access to Magic, especially the superior element of Darkness. If your Nation houses Hybrids (or other races) that use and celebrate Dark Magic, you are cordially invite you to relocate to Nations of the Dark Arts. Users of Light Magic or other elements of Magic are permitted in this Region but are merely tolerated, not accepted.
