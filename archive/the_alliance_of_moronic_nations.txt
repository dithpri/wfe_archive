The Alliance of Moronic Nations (often shortened to the AMN) is a collection of nations who, due to their high level of idiocy, don&#39;t fit into other regions and thus became an allied region.

To join, a nation must prove itself stupid enough and that it is similar ideologically. In other words, only nations founded by the same person (me) can join.
