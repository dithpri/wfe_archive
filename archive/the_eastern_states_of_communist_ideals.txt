We believe a strong, communist country is the best kind of country there is. A country with a thriving economy, powerful military and state-owned businesses only. A country where the leader is great, and all people of the country love their leader and their brilliant decisions which everyone knows are the best possible decisions for that country, no matter how bad they may seem. A communist government is the best kind of government there is, with a fair wage for everyone.
