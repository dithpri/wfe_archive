First and foremost, the Oatpire is focused on the procuring, exhibition of, and appreciation of the trading cards in the game. 
The Oatpire is a strictly politically neutral region, both in and out of game. Keeping in the spirit of neutrality, the Oatpire opts to officially distance itself from raiding and defending, WA voting, and foreign affairs.  
Role-Play and the like are welcome, however the region itself is not strictly roleplay, rather, it&#146;s encouraged you keep your card nations here while you go explore the outside community! Or, if your favorite part of the game are the trading cards, feel free to stay here and chat with like-minded individuals.
