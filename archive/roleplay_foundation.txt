Hey newcomer! Welcome to the [region]Roleplay Foundation[/region], the newest role-play centered region on NationStates! With your membership, this region can grow into a prosperous role-play space. But only if you allow it to, the more people that we as a community can bring in, the more features and various role-plays will happen. We currently have a basic map and basic role-play idea. Stick around and we will try and make a welcoming and fun community! The possibilities are endless!

P.S. 
You don&#39;t have to be in the WA or other origination to join, all we ask is that you be respectful to other members and have a good time.
No fascists allowed.
We also plan to have 1-16 different role-play&#39;s one day.
