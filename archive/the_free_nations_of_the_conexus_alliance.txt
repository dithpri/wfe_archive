We are The Free Nations of The Conexus Alliance. We are a young region that&amp;#39;s biggest goal is to expand the Alliance and spread liberty through the Galaxy. We are a very active RP region as well. We have been through multiple wars and have a battle hardened Military. We are ready to protect and defend Allied nations at all cost. To learn more of this Military read Arobithia&amp;#39;s Factbook on the matter. We reside on multiple planets of the Universe and dabble in futuristic technology, religion, all kinds of politics, and free trade.
