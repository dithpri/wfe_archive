We are a region that values strength and freedom above all, closely followed by the health and education of our citizens and our youths. we will claim this strength and prosperity through force, and we hate politics. be warned that while we will spare the innocent, the guilty and the corrupt will face mandatory public slapping, and all who we declare as unjust will be subjected to mandatory weed smoking.
This may sound like a harsh entry, but we truly value the welfare of our citizens, and only follow this route because we recognise that politics are corrupt, and only lead to the destroying of the environment and to a downfall in the personal and societal prosperity of our people.
