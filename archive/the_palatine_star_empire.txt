The Palatine Star Empire consists of all the planets ruled by the Palatine Citadel, specifically, it&amp;#39;s Emperor, Charles Napoleon VII. The Empire consists of many different races and species, all united under the common goals of exploration, colonization, expansion and universal liberty, with Citadel Space being a shining beacon of freedom, equality and brotherhood amongst people. In the Empire, all stars burn as one, as all races live as one.
