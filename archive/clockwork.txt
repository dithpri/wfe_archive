From economic powerhouses such as The Holy and Riteous Empire of Quazin the Great and The Borderlands of Drakmah, to lands of freedom such as The Free and Equal Land of Ben M and The Anarchic Sovereign Districts of Garfunclia; Clockwork is a land of diverse ideals and beliefs, and I am proud to say that all of our members are able to coexist in harmony. I know I will not be the WA Delegate for long, as I know the changes happen fast in our region, but I am satisfied with whatever length of time that I&amp;#39;m in this position I never had expected to be gifted to begin with. I know that no matter the WA Delegate, we will continue to persevere and prosper as we always have.
