Alright everyone, all is fixed and all is as it should be. The annoying communists have been removed and Quazin the Great has returned to us, the unneeded messages have been taken down, and I have been returned to power. Unlike other delegates I welcome criticism and support people expressing their opinions, I also support free market, but that&amp;#39;s something else entirely. Now that we have a nation that knows how to make money and balance a budget the region can return to a golden age of profit, cooperation, and unity. Thank you all who supported me.
