ingling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College&reg; was started in 1968 by Feld Entertainment&reg; founder Irvin Feld to preserve the ancient and honorable art of clowning. Since its inception nearly 1,300 people have received diplomas with graduates touring with The Greatest Show On Earth&reg;, performing on stage, in film and in other areas of the performing arts.

With its structured program teaching character development, athletics, physical and verbal comedy, the art of clowning has been codified with the legacy of Ringling Bros. Clown College, as is seen by the many books, videos, seminars, youth circus programs and clown-related businesses across the country - many of which have been started, staffed and inspired by proud alumni.
