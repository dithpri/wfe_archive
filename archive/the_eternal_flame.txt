The last remains of the garden of Eden, a once hopeful place full of wonderful landscapes and beautiful and unique plants. Burned forever by the nightmares of sins by humans, demons, animals, and other things. Now frozen over and covered in darkness and shadow...

A single flame lights the way... The Eternal Flame... The last light and hope of the once beautiful Eden.
