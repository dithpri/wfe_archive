Welcome to the [b]Authority&#39;s Presidium[/b], a collective of national executives and offices dedicated to running a vast corrupted dictatorship. Embracing the use of many military divisions to our own ends, the Presidium&#39;s ethos of &quot;justice&quot; has been twisted into a creed that demonizes political opponents indiscriminately together as &quot;villains&quot;. The Presidium hires or creates biologically-enhanced humans on a wide scale to enforce its rule; known as [b]Protectors[/b], many are idolised in propaganda. While most Protectors aid their local division of the Presidium in suppressing various local insurgencies against the wide power of the dictatorship, other Protectors combat rogue and destructive enhanced humans.
