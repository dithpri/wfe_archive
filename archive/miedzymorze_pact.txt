
[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region], with some friends from the [region]Osiris[/region] Sehkmet Legion, went on a trip that took them 1,500 light years from [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]home[/url] to visit the Horsehead Nebula. Their trip took them through here, leaving a mess in the WFE and flags. Sorry about that!
