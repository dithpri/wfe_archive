[b]Miedzymorze Pact[/b]
Welcome to the Miedzymorze Pact, where we are strongly anti-communist (hehe...) and anti-fascist. This is an anti-war Region, but we are still always patriotic.
[b]Flag Rules:[/b]
The flag may be based but not copied off a real-world state, territory, or city flag.
The flag must be simplistic and have 4 colors at the most.
Anyone failing to cope with these rules will be ejected and banned.
