Merithia is a land 7x large than Altori, having 7 kingdoms in all. Each kingdom has a different environment, system of government, and religion. Some might have same aspects, but not many. It is a diverse world when it comes to Merithia. 

Many don&#39;t travel outside of their own kingdom, others travel the far lands in search of riches. Things such as rare herbs, metals, diamonds, and more hide in site of the blind eye. Be careful though, many monsters and beasts lurk beyond the shadows.
