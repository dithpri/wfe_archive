A large, and lush land, resembling that of England and Ireland. Empty, unoccupied forests, mountains, and plains stretch for miles and miles, with the League of Helena being the dominant force in the region. Helena welcomes outside colonists, and heavily supports their stay, as long as they refrain from using force against their neighbors.
