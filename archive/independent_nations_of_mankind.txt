(This is the alliance from the fictional universe &amp;quot;Journey of Nations&amp;quot;)

The Independent Nations of Mankind maintains that liberty and the freedom of all peoples of the world should be held with high regard and protected at all costs. Although the large nations of the world have typically been oppressive, aggressive nations ruled by tyrants, the INM supports any sized nation as long as it adheres to the founding principles of freedom and justice for all by God&amp;#39;s kind hand.
