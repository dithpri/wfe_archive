The &amp;#39;Chola dynasty&amp;#39; (Tamil: &amp;amp;#2970;&amp;amp;#3019;&amp;amp;#2996;&amp;amp;#2992;&amp;amp;#3021;) was one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the history of southern India. The earliest datable references to this Tamil dynasty are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE left by Ashoka, of the Maurya Empire. As one of the Three Crowned Kings, the dynasty continued to govern over varying territory until the 13th century CE.
