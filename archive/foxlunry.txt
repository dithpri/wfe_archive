A gunshot rang through lands and insane laughing promptly followed. Lunry being the curious guys he was walked over to see what the hell was going on. To his surprise he saw the leader of his ragtag little Region dead on the ground with this crazy guy holding on to a gun. Obviously the guy had killed his leader to take his position. Obliviously Lunry could not allow that to stand so he talked the guys and knocked him unconscious. Then he walked back to their main city/town and told everybody what had happened. He was immediately made leader.
