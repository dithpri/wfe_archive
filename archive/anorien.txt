Known as the Land of the Sun, An&oacute;rien is wealthy and populous region in northern Gondor where Minas Anor is located. An&oacute;rien lies north and east of the White Mountains, between the Anduin, Erui, Glanh&iacute;r (river Mering) and Mouths of Entwash. It was established in S.A. 3320 by An&aacute;rion to be settled with his kinsmen and refuges from N&uacute;menor. However, some of its inhabitants are not of D&uacute;nadan stock: Foothills and forests of Ered Nimrais are home to a reclusive and primitive aboriginal people called Dr&uacute;edain
