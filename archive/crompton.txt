The Democratic Republic of Rakataka (Tax-hating, political freedom-loving nation) welcomes you to Crompton.

The Dictatorship of Yepistan hates its people, loves extremely high taxes and hates political freedoms does not welcome you to Crompton and infact advises you to &quot;piss off&quot; if you earn less than 10,000 Yeps. (R$ 15,000) Should you earn less than 10,000 Yeps, you will be seriously punished. (Most likely be executed by firing squad)

P.S. Rakataka has over 7,500,000 troops.
