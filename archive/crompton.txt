The Democratic Republic of Rakataka (Tax-hating, political freedom-loving nation) welcomes you to Crompton.

The Dictatorship of Yepistan hates its people, loves extremely high taxes and hates political freedoms does not welcome you to Crompton and infact advises you to &amp;quot;piss off&amp;quot; if you earn less than 10,000 Yeps (R$ 15,000)

P.S. Rakataka has over 7,500,000 troops.
