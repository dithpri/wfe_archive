[b]Greetings, comrades![/b]

[i]For too long have the workers been oppressed and exploited. [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], [region]Balder[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region], in our eternal benevolence, have decided to give them the means to fight back. We have taken the opportunity to seize the means of production. All who wish to join the revolution are to join our [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]headquarters[/url].[/i][hr]
[b][url=https://youtu.be/tvmC7qxtQxs]Song of the raid[/url][/b][hr]
[b]All must do their part in the revolution! Help us hold the means of production by endorsing [nation]Red Maw[/nation] and all Regional Officers! Failure to do so will result in rapid relocation to the Rejected Realms.[/b]

[b]Lone Wolves United - [i]For your protection[/i][/b]
