Hello, we are [b]Random NS Region[/b], the first F7 experiment where users create a region, however this region has been lost to history. Now all that remains is this. We had our brief time in the spotlight, and for us that is enough. [region]Forum Seven[/region] was another version of the same experiment, but it died out now.
