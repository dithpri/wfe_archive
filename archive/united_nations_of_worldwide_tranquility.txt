We allow everyone to have a say in our decisions. Our only rules are to be courteous and accept the role you are given. If you are new and considering joining, know this; the spawning regions are not a favourable region to be in due to the lack of regard to new players. Here we are trying to create a community where everyone is regarded as a valuable member. So come in and have fun!
