Welcome to our corner of the world. Our region is specifically made up of people who know each other in real life, however, we welcome all nations to join our ranks. We are mostly made up of nations with democracy-style governments.

Here are things you should probably know:
- Generally whomever has the most influence in the Region. will get a seat on the Council.
- If we don&#39;t know you in real life, you&#39;ll probably need to build trust first. Just don&#39;t try to destroy anything. We don&#39;t hate you, we just don&#39;t know you.
- The obvious things that you shouldn&#39;t say on the Internet (insulting other people for no reason, malicious trolling, etc.) are obviously not tolerated.
