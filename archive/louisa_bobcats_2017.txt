Region is designed to show you how government actions affect the Society in which you live in.  You need to update daily, and keep track of your Civil and Political Rights to make sure you are following the ideas of the type of government you created.  Any inappropriate names or language will be handled as if it occurred in the classroom with a referral to the office.  Have fun!
