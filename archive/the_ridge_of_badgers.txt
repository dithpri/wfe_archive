[b]The Ridge was created by a group of 5 people who know each other. It&#39;s ideal for casual players with joke/fictional nations. We have a short but proud history of strategic victories over our rival, Axolotlum.[/b]

[color=Darkred][i][b]History[/i]
We were founded by [nation]Cthulhus Horde[/nation] at about 7:30 Central Time on the 13th of March, 2016. The Ridge is largely a splinter region of [region]Axolotlum[/region] and [region]10000 Islands[/region].
