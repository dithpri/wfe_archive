[b]The Ridge was created by five fairly old nations as an alternative to the Axolotlum pact. Since then the region has grown as our puppets were aglomerated into it. We have a short but proud history of strategic victories over our rival, [region]Axolotlum[/region].[/b]

[color=orange][i][b]History[/i]
We were founded by [nation]Cthulhus Horde[/nation] at about 7:30 Central Time on the 13th of March, 2016. The Ridge is largely a splinter region of [region]Axolotlum[/region] and [region]10000 Islands[/region]. During a conflict with [region]Axolotlum[/region] we created our primary puppet region, the [region]League of Extraordinary SpacemanSteves[/region]. [/color]

All scrub nations of [region]CKCS8[/region] are enemies of the Ridge. A peace settlement with Axolotlum, however, is desired.
