[nation]Tiranije[/nation] has abdicated. As his successor, I am now governor of the [region]Private Tiranski Region[/region]. I will make it a better place, I [i]promise[/i]. My economy isn&#39;t doing too well, but that&#39;s my problem. I promise I will give equality and fairness to this Region, no matter how hard it is. We may be small, but we will [b]grow[/b]. Please join our region, we would all really appreciate it.

The Community of [nation]Fle Reko[/nation] will try our best to maintain peace and security throughout the region. We&#39;ll be like Switzerland. Friends with everyone, Allied with nobody. Please tell me if you know how to make an election for a WA delegate, it would be really helpful.

Thank you, your membership of this Region is [b]wonderful[/b].
