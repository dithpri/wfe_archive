[u][b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[i]Taken: 30/05/13[/i]

[color=red]Once run by Dictators and later protected by &amp;quot;Defenders&amp;quot;/Nazis, this region now serves as a living museum against hate. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[nation]Vippertooth33[/nation]&amp;#39;s vision is to see the Nazi/fascists gone from NationStates forever.
