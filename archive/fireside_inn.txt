[b]The American dream of Fireside Inn! Open since 1908.[/b]
You drive down a dirt road, glancing Grand Lake though the reasonably crowed tree wondering if, &quot;You will ever get there!&quot; Then you see it, a sign announcing, &quot;[region]FIRESIDE INN[/region], since 1908,&quot; along with the times for breakfast and diner. As you drive down the road you get a beautiful eyeful of the sparkling, clear Grand Lake, and feel an air of full on chill settling in your stomach.
