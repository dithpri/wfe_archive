Good day friends and welcome to Pandoras Box.

This region is dedicated to Roleplay, one in which everyone cooperates to make the best Story that we possibly can. It isn&#39;t about competing with each other to see who comes out on top (in fact, it was this very mindset that was one of the driving forces for this region&#39;s development). It is about collaborating and communicating with each other to make a fun and engaging story.

People looking at the region and its RMB and only seeing Walls of Text and No Discussion, keep in mind, we do a LOT of that (discussion). We just do it in another way that isn&#39;t spamming the RMB, and instead having room for our RPs.
