Good day friends and welcome to Pandoras Box.

This region is dedicated to Roleplay, one in which everyone cooperates to make the best Story that we possibly can. It isn&#39;t about competing with each other to see who comes out on top (in fact, it was this very mindset that was one of the driving forces for this region&#39;s development). It is about collaborating and communicating with each other to make a fun and engaging story.

Of course, the region is still in its early developments, and could be considered to be in its Beta Development Phase.
