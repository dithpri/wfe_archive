Greater Anvil is a large geographical region in the central European plains. The only nation of note in the region to date is Central Anvil which occupies the most habitable areas within Greater Anvil. There are rolling hills, sweeping grasslands, wide but shallow rivers and steppes to be found in Greater Anvil with limited access to Trout fishing opportunities. Greater Anvil is a largely under-developed but growing region. Nations are welcome to set claim to any piece of Greater Anvil but must respect the authority of Central Anvil in administering for the region at large.
