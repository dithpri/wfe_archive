The Indian Film Industry is a fragrant region in southern Asian best known for its borderline obsessive cultural focus on the consistent output of incomprehensible musicals and movies, which are generally full of catchy sitar riffs, arranged marriages gone wrong, and Godzilla-esque monsters based on mythical beings from the Vedas. But also notable are (a) its hot climate known to cause instantaneous perspiration, (b) its righteous monsoons, (c) its prominent philosophy industry (entry to which requires a beard or dreadlocks), and (d) its flatbreads of both the leavened and unleavened varieties, which are healthy sources of carbohydrates, commonly served with a variety of condiments, ranging from chutney to hummus.
