[b]Welcome to Greater Brutesia[/b]

All nations in this region are claimed by [nation]Brutesia[/nation], but the claims are not taken seriously and the region name is mostly tongue-in-cheek. 

This region is meant as a refuge for nations to answer issues in peace, free from recruitment telegrams and WA campaigns. If issues are all you care about, this is the region for you. Nations are allowed as many puppets as they like and different issue-answering &quot;gimmicks&quot; (e.g issues answered by RNG, emphasizing defense forces and nudity etc.) are encouraged. Don&#39;t expect any RP, extensive regional government or community.
