     Project Have Blue was the code name for Lockheed&#39;s secret demonstrator aircraft, developed in the 1970s, to prove the feasibility of stealth technology. The highly classified program, developed by the Skunk Works division, resulted in a faceted, radar-evading aircraft designed to penetrate enemy airspace undetected. Although both prototypes were lost in accidents, the program successfully validated the foundational concepts of stealth. The valuable data gathered from Have Blue directly led to the development of the F-117 Nighthawk, the world&#39;s first operational stealth aircraft
