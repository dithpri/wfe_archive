A silly region of alien science, magic - and yes, silliness
Of transformation internal and external.
One side of a coin, or quite possibly a cube, of worlds.
And a reminder that good can triumph when we stand together and refuse to give in.

(Also, inspired by the webcomic El Goonish Shive. Go check it out! )

(This region is not and shall not be connected to Moperville North until and unless the raiders get kicked out for good.)
