The Senate and People&#146;s Democratic Republician Coalition aims to improve the civil rights of the masses across the world through political, and (if nessasary) military dialogue. Taking its name from the SPQR (not spiders), SPDR will except most ideologies, excluding only those with genocidal attitudes. Any further questions or requests will be handled by the SPDR Representative of member state Novi Serbyzantus.
