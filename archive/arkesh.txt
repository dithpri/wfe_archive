Arkesh is a somewhat arid region isolated from the rest of the world by steep mountains and large oceans. This isolation has yielded a unique and strange cultural mix of the original pioneers who colonized this region centuries ago and the subsequent migrants who came later. The incredible isolation factor has protected Arkesh from foreign influence thus enabling developing nations within this remarkable region to go about their business in peace, safe from warmongering nations from outside Arkesh.
