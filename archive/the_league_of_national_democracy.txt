The League of National Democracy is the world&amp;#39;s first (or in this case Nation States&amp;#39;s first) reboot of American president Woodrow Wilson&amp;#39;s dream for world peace through the League of Nations. Although the League of Nations was a precursor to the UN, it was the intended organization. Anyway, this region has lush forests, high flying Bald Eagles, and will soon a strong organization for new nations and nations that want a change. The United National Federation will instill its beliefs into this organization of democracy, liberty, resolution, and will be a part of the WA.
