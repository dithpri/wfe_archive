This conglomerate was created after the dreadful Battle of plumbers, where the beloved, short, Italian plumbers with mustaches bravely mounted their multi-colored dinosaurs and rode to face the great turtle-shelled beastie. At the end of the battle, the plumbers took out the bridge, dropping both them and the monster into it. We still weep for their lost lives, but thankfully they found 1UP potions along the way, so it wasnt that big of a deal.
