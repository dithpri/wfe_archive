Welcome to The Alliance of Homework! Talk and be social! Make new friends and have a good time! Feel free to join in region-wide role-play! Also if you have any questions, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to ask! We do have a few rules (I know, disappointing right?). First, Please no swearing! Second, have a good time (That one isn&amp;#39;t so bad)!
