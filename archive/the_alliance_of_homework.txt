Since there is a lack in morales and knowing when a joke is funny or not(cough)(cough) self. But this seems to be spreading. Here are the rules:

NO making fun of people, joke or no joke it isn&amp;#39;t fun.

NO swearing or stuff like that.

Um, NO threatening ya that&amp;#39;s good.

hmm, if any of you have a dispute, um, don&amp;#39;t make it too serious? or something. I am up for trying to settle it

Three strike rule warning, warning, ejecting, and two more acts after that gets you banned.
