[i][b]Behold the Alliance of Capitalist Economies (ACE)![/b][/i]

ACE was established by [region]The Free States[/region] during 2016 to unite the capitalist regions and organizations of NationStates. The project was spurred by prolonged effort from the militant left to harm capitalist regions. The Alliance&#39;s structure was inspired by the historical NationStates organization [region]ACCEL[/region]. 

ACE will be governed by a legislature made up of representatives from each of the member regions. The executive is currently the Interim Secretary-General of the Alliance of Capitalist Economies: [b][nation=short]The Gipper[/nation][/b] of [region]The Free States[/region].
