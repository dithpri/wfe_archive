Let it be known that it was here, on July 20th, 2014, that the gallant Assassins of [B][region]Sicarius[/region][/B] made their first refounding intercept. In June 2014, [B]less than 30 days ago, Tofuline was a home for more than 180 nations[/B], and today it was seized from the hands of the naive natives by the gallant Assassins of [B][region]Sicarius[/region][/B].
