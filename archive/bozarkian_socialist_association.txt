This regional faction is formed by separation from the injuncted frontier known as Bozarkia, due to a shift in ideological differences within the latter region. It specifically caters to the socialist model of economy and governance, in which the state controls all policies along with government. The BSA encourages its member nations to adopt a socialist model in order to achieve ethical income equality, defense growth, rapid industrialization and progress in education and healthcare.
