You will never be in a region like this again. It&#146;s brilliant. Fact.

[i]Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!
It isn&#39;t fit for humans now, 
There isn&#39;t grass to graze a cow. 
Swarm over, Death!

Come, bombs and blow to smithereens
Those air -conditioned, bright canteens, 
Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans, 
Tinned minds, tinned breath.[/i]
