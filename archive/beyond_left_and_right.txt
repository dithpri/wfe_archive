A region for nations rejecting the left-right paradigm, recognizing its only real purpose is to entrap the people within monolithic dogmas, to prevent them from collaborating on a better future for all.

Those most open to this new way of thinking may be; Populists, Nationalists, Social Nationalists, Religious Socialists, Conservative Socialists, Distributists, Direct Democrats, Radical Centrists, Constitutionalists, Civic Nationalists, State Capitalists, National Liberals, Third Positionists, Fourth Theorists, Integralists, National Syndicalists, National Anarchists, Agrarianists, Georgists, Mutualists, Agorists, Social Libertarians, etc.

We respect a nation&#39;s ability to determine its own destiny, free from outside influence.
