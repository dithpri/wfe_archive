[b][i]Welcome to Bloodcairn Depths, heroes![/b][/i]

This treacherous dungeon is your third stop on your journeys with [nation=short]Amber the Far Seeker[/nation] following [nation=short]Brun Oakbreaker[/nation]&#39;s defeat at the hands of some within your party in a test of strength. Unbeknownst to Brun and the Bear Clan&#39;s Elder Council, [nation=short]Sargon the Death Teller[/nation] had already established himself deep within this dark place long before Brun was sent to guard its entrance.

Sargon is a wicked sorcerer from the Rat Clan who&#39;s come here to perform a dark ritual to summon a demon known as a Bane. These horrifying bird-like creatures are born of the Rot and once summoned, they stalk the night and terrorize the land. Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points here will drive him away and claim the region!
