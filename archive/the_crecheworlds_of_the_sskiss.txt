Originating on Earth some 125 million years BP, the Sskiss are an ancient race that are actually composed of at least 3000 distinct species. All of which possess, the same basic morphology. Expansionists by nature and necessity, they have already colonized a large number of worlds within a few thousand systems, including their home system. The bulk of the Sskiss Creche worlds occupies and is scattered within the Orion arm and is centered at roughly 4000 light years antispinward from the Sol system and slightly to the galactic north. The remainder of the Sskiss crecheworlds reside within the Sagittarius and Perseus galactic arms. Most Sskiss worlds were terraformed eons ago from formally carbon dioxide rich primordial worlds.
