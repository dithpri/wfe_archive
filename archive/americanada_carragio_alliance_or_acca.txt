Jointly founded by The United States of Ameri-Canada and Carragio. A fledgling region, but with a lot of experience behind the founders. We don&amp;#39;t require any real unity, just a willingness to join! New nations have nothing to fear and much to gain. Join, and this region will be taken seriously by massive regions. We also welcome nations that have a bone to pick with another nation, region, or organization. We stand together. Anti-Black Riders!

We are now at war with the Black Riders.

Commander In Chief: Carradgio
