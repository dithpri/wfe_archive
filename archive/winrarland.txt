[b][color=purple]WinrarLand[/color][/b] is a lush land full of opportunity. There are few rules and regulations here. All nations are welcome.
[hr][b][color=red]Rules[/color][/b]

1. Do not recruit unless you&amp;#39;re a recruiter.
2. WA Members, endorse our current delegate, [nation]EpicPwnageLand[/nation].
3. [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI]Don&amp;#39;t be a dick.[/url]

If you follow these 3 simple rules, the [color=purple]flying spaghetti monster[/color] will stay on good terms with you. And you won&amp;#39;t get blasted by flying poptart cats farting rainbows.
