Arising from the dead...Kentonia lives! A collection of kingdoms, queendoms, and republics...this land is probably not the land for you or me. Dictators and democrats are welcome, though they usually fight a lot. We all share some borders, but we don&#39;t agree on anything. Librarians turned world leaders...what&#39;s the worst that could happen? Nuclear war, promises of genocide, and threats of aggression. Who ever would have guessed that a group of really intelligent people could be so stupid?
