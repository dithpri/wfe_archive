Welcome to Triangulum, a place for all futuristic space-nations to hang out, no matter who you are. Triangulum contains heaps of land variation, from frozen, icy and barren worlds to lush, peaceful and paradise-like worlds.

There are no restrictions based on play style, World Assembly or anything else of the sort. If you are being a nuisance, you will banned on sight. Being a nuisance includes using this region as base to raid from. Raiders also coming here to mess stuff up can go a crawl back to where they came from!

[b][colour=red]This is for fun. Don&#39;t spam our TG or RMB with recruitment requests/regional merge offers. It will be reported.[/colour][/b]
