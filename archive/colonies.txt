This region is a haven for Nations of all political systems. If you just want a space on a map, and someplace to reside without the burden of feeling required to join in on regional activities, then this is the place for you! We can also offer a map location for nations that RP and need a map, but don&amp;#39;t have one. We do prefer that you reside here, however. Just ask and we can find a spot for you. To get a spot, TG the Delegate with your request.
