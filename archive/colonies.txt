[color=#139dc6][B]This region provides a geographic home for colonies, puppets nations, and any nation seeking someplace to reside without the burden of feeling required to join in on regional activities. We can also offer a map location for nations that RP and need a map, but don&#39;t have one. We do prefer that you reside here, however. Just ask and we can find a place for you! To get a spot, telegram the Founder with your request.[/B][/color]
