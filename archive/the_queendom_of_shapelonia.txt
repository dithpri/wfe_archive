The Queendom of Shapelonia is a small, genial nation, notable for its state-planned economy, complete lack of prisons, and stringent health and safety legislation. The compassionate, democratic population of 29 million Shapelonians are fiercely patriotic and enjoy great social equality; they tend to view other, more capitalist countries as somewhat immoral and corrupt.
Shapelonia&#39;s national animal is the mouse, which frolics freely in the nation&#39;s many lush forests.
