[b]Omg, hi!

Your friends in [region]The Black Hawks[/region] thought they would pop in for a midnight snack, so they raided your pantry and refrigerator looking for something good to eat. Unfortunately, having found that your kitchen was totally empty, they decide to raid your region instead :(

If you too would like to go out looking for a midnight snack, then [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc][color=red]COME JOIN US![/color][/url]
