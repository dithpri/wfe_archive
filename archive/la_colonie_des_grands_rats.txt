What&#39;s with these homies, dissing my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?
Woo-hoo
But you know I&#39;m yours
Woo-hoo
And I know you&#39;re mine
Woo-hoo
(And that&#39;s for all time)
Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you&#39;re Mary Tyler Moore
I don&#39;t care what they say about us anyway
I don&#39;t care about that
Don&#39;t you ever fear, I&#39;m always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian
Woo-hoo
And you know I&#39;m yours
Woo-hoo
And I know you&#39;re mine
Woo-hoo
(And that&#39;s for all time)
Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you&#39;re Mary Tyler Moore
I don&#39;t care what they say about us anyway
I don&#39;t care about that
I don&#39;t care about that
