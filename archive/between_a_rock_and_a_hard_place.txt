This region exists outside of the confines of euclidian space, completely contained in the space between a boulder on the side of Serra da Mocidade, Brazil and a bar of tungsten carbide stock in a warehouse in Shenzhen, China. The countries inhabiting this region range between psychotic dictatorships and psychotic anarchistic hellscapes. Come visit in the spring, when the antelopes can be seen turning inside out as they shed their internal organs.
