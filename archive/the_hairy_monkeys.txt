In the black of night we came
to beat them at their own game.
We tried to warn them
That this day would come
but all they did was twiddle their thumbs.
No one can blame us,
we tried our best
but as [b]raider bunnies[/b] we can only be 
so compassionate.
We stormed their fort
We pillaged their village.
There&#39;s not much here in way of value,
So we won&#39;t revisit.
Have a beautiful day
and a blissful night.
Us [b]raider bunnies[/b] here
will tuck you in tight.

Much love,
