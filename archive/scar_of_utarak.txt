The Scar of Utarak is a war torn zone that lies between two former warring countries. Several NationStates have been found among the ruins here. The winters are harsh but those who survive are blessed with mild summers and a long growing season for food. Occasional bombardment from artillery and weapon testing sometimes claims the lives of a town or city but the countries will live on.
