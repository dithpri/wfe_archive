[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region appears to have been a region against the moderators of NationStates. The moderators are actually not corrupt for the most part, it would seem, all my dealings with them have been firm but fair in nature, never abrasive and never hostile. For some reason, the goody two-shoes [region]The Wooloo Pact[/region] established embassies with these people. What a shame.
