The Greater Ethynea region was formed by original peoples in the mid-12th century. The original people had extensive skills in agriculture, architecture and cooking and made Ethynea a large and blessed piece of land.

Until, in 1522, foreign people with huge ships and golden cannons docked on the coast of Ethynea and took over the entire territory. The deposed chief governor ends up signing a pact that makes the original Ethyne people free and common people like anyone else.
