Hello, I accidentally allowed this to CTE

[hr]
[b]History[/b]

This region was founded back in, hmm, 2017 I believe, it&#39;s been a while.
Founded by a group of nerdy school kids who have now scattered upon the four winds, never to reunite (probably).
I [nation]Of Middle Earth[/nation] am probably the only one still active on NS.
The region has ebbed in active nations, until it was no more, so now I am the only survivor.

I will continue to maintain&quot; this region as a memorial to my former friends.
