Welcome to Janevski Union where you have a say in where we head for, what our liberties are, what we will do for ourselves and others. We have foreign affairs in real life where you can also help. (we use real paper letters). If you do not hear from me thats alright I&#39;m just away. We stand for Roe, social democracy, social freedom, healthcare coverage being a privilege, along with dental insurance and etc. Uh also um, freedom to however you view you view your opinions.
