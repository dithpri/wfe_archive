Welcome to [b]The Europeian Capital District[/b]! TECD is home to the formerly oppressed minority of Europeian patriots who seized the Europeian capital in a violent protest against their totalitarian government. Helicopters are available to any Europeian refugees seeking escape from the surrounding countryside still under the control of Europeia&amp;#39;s cruel dictator.
