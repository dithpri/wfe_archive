From the ashes of the [region]Zaklenite Confederation[/region] rises a new, fairer land. The nations of the old Confederation have dissolved their somewhat forced diplomatic ties, and formed them anew, stronger, and more willingly, than before. 

Behold, the Founders of this region:

[nation=short]Zaklen[/nation], [nation=short]Amyrintha[/nation], [nation=short]Gotha[/nation], and [nation=short]Base1[/nation].

Regional Tribunal:
[nation=short]Amyrintha[/nation], ???, and ???.

Delegate:
[nation=short]Zaklen[/nation] [b]Term Ends on January 16th[/b]
