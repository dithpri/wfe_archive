[b]The Ocean Republic of Sonindia[/b]
19th April 2018 - 14th December 2023
[hr]The Ocean Republic of Sonindia is no longer active, and the government has ceased functioning. On behalf of the region, we&#39;d like to thank you all for your participation throughout the years!
We hope that wherever you may go next in life, you continue to hold the memories you&#39;ve made here dear - the good, the bad and the downright bizarre.

Sonindia rose from the ashes of a fallen power, and maybe someday, that cycle will repeat once again...
...but for now, thank you and goodnight!
