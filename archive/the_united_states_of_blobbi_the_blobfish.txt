We, as a Union, come as strong and not opposed by anyone. We promote world peace, along with the scientific advancement for AI.

As a nation, I, myself, has disagreed with scientists claiming our Holy Animal of the Blobfish is the ugliest creature alive. That is not ok. The scientists who said that are our only rivals. I hope you enjoy being in this Union, and Long Live the Blobfish!
