The First Entente is a region based not on tyrannical oppression, persecution and dictatorships but a calm, peaceful and stable environment. Founded in June 2018, we are an oasis in the desert,  a salvaged land, a break from oppression,  we are the First Entente. We exist for a reason. For peace and for stability. And whether you are to believe, or not, join us. We will not let you down.
