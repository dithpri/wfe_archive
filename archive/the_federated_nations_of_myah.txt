After the Great Myahkazstanian war of 2014, the glorious FNM was born. These nations agreed to the provided armistice developed by the glorious Authoritative Union of Triskovakastan. All nations within the FNM have agreed to a ceasefire, but are prepared to defend themselves at any time in case of a crisis with a limited military. Besides Triskovakastan and Xelastan, of course. Those who reside in the FNM must submit to Triskovakastan and Xelastan as omnipotent powers in the region. The FNM&amp;#39;s goal is to end all conflicts in the Myah region, provide safety for all inside and outside of Myah, and build up the everlasting powers of Xelastan and Triskovakastan.

For His Hue and Mighty Overseer and For the Betterment of Xelastan,
Glory to the FNM.
