Recently, the CDSP appears to have been acting unusually friendly, causing some critics to suspect that the cold people of the Provinces are plotting something treacherous. Trade deals have been put forward, as well as offers of weapons sales. As a side note, the Mammoth species population in the Veshivoslav mountains has hit an all-time high, as it&amp;#39;s main predator, Saber Tooth Tigers have been driven to extinction by Mammoth Herders seeking to protect their cattle.[/i]
