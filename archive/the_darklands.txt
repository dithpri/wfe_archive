The Coalition has been expanded to include the nations of Kaligula and Solgardt, with China under talks for potential inclusion. Currently, the two newest members are in a transitional period, with Coalition facilities being established within their borders. These include orbital-capable launch points, military bases, and automated foundries. Not only that, but each has established their own versions of Secondary Alert, with the official reason being given as training exercises in the North Entas Ocean and Ironmist Sea.[/i]
