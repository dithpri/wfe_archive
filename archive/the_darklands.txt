Communism returns to Russia! After struggle and inflation, Kuryak Poletski is the new Soviet Head of State. Comrade Poletski has promised to fix the Soviet economy in five years. Critics call his goal &amp;quot;unrealistic&amp;quot;. As his first move, Comrade Poletski kicks international media and banking out of the USSR. While this move has been supported by those inside Russia the outside world now has little to no clue on what happens inside Russia other then what the government says.[/i]
