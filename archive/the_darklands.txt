Poletski starts a public works program and continues to build up his popularity. The DSP has given Russia 10,000 tonnes of gold which has been used to back the &amp;quot;reissued&amp;quot; Ruble. This transaction has also given Russia the largest single gold reserve in the Darklands. After the transaction international banking has been welcomed back to Russia. Aid has resumed and radiation cleanup efforts begin. The CDSP is now seeing a large recession due to the sudden loss of so much of its collateral.[/i]
