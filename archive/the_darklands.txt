A beacon of peaceful light is showing in the post-war world of the Darklands. The nations of the world plan on coming together in Kauvara for a hockey tournament, as a show of unity in the most ethnically-diverse nation in the world. The nations are currently deciding which city should host the tournament, as each has historic affinity with a respective nation. Some fears circulate that the city of Fyrto or Aloriya may be selected, but Kauvara will, as is its democratic nature, follow through on whatever might be chosen.[/i]
