[b][color=blue]Welcome to Waterbana!!!![/color][/b]
[color=green]Waterbana is an archipelago and currently a (private) fledgeling region containing four fledgeling nations. Each nation encompasses a particular biome that houses a beloved (and dangerous) animal.[/color]
[color=orange]Every nation in Waterbana is a great place to visit! Frolic at our beaches, get lost in our forests, wear at least 27 coats in our icy corner, and walk on our colorful clouds in our skies.[/color]
