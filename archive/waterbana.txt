[b][color=blue]Welcome to Waterbana!!!![/color][/b]
[color=green]Waterbana is an archipelago and currently a (private) fledgeling region containing five fledgeling nations. Four nations encompass a particular biome that house a beloved (and potentially dangerous) animal. The fifth holds a rich and diverse culture of magic, where purity is highly represented.[/color]
[color=magenta]Every nation in Waterbana is a great place to visit! Frolic at our beaches, get lost in our forests, wear at least 27 coats in our icy corner, walk on our colorful clouds in our skies, and explore the magic of Luruar.[/color]
