To preserve the liberty of one, liberty must be allowed for all. In order for a nation to consider itself sovereign, in it&amp;#39;s own right, it must recognize the sovereignty of all others. If a nation believes that it retains the authority to govern it&amp;#39;s people, it must acknowledge that same authority is granted to others to govern their peoples.

Welcome to Neipas Omoh, where all are welcome. Regardless if you&amp;#39;re a communist dictatorship that controls all things in your borders, or a democratic republic where your populace is fun and fancy free, you shall find friends in Neipas Omoh.
