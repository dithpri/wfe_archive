The grand entity of Corpulex (formerly Corpulexia, shortened version: CX). CX wishes to make peace with the nations who believe in the greater good (and/or LOTR) and conspires against nations who worship Satan (and/or hates cats). Kickstarter (known more commonly as ZexWy) is the prime nation who has founded CX, and is a vast nation, abundant with almost everything. Chihuahas, timber, nuclear missiles, clay... anything!
