Tofuline&amp;#39;s [B]first[/B] official backup for a scenario like Tofu leaving, becoming DOS or DEAT&amp;#39;ed. If he is DEAT&amp;#39;ed, this will be pretty much a waiting room until he returns and a new Tofuline is established. 

We have 2 leaders, [nation]Blekksprutia[/nation] and [nation]United Regions of Verona[/nation]. They are titled Refugee Leaders as for a backup, we are refugee&amp;#39;s, and so the title Refugee Leader is born. If this is to become a permanent region, titles will change to &amp;quot;Leader&amp;quot; and for the WA Delegate slot we shall have elections. If we are invaded, WA access will be revoked and the region will become locked in order to rid the invaders.
