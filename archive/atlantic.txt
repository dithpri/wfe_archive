Originally founded in early 2003, Atlantic was the birthplace and home of the Atlantic Central Command and Atlantic Alliance. Although those organizations no longer exist, Atlantic remains as a monument and a region open for anyone who wishes to settle here. Atlantic is not currently involved in global politics, and has no intention to abandon its relationships with any current allies, regardless of any perceived wrongdoing by individuals within an alliance government. [b]Any propaganda posts against Atlantic or any regions with active embassies will result in an immediate ejection and/or ban.[/b]
