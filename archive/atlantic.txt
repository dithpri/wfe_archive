Originally founded in early 2003, Atlantic was the birthplace and home of the Atlantic Central Command and Atlantic Alliance. Although those organizations no longer exist, Atlantic remains as a monument and a region open for anyone who wishes to settle here. Nations wishing to become citizens may apply on the Discord after one week of residency either here or in [region=The Atlantic].
