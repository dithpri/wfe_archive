[b]History:[/b] Originally founded on March 16, 2003 by [nation=Nazifaz], Atlantic is the birthplace and home of the Atlantic Central Command and Atlantic Alliance. Though long dormant, the ACC has risen once more and will resume its rightful place as a world leader in regional politics. Past members and conquests will of course be returned when the time is right. Potential members and allies should find us on [url=https://discord.gg/NHqt3w8]Discord[/url].
