Atlantic is ready to begin a new era!   Our control center is secure, and the borders are open once again.

We would like to thank our friends from TWPAF, The Pacific Revolutionary Guard, and One Big Island for their assistance in the recent operation to secure our borders.

Nations who would like to participate in discussions regarding the future of Atlantic, please sign up on the Regional Forum and join the discussion!
