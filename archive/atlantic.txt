Originally founded in early 2003, Atlantic has been home to the now-legendary Atlantic Central Command and Atlantic Alliance.  Although the region no longer enjoys the popularity of the past, activity is on the rise again.  We are currently in the process of forming a new government that will lead our region into the future.  Nations who would like to participate in this new government should apply on the forums.   Leadership positions are currently open!

We would like to thank our friends from TWPAF, The Pacific Revolutionary Guard, and One Big Island for their assistance in the recent operation to secure our borders.
