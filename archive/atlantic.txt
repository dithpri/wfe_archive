Originally founded in early 2003, Atlantic was the birthplace and home of the Atlantic Central Command and Atlantic Alliance. Following our refounding and restructuring, we currently have government positions open to citizens. Nations who would like to participate in the regional government should apply on the [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/NSAtlantic]Regional Forum[/url]. We are looking for members to help rebuild and revitalize our great region.
