Originally founded in early 2003, Atlantic has been home to the now-legendary Atlantic Central Command and Atlantic Alliance. We are currently in the process of filling government positions and establishing operations.  Nations who would like to participate in the regional government should apply on the forums.  

We would like to thank our friends from TWPAF, The Pacific Revolutionary Guard, and One Big Island for their assistance in the recent operation to secure our borders.
