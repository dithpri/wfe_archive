A place for silence. A place for puppets. People don&#39;t come here for the stirring conversation.

Pull up a rocking chair and stare at the void.

&quot;Far away from the bustling noise
At Cosmos&#39; edge sat a quiet cottage
Where the evenings were lit up with lamps.
Lonely on the precipice it stood, touching the horizon.
When quiet souls inhabited the place
Humor shone brighter than electric lights.
There was abundance of kinship to light up the world;
The cottage was a shrine where puppets resided.
There was less embellishments
But the grandeur of the souls there shone through.
It was a humbling experience for any visitor to see -
Amazed by the rich simplicity
With which it welcomed the weary traveler.&quot; - [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=17831116]Ratels[/url]
