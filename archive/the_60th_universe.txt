welcome to the 60th universe. this is a universe controlled by the samuelopalian empire. all nations shall be referd to as &amp;#39;systems&amp;#39; but they need permission from the empire to enter. we are democratic and respect your opinion.
the guards are the Royal Guards (that is why they are not democratic) and the main soldiers (work that out for yourself :P)
