We are a democratic, industrial region that supports LGBTQ, and will ban anyone who says anything homophobic. 

If you have a problem with a member, take it up with the founder. 

If you are a WA member, endorse all others in the region. 

If you would like support in a WA proposal, don&#39;t hesitate to ask. 

We don&#39;t care if you have been banned from another region, we&#39;ll still accept you if you follow the rules!
