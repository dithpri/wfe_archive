Visegrad is a region based on a careful balance of democratic and autocratic principles. This balance, can be summarised by the following slogan, 
&#39;The people vote, the king listens.&#39;

Visegrad welcomes all articulate and civilised nations seeking the possibility of deep political involvement in a stable setting while maximising individual potential.
