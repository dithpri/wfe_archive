Enchanted lands is a hidden realm, created by a group of very powerful mages known as &amp;quot;Creators&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s a vast flourishing land, filled with enough fertile land, lush forests and other necessary recourses for nation&amp;#39;s survival.
&amp;quot;Enchanted lands&amp;quot; is never a prison, though - it&amp;#39;s size steadily grows, leaving room for experiments and further development.
A safe heaven, protected by powerful barrier, that can be left easily and impenetratable from any harm from outside at the same time.
Founded as a new homeland for Wisdom Seekers, Enchanted Lands may accept new settlers in future...
