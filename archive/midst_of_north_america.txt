Welcome to the region the Midst of North America, where the United States of America used to be at until the second American Civil War. Feel free to join us, as we are a democratic democracy seeking peace, maximum civil and political rights, excellent economy, excellent ideas, and most importantly, freedom.

**Side note: Alaska and Hawaii are apart of this region, due to the fact that those are states of the People&amp;#39;s Republic of the Democratic States of America (formerly the Republic of the United States of America).

Administration: The Democratic States of America [PRDSA]
