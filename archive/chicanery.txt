My mom called me this afternoon and instead of saying &quot;hello&quot; I said &quot;yeah&quot;.

She started cussing at me so I then said &quot;whatever happens next, it&#39;s not gonna go down the way you think it is.&quot; She interpreted that as a threat and at that point I was getting scared so I hung up and snapped my phone in two. AITA?
