[b][i]Welcome to The Singing Rocks, heroes![/b][/i]

Not far from the exit of the horrific dungeon you&#39;ve all just passed through with [nation=short]Amber the Far Seeker[/nation], this ancient stone circle is a sacred site to the Wolf Clan. [nation=short]Thane the Winter Wolf[/nation] has come here to hear the rocks&#39; tunes and be inspired by their music. However, they have remained silent despite him spending much of his time here patiently waiting.

Whichever Clan scores the most points here will energize the rocks and make them play their song for Thane, proving their innate connection to the Wyld and claiming this region in the process!
