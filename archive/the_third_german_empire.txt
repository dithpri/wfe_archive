My German fellow-countrymen and women! Party Comrades! It is, I think, something very extraordinary when a man after about 20 years can stand before his old followers, and when in doing so he has not had to make any revisions of his program during these 20 years.

Today&#39;s gathering, however, reminds us most of all of the evening which we were able to celebrate in the former hall 10 years ago.
