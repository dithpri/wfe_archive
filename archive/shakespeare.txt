If we shadows have offended, 
Think but this, and all is mended;
That you have but slumbered here
Whilst these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend;
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to &amp;#39;scape the serpent&amp;#39;s tongue,
We will make amends, ere long,
Else, the Puck a liar call.
So, goodnight unto you all!
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.
