[color=darkblue]Did you ever hear the Tragedy of UCR the wise? I thought not. It&#39;s not a story the GCRs would tell you.
It&#39;s a TNP legend. The UCR was a Dark raider org, so powerful and so wise they could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life...
They had such a knowledge of the dark side that they could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. They became so powerful...
the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
Unfortunately, they taught their apprentices everything they knew, then their apprentices killed him in his sleep.
It&#39;s ironic they could save others from tagged, but not themselves[/color]
