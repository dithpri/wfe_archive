[color=red][b]There&amp;#39;s a difference between a feminazi and a feminist.

A feminist is someone who supports womens&amp;#39; rights. Simple as that. Thinks girls in poorer countries should go to school, is opposed to those music videos that consist of like, three minutes of boob shots, etc. Equality is cool, guys. Feminism is cool.
