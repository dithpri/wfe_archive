The Templars were founded after a group of pilgrims, the Kezdinites, were ship wrecked on an island North-North Midwest of Bohaminsa.  The island was full of smelly natives.  These natives were very soon exterminated by the nation of Groomps and Butcher Hands.  The wise natives foresaw the eventual rise of the great nation of Groomps and Butcher hands, so they were not upset when they were murdered. After the island was cleared all the Kezdinites sent word home to the nephews and nieces to join them on the island in peace for ever more.
