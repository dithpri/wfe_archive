Hello! I invite you all to join [region]SkyLeague[/region]! You may be wondering why. I am Zonapia. You see, a few days ago, I forgot my password. I created Xcenanonia to get back into the game. But there was the password.....I had completely forgotten it. I tried asking, but you all were inactive. I created SkyLeague to build up an empire, and to show all of you that I am an experienced founder. Look, I replaced the flag back. How else could I do that? I am Zonapia! I restored your embassies. Please, come with me to SkyLeague. I miss all of you! I am giving up WA Delegate. If you wish to stay, then fine. But know that you will have an inactive founder.
