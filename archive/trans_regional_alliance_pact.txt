TRAP&#146;s essential purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of its members through political and military means.

POLITICAL - TRAP promotes democratic values and encourages consultation and cooperation on defence and security issues to build trust and, in the long run, prevent conflict.

MILITARY - TRAP is committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes. If diplomatic efforts fail, it has the military capacity needed to undertake crisis-management operations. These are carried out under Article 5 of the Penobrook Treaty - TRAP&#146;s founding treaty - or under a WA mandate, alone or in cooperation with other countries and international organizations.
