The United Ascendancy was a region originally founded in January of 2018, from a merger of the regions The United Nations of CASA and Uniterra. The region saw some success for nearly two years, before merging into [region]The Democratic Republic[/region]. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t a community here, but feel free to check out TDR! This region page is kept around for historical purposes.
