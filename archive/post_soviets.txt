[i]&quot;All nations who are pure blood communists and believe that civil rights are a waste of ink&quot;[/i]

Welcome to the Post Soviets, a collective of pure-blood communist nations deeply rooted in the legacy of the USSR. We proudly carry the torch of our predecessor, a beacon of ideology extinguished far too soon. Our commitment to communism is unwavering, and we consider civil rights an unnecessary distraction.

In our region, the government operates independently from the people. We&#39;ve discarded the nuisances of elections and traditional citizenship. Instead, our focus is on collective effort and dedication to the ideals that once defined the great USSR. Our unity is our strength, and we strive to embody the essence of a true communist society.
