[b]A group of hawks from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were speedily whooshing through the night sky in search of a place to hide. After landing in your region and planning their next course of action, they heard the faint noise of some footsteps. Taking a glance in the direction of the sounds, the bunch realized that their hiding spot had been found by their opponents! Quickly, the bunch yeeted a bunch of water balloons at the other team of hawks.
