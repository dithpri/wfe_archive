[u]Welcome to the USN! [/u]
We are a region that will protect small nations who feel the need to preserve their independence. We stand against the Security Council and General Assembly. We believe in social conservatism and want to protect our countries from foreign influence. We have a regularly elected government, legislature and judiciary that regualate the boards and management.
