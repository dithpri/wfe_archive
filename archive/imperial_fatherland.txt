Welcome to the Imperial Fatherland, a democratic, orderly and cultured region.

A regional map is needed, but whether it should be fictional or not will be subject to a week-long poll on the 14th of January. For a list of other important assets that will be decided upon by the region&#39;s populace, [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=754602]click here[/url].
