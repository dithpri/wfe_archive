A safe haven for the many persecuted peoples of the world, Terranova Qiche is a large, flat island surrounded by many high, rocky, smaller islands. The smaller islands are formed at the intersection of four tectonic plates by the plates pushing each other up. The effect is that the flat land of Terranova seems to be surrounded by spires.
In the center of the flat central island is a large ancient burial mound. On this burial mound is the administration of Terranova Qiche.
