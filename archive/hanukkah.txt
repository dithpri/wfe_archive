[b]Happy Hanukkah! In this holiday, we play and gamble with dreidels at the same time, choke on gold coins, light candles in a weird way, and praise our supreme leader [nation]Baigalia[/nation]- wait, what?

That&#39;s right! The Baigal Liberation Army[sup]1[/sup] has come and is here to stay! So you better put away your toys, stop the festivities, and thank the glorious Baigal people for &quot;liberating&quot; this region![/b]
