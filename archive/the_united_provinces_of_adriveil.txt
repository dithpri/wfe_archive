[b]Welcome to The United Provinces of Adriveil![/b]

By joining [b]The United Provinces of Adriveil (UPA)[/b], you are taken back in time to the 6th Century. This is when Kings ruled kingdoms and Lords governed their castles and when Knights served their countries honorably. Upon joining, you will see a link to the Adriveil map. If you do not, then you do not have NS++. You can download that [url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nationstates%2B%2B/gcgdpgjockahmkhjgcfidmlahiicmagj]here[/url]. Choose a spot on the map and claim it as your own. There are little pictures of castles and dots that indicate possible locations. Notify me of your choice!
