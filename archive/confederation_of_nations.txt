[i]&amp;quot;In Russia live Russians. Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws. If they prefer Shari &#145;a Law, then we advise them to go to those places where that&amp;#39;s the state law. Russia does not need minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell &amp;#39;discrimination&amp;#39;.
