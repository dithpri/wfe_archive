[color=Teal]We are a base for our motherland region which is [region]The NSIDC Headquarters[/region]. This is a base which will build its own militia and intelligence agency. Support to the motherland will be given when called upon, but when not called upon we are free to indulge in any military functions we choose. Please stop by and see our [b]Governor[/b] to pay your respects. A quote from the Governor, &quot;My goal for this region is to climb to glory and make our homeland the [region]The NSIDC Headquarters[/region] stronger and a better place to live!!&quot;[/color]
