Officially discovered in 1413, the islands have been uninhabitable until April 22nd, 2011 due to the over whelming danger of the the Flesh Maws. Flesh Maw are believed to have gone extinct in 2009, but it took two long years to establish a successful habitat on the main island, Litho. These islands are open for anyone, at a fee of course. The most well known and safest islands currently available for purchase are as follows: Astreno, Algol, Azure, Rook, Island 87 (this is due to the island only recently being discovered) and Pluton.
