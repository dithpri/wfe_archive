The Democratic Alliance is a fledging region devoted to peace and democracy. Any and all nations, whatever their political leaning, are welcome as long as...
1) They have peaceful intentions.
2) They respect the opinions and arguments of others.
3) They do not cause personal grief to other players, doing so will lead to expulsion.
4) They enjoy the game!
