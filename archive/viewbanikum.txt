The Viewbanikum Union is a loose military, economic and political confederation between the nation-states of Viewbankria, formed in the aftermath of the devastating Norvex wars. It was founded to maintain prosperity on the continent and intended to fend off another disastrous conflict. Engraved upon the Viewbanikum parliament building, located in New Bankstown, there is engraved a single phrase in the script of the first peoples. &#147;Aldrigen&#148;, never again.
