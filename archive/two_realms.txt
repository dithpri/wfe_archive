After the Great War, many new nations came to be. These nations developed newer and more exotic technologies than the world ever had before; one of these technologies was Teleportation. Through this technology, they discovered a world totally different from their own and came in contact with it.

During the ending years of the 4th era and the dawn years of the 5th Era of Nirn, many nations rose and fell. Wizards experimented with dangerous teleportation magic, and discovered another Universe through that.
