The Iseranian archipelago is composed of 4 islands, the largest of which has a surface area of roughly 640000 km&sup2;. the 3 smaller islands (all of which have a surface area smaller than 550 km&sup2;) are mostly uninhabited, but the second-largest one (at +-540 km&sup2;) is a prime destination for hunters due to the abundance of wildlife it supports. 
the climate of the IA is temperate and surface geological activity is low making it a very safe place to live in terms of natural disasters.
