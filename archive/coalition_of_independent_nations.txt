The founder holds power to remove the WA Delegate (President) from office if they abuse their powers or the citizens agree that they should be removed. Otherwise, they will hold office until the end of the month. The President decides who they want as Vice President.

The President and Vice President rule for 14 days before a relection campaign is mounted.

Campaigns last for a 7 day period. The citizens vote for 3 candidates who get to run against the current president. No one is required to come up with a slogan or speeches, but these may help you get elected. At day 3, citizens vote on which of the 3 goes against the president. At day 5-7 there will be a poll to which you can choose the next leader.
