The Eastern Slavic Bloc (ESB) is a collection of small, poor, but rising nations. 

All nations within the ESB must be Dictatorships, or Communist governments. 

Eastern Slavic Bloc nations are encouraged to discuss issues within their nations with fellow ESB members. Giving aid to countries or regions outside of the Eastern Slavic Bloc is prohibited without permission from ESB members.
