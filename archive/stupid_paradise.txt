[b][color=red][u]HISTORY[/u][/color][/b]
The Stupid Paradise was founded by a group of stupid 8th graders from Singlan Middle School on May 20, 2015. In an effort to get away from their teachers and other peers, they decided to dedicate the land for partying, screwing around, and being wild. The founder himself, Ginfy Demi alongside his closest friends, Kewin LuSlow and Ratt Mabara found like they should live in Lamborginis and Bugattis for the rest of their lives and play basketball in peace, offically founding Stupid Paradise.
