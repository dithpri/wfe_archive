This region is used mainly to store nations that are affiliated with the former nation of [nation]Silusthenco[/nation]&#151;which is now in the boneyard.

[b][color=fuchsia]IMPORTANT: These nations are puppets only in the sense of all being created by me. For gameplay purposes, each is fully sovereign &amp; independent of all the others, &amp; used as secondary accounts for different types of regions.[/color][/b]

Embassies welcome. An embassy to the Council is regarded &amp; treated as an embassy by extension to all former &amp; current [b][color=red]full member[/color][/b] nations plus the founder, [nation]Phirken[/nation].

Want to park a nation here? Not a problem! Send a telegram to the Curator, &amp; we&#39;ll add your nation to our roster as an [color=red][b]associate observer.[/color][/b] See our dispatches below for embassy policies, etc.
