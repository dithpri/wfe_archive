This region is used to store inactive nations that are affiliated with the former nation of [nation]Silusthenco[/nation]&#151;which is now in the boneyard.

These nations are puppets only in the sense of all being created by me. For gameplay purposes, each is fully sovereign &amp; independent of all the others, &amp; used as secondary accounts for different types of regions.

Embassies welcome. An embassy to the Council is regarded &amp; treated as an embassy by extension to all current member nations plus the founder, [nation]Phirken[/nation].
