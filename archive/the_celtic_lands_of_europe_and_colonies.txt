The Celtic Lands of Europe and Colonies is a region built on the shared heritage of the Celtic peoples, from the British Isles and Brittany to Galicia and far-flung colonies. We celebrate a common legacy of language, myth, and culture while embracing the diversity of our member nations. United by tradition and creative spirit, we welcome all who honor the Celtic past and help shape its future through diplomacy, roleplay, and community.
