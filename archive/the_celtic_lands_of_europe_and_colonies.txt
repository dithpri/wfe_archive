&quot;The Celtic Lands of Europe and Colonies&quot; refers to the geographical areas and their descendants, where Celtic languages and cultures have persisted or been established, both in Europe and through colonization. This encompasses regions in Europe where Celtic tribes once thrived, as well as areas where they later migrated, such as the British Isles, and later, colonies established in the Americas and other parts of the world by people of Celtic descent.
