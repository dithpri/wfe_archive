Whose [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]woods[/url] these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with [/color][color=#747475]snow[/color][color=#1e3d70].   

The woods are [/color][color=#000000]lovely, dark and deep[/color][color=#1e3d70],   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,   
And miles to go before I sleep.

Sleep tight little region. Maybe you&#146;ll wake up in a better, warmer place.
