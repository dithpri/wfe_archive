Hebrews 4:1-3 (NKJV) &#39;Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it. For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: &#147;So I swore in My wrath, &#145;They shall not enter My rest,&#146; &#148; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. &#39;

Matthew 11:28 (NKJV), &quot;&#39;Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&#39;&quot;
