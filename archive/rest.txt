Psalms 37:7-8 (NKJV), &quot;Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Do not fret--it only causes harm.&quot;

Matthew 11:28 (NKJV), &quot;&#39;Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&#39;&quot;
