Turn to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, whom He died in our place so that we ALL may be reconciled through faith in Him and through grace from Him, for in Jesus is life, hope, and rest, as it is written:

Matthew 11:28 (NKJV) &quot;&#39;Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&#39;&quot;, John 14:5-6 (NKJV) &#39;Thomas said to Him, &#147;Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?&#148; Jesus said to him, &#147;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.&#39;

All I do on NationStates is share the gospel of Jesus Christ to people and pray for people. Please do not hesitate to telegram me if you have any questions or prayer requests, because I&#39;d be more than happy to do so!
