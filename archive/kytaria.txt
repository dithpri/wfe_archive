Welcome to [region]Kytaria[/region], a past-tech, fantasy-tech, ancient-tech, roleplay region. We are dedicated to serious roleplay, but we can have some fun, too. Whatever you are- ancients, a fantasy kingdom, nomads, or otherwise, you&amp;#39;re always welcome here. We&amp;#39;re national sovereigntists, which means neither the World Assembly delegate nor I will impose upon anyone to follow any regional-wide laws. Make up your own laws, and follow them! 

Here, you can do what you wish. If you want a city-state of Spartan-esque dwarves, than do it! A genocidal race of orcs? You can do that, too! You&amp;#39;re free to your beliefs, your ideas.
