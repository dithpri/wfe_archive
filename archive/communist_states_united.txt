The Red Bloc is a collection of various Nations that all fly under one united banner: Communism. This international organization promotes the distribution of wealth, the destruction of the bourgeoisie, and equality for all human beings. We stand for beauty in environment. We stand for the rights for humans to do so as they will with themselves. We stand for the right of the people to elect their own leaders. We promote death to private industry. We promote the expulsion of Capitalism from modern society. FREEDOM TO THE WORKERS OF THE WORLD!
