Announcements:
The region we are planning to raid is: The Unanimous Covenant
NEW ORDERS:
Please ask everybody you know to join our region. 
We are planning a raid. To do it, first we must have a volunteer to join the target region. He must do it unsuspicously. Then he must be a member of the WA. Then other members of the WA must endorse him so he can become their delegate. That way he can be in control of the administrative powers and kick/ ban the rest of the people out and change the rules so that we be in control of the region. Any volunteers?
