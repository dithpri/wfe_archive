The frozen north with beautiful summers, the southern region full of islands and rain forests, the middle with hills, plains, deserts, you name it. Much is still unexplored and many wonders still undiscovered. 

This is a region that I, a newcomer to nationstates, have started. I plan on this to be a simple region for you to hang out in, no complicated off-site forums or discords, everyone who comes here is free to make themselves at home without any of that. We welcome and encourage a diverse amount of governments and societies. This is a new world.
