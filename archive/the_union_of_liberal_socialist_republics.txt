The Union of Liberal Socialist Republics is a testament to the shared comradeship between great socialist and communist states. The union guarantees support in the face of turmoil, and strives to eliminate the threats of capitalism, fascism. Members of the union are expected to be loyal to their comrades, have faith in the union above religion, and strive for the greater good. In turn they can expect freedom and support from fellow nations and states.
