If there were issues with people outside our region viewing the constitution, they have been resolved.
[color=red]Nations of the world, we are facing a crisis.
With the exception of [nation]the sovereign leader[/nation] and [nation]rolling stonesia[/nation], we are empty and dead. All of our other nations are dead and gone.
Due to the situation, there will no longer be need of a two party system.
We will be joint rulers of this region, and if other nations are to join, the laws will not change.
We are currently accepting applications to join. 
WE WILL NOT FALL![/color]
