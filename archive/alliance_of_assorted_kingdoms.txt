This is the Alliance founded by Lord Shiagur the 3rd. Made during a time where coffee was something new and misterious, Lord Shiagur the 3rd decided to try this new substance taking a whole 5 spoonfuls thinking that it was as weak as drinking chocolate. He was wrong. Though accounts of what actually happened that day are lost to time, we do know that he managed to complete half a kilo of paperwork and managed to sign all the forms to make an alliance, so now we are here and surprisingly the alliance works... every now and then.
