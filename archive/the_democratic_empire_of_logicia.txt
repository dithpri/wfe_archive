Welcome to The Empire of Logicia. We hope you enjoy your stay.

We love a good debate, and encourage member nations to use their debating-skills to help others make decisions. Telegrams are a great way to show other nations how stupid they are, although the regional message board makes it more satisfying. Choose whatever you will.

NOTE: When we say &amp;quot;argue&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;debate&amp;quot;, we do NOT mean bully! Being mean for the sake of being mean is just terrible and will get you banned.
