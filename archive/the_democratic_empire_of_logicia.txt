Welcome to The Empire of Logicia. We hope you enjoy your stay.

We love a good debate, and encourage member nations to use their debating-skills to help others make decisions. Telegrams are a great way to show other nations how stupid they are, although the regional message board makes it more satisfying. Choose whatever you will.
