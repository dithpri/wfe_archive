Welcome to the Kasseos.  Please make your self at home, this region is all about role playing and trying to be as realistic to the real world as possible, here you can build your nation into a power where you can compete with others, be a tin pot dictatorship, wage war, or become a peace maker.  Will you join a alliance?  Or start your own alliance in Kasseos, the choice is yours.

The choice is yours, or will your fall to a forign occupation.  It is up to you.  Please TG Gudaria (me) if you wish to join or simply join on the region land claim thread.
