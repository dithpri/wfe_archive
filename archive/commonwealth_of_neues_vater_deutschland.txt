This region encompasses all lands not geographically within the borders of the Empire of Neues Vater Deutschland. These may be colonies, territories, or lands claimed by explorers loyal to His Imperial Majesty Theodorus I. While these lands are not geographically under the gracious rule of His Imperial Majesty, they are nevertheless for all intents and purposes to be considered subjects to His rule. They are bound in all matters to pay Him due and proper obesiance, and some may be granted the privileged status of &quot;Theodocian&quot;. The governance of these various lands and territories varies as the need arises, but all governing bodies owe ultimate allegiance, fidelity, and absolute submission to the person of the Emperor.
