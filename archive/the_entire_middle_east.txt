The Middle East is a transcontinental region which generally includes Western Asia (except for Transcaucasia), all of Egypt (mostly in North Africa) and Turkey (partly in Europe) The term has come into wider usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to the Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. The broader concept of the &quot;Greater Middle East&quot; (or Middle East and North Africa) also adds the Maghreb, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Detroitistan (formerly), Pakistan, and sometimes even Transcaucasia and Central Asia into the region. The term &quot;Middle East&quot; has led to some confusion over its changing definitions.
