[i]Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, 
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&#151; 
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, 
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. 
&#147;&#146;Tis some visitor,&#148; I muttered, &#147;tapping at my chamber door&#151; 
            Only this and nothing more[/i].&quot;
