Greetings, hope you decide to join this group and enjoy the Craic, help yourself to a potato and a pint of Guinness.
You can take part in our local daily elections on everything and anything, if you want to become a member of Government there&#39;s great news. There are FREE Government spots available.
Enjoy your stay, Cill Chuillin (founder)
