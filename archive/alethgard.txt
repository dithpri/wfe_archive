Aethelgard is a terrestrial planet four times the size of Earth still with normal gravity. Humanity occupies only one charted supercontinent, &quot;The Cradle,&quot; representing a quarter of the total landmass and bordered by the unexplored &quot;Great Abyss&quot; ocean. The economy focuses on resource extraction and manufacturing, attempting to construct high-speed rail for essential continental travel, as the rest of the world remains an inaccessible frontier. (Basically, Earth got teleported to a new world, and its unexplored and there is not infastructure.)
