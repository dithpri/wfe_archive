Byzantolia is home to serious and coherent nation states governed by leaders with an interest in world-building. This region has entered the modern era, though within it don&#39;t all necessarily embrace the conventions of modernity. Nation states located in Byzantolia may be neoliberal democratic republics, feudal theocracies, Marxist-Leninist dictatorships, anarchist confederations, and everything in between. Ideological diversity is encouraged.
