Plutocratic Oligarchy is a wonderfully diverse region full of nations which conform to a strict set of corporate sponsored regulations.  Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness are of the utmost importance to the 1% of Plutocratic Oligarchy&amp;#39;s population which control all of the wealth and power of the region while the remaining 99% spend their lives with a corporate sponsored police officer&amp;#39;s boot firmly pressed against their neck and furiously working in factories, mines, oil fields, and military actions to support them.
