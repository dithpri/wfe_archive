[color=navy][b]British Columbia[/b] welcomes you.

Canada&amp;#39;s westernmost province, most mountainous region, bordered by Alaska, [region=Yukon], [region=NorthWest Territories], Alberta, Montana, [region=Idaho], [region=Washington] State, and the Pacific Ocean.
Thought to be part of the West, but is a very distinct region geographically, historically, and culturally.

The gateway to the Pacific.
