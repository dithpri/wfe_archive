This region has been freed by ARA, the Anti-Raider Alliance. An alliance founded in [region]The Eternal Order[/region] by [nation]Nagatar Karumuttu Chettiar[/nation] but eventually globalized. To join go to [region]The Eternal Order[/region] home page and follow the instructions in the dispatch. All who called this their home before [region]The Black Hawks[/region] invaded may return, and be given positions of governance, and after three days ARA will withdraw it&#39;s forces! Thank you.
Codenames of the shamed blackhawks:
Private First Class [nation]Bedetopia[/nation] (pack leader)
Sergeant [nation]Felt Karpit[/nation]
Sergeant [nation]Qonon[/nation]
