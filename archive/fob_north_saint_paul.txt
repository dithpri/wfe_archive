[color=red]Huzzah![/color] [color=blue]Huzzah![/color] [color=green]Huzzah![/color] After a long day of raiding, the [color=red]Europeian[/color] [color=blue]Republican[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color] ([color=red]E[/color][color=blue]R[/color][color=green]N[/color]) thought it would be a good idea to stop by North Saint Paul. The panda was a little slow upon entering, but who can blame him? He&amp;#39;s a panda after all. The kraken with us would have taken this short vacation, except he couldn&amp;#39;t keep a WiFi signal for more than a minute before falling into the deep ocean. Good thing we brought a Carrot along, because we do get hungry. *laughs*
