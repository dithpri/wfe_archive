An enormous amount of small and large islands on the equator! There is one continent (Actorla) and this is where metropolitan Vilania resides. Most governments are welcome. (except for tinpot dictatorships, that is.)
The environment is mostly rainforest with small deserts, lush plains, and some really oversized mountain ranges. Please keep role-playing and news reports that mention the climate to what I just said it was (unless you are talking about somewhere else).
(as I want to keep it like this, please refrain from immediately clear-cutting every palm tree sighted once you arrive)
