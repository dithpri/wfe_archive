[b][color=4f2b77]Failed Hope is bent in two places, hammered like a mace against the enemy&#146;s shield. A dull [i]crack[/i] and the blade is a third its former length. Failed Hope fades from his hand.[/color][/b]

[b][color=32224c]The shadow of a blade remains. It solidifies. The fell blade called The Reason Why has met the conditions. It terrorizes the battlefield, a true champion![/color][/b]

[b][color=bf5106]A champion is a target. Desperate soldiers fire a siege weapon at him. The Reason Why angles to deflect. But it is a sword. Not a shield.[/color][/b]

[b][color=a53a06]The broken blade does not fall to the ground. It sings. He staggers back. They all do. Unstable Stem touches the ground; they fall.[/color][/b]

[b][color=a89a59]Unstable Stem must be borne. Once it is, everyone is slain. Alone, gone.[/color][/b]
