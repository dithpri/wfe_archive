[color=green][region]The Order of the Sword[/region] has been laid to rest by The All-Mighty Tsar Tawks VerinGuard of The Empire of the Sword.[/color]
[hr][color=red]This Region is left in memorial of it&#39;s past. It is a museum of the beginnings of my, Tawks VerinGuard AKA Scott VerinGuard, career here in NationStates. I hope this region is never truly forgotten but instead remembered in our new region, where we shall start anew and live long. Thank you all for joining me on this ride, the Discords and Forums are all archived, and it is time to move on. But never forget our past![/color][hr]
