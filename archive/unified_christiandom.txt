[b]Welcome![/b]  It is our honor and privilege to welcome you to Unified Christiandom.  This is a new kind of Christian Region.  While all Christian Regions include a Daily Verse, but there is a tendency to become more focused on Gameplay than on being Christians in NationStates.  In Unified Christiandom our focus is giving glory to God and being Christian. Here in Unified Christiandom we hold and protect the pillar disciplines of the Christian Faith: Worshipping The Lord, Prayer, Scripture, and Christian Fellowship.
