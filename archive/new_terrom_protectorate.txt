After the fall of Brystozka due to riots, and unsuccessful attempts at peacekeeping in Nicotonia, a new region must be formed. This new region will be made of three of the five original nations: Frontera Salvaje, Clystonia, and Piltland. This time, however, we will open the region to the public, and allow other nations to help us in this alliance.
