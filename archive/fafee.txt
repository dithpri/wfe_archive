Fafee (nicknamed &quot;Far Away From Everything Else&quot;) is a region located just south of the outermost region of the world, right next to it&#39;s periphery.

While the countries in Fafee do conduct in foreign affairs, some more than others, the region for the most part &quot;looks after itself&quot;, resulting in a semi-isolationist foreign policy by many. Diplomatic envoys usually consist of groups of casual representatives, chosen from whoever is available at the time, and sent off in the general direction of the diplomatic mission, where they will sometimes carry out the diplomatic mission when/if they get around to it.

TL;DR: The region for casual players who don&#39;t want to read 200 telegrams a day.
