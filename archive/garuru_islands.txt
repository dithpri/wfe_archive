[b]Introduction:[/b] Hello, and welcome to The Garuru Islands!
This is a small cozy region for all my pals that decided to have a puppet here.
To get things straight, this is not a public region.
In other words, not everyone and their grandma may join.
We mainly just hang out and chill, and have the frequent Public Poll.

[b]How to Join:[/b] I, Kokonia, the founder, have puppets in other regions.
The only way to join, is for one of my puppets to send you a telegram.
It will contain a notice of acceptance and the current password.
Be mindful; these entryway telegrams are only sent to trusted friends.
Sorry, random joy, this is a place for a select few.
