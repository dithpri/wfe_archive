[b]Salve![/b]

Welcome to Imperium Rulanzum, home of the Stoic Nations.

While other regions are based upon a unifying political identity, or common race, relgion, or otherwise, the Imperium is based upon the unifying following of the Greek Philosophical school of the Stoics. The Imperium encourages debate between it&amp;#39;s member states and recognizes the full independence of the nations within to not be oppressed by any others.
