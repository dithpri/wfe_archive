The Cetan Islands are a island chain that is quite large in the south part of Titan (The World the Continent is in), Titan is 4.8x the size of Earth (How the Gravity works I simply don&#146;t know). Moving on the other hand. After a war the continent was quite broken, the West Cetan Empire along with the Eastern Cetan Republic fell. Now dear great nation, it is time for you to forge your history here now, however you may leave this great continent before your great journey start&#146;s. So to that farewell. (BTW If you want to make a map make it based off the Falklands as that was my original vision)
