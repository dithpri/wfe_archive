Welcome to the D&aacute;xlamic Soalvian Union!

The Union is not open to immigration, as it only exists for roleplay purposes within the region of Declansburg. Within the Union reside the four actual members of the Soalvian Union - New Soalvia, Buavolia, Croydomia, and Rauna, alongside the rival secular nation of Orvoria. All five nations were formed after the fracture of the State of Soantrias. (which is yet to happen, so hang tight).

To participate in this roleplay and many others, head over to Declansburg and join their Discord server!
