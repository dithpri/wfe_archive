Welcome to the D&aacute;xlamic Soalvian Union!

The Union is not open to immigration, as it only exists for roleplay purposes within the region of Declansburg. Within the Union reside the four actual members of the Soalvian Union - [nation]New Soalvia[/nation], [nation]Buavolia[/nation], [nation]Croydomia[/nation], and [nation]Rauna[/nation], alongside the rival secular nation of [nation]Orvoria[/nation]. Additionally, the three micronations of [nation]Ureva[/nation], [nation]Daovakistan[/nation], and [nation]Kovoristan[/nation] exist in the Galac&ecirc;ev Mountains. All eight nations were formed after the fracture of the State of [nation]Soantrias[/nation]. (which is yet to happen, so hang tight).

To participate in this roleplay and many others, head over to [region]Declansburg[/region] and join their Discord server!
