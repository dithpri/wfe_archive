Set in a timeline where Winston and Stalin don&#39;t make the [b]Percentages agreement[/b], the [b]Socialist Republic of Greece[/b] is a [b]satellite state[/b] of the Soviet Union and a member of the Warsaw Pact. In this universe, the Allies suffer major losses at Normandy, giving the [b]Red Army[/b] enough time to advance into the Balkans. After Greece was liberated, along with [b]many countries[/b], the Socialist Republic of Greece was proclaimed in [b]1948[/b] and remained a loyal ally of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics until its dissolution in [b]1991[/b].
The First General Secretary was [b]Rafail Baridis[/b] from 1948 to 1961, until [b]Moscow[/b] decided to replace him with hardcore Stalinist [b]Titos Xenakis[/b].
