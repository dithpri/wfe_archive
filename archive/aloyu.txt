The Aloysius Union (ALOYU) is an economic and political union or confederation of 10 member states which are located primarily in the beautiful Northern Suburbs of Sydney, with a few from the dirty Western SUburbs. The ALOYU traces its origins from the Aloysius Economic Community (AEC), formed in 1958. In the intervening years the ALOYU has grown in size by the accession of new member states, and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit.
Currently there are attempts to standardise both the currencies shared between member-states and to establish a single-market.
