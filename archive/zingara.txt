This land has been annexed by [region]Altmora[/region]. Death is preferable to communism, and death is what the degenerate Leftists of this former kingdom received at the hands of the III Chad Legion. One legionnary is more than a match for five Antifa trust fund babies. The Viceroy of [nation]Kelzin[/nation] was asked how it felt to take so many human lives. He replied, &quot;I only kill communists, so I wouldn&#39;t know.&quot;

Hail Keldros!
