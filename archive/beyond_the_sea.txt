Welcome to Beyond the Sea, a region for those with no desire to have political affiliations or to be involved with international politics. We are a peaceful realm and simply ask that you be courteous to your neighboring countries.

We may be small and wide-spread, but that allows us to maintain that image of being the region that does its own thing.

Reminder, every Friday is $5 all you can drink (top shelf) at all regional liquor establishments.

Once again, we bid you welcome to Beyond the Sea. Please enjoy your stay with us.
