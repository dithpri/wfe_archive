We are Consumerists, [i][b][u]NOT[/i][/b][/u] Capitalists. We take a Keynesian stance on economics, and we believe that corporations (when backed by the government) can benefit a society. Large corporations are too big to fail, so the government must keep them alive, and let citizens purchase their products.

So, kick back, grab a Big Mac&copy;, or get everything you need at the WalMart&#153;. 

[i]It&amp;#39;s our products that make your life easier[/i]&#153; 


Corporatists are welcome as well, as they are an ally of the Consumerists.
