My name is Fredrick Fitzgerald Fazbear. I live at 308 Freddy Fazbear&#146;s Pizza, Hurricane, Utah. 84024. To all night guard entities, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my Fazbear family now. [covers security camera momentarily] Freddy Fazbear: Chica, you are the love of my life, I hope you know that. Golden Freddy, you&#39;re my big man. There are... there are going to be some things, things that you&#39;ll come to learn about me in the next few nights. I just want you to know that, no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. End communication.
