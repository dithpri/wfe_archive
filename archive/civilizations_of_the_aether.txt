The Civilizations of The Aether(CTA) is a group of FT nations. This was created as an option for FT nations who want an active FT region that has trade[actual trade, buying technologies that have a template, things like that], threads, etcetera. I hope that we have fun and we get along, oh, and welcome to the Aether, a Pan-Galactic organization of great technological prowess.

[b]Threads/Sponsored Threads:[/b]--If you have a FT thread you want the Aether to join in, just tell me, I&amp;#39;ll look it over and add it!
