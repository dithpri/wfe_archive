Located in southern Spain, Granada played a significant role in Spanish history, as its incorporation into the Spanish crown marked a pivotal moment in the Reconquista and the consolidation of Christian rule across the peninsula. Centuries of Moorish and Spanish rule left a lasting cultural legacy in Granada, most notably exemplified by the architectural marvel of the Alhambra palace complex. [/color][/list][/list]
