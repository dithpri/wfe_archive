Earth is Planet 4032-Green-877, and is part of Universe 7. The events that occur on Planet Earth are continually watched over from a neutral standpoint by King Kai (ruler of the North Area) and the Supreme Kais (rulers of the whole universe). Flying vehicles, capsules that can shrink inanimate objects down to pocket size, robots, and other near-future science-fiction staples are commonplace on Earth. The architecture is also more advanced. The buildings are usually rounded, often employing spherical or ovoid sections held aloft by a cylindrical stem. Certain elements of magic also coexist with the advanced science.
