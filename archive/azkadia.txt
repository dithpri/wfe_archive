The term &quot;Azkadia&quot; refers to a broad region in which the ancient &quot;Azkadian Empire&quot; once held hegemony over. Many nations have claimed ownership over this title, and all nations within this region bow down to the one who&#39;s claim to the title remains undisputed. At the present, an Autocratic nation with visions of an eternal, undying Empire currently holds the title, and its reigning Emperor is considered to be a vast improvement over the tyrants and despots that preceded it. Azkadia (The Nation) has proven itself to be a decent, if not excessively moralistic leader to its own people, but the Empires ability to successfully maintain control of it&#39;s sub-regions remains to be seen.
