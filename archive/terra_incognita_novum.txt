[hr][u][b]What is Terra Incognita Novum?[/b][/u]

We are a play-by-post Nation Roleplay region set on Earth in the year [b]1990.[/b] Our philosophy is to make a casual, fun place for people who enjoy Nation Roleplay, and not something you need to check up on every day. We all have lives and this is a hobby, so our number one concern is making a roleplay region with an easy approach and quick to get involved. Terra Incognita Novum is unique in that we have no singular point of divergence or history you need to study before signing up. Just join our discord, pick some land, and get involved!
