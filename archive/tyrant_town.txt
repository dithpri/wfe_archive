Tyrant Town was a former region for Fascists and their sympathizers. Although being the tyrant leader of a nation is fun, have ever heard of an eternally lasting one? No. The people always will find a way to get their freedom and rights! Spread the message of anti-fascism! There&#39;s a reason why you don&#39;t live in a authoritarian country IRL.
