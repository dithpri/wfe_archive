This Region is essentially dead but the founder still has power over it. If any person feels like reclaiming this region for any purpose feel free. If you would like to restore it to its former glory feel free to message the original founder he will be glad to get you set up.

Any original members should head over to the Superiorem Merionem Region. See their factbook for further info.
