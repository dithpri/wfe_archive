This Region is an RP region of North America after a major SHTF situation in which the world as we knew it came to an end, that happened in 2001, the current year is 2017 and many former states have rebuilt as their own confederations, unions and republics, the unrules lands are filled with unknowns, gangs, armies, raiders, lone survivalists, unencountered governments and unknowns of all kinds...

We are a MT (MODERN TECH) region, no fantasy, no zombies, no laser guns...
We use random events, sometimes monthly and sometimes weekly to help determine RP. 
We have some very standards but the main rule right now is NO GOD MOD.
