This region was conquered by [nation]Nuevo Mexican Empire[/nation] from the communist horde then taken under the control by Kaiser [nation]Selven[/nation] and [nation]LadyMorrighan[/nation] of [region]New Reich of Bunicken[/region]. Hail the Monarchy! Never shall this region again promote the genocidal, oppressive communist regime. 

[region]New Reich of Bunicken[/region] is a Prussian themed Monarchy run by the Kaiser and Kaiserin. We have a thriving discord community and hold regular events. If you have ever dreamed of being a nobility, raising power and wealth, raising through the ranks or a Minister in the Government, perhaps find glory on the battlefield or just engage with a laid back fun community of people then stop into New Reich of Bunicken.
