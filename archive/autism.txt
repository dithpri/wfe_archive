It is our goal here, in the Region of Autism, to build a strong community of, by, and for the Autistic people and their allies on NationStates. This community is intended to serve as a force capable of promoting the rights and interests of the Autistic people and to combat negative and harmful attitudes about Autism and the Autistic people. It is also hoped that this community will serve as a forum for the Autistic people and their allies to ask and answer relevant questions, to share the struggles, successes, hopes and joys of the Autistic people and their allies, and to foster pride among the Autistic people in general.
