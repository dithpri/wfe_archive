The Region of Autism was originally founded (by [nation]Aspergeria[/nation] in September, 2013) as a community of Autistic nations and their allies. The original purpose of this region was to function both as an in-game forum for nations to discuss Autism (and other relevant topics) as well as a base of operations from which to combat negative attitudes toward Autism. After the original founder CTE&amp;#39;d, this region was protected by Port Blood and Port Autism, two nations that are no longer active. Port Blood and Port Autism jointly hold the esteemed title of &amp;quot;Eternal Protector of the Region of Autism.&amp;quot; The Region of Autism was refounded on November 29, 2014.
