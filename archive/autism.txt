At present, our region is under construction. Whether or not our region will resume its intended function as a forum for the Autistic community on NationStates has yet to be determined. Perhaps we will serve a purpose that is mostly unrelated to Autism such as being a base of operations from which anti-fascist forces can combat what Vladimir Ilyich Lenin called &amp;quot;capitalism in decay.&amp;quot; The only certainty here is that our region, with its [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=335198]fascinating history[/url] and unwritten future, is at a crossroads. In any case, have an enriching stay here in the Region of Autism should you choose to reside here.
