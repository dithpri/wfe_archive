Indr is a planet in an alternate plane of reality, nearly identical to our own. It is parallel to Earth, being populated by humans with the same fallacies and flaws we do, but with a different set of cultures and peoples. However, when it comes to humans, history repeats itself, even beyond time and space - and so countless equivalencies can be drawn between Indr and Earth.
