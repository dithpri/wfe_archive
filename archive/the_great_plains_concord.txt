Founded under the writings and doctrine of New Plainsville statesman James Monroe, and expanded upon by its government, The Great Plains Concord is a region compromised of self-governing, moral nations-states.

The goal of The Great Plains Concord, as stated in the Treaty of Teton, is to ensure the safety and conservation of the plains, mountains, valleys, and plateaus of the region from foreign adversaries threatening to destroy the region for control, profit, or otherwise. Because of the cultural, historical, and environmental significance of the region, each nation is required to incorporate preservation and conservation programs within their regions, and to encourage their citizens to visit and experience the lands for themselves.
