[color=#C90000][b][i]One eyrie night, March 22nd of 2022 year of the dread lord, an old, forgotten gate suddenly materialized in front of this region. Charging out on the pale stallion was a group of horrible demons. The demons came for one purpose: to bring Hell on Earth. This poor, unfortunate region happened to be the first in line of a long march the demons took from the gates to [region]The Devils Castle[/region]. [/b][/i]
[b]Heaven, are you watching?[/b]

This region is the very first region to be tagged by [region]The Devils Castle[/region]. Our first jump on our first raid, was our first hit.
