The Old Believers of the Holy Lands, a region characterized by the theocratic nations of which share common civil and electoral rights associated with democratic ideas. The name given to the nations that upheld these rights and open religions (i.e. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.) shall be Holy and Sovereign. We are of peaceful nations, as long as you don&amp;#39;t provoke us, much like a bee and it&amp;#39;s hive. As nations of the Old Believers of the Holy Lands, we endorse free-thinking individuals and ways to further improve the lives of everyone.
