The players are in control of every aspect of the region through a system of referenda and discussion. Our roleplaying system gives each nation unique statistics based on the territory they claim on the map, which is used to build unique and interesting nations connected to each other and their land. We try to maintain a relatively casual, social atmosphere while not sacrificing the benefits of realistic worldbuilding and responsible management.[hr][b]&amp;#128772; [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRKdSy0c-l4rVMFY6Grwn3uTSbAXjDTBJ8A2Iv1fhQha08p1QNi1FEI-e9ey8ex4C7W57e2lNqspsAu/pub]CONSTITUTION[/url] &#149; [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1325024]REGISTRY[/url] &#149; [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1325013]CITIZENSHIP[/url] &#149; [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1325048]REPOSITORY[/url][/b] &#149; [b][url=https://forms.gle/fgHykSKw2zZEoYceA]CONCERNS[/url] &amp;#128772;[/b][hr][b][color=goldenrod]Featured on March 31st, 2020.[/color][/b]
