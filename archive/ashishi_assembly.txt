Greetings, fellow leaders! Welcome to the [u]Ashishi Assembly[/u]! 

The Ashishi Assembly is a quasi-G group that serves as an economical and political alliance between a few privileged countries in this particular region. Originally consisting of fourteen members, the established Assembly would have each other&#39;s backs for the sake of interdependency and unity.
