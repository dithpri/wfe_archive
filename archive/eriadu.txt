Eriadu was the primary world in the Seswenna sector, and one of the Outer Rim&#39;s most active trade centers. It sat on the intersection of several hyperspace routes, including the Rimma Trade Route, the Hydian Way, the Lipsec Run, and the Yankirk Route.

The planet was originally located on the Eriadu Bypass until the Hydian Way was remapped to run through Eriadu (reflecting economic realities) rather than Seswenna. It was an important launch point for ships headed to the Moddell sector, such as the colony ship Free Enterprise in 130 BBY.
