[b]Quick Rules:[/b]

-[u]Reasonable claims[/u] can be placed via telegram to [nation]Pruszia[/nation]. Please note, that some nations are reserved for a socialist or a capitalist nation concept. 

-We base on real-life history until 1948. Alternate histories after that year are highly welcome.

-Beside your nation, a single minor puppet is allowed.

-Splitting your claim for more puppets is possible.

-There is no Off-Site Forum!

[i][b]Regional Mission Statement:[/b] 

Expansions should stay an exception and reasonable. Cold War and political scenarios are highly welcome! War should be always the last option and will not automatically lead to an expansion![/i]
