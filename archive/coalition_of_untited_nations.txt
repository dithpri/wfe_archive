CAN is a group of nations with different nations with different rulings (Capitalism, Communism, Presidency, Dictatorships, etc.) who stand against other invasive nations. Don&#39;t be afraid to either pretend to be someone your not (as long as it does not seriously insult someone) or play as you would.

*RP is allowed just don&#39;t clog the message board
*Nations here are generally in the space age with colonized planets. But it may change depending on the agreed timeline
*Events that happen generally affect the CUN as the Nations in here share a continuous timeline. So make good relations!
*If you have CIV 6 or HOI4 feel free to ask other players to duo or play together, they help with policies advising etc so feel free to ask around
