[b][color=darkblue]Welcome! To the twin continents of Arganorh. 

Our land is one of international cooperation and issue playing. We are comprised of two continents: Avanor in the south and Norrhan in the north. We are democratic both in roleplay and in administration: with the Arganorh Union being the roleplay government, and the Regional Directorate being the official game government of the region. Both have elections and defined roles under the Constitution of Arganorh. 

If you wish to become a citizen of Arganorh, please contact the current Executive of Arganorh. 

Thank you! And have a wondrous stay in Arganorh.[/color]
