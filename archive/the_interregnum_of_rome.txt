What if Rome was an elected monarchy, sorta?

Rome was built as a Hellenized-ish Etruscan city-state. A monarchy. So, when the Senate was created and given the power after the death of a king to choose the Interrex (a king in Rome was called a Rex) who would choose the candidate for being the next king. The Interrex would have all the powers of a king in the meantime. 

Anyways, in an alternate past, a political shift happens during one of these interregni periods. They extend the term of this Interrex position from 5 days to 2 years, and limit its powers a bit to appease the Senate for their extention. They also strip the Rex of all powers, and make Interrex a permanent position.
