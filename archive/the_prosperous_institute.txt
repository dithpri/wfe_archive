This institute was created for those states who wish to run things a little less and let the people decide their lives. We stand for free markets and freedom. Less government and more liberty. Civil Freedoms are a cornerstone of this Institute. All are free to join and all may have their say. We oppose Corporatism, Fascism, Communism, and Monarchies. Remember: The government which governs least, is the government which governs best!

Peace, Love, Prosperity
