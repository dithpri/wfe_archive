A tight confederation of several Empires, this region is extremely fierce yet culturally diverse. The variety among nations is substantial, but they also all have a fierce national identity. The region may be chock full of corrupt dictators, crazy regimes, and religious nuts, but we also have civilized societies as well. In essence, we have a lot to offer... that is if we don&#39;t claim some random religious war on you first. The social rejects of the world, these people strive on many different means of life such as gladiatorial combat and psychological warfare. Whatever the case, the leaders here are tightly bound by blood and won&#39;t ever back down to anyone else.
