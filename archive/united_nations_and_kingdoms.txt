   The U.N.K. was founded to have a region where everything was awesome. We will have monthly elections, daily topics, and more. Later, we will have a website, a constitution, and more. Also, I, the founder, will have no control. (Unless I&amp;#39;m elected). Its all up to you. So come, and join the U.N.K!
