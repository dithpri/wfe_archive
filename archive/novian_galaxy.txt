The Novian Galaxy is a place in deep space far from that of this world. We are an alliance of nations and planets who prefer to be left out of squabbles and war. We are neutral in all battles unless we are provoked. We are intergalactic peace keepers who hold several strong core values: Sovereignty, truth, justice, and creativity. If you hold any of these values, we openly welcome you. Each ruler is welcome to rule their nation as they please without intervention (within reason). The regional government is only here to be a watchful eye and to help make the community, here in the galaxy, stronger.
