The Onega Alliance is a triple pro-capitalist political alliance between [nation]Rodesie[/nation], [nation]Jijako[/nation] and [nation]Ecleia[/nation], which guarantees advanced economic cooperation, but also military cooperation, in particular for the development of armaments projects.
This cultural unification is created to radiate the power of these three countries on the international scene.
Several economic projects (not common with [region]EPEC[/region]) are already in development, while several contracts including weapons development will soon be signed by the leaders.
