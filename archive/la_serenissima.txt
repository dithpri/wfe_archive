[b][color=darkfire]Welcome to [i]La Serenissima[/i], a region based on Venice.[/color][/b]

Home to the greatest seaport in late medieval Europe and the continent&#146;s commercial and cultural link with Asia, Venice is unique environmentally, architecturally, and historically, and in its days as a republic, the city was styled [i]La Serenissima[/i] (&#147;the most serene&#148;). It remains a major Italian port in the northern Adriatic Sea and is one of the world&#146;s oldest tourist and cultural centres.
