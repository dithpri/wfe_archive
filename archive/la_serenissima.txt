Forged in the union of the dazzling Republics of Regnorum, Cossima and Mimesis, the region of La Serenissima represents the timeless Serenissine relationship. Head-quartered in the Dogue, a neutral island-city at the borders of the nations, the region is ruled by the Doges of the Dogue: Her Serenity, Madeleine of Braganza-Constantine and Her Radiancy, Hedwig of Holstein-Gottorp-Regnesse.

In La Serenissima, we rule with a gentle hand, believing in the liberal paradise and denouncing all self-serving, rightist nations as unfounded and despicable. Conservatives have no place here. Inequality has no place here. As a region, we proclaim the importance of all liberal ideals, and strive towards a Green and socialist future.
