This region has been vulnerable for more than six months now, and we&amp;#39;re going to fix that.

[b]I am Queen Linse of [nation]Linseland[/nation].[/b] My claims to the leadership of this region are that I have been here since my founding, I am indeed an ethnic Dane, and I am indeed a Queen. (After all, any region called &amp;quot;Queendom&amp;quot; aught not be led by a male.) I concede that the Queen of [nation]Cielly[/nation]&amp;#39;s claim is stronger than mine, but I&amp;#39;ve spoken with her, and she shows no interest, so that makes me the logical choice.

I will hold the delegacy of this region in Queen [nation=short]Cielly[/nation]&amp;#39;s sted as long as is necessary to lock the region and make it safe.

Thank you very much for your support and patience.
