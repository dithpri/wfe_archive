Evyet Douxs is a region in the North Eastern Hemisphere of Douxs Ascend. 

Douxs Ascend is a world extremely similar to Earth with the only major differences being the location of landmasses, species of animals, and a second sentient race called the Veyla.

Koyacyi is one of very few nations with a bi-special society. Both get along with little to no animosity, whereas other nations are comprised of one species entirely or have massive civil wars, unrest, and special infighting.

Douxs Ascend has three continents with several major islands. Evyet Douxs is one of the continents. Evyet Douxs is the only continent the Veyla have been the dominant society in.
