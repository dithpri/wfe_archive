The [b]Admiralty Islands[/b] are an archipelago group of 18 islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, to the north of New Guinea in the South Pacific Ocean. These are also sometimes called the Manus Islands, after the largest island.

These rainforest-covered islands form part of Manus Province, the smallest and least-populous province of Papua New Guinea, in its Islands Region. The total area is 810 square miles. Many of the Admiralty Islands are atolls and uninhabited. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
