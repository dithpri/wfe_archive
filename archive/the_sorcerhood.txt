The story:

&quot;Don&#39;t you just love unicorns?&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve gotta love unicorns.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t, so too bad.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t tell if unicorns invented the shish-kabob or of they just ripped it off of narwhals.&quot;

&quot;I could care less.&quot;

&quot;HA- that means you do care!&quot; *boops on nose*

&quot;Wha-- whatever. No unicorns go on the flag.&quot;

&quot;What if I put your flag on the Sorcerhood flag, too?&quot;

&quot;How are you going to do that?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; *smiles*
