Relegated to the realms of myth and legend to most, Agharta is a beautiful subterranian Region existing within the Inner Earth. Accessible from various hidden caves and cavern systems around the world, with maritime passage via concealed entrances at both Poles and subject to a worldwide High Ranking cover-up of its very existence -- the tranquil Free Lands of Agharta remain essentially untouched and unspoiled by the insanity of the aggressive and warlike surface dwelling species of humans.
