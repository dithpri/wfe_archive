[b][u][color=green]WELCOME TO THE EMERALD TIDE! I hope you enjoy your time here.[/b][/u][/color]

Hello all! I am [nation]New Mememia[/nation] and welcome! My mission with The Emerald Tide is to be very casual. I also want to promote a free speech board. Whatever your political opinions, hobbies, or general tastes are, all are welcome here. The only thing not allowed are things things banned site wide. Outside of that, anything goes!

And by anything goes, that includes the WA Delegation. No rules there! Endorse whoever you want! Or no one!

Currently, I have no plans for Regional Offices. Just me right now. Consider it my own &quot;benevolent dictatorship&quot; but I promise you will not be kicked due to wrong speech.

Passing by or dropping in, thank you for choosing The Emerald Tide!
