&#147;Rome will exist as long as the Coliseum does;
when the Coliseum falls, so will Rome;
when Rome falls, so will the world.&#148;

The Council Of United Vexilla (Vexilla being the plural form of &quot;Vexillum&quot;, a Roman banner of sorts) is a roleplay based region centered around cooperation and economic/military growth. While nations within the council are not required to be of &quot;ancient&quot; origin (names/government similar to Spartans, Persians, Egyptians, etc), it is encouraged as to foster a more tightly knit, interactive community.

If you wish, you, may request lore for the realm, which of accepted will be posted and have you credited accordingly.
