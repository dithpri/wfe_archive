Welcome to The Way!

Nations and states small and tall, The Way is for one, The Way is for all, the World Assembly is boring and dull, run by a dirty progressive cabal, we&#39;ll have us some fun with the legislative gun and give it an overhaul. 

Bippity bippity boppity boo, this is rhyme number two, come fresh without agenda or NO SOUP FOR YOU, The Way is good, The Way is wise, do not question it&#39;s authority, it will be your demise.

One, two, it&#39;s rhyme number three, the best things in life are free, so join the movement don&#39;t delay, your delegate&#39;s a maniac and wants to ban you anyway!
