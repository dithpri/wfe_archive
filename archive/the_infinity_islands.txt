The Infinity Islands are a group of islands located somewhere in the world. Exact position is still unknown to its inhabitants. The Principality of Pegie is the founder of the region, having given it its name.

Currently, there are 2 islands that have already been colonized by Pegieans, although we remain optimistic that there will be more to be found. The Prince of Pegie has dispatched explorers on a mission to discover new land.
