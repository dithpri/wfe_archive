The new region of [region]Dubtopia[/region] is now officially our new home. You [b]MUST[/b] relocate there in order to allow JustDubs Asylum to die with full honors. This is no longer up for vote due to recent invader attacks. This region will be password locked so as to deny the possibility of hostile takover. No new nations shall visit this region. Any nation still left here will be ejected one by one by the imperial army of Alpha. 

See you on the other side of the fence.
