[color=grey] SCL is a non-governmental forum and policy institute. Our goal is simple - but it&#146;s work Great. By promotion of globalization through neoliberal doctrines and the fostering of unrestricted corporate free trade among regions and states, we at Sovereign Corporate League strive toward the foundation of a new golden dawn. We connect by common interest - titans of industry, barons of banks, moguls of media, and politicians along with academics and religious leaders of all backgrounds. Together we actively promote and further our Great Work - to bring forth a common Government with common judicial law under a single centralized monetary system for all mankind.  [/color]
