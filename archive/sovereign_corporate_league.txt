Initially established shortly after the [i]Great War[/I], by a group of wealthy Arkbergenian bankers and industry tycoons; to serve as a facilitator and promoter of capitalist ideals during the [i]Comintern Crisis[/i].

Today, [I]SCL[/I] is a multinational and non-governmental organization of; industrialists, bankers, politicians, academics, corporate shareholders, and media barons - whom strive toward the common goal of a [b]privatized[/b], [b]neoliberal[/b] and [b]globalized[/b] world order.
