Welcome to the Yorktown Elites.

This region is an alliance among multiple nations with a whole variety of different forms of government. Although we here at the Yorktown Elites value glorious Fascism over any disgusting ideology, we accept any member as long as they bend their knee to the great and mighty power of Rome. May the Caesar live long and may our christian religion spread among the heathens of the world. Deus Vult, Ave Maria!
