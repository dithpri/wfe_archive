Skenmua &quot;Lake&quot; is a large, geographically isolated ocean, with the various flat Isles of Liuhcbneatt being located throughout it&#39;s southern region possessing quite unalike dimensions. The largest Isle was christened Skenmua, and provides a home to many mutually hostile and politically severed nations. On various occasions these nations have initiated border crises and infringed into the territory of their neighbors, sometimes including mass murder of civilians as retribution for the actions of their government.



Skenmua Isle&#39;s beaches are heavily mined, fortified by old ocean - facing concrete bunkers, contaminated with lead from invasions, and used as dumping grounds for military equipment which is too expensive to repair.
