Hello friends, to the conglomerate of nations known to all as the Batasun Union! We have near to no rules, so go wild! Do as you wish!

Known participants:
Welp, everyone&#39;s dead now. Region has gone from more than 50 member nations to 7 original inhabitants, with only three of which being WA members. The apocalypse will eventually claim us all. Edit: THE APOCALYPSE COMES FOR US! PREPARE YOURSELVES. I WILL ASSIGN EACH NATION A SPECIFIC TASK IN THE COMING BATTLE. IF YOU SUPPORT THE ZOMBIES, YOU [b] WILL BE KICKED! [/b] PASSWORD WILL BE ADDED SHORTLY.

Side note: I, [nation]Ixlund[/nation], run most if not all of the administration here. If you have an official matter to attend to, please refer to me.
