Welp, everyone&#39;s dead now. Region has gone from more than 50 member nations to 8, with only three of which being WA members, and 7 being original inhabitants. The apocalypse will eventually claim us all.

Side note: I, [nation]Ixlund[/nation], run most if not all of the administration here. If you have an official matter to attend to, please refer to me.
