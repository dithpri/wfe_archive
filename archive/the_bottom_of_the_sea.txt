The pirate is dragged down with his vessel,
Passing the fish as he reaches the deepest levels.
The pirate holds his breath and tries to escape,
From his water tomb but what difference will he make?
His swims and swims in the water deep and cold,
But not too far below he spots the glint of gold.
He swims and reaches a chest his own beating quick,
Inscribed: a name shared with the second pirate&#39;s flick.
