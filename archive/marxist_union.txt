This Marxist region ceased to exist when it&amp;#39;s original Founder and sole remaining nation ceased to exist. To prevent the region being refounded and held by Fascists and Nazis as a propaganda coup for them, this region has been refounded and taken into the care of [region]The Internationale[/region] as an anti-fascist and anti-Nazi protection operation.

[region]Marxist Union[/region] lives once more.
