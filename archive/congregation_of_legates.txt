The Congregation of Legates is a nation-state consisting of numerous provinces led by a series of governors, known as Legates. Each Legate has equal power to vote on matters of importance to the Congregation. The only Legate above the others is the Prime Legate, whose power is only slightly more elevated. The Prime Legate has the power to evict any province from the Congregation if he feels that it disrupts the balance of the Congregation.
