All aircraft manufacturers are welcome here.

Rules:
1. Your nation must be named after an aircraft company. It can either be a real life company (ex. Lockheed Aircraft) or a made up one (ex. Basicsimple Planes)

2. World Assembly membership is optional. Please read the NS FAQ for rules on WA membership. Remember, you can have as many nations as you want, but only ONE can be a WA member at any time!

3. Nation classification does not matter. You can be an Anarchy or Psychotic Dictatorship- I legit won&#39;t care.

4. Do not make threats towards other members. If you do, you will be booted from here. In addition, do not post anything that goes against the FAQ rules.
