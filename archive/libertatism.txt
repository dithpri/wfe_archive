[b]Our goal is equality, freedom, and peace.
Our creed is reason, justice, and knowledge.
Athos will always promote camaraderie in the anti-capitalist world;
we will always support destruction and separation in the bourgeois world.
We will not falter in our fight. We will continue this struggle set by Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, et cetra.
We will enlighten the world.
