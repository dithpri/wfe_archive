Autonomous State Treaty Organization, or ASTO for short, is dedicated to the advancement and preservation of all self identified states throughout the globe. If military action is necessary to carry out the functions of ATSO, then a coalition of member nations will send a peace keeping force to ensure the stability and continuation of said autonomous state.
