Mossad (Hebrew for &amp;quot;Institute,&amp;quot; short for &amp;quot;the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations&amp;quot;) is the greatest Nazi fighting organization to exist since the end of World War II. Thanks to Mossad, villains like Adolf Eichmann and Herberts Cukurs met justice.

There were once regions named &amp;quot;[region]Mossad[/region]&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;[region]The Mossad[/region]&amp;quot; on NationStates that were created by anti-Semites to insult the organization and belittle Jews in general. But the forces of hate failed to hold onto them. So they were refounded by a Jew who respects the organization and its legacy.
