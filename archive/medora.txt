[b]Welcome to the world of Medora, a diverse planet with ten nations across seven continents.[/b]
From the political freedoms of TerNova and the authoritarian BluCo on Tern, to Aoterra&#39;s economic protectorate, and Fricklandia&#39;s libertarian ethos, Medora is a land of contrasts. The oppressive Polski Chissian, the minimal-regulation Hoosierpolis, and the locally governed Cerealialand shape Cerealia. Ferrum hosts both the free Maheose and the strict capitalist Havoc. Finally, Medar is dominated by the socialist Empire of Evil Medora, which controls all aspects of life.
