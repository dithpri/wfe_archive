The Old Empire, what was once label as the &quot;Great North-East&quot; has long since fallen.
 
Throughout the uncountable years I have seen only the shattered remains of the Capital. 

I gathered my people and we made a pilgrimage to the Holy South, were the land is green and creatures fair. 

But the mountains still loom, and the Old Emperor&#39;s breath whispers forgotten truths. 

Now an age of Steel and Circuits the Stone still stands, if not weathered. 

The Fortress we call home the bared the scars of the past. We minded it with Hope and Lies, but it was never enough.
             - Ferdinand&#39;s, First Leader of the Cult of Hooded Rags, final spoken words.
