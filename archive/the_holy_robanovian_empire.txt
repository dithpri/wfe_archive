The Holy Robanovian Empire 
 &quot;Bleiben Sie ruhig. Travaoski lebt. Es lebe das Imperium. Der Heilige Orden war in der elftent Stunde. Es gibt viel zu tun.&quot; (German for &quot;Stay calm. Travaoski lives. Long lives the Empire. The Holy Order was in the eleventh hour. There is much to be done.&quot;)
 
Welcome to The Holy Robanovian Empire, where states can join and be a part of an (hopeful) great region! 
The General Government will not use Discoard. He prefers using the region board.
You do not need to join the WA, we support the route of all states apart of our region.
Please read the NationStates rules before posting to the board. I do not know how to show it here, so just go to the FaQ.
