[b][color=lightblue]Vandor, also known as Vandor-1 or ID 53-80, was a cold frontier planet in the Sloo sector of the galaxy&#39;s Mid Rim. Tobias Beckett and his crew had also landed on Vandor to carry out a heist on an Imperial conveyex train, in order to acquire coaxium for Dryden Vos and Crimson Dawn. They were assisted by Han Solo and Chewbacca, who had escaped Mimban on Beckett&#39;s stolen Y-45 armored transport hauler. The heist ultimately failed due to the interference of Enfys Nest&#39;s Cloud-Riders, who also attempted to steal the coaxium, leading Solo to drop the cargo in order to save the survivors of Beckett&#39;s crew.[/color][/b]
