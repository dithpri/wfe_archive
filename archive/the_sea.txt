&#147;Call me Ishmael. Some years ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.&amp;quot;
-Herman Melville, Moby Dick

&#147;The cunning waste their pains;
The wise men vex their brains;
But the simpleton, who seeks no gains,
With belly full, he wanders free
As drifting boat upon the sea.&#148;
-Cao Xueqin, The Golden Days 

&#147;When I paint, the Sea Roars
Others Splash about in the bath&#148;

I don&amp;#39;t do drugs. I am drugs.
-Salvador Dali

&#147;A true artist is not one who is inspired, but one who inspires others.&#148;
-Salvador Dal&iacute;

&#147;I am not strange. I am just not normal.&#148;
