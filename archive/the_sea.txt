&#147;Amid the seeming confusion of our mysterious world , individuals are so nicely adjusted to a system, and systems to one another and to a whole, that, by stepping aside for a moment, a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of losing his place forever.&amp;quot;
-Nathaniel Hawthorne, Wakefield

&#147;When scholars study a thing, they strive to kill it first, if it&amp;#39;s alive; then they have the parts and the&amp;#39;be lost the whole, for the link that&amp;#39;s missing was the living soul.&#148;
