[b][color=teal][i]Pearl frothed foams crest my sapphiric waves. Ephemeral and yet eternal. Acquiscent and yet irresistible. Make your firmament upon me and I will sustain you, succor you, and provide you the loving bounty of life. Abuse of me and you will know my horrific wrath of legends.[/i]-The Sea[/b][/color]
