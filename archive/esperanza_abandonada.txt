Esperanza Abandonada is an Australia-sized continent in the central Pacific Ocean. The population is largely Polynesian, strongly mixed with Chinese, Nipponese, Russian, Indian, and South American immigrants. The dominant language is Australian English, with Spanish, Hindi, and Chinese close behind.

Esperanza Abandonada acts as a shipping hub for the Pacific Rim, and the sheer profits have shaped the cultures and governments there. Whatever form the government may take, Capitalism is king.
