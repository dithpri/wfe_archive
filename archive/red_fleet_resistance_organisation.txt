[b][color=darkmagenta]Fascists, Capitalists, Conservatives, Elitists, Still we remain. Still we fight this endless battle against the dark, evil left of the world who wish to bring darkness and misery to this world. As Margaret Thatcher once said:[/b][/color] &quot;[color=blue][i]They would rather the poor be poorer, as long as the rich were less rich,[/i][/color]&quot;

[color=crimson]Now, I don&#39;t know about you, but that doesn&#39;t sound too nice. Everyone worse off. Yet we do not have to stand for these dreamers, dreaming about a world which can never happen. When communism is fully dead, we will truly be rid of a dark force on this planet. So rise, all people who wish for freedom, money and rights. Join the fight against Communism![/color]
