An election is underway to determine the new Governor of Katanar. Early polling suggests a blow out win for incumbent Interim Governor HardBass School.

First embassy requests have been put out, and have been built. (70 so far have been finished!)

Katanar has become semi-indpendent - we&#39;ll be figuring out tags shortly
