The Southern Equatorial Council (SEC) is a fledgling, friendly region, born out of a internal war and home to many great and successful nations. We welcome new recruits and are committed to being a fair, fun and innovative region, with elections to leadership roles completed using a fair and exciting system.

The Southern Equatorial Council has an executive founder, an elected president and vice president and a separately elected World Assembly Delegate. The founder uses executive powers only to safeguard the region from threat and oversee the traditional passing over of power between administrations. 

Embassy offers from other regions are greatly welcomed and will be warmly received.
