The Royal Empire of Germania is a Confederal Elective Monarchy in Northern Germany. It unites many different germanic states together and is considered to be the modern successor to the Holy Roman Empire. It was originally formed after WW1 when Onselburg, in fear of complete annexation, proposed to the nearby Broncia to form it. They accepted and integrated their vassal states and released some of their territory as other members of the brand new empire.
