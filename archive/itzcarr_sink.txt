Good day. &#39;Tis I, [nation]Charnea[/nation]. This region is my own, devoid of all others and their pesky complains of stability and not radically changing everything I&#39;ve ever done on a whim, such that I may peruse these allegedly disruptive world building practices for my own enrichment. All nations located within the Itzcarr Sink will be created and operated by myself and I, with occasional input from me. 

A small addendum. To those concerned, I will of course continue to participate in any other role playing ventures in which I am currently engaged.
