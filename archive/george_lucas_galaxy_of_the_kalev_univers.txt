The George Lucas Galaxy was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated stars and over 3.2 billion habitable systems orbiting around a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000 light-years. It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.
