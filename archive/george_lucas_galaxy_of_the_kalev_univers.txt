The George Lucas Galaxy was one of trillions of&nbsp;galaxies&nbsp;in the&nbsp;observable universe. The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated&nbsp;stars&nbsp;and over 3.2 billion habitable&nbsp;systems&nbsp;orbiting around a supermassive&nbsp;black hole&nbsp;at the&nbsp;heart&nbsp;of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000&nbsp;light-years. It was home to countless&nbsp;sentient&nbsp;species&nbsp;and star systems.
