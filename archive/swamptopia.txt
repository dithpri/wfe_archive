&quot;Damn peoples in my damn swamp using my damn resources, with people building their damn houses in my damn swamp.&quot; - Local Priest, The Swamplords 

Because of the growth of the religion known as &quot;Swamping&quot; a large part of land has been purchased by a collection of countries. These countries are severe believers of &quot;Swamping&quot; and have prepared this land in wait for the grand lord Shork.

Praise Shork!
