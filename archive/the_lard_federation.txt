[b] The Lard Federation [/b] was founded on the belief that cheese and butter is all you need to rule the world. If you happen to come across our glourious federation of high fat by-products and wish to also indulge in our heart-stopping power, send a telegram to the [nation]The butter lord[/nation], where you will be screened and then possibly accepted into our greasy haven.
