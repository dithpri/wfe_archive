A small chain of island states, The Varied Isles were never fully colonized by any singular power during the years of Discovery. Following the end of overseas colonial empires after World War 2, the various states of the Varied Isles regained varying degrees of freedoms from their colonial overlords and established (often unique) governments to guide their people into the new era. 

With much of their precolonial history erased, and very little in common culturally or politically, it remains to be seen how each state will develop into the new century.
