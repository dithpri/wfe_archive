The east wolf region has been through many bumps in the path from winning its independence to almost being on the brink of civil war. Having people attack our region, through it all stood a few things 
1. We are one region you mess with ine you mess with all
2. Our hopes &amp; spirits never die they grow stronger even when we seem to fall weak
3. We have strong beliefs &amp; morales
4. We faced tough times &amp; refused to subdie to them
5. We dominate any test thrown our way
