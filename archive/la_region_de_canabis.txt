The Cannabis region (Spanish: Regi&oacute;n de Canabis) is located in what was originally Mexico. It consists of the Communist Republic of Ethan and the People&amp;#39;s Democratic Republic of Cannabis. Don&amp;#39;t be fooled by the second country&amp;#39;s name. The only thing &amp;quot;democratic&amp;quot; about it is the fact that you get to vote for the leader who torments you for the next 5 years!
