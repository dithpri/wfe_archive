1. All who wish to serve GOD must praise Her and Her Purity on the message board once a week.
2. No gods will be worshiped but the one true GOD; Argumentists have no place here.
3. Skypehausers will be required to make a weekly pilgrimage to the Channel in order to repent. This requirement will be lifted when the Skypehaus is destroyed and its members restored to the Channel.
