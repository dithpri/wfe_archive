[i]The Commonwealth Society is a region founded on the belief that nations have the right to govern themselves freely and that there should always be equality among Member States. This region has endured much in its time and is now on its third incarnation and continues to stand tall. We shall remember all those who have contributed to it and helped shape it into what it is today.[/i]
