The Commonwealth Society is a region founded on the belief that nations have the right to govern their citizens freely and that there shall always be equality among all Member States regardless of their age or history. Currently on our third incarnation, we have a long history as a centre of politics, role-play, and social activities. Be sure to check out our website and find out about how we operate as well as to find out more about the workings of our region.
