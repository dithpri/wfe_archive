A densely populated mass of land that was originally politically differentiated only by religious beliefs, the Great Puritan Peninsula has developed into a diverse but still united land.  When first found by pioneers, the land was inhabited only by a small, dying people riddled with disease.  After they arrived, with the use of herbal medicine, the people were liberated from disease and separated into sects- religious people and non-religious peoples.  From those sects, separate, diversified political entities developed; but due to their shared histories they today work together.  The future of this land mass looks bright as it is home to many industrious, fledgling nations.
