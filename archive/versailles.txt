The Palace of Versailles, Ch&acirc;teau de Versailles, or simply [b]Versailles[/b], is a royal ch&acirc;teau in Versailles in the &Icirc;le-de-France region of France.

When the ch&acirc;teau was built, Versailles was a small village dating from the 11th century; today, however, it is a wealthy suburb of Paris, some 12 miles southwest of the centre of the French capital. Versailles was the seat of political power in the Kingdom of France from 1682, when King Louis XIV moved the royal court from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789, within three months after the beginning of the French Revolution. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
