Hola! Wait, they might not like that...

Old Factbook:

Welcome to the new &quot;Kingdom of Aragon&quot;, or today onwards known as &quot;Federation of Aragon&quot;. You may help us rise again to our maximum extent, and achieve the importance that was once stolen from us by our oppressive neighbours. May &quot;Jaume el Conqueridor&quot; guide you here, through all of the other regions, safely. You are more than welcome to join the federation whenever you like, as well as get out of it. You are free to do whatever you may like to do, except damage the good name of Aragon and its history. 

Enjoy your stay my dear friends. 

Queen Hajnal II.
