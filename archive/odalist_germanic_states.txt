We are a collection of ethnically and historically Germanic peoples, built on the ideas of Odalism. Odalism is the idea that individuals should do two things in order to maintain a great society.

1: Live in your ethnic birthplace.
  - Asians should live in Asia, Africans in Africa, Amerindians in America, and Europeans in Europe.
  - Odalism maintains that we do not hold a racist mentality, we simply believe that a people is most productive        when they are united.
2: Follow your native religion.
   - We believe that in addition to living in your ethnic homeland, you should also follow your ethnic religion.
   - Odalism is anti Abrahamic and against all universal religions, due to the fact they disrupt culture and ethnicity.
