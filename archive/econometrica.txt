Welcome to Econometrica.

A friend of mine once said: You know what the problem is with being an economist? Everyone has an opinion about the economy. No body goes up to a geologist and says, &#39;Igneous rocks are fake news&#39;.

This region is for people who are interested in learning about or practicing [i]economics[/i]. It&#39;s a good idea to clarify that means academically-based non-crank economics. No, Marxism is not economics (under Popper, nor is it science). Nor is being a gold bug. Public goods and the impact of inequality are. The price specie flow mechanism is. Remember, OLS is BLUE.
