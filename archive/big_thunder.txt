[color=#9d8de2][b]Luto Araka and friends had arrived from the future to visit the cafe, but one she opened the door, it led to outer space instead. Curiously, they entered and followed through the long winding paths. A few enemies did show up along the way but were quickly defeated with powerful spells. With no more opposition onward, they continued through following down the space roads all the way to the end.

A door appeared. Luto opened it up, and it led to the actual cafe. Strangely, this door coincidentally happened to be in almost the same place they started from. What exactly happened remains a mystery...[/b][/color]
