The [b]Rafterian Partenariat[/b] is collection of states engaged in diplomatic collaboration with the government of Rafterland. 

Furthermore, we encourage the development of relations in regards to the World Assembly. To enable that objective, we are more than happy to start the construction of embassies to facilitate communication.

Indeed, members of the Partenariat will be more than happy to discuss the potential of any resolution that you, as a WA member, might want to submit, but lack the expertise to, let&#39;s say, &quot;foolproof&quot;.

Don&#39;t be afraid to leave a message in our [b][color=blue][url=https://discord.gg/TuyfMBv]discord[/url][/color][/b] for more information, or by telegram to [nation]Rafterland[/nation] if you wish to join our team or to request our expertise.
