[b][color=green]This puny, insignificant region was visited by the mighty, the illustrious, the all conquering Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army!  Rather than crush this region into the dust like other lily-livered, insignificant raiders might, magnanimously, we at [region]The East Pacific[/region] believe in improving the weak and feeble, and leaving them in better shape than we found them, and so we take it upon ourselves to beautify the neglected, dilapidated regions left in our wake.[/color][/b]
