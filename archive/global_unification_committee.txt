Liberty Stands for Freedom
Oh hail the flag that set us free
Standing righteous, symbolic of strength
Our hopes for freedom to be
My friends unite hand in hand
Oh Hail! Liberty Bell!
True Freedom for all men!
Fighting hard for the future
The promise of a better day
For tomorrow we drink for the cup
The wine we fought for today
My friends, let us sing a song
Sing along, ring a bell, Liberty!
Oh Hail! Liberty Bell!
True Freedom for all men!
&#145;F&#146; that stands for our freedom
As well the flag that stands so strong
Spirits set free in our future land
So let us share in this song
My friends, not so far away
Rules will unite hand in hand
Oh Hail! Liberty Bell!
True Freedom for all men!
