Pantala is a continent of staggering mountain peaks and large swathes of forested territory. The land is rich with resources, helping the nations that reside there thrive. Many of these nations have joined together in the name of peace and prosperity to form the Pantalan Unity Coalition. The Pantalan Civil War ended in a minor Quellestromania victory, reshaping the borders and politics in the region. Now with the rush to colonize the second continent, Rindala, new alliances have formed, including the eastern Pantalan alliance (Quellestromania, Lanest, and new Plantia) and the northeast Rindalan island coalition (new Plantia, BubonicPlague).
