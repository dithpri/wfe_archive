Pantala is a continent of staggering mountain peaks and large swathes of forested territory. The land is rich with resources, helping the nations that reside there thrive. Many of these nations have joined together in the name of peace and prosperity to form the Pantalan Unity Coalition. However, the great continent is currently in a state of civil war, with the Allied Nations of Pantala (Lanest, New Plantia and 2 other nations not in the coalition) against the United Socialist States of Quellestromania. This great battle began on the sixteenth of February, 2019, and with many new advances in technology, has become quite destructive.
