The Swamplands is a pristine region were everyone is equal and free to do what they please! 
The Swamplands is a place of equality and freedom for all! but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean there aren&amp;#39;t any rules!:

1. No bullying, flame wars, etc. (you can still debate though.)

2. Don&amp;#39;t spam anything such as: Endorse some nation!, or just annoying spam.

3. And remember everyone is equal! no one is better than another!

And remember! LONG LIVE THE SWAMPLANDS!
