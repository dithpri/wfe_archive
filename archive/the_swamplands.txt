Homeland of Shrek. Houses populous nations in which are extremely diverse. Also, when someone in The Swamp dies, it is said, if they are good, Shrek will bless them to the Heavenly Swamp. If they are evil, they will go to the Hellish Swamp to suffer eternal torture by none other that Rick Astley himself.
