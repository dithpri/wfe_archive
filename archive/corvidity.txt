Welcome to Corvidity

This Region is an rp region about an Alt History where humans go extinct and a new civilization arises 10 million years later which is a species of corvid called the Neo-Corvid. This species is tested to create a civilization rivaling those of their predecessor, Humankind.

I believe this alt history has extreme potential for a complex articulate story.
Unlike other regions, where each nation has completely uncorrelated histories, Your history is a puzzle piece of &quot;The Canon&quot; which is a giant lore book all about Corvidity. 

I wont be using telegrams so whoever finds this, perhaps it was meant to be?
Essentially this is planned to be a giant library
