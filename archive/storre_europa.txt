[b]Hello!  Welcome to St&ouml;rre Europa, a RP-region set in Europe![/b]

St&ouml;rre Europa, meaning Greater Europe in Swedish, is a RP region set in an alternate Europe, different from our history. In St&ouml;rre Europa members will take the role of a country in Europe, set in modern times. This will be a heavy RP region, and players will be able to conduct diplomacy, trade, and war with each other. This region is democratic! Members may make proposals to the other members, such as ban country X or build embassy in region Y, and all members will vote on whether the proposal is acceptable or not.

This is just the start; when more players come I plan to add more features such as a regional government and a map.

Also, this region has MT.
