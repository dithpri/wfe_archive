Earth&amp;#39;s first alien settlement, namely the Romulans of Alpha Quadrant used this part of the land as a refugee station while in the midst of the Great War on their home planet, during our Neolithic era around 10,200 cal.. After the occupation and demise of the Romulan empire, the land was later adopted by care-free yodeling animal hunters, disbanded pirates, bipolar intellectuals, unemployed beer maids and spirit guides.

The refugee station left much of the Romulan technology behind, and historic data was restored, where it was by public vote to retain the locale&amp;#39;s original title, an&amp;#39;d Hyperion&amp;#39; was re-introduced to the modern age as a Region that stands for the perpetual duality of advanced technology and lotus-eating culture.
