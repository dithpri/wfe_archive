The Imperial Protectorate of Nations is an elective absolutist monarchy loosely based on the Roman Empire and consists of a collection of autonomous nations/provinces AKA Protectorates that guarantees each individual nations sovereignty. Together the nations of the Protectorate run the regional state apparatus under the eye of the Emperor who is chosen from one of the member nations on a non-regular basis when popular outcry demands it.
