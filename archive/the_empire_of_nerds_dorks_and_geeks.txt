  It started when five geography nerds wanted a place that all people could fit in. A places were they could watch Hetalia, Dr.Who, and Back to the Future on Netflix. So traveled for a awesome region.Though then a miracle happened they saw a flock of unicorns. The unicorns took them to the best place they could find and the Empire was born. Of course their were several other problems including a zombie civil war, alien invasions, but this only made it&amp;#39;s citizens stronger. Living here will be the best idea you ever had. No need to be some freaky genius or anything just be yourself.
