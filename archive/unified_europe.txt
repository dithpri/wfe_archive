Welcome to Unified Europe.  We (or should I say I!) are a small region that will try to grow.  So yes you can join and have fun!  Have a nice day!

Note:  Unlike the name might make you think, this region isn&amp;#39;t a movement or anything.  It doesn&amp;#39;t actually have any relation at all really to Europe, unless you want it to.  ;)
