[b][color=brown]Mimban, formally known as Circarpous V, was a swamp planet located in the Circarpous sector of the galaxy&#39;s Expansion Region that was the homeworld of several intelligent species, including the Mimbanese. For many decades, it was the site of conflict between its natives and mining interests attracted by the planet&#39;s deep hyperbaride mineral deposits. During the Clone Wars, the Mud Jumpers of the Grand Army of the Republic&#39;s 224th Division helped the Mimbanese Liberation Army repel the invading Separatist Droid Army. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, the 224th returned to Mimban as part of the Imperial Army to subjugate the Mimbanese and ensure Imperial energy mining operations continued unabated.[/color][/b]
