[i]&amp;quot;In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy &amp;#39;proving&amp;#39; that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the &amp;#39;mystique&amp;#39; of Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all.&amp;quot;[/i]
