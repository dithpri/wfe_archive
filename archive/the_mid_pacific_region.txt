The Mid-Pacific islands began as a small fishing village on what is now The Mother Garden in 1652. The village grew and attracted European settlers. The culture on the island spread to the surrounding islands of what are now Post Bellum, Fremane, and Seylong. Sometime around the mid-18th century, a self-declared monarchal government was established by a family with the name of Ignis. However, in 1925, the country of Ignis began to fall apart, resulting in mass opposition of the monarchy. The islands each sent a delegate to speak to the monarchy. After months of negotiation, the monarchy agreed to dissolve, and slowly implement a democratic government on each, now independent, island.
