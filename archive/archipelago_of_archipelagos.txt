Now, if you&#39;re experienced in the ways of the traditional Region, you&#39;ll know that right about now, I&#39;ll be asking you to endorse the Delegate. However, you&#39;re... incorrect, to put it lightly. Not only do we not have a Delegate (as of now), but even if(or when) we do, you don&#39;t have to bother. No-one expects you to buy into a dictatorial regime. Endorse who you [i]want[/i] to.
