[b][color=red]History of Feros[/color][/b]

Feros was once ruled by the malevolent King Seymour. A vicious tyrant who ruled with an iron fist. In his old age, members of his council saw their opportunity and conspired to kill him. King Seymour however had left no will. This meant his kingdom was up for grabs. All out war broke out between the councilmen. After a year of fighting, each council member took a piece of Feros and made their own kingdom. Now, these kingdoms attempt to live among each other, whilst trying to expand their own kingdoms
