A region of freedom, comradery, and love. The sun never sets over the Alps and our nations are united forever in unity. Only a select few will ever be allowed to join us, and only after a vigorous check of their nation. We are always improving and waiting for the next nation that is just right. Welcome to West Central Europe!
