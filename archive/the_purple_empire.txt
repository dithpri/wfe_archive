Before [nation]The Purple[/nation] founded [region]The Purple Empire[/region], there were three ruling nations that formed the XAN Alliance. But one day, they couldn&#39;t decide which of the three nations [nation]Xurus[/nation], [nation]Acury[/nation] or [nation]Nostragua[/nation] should lead the region. This led to the XAN War. During this war, [nation]The Purple[/nation] succeeded in seizing power from all three nations, thus ending the war. The once peaceful XAN Alliance, divided by war, was reunited by [nation]The Purple[/nation].

As his first official act, [nation]The Purple[/nation] reorganized the &quot;XAN Alliance&quot; into [region]The Purple Empire[/region]

A&#39;Norak joined The Empire on a later date
