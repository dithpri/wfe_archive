Before The Purple founded The Purple Empire, there were three ruling nations that formed the XAN Alliance. But one day, they couldn&#39;t decide which of the three nations should lead the region. This led to the XAN War. During this war, &quot;The Purple&quot; succeeded in seizing power from all three nations, thus ending the war. The once peaceful XAN Alliance, divided by war, was reunited by The Purple.

As his first official act, &quot;The Purple&quot; reorganized the &quot;XAN Alliance&quot; into &quot;The Purple Empire.&quot;

A&#39;Norak joined The Empire on a later date
