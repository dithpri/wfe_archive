[b]Greetings,[/b]

[i][color=9C1616]We are writing today to notify you of the fact that we, [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b], along with our partners in [b][region]The Black Hawks[/region][/b], [b][region]Kantrias[/region][/b], [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_west_pacific]TWPAF[/url][/b], [b][region]Lily[/region][/b] and [b][region]Caer Sidi[/region][/b], are changing our terms of service, to provide a better experience for (y)our residents. So what will change for you? We have decided to replace your local administration with our own, to make communication easier. Secondly, you are no longer free to endorse anyone else. We hope these changes will be received well - if not, we have also decided to update our terms on the use of the banhammer. What those changes are, who knows?[/color][/i][hr]

[b]Endorse [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=tamiel]here[/url] to agree to the new terms! Note: failure to do so may result in banjection. No pressure.[/b]
