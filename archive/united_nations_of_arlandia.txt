The United Nations of Arlandia (or UNA) was created to be a safe haven for the nations of the region. The UNA is ruled by several nations, each of them appointed by the nations of the region. We have votes to decide new rules and policies. We believe that the welfare of the citizens is off utmost priority and that protecting them and their rights is always the correct action.
