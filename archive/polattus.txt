[b]WELCOME TO POLATTUS![/b]

This is Hub which Nations from the Polattus Universe may use to gather and discuss varied topics such as relevant events, lore building and so on. Most Nations here are from planet Polattus, but some Nations or Civilizations may be in the outer space of the Polattus Universe.

Most of the technology is post-modern, although nuclear fusion and the ability to communicate with other universes are already a thing. Outer Space civilizations may also have more advanced tech than Nations in Polattus (planet).
