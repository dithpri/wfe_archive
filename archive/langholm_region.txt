The Langholm Region was founded by Langholm Xu but oddly not reigned by them, infact it is reigned by Lang X which was the origin of Langholm Xu and then Lang X became the Military of the country and have been given the ownership of this region. Xu Vere and Xu Verea still own Lang X but you cannot class Lang X as Langholm Xu.
