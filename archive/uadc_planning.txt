[b][u]Unitary parliamentary republic[/u][/b]

A temporary planning region for the UADC (now using that other name, if you know what I mean).

Note: I accidentally confused the UADC&#39;s name as &quot;United Alliance of Defense and Collaboration&quot;. I won&#39;t do that again.

Goal is for the alliance to be founded in a month.
