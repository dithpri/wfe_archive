&quot;You are all better than you think you are, you are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.&quot;


Welcome the The Community!

We are a friendly and inclusive region and while we are lightly themed that shouldn&#39;t effect your gameplay.

We are new, and many things will come. You have a voice here and can help shape the region in any way that you like.

Please contact the Dean with any questions, concerns, or suggestions.
