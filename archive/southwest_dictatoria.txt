A region of the world in the far Southwest, not many people go to this land. It is a medium size continent, almost the size of Modern day Australia home to a few nations. 

We are the people of the lands of the Red Star,
To be born upon are soil is to be born a warrior,
This is the saga of the greatest war ever fought
The Red Star, the bringer of justice the campion
who led our people to victory against the invader
that had tried to enslave our lands, the World Assembly
and the Security Council. Millions fought against
them. To free us from deception and to restore the 
light of truth to the world. To honor their sacrifice
The Red star shall fly high forever so that their
 dead&amp;#39;s shall never be forgotten!
