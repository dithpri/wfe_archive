[b]Raiders from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were out for a stroll when they ran into a man with a suit. He took them to a strange door. He opened the door which sent the Hawks to a new dimension. One that was beyond normal gameplay. One in which all regions are founderless and have no delegates. They had been transported to The R/D Zone! The raiders were impressed and hit as many regions as they could and left before the cruel twist they knew which would come in a region like this.
