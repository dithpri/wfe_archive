The world is full of states that claim to be led by values and honor; yet, as so often is the case, these states are caught in the mire of nihilism and greed. Together, the Union of Reverent States safeguards the collective commitment to safety, security, and sovereignty. Unified, the States defend their respective sovereignty, as well as the authority of The Union as a whole. In solidarity, The States shall make the world a more peaceful place, through any means necessary. The Reverent States shall overcome.
