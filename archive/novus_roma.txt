[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to arrange a meetup with some old friends, the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]EPSA![/url]

We dug out the [color=orange]old shotgun[/color] in the storage shed, as well as some other [color=blue]water guns[/color], and practiced shooting. 

[color=red]Your region was hit, and is now down for the count![/color]
If you would like to try shooting practice too, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
