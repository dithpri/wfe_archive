UTAC (Union des Territoires Anarchistes et Communistes) has been made specifically for anarcho communist people. Everywhere else we are forced to mix with Proudhon or Lenin supporters, which is why I created a space entirely devoted to ancoms. All ancoms are welcome here, despite the conflicts between Malatesta supporters and the determinists or between Volin and Makhno supporters. This region is also a place where ancoms can debate about theory and great communist and anarchist authors.
