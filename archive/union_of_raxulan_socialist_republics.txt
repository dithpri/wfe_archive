[b]The beating heart of the Raxulan Revolution![/b]

After two months of bitter oppression by the [region]Raxulan Empire[/region] the people of the Raxulan lands finally had enough and in many places toppled the imperial governors in popular uprisings.

Now, on October the 23rd 2025, the Soviet Socialist Republics of [region]Mongolea[/region], [region]Caucasea[/region] and [region]Dacea[/region] merged together in the [region]Union of Raxulan Socialist Republics[/region] or URSR.

We will not rest until our people in the remaining colonies of the doomed [region]Raxulan Empire[/region] are liberated too!
