This region has been tagged by [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1546995][b][color=fca109]The League&#39;s Defense Forces[/color][/b][/url] in honor of the natives plagued by the invader menace. 

While [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] may have relocated its forces elsewhere, they have maintained this region and thus it remains a monument to the heinous practices they espouse. Through both victory and failure, may we never forget what we fight for.

Remember [region]Trovons[/region].
Remember [region]Warzone Europe[/region].
Remember [nation]Maineiacs[/nation].

And may the fortresses invaders cower from meet their reckoning.
