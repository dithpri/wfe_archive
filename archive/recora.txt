Hello, and welcome to Recora.
Recora is a peaceful region, and is completely Democratic.
Many nations hold Liberal views, and due to the fact that Wars are seen as a thing of the past, it has granted Recora the title of &amp;quot;The Land of Peace&amp;quot;.

[b]Rules:[/b] All views are welcome in Recora, though the Left wing is more prevalent. (We do not allow corrupt Nations, Empires, etc.)
                  We strictly forbid attacking other Regions, if you are caught doing so, you will be exiled from Recora.

[b]Map:[/b]  Simply Telegraph Reath regarding the Map and you will be given the map, then mark out where you wish to be placed. (Please know that, to include all other Nations of Recora, you will not get, say, 25% of land for your single Nation.)
