The Holy Imperial Union bases itself on a few defining principles, as underlined below...

1) Loyality to God and King 
2) Sole Alligence to the Union
3) Respect for Brother Nations 
4) Political and Social Unity 
5) Upkeeping the principles of Democracy, Theocracy and Republicanism 

The Holy Imperial Union is founded on a strict brotherhood, with the sole reason to unite as one grand Holy Empire. We are dedicated to upkeeping a large army, democratic rights and freedoms and moralisitic ideologies. 
We dedicate our Nations to reflect these principles, and actions and deeds that will unhold our repuation as moralistic, democratic powers.
