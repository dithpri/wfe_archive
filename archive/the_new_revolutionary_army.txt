  Soldiers &#150; don&#146;t give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you &#150; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder. Don&#146;t give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don&#146;t hate &#150; only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers &#150; don&#146;t fight for slavery, fight for liberty!
