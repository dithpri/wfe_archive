Greetings! Welcome to the United States of Earth.

The USE is an alternate-history region that revolves around the idea that somewhere in history, the United States either peacefully or forcefully took over Earth. In the end result of this, there were several new states created under the now-global United States of Earth, whether it be from Africa, Asia, Europe, or Oceania, the new world was modeled after the old United States&#39; governmental system.

The USE is a roleplay region. If you do not plan to participate in roleplaying events, please seek a different region.
