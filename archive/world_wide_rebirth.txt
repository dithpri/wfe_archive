Introduction:
World Wide Rebirth (WWR) is a global movement characterized by far-right nationalist and fascist ideologies. Founded on the principles of ethnonationalism, authoritarianism, and anti-globalism, WWR seeks to establish homogeneous nation-states governed by strict social hierarchies and traditionalist values. The movement advocates for the preservation of ethnic identities, the expulsion of LGBTQ+ and leftist groups, and the rejection of liberal democracy in favor of authoritarian rule.
