The Secessionists of the Brotherhood Nations, sometimes referred to as Brotherhood Secessionists, Brotherhood Separatists or simply Secessionists and Separatists, are a faction of nations that have separated from the Brotherhood Nations and formed their own regional splinter group. It was founded by Emil Briar and soon took in other nations that would become major allies and supporters to the cause.
