Res Publica Terrarum Libertatis Aurea et populi eam te excipiunt! 

The Commonwealth of the Lands of Golden Liberties and her peoples welcome you!

Terrae Libertatis Aurea are progressive conservative states, retaining their rich traditions which we believe are the foundation of any stable state that is to survive the tests of time. We unite in this region because we are strong in unity, because we have a common past, common tradition, and common interests.

This region is themed around democratic traditions, and around cultural preservation and the rebirth and cultivation of national identity.

does not deserve the respect, the present, 
nor a right to the future.&amp;quot;
