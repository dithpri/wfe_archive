This region is being raided by the North Pacific Army (NPA). We were also going to raid your fridge, but that must have been taken along when you moved to your next region since there was no food to be found in there. Soon y&#39;all will enjoy Kandy&#39;s BBQ as well. Something something raiding TNP allies is bad you should know better, something something harboring less than desirable nations in your regions is bad, be best.
