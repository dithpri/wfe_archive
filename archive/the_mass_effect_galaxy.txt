Welcome all Mass Effect fans to a region especially designed for you!

Unlike many other regions that base their timeline on either a post or pre Reaper War era, the MEG takes place in an alternate universe where the Reaper threat never arrived and Commander Shepard is not the ultimate rallying force within the Galaxy, and Eden Prime was untouched by Spectre Saren and his Geth Army!
