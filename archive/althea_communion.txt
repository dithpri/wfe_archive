A region located on the northern part of the Karkost region, Althea Communion was form by The Empire of UnholyEgg, after The Grey Winged Alliance was formed to take advantage over the recent civil war between UnholyEgg and the Protectorate of Eggnunguin. We don&amp;#39;t like those GWA folks very much, especially The Empire of Lanessiera (mushroom-dude).

Althea Communion is an ALT region for the ALT nuttyness.
