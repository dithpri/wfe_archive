Yo is that your new ride is a small region, but what it lacks in region size it makes up for in beauty. It is free of raiding and defending, plus we put no tags on the region because in [b][color=blue]my[/color][/b] opinion, it discriminates against nations and views that are not that way.  I want everyone&amp;#39;s NationStates experience to be as good as possible, and this region surely will help.
