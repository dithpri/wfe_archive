The Mujahideen was a region which Repreteop had partaken in [i][b]their inevitable downfall[/b][/i], they had supported hatred against homosexuals and none Muslims.

This region does not stand as a hate sign of Muslims, but more of a reminder that you should respect others.

This region can be taken from [nation]Repreteop[/nation] if you telegram him and agree to terms on being neutral, respectful, and good.
