[color=green][b]Welcome to the Azad Hind Society![/b]

The Azad Hind Society (AHS) is an independent left-leaning think tank and a democratic membership society which aims to promote the values of equality, collective action, social progress, direct democracy, human rights and sustainable development.

Here at AHS, we wish to create a space within NationStates to discuss and organize for the development of socialism in real-life India.

One of our primary goals is to clear the misconceptions regarding leftism which is quite prevalent in Indian society.[/color]
