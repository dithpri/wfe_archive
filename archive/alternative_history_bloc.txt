Alternate History or AH is a fictional genre that imagines what would happen if history had gone differently. It often begins by changing a single historical event, called the point of divergence or POD, and tracing how this produces big changes in the world, diverging it from Our Timeline (OTL) and creating a new, alternate and parallel world. Other names include alternative history, allohistory and uchronie.
