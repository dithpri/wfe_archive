The Ursusian Archipelago consists of roughly 80 rocky islands in the Labrador Sea, southwest of Greenland and northeast of Newfoundland, Canada. The archipelago makes up the mainland and territory of the Commonwealth of Ursusia as well as many uninhabited islands that are administered by the nation but not physically controlled, as well as some that are disputed between Ursusia and Greenland. Native species to the region include the Black bear, Atlantic puffin, Ring-billed gull, Cod, Haddock, and Blue whale.
