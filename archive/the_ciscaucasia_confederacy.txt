[b][color=steelblue]It was a dark and stormy night, and all the sailors were asleep... all but 4!
Waves impacted the ship, and filled the deck with water. A hamster was running around with buckets to get the water out.
A sailor started cursing at the seas, as he held himself against a mast.
The captain, kept the calm and started navigating carefully, holding the wheel strongly.
The other sailor, the unfunniest one in the entire crew, kept telling jokes to keep the people motivated.[/color]
