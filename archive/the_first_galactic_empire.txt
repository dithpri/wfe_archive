The Galactic Empire&#151;also known as the First Galactic Empire, the New Order, the Empire, the Order, or the Old Empire&#151;was an autocratic government that ruled the galaxy during the reign of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who proclaimed himself Galactic Emperor in 19 BBY. The new regime replaced the Galactic Republic, a democratic state that existed for a millennium until the end of the Clone Wars. The planet Coruscant, an ecumenopolis located in the Core Worlds, retained its status as the galactic capital under the Empire.
