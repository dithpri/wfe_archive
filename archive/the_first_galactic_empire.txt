[color=red]The First Galactic Empire[/color]
[hr]The First Galactic Empire was an all-powerful, galaxy-spanning empire led solely by [color=red]The Emperor[/color] of [nation]Ruhigen[/nation]. It was built around five values: [color=blue]economic power[/color], [color=grey]military might[/color], [color=goldenrod]superiority[/color], [color=orange]unity[/color], and [color=red]honour[/color]. Promised to last for ten-thousand years, now it is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, deprived of life. It&amp;#39;s former inhabitants have either fled to neighboring regions or been utterly destroyed.
