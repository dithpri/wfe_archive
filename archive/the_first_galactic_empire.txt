The First Galactic Empire is an all-powerful, galaxy-spanning empire led by the Emperor of Ruhigen. It has been built around five values: economic power, military might, government control, superiority, and honour. The nations within are free to act as they wish, as long as they remain loyal to the Emperor. 

LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!
