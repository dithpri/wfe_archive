[color=red]The First Galactic Empire[/color]
[hr][region]The First Galactic Empire[/region] is an all-powerful, galaxy-spanning empire led only by [color=red]The Emperor[/color] of [nation]Ruhigen[/nation]. It has been built around five values: [color=blue]economic power[/color], [color=green]military might[/color], [color=yellow]superiority[/color], [color=orange]unity[/color], and [color=red]honour[/color]. The nations within are free to act as they wish, as long as they remain loyal to [color=red]The Emperor[/color].
[hr]&amp;quot;We stand on the threshold of a [color=red]new beginning[/color]. In order to ensure our [color=red]security[/color] and [color=red]continuing stability[/color], the Republic will be reorganised into [color=red]The First Galactic Empire[/color], for a [color=red]safe[/color] and [color=red]secure society[/color], which I assure you [color=red]will last for ten thousand years[/color]. An [color=red]Empire of laws[/color], not of politicians!  An [color=red]Empire[/color] that will continue to be ruled by a [color=red]sovereign ruler chosen for life[/color].&amp;quot;
[hr][color=red]&amp;quot;LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!!!&amp;quot;[/color]
