The Union of Communist and Socialist States is a democratic Union of nations organized and maintained through a central regional government system. Unionist nations are free to be, and encouraged to remain, independent from the Union government, however they are still required to follow any legislation passed by the Union government. Every Unionist nation is treated equally within the Union, regardless of their size, power, or economic situation. Governments, leaders, and nations are only judged by their actions within the Union. Nothing more, nothing less.

Will add a Regional Factbook should the Union gain enough power.
