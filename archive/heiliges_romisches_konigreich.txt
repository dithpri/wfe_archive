[color=#2ECCFA] [b] [i]Welcome[/i] [/b] to the [b][/color][color=#FE2E2E] Heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich[/color][/b][color=#2ECCFA], or the Holy Roman Empire![/color]

[color=#088A08][b]Peace on the Continent!  Victory at Austerlitz![/b][/color] [i]Emperor Francis II[/i] defeated Napoleon with help of the Russians, stopping the self-styled Emperor of the French.  However, war dragged on into 1815 without a decisive victory. With peace concluded in the [i]Congress of Vienna[/i], the [color=#FE2E2E][b]Holy Roman Empire[/b] has been restored as the [b]Holy Roman Kingdom[/b][/color]. Will we stand united under a unified Imperial Diet? Or be fractured by divisions leaving us vulnerable to outside invasions?
