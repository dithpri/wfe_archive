Welcome to Urbanites! Established early in 2003 by members of the notorious Urban75 collective, though there are now few if any of the original members still around. Urbanites was re-founded 3/10/2010 and hopes to revive the spirit of the past. 

Our allies are 10000 Islands with whom, in the past, we often fought side by side against invaders and who have since frequently come to our aid and rescue.

Enjoy your stay if your intentions are honourable. WA members are expected to endorse our Delegate.
