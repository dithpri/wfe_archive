A tiny region where you&amp;#39;ll feel right at home with your closest neighbors! The Edhelities strive for perfection in everything they do, aiming for World Benchmark in Civil Rights, Economy, and Political Freedoms. We do not yet have any sort of leadership other than Alexanderlandia, our founder, and the WA delegate, but we are very open to new ideas. We are a free and open land, so come as you please and enjoy the fun!
