[region]Centralized Free Islands[/region] is a new small but rapidly growing region. We are happy to welcome everyone. There is freedom of speech and political freedom. The government is centralized.

Founded [region]Centralized Free Islands[/region]: [color=blue]2018-03-06[/color]
Official languages: [color=red]Polish, English[/color]

To join the Centralized Free Islands, you must meet two conditions.

2. You must have Political Freedom at least [color=green]50[/color]

And that&#39;s how easy it is.


Please do not invite other nations to the region! Any nation that meets the above conditions can be invited. We must grow.

I can not speak English, but thanks to translator I can get along

(I&#39;m writing from a translator, so I may get errors)
