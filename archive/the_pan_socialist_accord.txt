A transnational coalition of socialist republics and workers&#146; movements unified under a shared mandate to advance economic collectivization, international labor solidarity, and anti-imperialist coordination. The Accord functions as both a diplomatic framework and a strategic bloc, harmonizing central planning standards, facilitating resource-sharing agreements, and supporting revolutionary parties abroad. Although its member states vary in governance models from syndicalist federations to centralized party-states. The Accord positions itself as the primary engine of worldwide socialist integration and a counterweight to capitalist alliances.
