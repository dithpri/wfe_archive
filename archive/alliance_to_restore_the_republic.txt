The Alliance to Restore the Republic was founded in the year two-thousand and twenty in response to the rising threat of global fascism. Alliance members are strong proponents for republican forms of government that utilize democratic processes in free and fair elections. Nations belonging to the Alliance strongly support social justice issues, climate change policies, and personal freedoms. Nations who seek to join the Alliance must adhere to progressive policies that help our region&#39;s must vulnerable residents.
