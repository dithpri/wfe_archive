[I]&amp;quot;In an age of nothing, at a time when we stand at the brink of our own destruction, strengthen our belief in ourself, in the future of humanity, in the things of this world that cannot be easily perceived. Awaken that which lies dormant, now, within our soul. Re-ignite the flame of our consciousness, and measure the strength of our conviction. Reveal the lie. Renounce our hatred. Seek, find and embrace the truths we are fortunate enough to discover. Cherish them. Use them to anchor us in the sea of chaos that is the world we live in. When twilight draws near, when we are pushed to the very limits of our soul, when it seems that all we have left are the dead remnants of the fabric of our life; believe.&amp;quot;[/I]
