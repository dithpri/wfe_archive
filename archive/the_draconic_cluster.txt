The secretive and devastating Ta&amp;#39;Nar rule the Draconic Cluster since they created it long ago.  Those who have fought them have vanished.  Those who manage to ally with them have survived.  Some whisper that the Ta&amp;#39;Nar are older than the universe and have the ability to create races from nothing.  While this may only be rumor and speculation, it does explain their servitors, the Kythons.  Approach with care and respect or that may be the last thing you do.
