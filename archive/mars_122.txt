Mars 122 is a world where Man lives on Mars - also it was modified to be a comfortable habitat for Man. With Phobos and Deimos becoming &quot;Remus&quot; - the Dead Son. Despite there being a whole thousand years of inhabitants, technology stagnated - maybe even regressed due to a galactic apocalypse. But lately the world has seen a return to ancient days, with mass produced weaponry &amp; words too.
