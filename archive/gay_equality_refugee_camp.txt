This is a temporary &amp;#39;Gay Equality&amp;#39; refugee camp.

While we are working our hardest to get our act together, have a piece of caek in the regional dining area, or do something else, this is only a temporary region.

Treat this region as home, please note that elections will be postponed until the refound is complete.
