This is a Commonwealth of the Danish Kingdom. It consists of 4 &amp;#39;Countries&amp;#39;.
The 4 countries are:

1 Denmark.
2 Greenland.
3 Feroe Islands.
4 Danish Mediterranean.

Every &amp;#39;country&amp;#39; has their own government, but general decisions are made by the Danish parliament Folketinget. There is election every 4th year. 
Our current Prime-minister is Helle Thorning-Schmidtt. She is the Leader of the mid-left wing party, the Social-Democrats. The political system is a constitutional monarchy, which means that our Queen is HM Margrethe II, our Primeminister is just leader of the Government.
