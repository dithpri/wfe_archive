We are a hardy nation that will stand for what&amp;#39;s right, no matter how hopeless the situation seems. Join the ranks of the Yuketobonian Nation as an ally or ignore us and we shall leave you alone. We are who we are because of our systematically unified governing. It may seem like our people have nearly no political freedoms but you would be mistaken if you think there is none. I hope you befriend us on our journey to reunite the world in being friendly once again.
