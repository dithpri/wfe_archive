- Gleaming Bayonets and Perfect Formation (all may I say spectacular qualities of the RKA who have just taken this place for their own).

With thanks to the [region]United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] for their help!

And now whatever I want to put I guess. Someone had a joke I think:

&amp;quot;Why did the Cerian raid the region?  To get across the street&amp;quot;

YOU HAVE BEEN RAIDED GOODNIGHT![/b]
