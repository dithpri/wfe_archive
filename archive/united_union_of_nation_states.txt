The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective Nation State Region, the organization was established on 3 April 2017 in order to prevent another such conflict. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.
