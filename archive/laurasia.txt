Welcome to Laurasia!
In paleogeography, Laurasia was the northernmost of two supercontinents (the other being Gondwana) that formed part of the Pangaea supercontinent from approximately 510 to 200 million years ago (Mya). It separated from Gondwana 200 to 180 Mya (the late Triassic era) during the breakup of Pangaea, drifting further north after the split.[2]
