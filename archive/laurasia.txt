[region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to show some new feathered uns around town to discover the best places to visit!

We heard that there was great entertainment to be found in your region, specifically in the form of all you can buy vending machines.

Unfortunately, we suddenly realised that we forgot to bring our cash, so we left this WFE in exchange for breaking your vending machines. We hope you like it!
