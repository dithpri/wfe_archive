Welcome to the TNA, population zero.

Tolstois was an idea of mine of a nation that didn&amp;#39;t have a IC population. All of Tolstois is completely empty, except for the wildlife and old decrepit buildings of the folks who used to populate the country. IC, Tolstois is technically a nation, just without anybody to rule it and nobody to be ruled over, so essentially an anarchy.
