The culture of the workers cannot be understated. With this, we declare a new era, an era where there are nations dedicated to preserving the workers, their rights and their culture, for without an iron fist, you cannot defend against an iron sword.

Religious tolerance is to be encouraged. Atheists and theists alike are not to be discriminated against or favored over the other. There is to be no national religion, but it is recommended that those who serve this glorious nation be atheist.
