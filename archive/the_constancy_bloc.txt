The Constancy Bloc is a region that comprises of governments that have identical socioeconomic policies. These identical approaches to the economy is a new kind of economic system that can be referred to as constancy economics or &quot;constanomics.&quot; The basic idea of constancy economics is to approach certain sectors of the economy in a certain and appropriate manner to avoid confusion and unnecessary disputes on whether the government should intervene in the market or not. In short, constancy economics has generated a quote that perfectly describes itself: &quot;Treat the private sector like it is the private sector and the public sector like it is the public sector.&quot; It can also be described as a middle ground between socialism and capitalism.
