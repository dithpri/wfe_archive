Quilner is home to Nitrona and surrounding territories.

[color=red]BREAKING:[/color] The Nitrona and Aanix Joint Council has declared the unknown virus that has taken hold across the world has been eradicated from Quilner. 

&quot;Whilst we can definitely say that Quilner is free from the virus at present, the rest of the world is still battling it. As that is the case, international flights and ships have been halted until further notice. We will do everything we can to share our cure research with international bodies.&quot; - Jack Sleyn, NAAJC.
