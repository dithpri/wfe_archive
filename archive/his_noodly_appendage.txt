We believe pirates, the original Pastafarians, were peaceful explorers and it was due to Christian misinformation that they have an image of outcast criminals today

We are fond of beer

Every Friday is a Religious Holiday

We do not take ourselves too seriously

We embrace contradictions (though in that we are hardly unique)

In Heaven we have a Stripper Factory and a Beer Volcano,
