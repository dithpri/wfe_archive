Established on December 22, 2019, The Free States Borealis was created as a sanctuary for those free nations interested in maintaining complete sovereignty until such time as they feel comfortable conceding to the rules and regulations of other regional/international organizations. As long as the Free Land of DeBeeland has Executive Authority as the Founder of the Free States of Borealis, the region is protected from takeover by foreign nations. Currently, this nation is seeking a Delegate to the World Assembly.
