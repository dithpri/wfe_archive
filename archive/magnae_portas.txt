hello, and welcome to our quaint region.
despite our name, we are an English speaking region.
anybody is welcome to join, and we will accept most embassies.

rules;
-dont be overly mean or petty
-dont use alt accounts in polls.

besides for this, the world assembly delegate has almost supreme power.
the governor will promptly ban anybody found in violation of these rules, including the delegate.
