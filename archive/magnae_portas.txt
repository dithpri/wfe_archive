hello, and welcome to our quaint region.
despite our name, we are an English speaking region.
anybody is welcome to join, and we will accept most embassies.

rules;
-dont be overly mean or petty

besides for this, the world assembly delegate has almost supreme power.
the governor will promptly ban anybody found in violation of these rules, including the delegate.

war is bloody, and we need no more blood on our hands. our name translates to &quot;great gates&quot;.
may heaven forgive what we did, and may we walk through great gates after life has escaped us.
