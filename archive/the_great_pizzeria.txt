The [b][color=red]Europeian[/color] [color=blue]Republic[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color][/b] came to this pizzeria seeking answers to some of life&#39;s greatest questions... Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? How much is the lunch special if I also want to order a 2 litre of Pepsi? 

But mostly we were looking for the answer to a single question which has gnawed at the hearts and minds of Europeians for at least the last two months and has become one of our most divisive issues: Does Pineapple belong on a pizza? 

Sadly it seems that even here, the answer remains unknown. 

We return to [region]Europeia[/region] our quest unfinished.
