The Kingdom of Violentus is a large, pleasant nation, notable for its compulsory military service. The hard-nosed, hard-working population of 80 million Violentusians are highly moralistic and fiercely conservative, in the sense that they tend to believe most things should be outlawed. People who have good jobs and work quietly at them are lauded; others are viewed with suspicion.
