[u][b][region]1st Epitome United[/region][/b][/u]

This region has rather diverse terrain. Clustered between bigger and stronger ones, fairly diverse, even though small. It&#39;s influence in the world has yet to rise and its inhabitants have not yet come.
It is centered around The Epitomic Sea, with the klocian land departing it from the ocean in the north. Most of the region has mediterranean klimate, with exceptions.
