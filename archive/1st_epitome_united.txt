This region is very diverse. Clustered between bigger and stronger ones, even though small, very vigilant and cultured. It&#39;s influence in the world has yet to rise. Founded by nomads, settled by many.
It is centered around The Epitomic Sea, with the klocian land departing it from the ocean in the north. The region has mediterranean or semi-arid climate, with Arid lands on the south.
