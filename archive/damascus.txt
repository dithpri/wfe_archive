[b][color=green]The horrific devastation of Syria is being orchestrated by outside forces &#151; 
the US and its puppets in Israel and Saudi Arabia. ISIS? Predictable blowback resulting from
the forever criminal behavior of the capitalist West. 
 
To sell this bloodbath as a fight for &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot;, as US politicians and the corporate media have done, is beyond hypocrisy... 
It is the propaganda of war criminals.[/color][/b]
