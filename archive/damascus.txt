[b][color=green]The Syrian war isn&#146;t black and white, good guys VS bad guys. 

The Assad government is far from just and decent, but the horrific devastation of Syria is being orchestrated by outside forces &#151; the US and Saudi Arabia.

They want to see the country reduced to ashes so that Iran will be isolated and easier to destroy.
 
To sell this bloodbath as a fight for &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot;, as US politicians and media have done, is beyond hypocrisy; it is the propaganda of war criminals.[/color][/b]
