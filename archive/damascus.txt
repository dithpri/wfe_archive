[b][color=green]The Syrian war isn&#146;t black and white, good guys VS bad guys. 

The Assad government is a criminal enterprise, but the horrific devastation of Syria is being orchestrated by outside forces &#151; 
the US, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. They want to see Syria reduced to ashes so that Iran will be isolated and easier to destroy; 
Iran is the only obstacle to absolute US regional domination.  
 
To sell this bloodbath as a fight for &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot;, as US politicians and the corporate media have done, is beyond hypocrisy... 
It is the propaganda of war criminals.[/color][/b]
