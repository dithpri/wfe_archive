French Guiana, officially called [b]Guiana[/b], is an overseas department and region of France, on the north Atlantic coast of South America. It borders Brazil to the east and south, and Suriname to the west. Its 32,253 sq mi area has a very low population density, with half of its 250,109 inhabitants in 2013 living in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. By land area, it was the largest region of France until the region reforms that took effect on 1 January 2016.&#151;Wikipedia[hr]
