Formed in early 1981, this pact was created out of necessity, a group of individualistic nations banded together to brave the vast geopolitical landscape that surrounded them. Formed by the critical member nations Migu, a primitive tribal paradise; Mouldova, a progressive democratic state; Good Kingdom, a &quot;good&quot; authoritarian nation; and Mar-a-Lagos, an economy focused industrial state.

Since then, more nations have joined the Pact.
