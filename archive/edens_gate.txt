Something is coming, you can feel it, can&#39;t you? You can feel that we are creeping towards the edge. I know that you are out there, and I know that you are in pain. But my children, I am here to tell you that suffering is a choice, and you can choose a better path. We want you, we accept you, and we will take you. Willingly or not. And some of you may fight, but in the end, you will thank us. I am your father, and you are my children.
