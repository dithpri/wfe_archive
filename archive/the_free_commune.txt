New peaceful region.

Enjoy your stay or go away! :) But hopefully you enjoy your stay.
You are here by choice and free association, so please stay civilized!
We are called Fremen and you are now one of us.

We have some ground rules:
1) Don&#39;t be a fascist, or otherwise endorse discrimination of any kind;
2) Specifically, don&#39;t swear or insult anyone, not even as a joke; we debate ideas, not people;
3) Understand that everything in our society is based on consensual agreement. Consequently, laws might start forming once citizens arrive. Keep an eye on the factbook.

Otherwise, any topic is on-topic in The Free Commune!
