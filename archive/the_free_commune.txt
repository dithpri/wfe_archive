New peaceful region.

Enjoy your stay or go away! :) But hopefully you enjoy your stay.
You are here by choice and free association, so please stay civilized!

We don&#39;t have laws yet, just some ground rules:
1) Don&#39;t be a fascist, or otherwise endorse discrimination of any kind;
2) Specifically, don&#39;t swear or insult anyone, not even as a joke; we debate ideas, not people;
3) Understand that everything in our society is based on consensual agreement. At this moment, it&#39;s just me, so the very first 2nd joiner and I will have to come to a common agreement, and then us two with the others, etc. Consequently, laws might start forming. Keep an eye on the factbook.

Otherwise, any topic is on-topic in The Free Commune!
