[i]The trash fires are red.

The icy tides grey.

The Scourged rose late last night and stole our weak away.

&quot;Serves the fools right.&quot; I callously say. 

It makes me remember the parties, the lavish buffets.

The world was our oyster then, a sick power play. 

Our old ways are done now, gone with the highways. 

Today only our children remain, forced to live in our gloomy decay. 

When the eastern sky parts, we&#39;d best well pray. 

God shan&#39;t treat us kindly on that sad dark day.[/i] [b]-Author Unknown[/b]
