[b]Poem of the Day:[/b]

[i]Pulses pounding
Damage - astounding
The Dead are hounding
The Dead are surrounding

Homes set ablaze
As crimson eyes gaze
Our endless outnumbered days
Are lost in the haze

Hungry breeding
Lifeless feeding
Limbs are bleeding
Life is fleeting[/i] -Unknown Pintrest User
