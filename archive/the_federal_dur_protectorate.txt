The Federal DUR Protectorate is under the protection and governance of the DUR. It was founded as a back-up region in the event the DUR comes under defender or raider attack, and will serve a purpose as a military base, if the council so choses. As such, the Federal Protectorate recognizes the rule of:

[b]DUR Founder:[/b] [nation=short]North Libya[/nation]
[b]DUR Delegate:[/b] [nation=short]Revitallia[/nation]
[b]DUR Vice-Delegate:[/b] [nation=short]The Peoples Republic of Pacifica[/nation]

And all members of the DUR Cabinet.
