Welcome to The Falling Skies, a region like no other!

You have endless opportunities here! There are no offsite chats or forums that you are required to sign up for, so all RP will take place here, on this forum.

Check out our map, and other dispatches, to see what else you should do before getting started. Once you are sure that this is what you want, to get started, send a telegram to [nation]The Falling Skies[/nation], or the RPSA, [nation]Argadoria[/nation]. Tell them (as best you can) the area you want on the map. Please do try to be reasonable.

Now that you have your own place on the map, you can begin to RP! If you haven&#39;t already, start working on your factbooks, to let us know some more about your military.
