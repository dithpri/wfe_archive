 In this Region we reject the false satanic, novus ordo, modernist church of Rome; its false anti-popes, false clergy, false sacraments and false beliefs; that was established after the death of His Holiness Pope Pius XII. We firmly adhere to the Holy Roman Catholic Church founded by God Himself, in the Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity; to the Papacy, to the Sacraments, to the Beliefs and to the Teachings of His Holy Catholic Church. As foretold by O L of La Salette (1846); &amp;quot;The Church will be in eclipse, the world will be in dismay.&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;Rome will lose the faith and become the seat of the anti-christ.&amp;quot; Those Catholics who are lost, alone, sedevacantist, or of the Siri-thesis, are welcome here. &amp;#39;To Jesus Thru Mary&amp;#39;
