Catalyst is a forgotten Region that most have never even heard of, as it has remained undiscovered. It has mostly been reigned over by The Empire of Kolari. Reasoning for Catalyst being undiscovered is the fact that Kolari hasn&amp;#39;t made contact with other Regions for some time, rather isolating themselves. But now, Kolari is beginning to make itself known, along with the rest of Catalyst.
