These areas of the world are almost inhospitable, very uninviting, and dangerous. Nations try to avoid this horrible place, but some were brave enough to venture into this region, and they were rewarded greatly. While there is sand  and nothingness almost everywhere, the underground is rich in minerals, has water deep underground, and oil seems to be uncommon.

Will you make a city that is a lush oasis and a beacon of hope for people who are lost? Will you be able to develop a thriving nation in areas which are avoided? Or will it become one of many ruins and be buried in the dunes? 
Will your nation stand the test of time?
