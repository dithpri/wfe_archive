Many civilizations have avoided these areas they call &quot;The Wastelands&quot;, due to the harsh environment and lack of surface water and flora alike. Nations have been established here in the past, and many fell, leaving only ruins of their former glory. Yet the brave still venture here in the search of riches and resources, as the underground compensates for what is not on the surface. Minerals are abundant, oil pockets are common, and water hidden deep underground keeps the cities alive.
With mining you can find water, and with the water your Nation will become an oasis for future travelers.

Will your nation inhibit these lands of death? Will you succeed where others failed? Will you stand the test of time?
