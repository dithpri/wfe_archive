We collectively live amidst this dark dark forest in the midst of all these dark things happening all around us. Still we thrive. Our wooden huts and berries bring us joy and together we collectively choose to be happy. We don&#39;t need a worker uprising nor do we need more civil liberties. What we need is happiness and sovereignty over our forest.
