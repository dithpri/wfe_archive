An isolated cluster of several constellations and systems formerly connected to Sol via the Home Gate network before the collapse, the Vel Sector is a vast area of space encompassing several factions, alternate timeline nation states and more than a few alien races. This space contains hundreds of thousands of planets among hundreds of star systems and the people that call this isolated part of the universe home are just as diverse and varied.
