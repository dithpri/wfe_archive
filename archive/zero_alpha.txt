A world conceived through war, yet run through peace. In the aftermath of the Second Great War almost a century ago, a new order was established in the world. In the new order, the traditional mutual hatred between Anthros and Humans were finally put aside, and the two races agreed to work together to build a better world together. The arrival of the Sergals in 2362 brought a new race into the care of Humans and Anthros, and a new opportunity to continue their eternal quest for the stars above. A new era has dawned, and the world is marching boldly into it.
