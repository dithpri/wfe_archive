A place only dreamed of by the many who lurk, made specifically for those who love boxes. A safe space for all who care to visit, and a refuge for those who may find a home here. Safe and undemanding, Vexil hopes to welcome all regions from all walks of life, the happy, the sad, the old, the new, those rejected, those cast out, even those forgotten. Those seeking new homes away from drama. We will be here for you.
