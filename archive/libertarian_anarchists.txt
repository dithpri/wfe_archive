Chomsky on right-wing libertarianism:
&amp;quot;[i]That kind of libertarianism, in my view, in the current world, is just a call for some of the worst kinds of tyranny, namely unaccountable private tyranny. Anarchism is quite different from that. It calls for an elimination to tyranny, all kinds of tyranny. Including the kind of tyranny that&#146;s internal to private power concentrations.[/i]&amp;quot;
