We are going to build up this time, and I would love for you to join me in this endeavor. I have started up a regional forum [url=http://alliedfederation.freeforums.net/]Located Here[/url] that is currently a work in progress. We have a chance to build an active region together, and the best way to start is to sign up on our forum. I hope to see you there!
