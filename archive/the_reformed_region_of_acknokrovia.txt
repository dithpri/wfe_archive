The Reformed Region of Acknokrovia is a reincarnation of an old region named Acknokrovia, which from the ashes of such rose New Acknokrovia. Reformed Acknokrovia is built upon the same basic ideas of inclusiveness, peace and cooperation among it&#39;s members, without an overly controlling leader that silences any discontent or unhappiness within region administration.
