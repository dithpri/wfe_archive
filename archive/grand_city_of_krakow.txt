Czezc!
Welcome to Krak&oacute;w, a city in southwest Poland, with over 1000 years of history,
This is a fairly casual region, we run things differently to most regions, this is because although not a frontier the Government will not have too much authority over the competitions and roleplay.
Rules:
1. Be Civil
2. Puppet Storage is maximum 20
3. Don&#39;t Feed The Dragon.
