Regional Anthem (to the tune of Haydn&#39;s Symphony No. 45 in F Sharp Minor):

This place is the phunk
It&#39;s the phunk, yeah
Tear up that bootie
You know you want to
Get down with the phunk
All the way down
To outer space
Ain&#39;t no place for rock, naw
Ain&#39;t no place for hate
This a place for phunk y&#39;all
Boogie with the Woogie
Slap some phunk on it too
Wipe that phunk around
It&#39;s gonna get real phunky in here
When we get down
To the upper purple sky part
Of the whole phunky phunk world
Of Phunktowne

Let me hear y&#39;all turn it up
Turn up that phunk
Turn it out too
Then get down, all the way down
To outer space
