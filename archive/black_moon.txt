[tr][td=c8r2][font=arial]The Black Moon is the &quot;egg&quot; of the Second Angel, Lilith, from Neon Genesis Evangelion. It is a transport vessel created by the First Ancestral Race to send Lilith to Earth, colliding violently into Earth 4 billion years ago in the event dubbed &quot;First Impact&quot; and resting deep beneath the Earth&#39;s surface in the region that would eventually become Hakone, Japan. Buried beneath the surface, the Black Moon formed a gigantic underground cavity, termed a &quot;GeoFront&quot;, around which Tokyo-3 and NERV Headquarters were eventually built. Nowadays, it is a puppet storage owned by [nation]Moukden and Kirin[/nation].[/font][/td][/tr][/table]
