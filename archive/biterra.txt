Bi&#146;Terra is a fictional planet I made for a D&amp;D campaign i&#146;m making (which is still in the works) and if you do join this region be ready to do some sort of roleplaying as to explain why you exist on Bi&#146;Terra
Example:&#148;The holy Angellonian Empire was founded on the continent of Aspoker during the 14th Era by Angellonians when they arrived on Bi&#146;Terra&#148;.
&#147;The Mountain Empire was found during the 7th era by Emperor Doragonteru on the Continent of Degora&#148;.
