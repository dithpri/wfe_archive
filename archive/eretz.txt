[color=red]End of the Second Season of Crash of the Region (a.k.a. OH NO IT&amp;#39;S TOO CAPITALIST I AM AFRAID OF CAPITALISTS vs. SHUT UP I DON&amp;#39;T LIKE YOU IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT KID). Hope the Third one is not gonna happen. Again.
Sorry guys for wasting your time. Some of you guys have been through this before. Hey, guys, remember Assembly of Independent Nations? 
Well, hopefully we will finally learn this lesson and not make this mistake again in future. Thank those of you who were not changing their mind every day. 
Sorry, byyyye. 
XOXOXOX. No, wait, it is too homo. I will see you in the next chapter. [/color]
