[i]Welcome to [color=red]Eretz[/color]! This region is for nations of various ideologies, and is a Roleplaying region. The region is new, and we soon plan to create a map for the region, as well as having an in-depth and detailed world history RP, integrating many of the nations of Eretz, developing their associated histories and affecting their present statuses. To become a member, contact [nation=short]Hallorania[/nation], [nation=short]Zeledia[/nation], [nation=short]Nuevo Meshiko[/nation] or [nation=short]Czervenika[/nation]. New members must be skilled in detailed roleplay, and creative in their approach.[/i]
