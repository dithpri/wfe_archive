[i]Welcome to [color=red]Eretz[/color]! This region is for nations of various ideologies, and is a Roleplaying region. The region is new, and we soon plan to create a map for the region, as well as having an in-depth and detailed world history RP, integrating many of the nations of Eretz, developing their associated histories and affecting their present statuses. To become a member, contact the founder or delegate, and a poll will be held. New members must be skilled in detailed roleplay, and creative in their approach.[/i]
