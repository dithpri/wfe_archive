The homeland of the Hearth, in all of its fire, passion, and glory. 
Nations of many different minds joined together only by geography.
Alliances to be formed, shattered, reformed, shattered, and rewritten once more.
Enemies to be made, hearts to be broken, hearths to be lit.
Come one, come all, and sit around the fire.
Sit around the Hearth, in the Hearthlands.
