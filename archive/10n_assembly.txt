The 10N Assembly is a large, cultured grouping, ruled by Little Cook with a fair hand. The compassionate, democratic, cheerful contributors are free to do what they want with their own bodies, and vote for whomever they like in elections; if they go into business.

The assembly prioritizes Education, with Healthcare, Environment, and Social Policy also on the agenda.
