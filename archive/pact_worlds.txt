The Pact Worlds is a collection of independent governments and associations within the Pact Worlds system, bound together for mutual protection and trade. It was formed in 41 AG by the Absalom Pact in response to the Veskarium&#39;s aggression toward the Golarion System, and has continued for more than 250 years to provide mutual protection from hostile forces, and facilitate interplanetary trade and law enforcement.
