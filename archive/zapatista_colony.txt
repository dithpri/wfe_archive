[i][color=grey]We were born of the night. 
We live in the night. We will die in her. 
But the light will be tomorrow for others, 
for all those who today weep at the night, 
for those who have been denied the day, 
for those for whom death is a gift, 
for those who are denied life. 
The light will be for all of them.
 
For everyone everything. 
For us pain and anguish, 
for us the joy of rebellion, 
for us a future denied, 
for us the dignity of insurrection. 
For us nothing.[/color][/i]
