[color=red]In the spirit of the founder of America&#39;s [i]Democratic[/i] Republican Party, Thomas Jefferson, all flavors of Republicans are welcome here for a free and respectful exchange of ideas.[/color]

We follow President Reagan&#39;s credo &quot;Trust, but verify.&quot;  You can begin earning our trust by attending this year&#39;s [color=blue]Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner[/color] (held annually on Reagan&#39;s Birthday) or our [color=blue]Al Smith Dinner[/color] and making a donation.

[color=blue]&#147;Our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe that America&#39;s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.&#148;[/color]
