Quote of the Month (August): &amp;quot;Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves.&amp;quot; Abraham Lincoln, 1809-1865

Aureia (AW-RE-AH), the &amp;quot;Golden Land&amp;quot;, is a collection of small, still-budding nations that feel their current stature leaves them to be ignored by the larger, older, and more powerful nations. Aureia is perceived by its residents as a peaceful, gentle place to freely grow into fresh, blossoming world powers.

Aureia only accepts nations with less than 100 million citizens, but upon entrance nations may stay as long as they so wish. Please telegraph Aureia&amp;#39;s founder, The Free Land of Loyak, or its current World Assembly Delegate if you wish to join our community.
