The Tazannian Bloodfall Empire is ruthlessly violent to all outsiders, and quick to strike out at it&#39;s enemies. We will not hesitate to invade an enemy of the Empire, though we show such hospitality and compassion to our allies. You do not play games with the Bloodfall Empire unless you want everything that you have ever built to fall by our hands.
