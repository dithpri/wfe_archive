Cold: the air and water flowing
Hard: the land we call our home
Push to keep the dark from coming
Feel the weight of what we owe

This: the song of sons and daughters
Hide the heart of who we are
Making peace to build our future
Strong, united, working &#39;till we fall

Cold: the air and water flowing
Hard: the land we call our home
Push to keep the dark from coming
Feel the weight of what we owe

This: the song of sons and daughters
Hide the heart of who we are
Making peace to build our future
Strong, united, working &#39;till we fall

And we all lift, and we&#39;re all adrift together, together
Through the cold mist, &#39;till we&#39;re lifeless together, together
