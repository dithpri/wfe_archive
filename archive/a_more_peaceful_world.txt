[b]A more peaceful world is a dream to cherish. A dream where raiders and defenders no longer control the world. A dream where the natives live in the peace they grant themselves, with no threat of invaders darkening the threshold. Perhaps one day there might be such an Elysium for all natives. 

Today, however, there is no such peace for this world. The [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] have neither intent nor obligation to give life to this idealized dream. Raiders will prevail until defenders again rise from their somnolent vigil.
