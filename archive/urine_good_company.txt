Well, hello there. Welcome to Urinetown. Not the musical of course. The place. Urinetown the musical is... Well it&#39;s a musical you&#39;ll here people referring to a lot throughout the town.

Urinetown the place of course is kind of a mythical place you understand? A BAD PLACE. A place filled with symbolism, and things like that. Years past and the water supply here dropped decisively. The use of private bathrooms became unthinkable and the governing body who runs this fair city replaced them with public amenities meaning &quot;public toilet&quot;

These people wait for hours to get into the only amenity affordable. And you can&#39;t just go in the bushes either there are harsh laws against that. So enjoy your stay and WELCOME TO URINETOWN...THE PLACE!
