Welcome to The British Liberal Nationalist Party [BLNP]
We are ideologically a far right party, however encompass ideas of civic nationalism, socialism, and liberalism. Being very progressive minded. We believe everyone deserves a choice in life. That no one should be singled out of this choice because of their race, sexuality, gender, religion, culture, status or wealth. However we also believe in creating a world where we aren&#39;t endangered by:
.over-population
.political or religious radicalism
.a disunited parliament
.a rise in privatized companies
.an environment scorched by our misconduct
.a world where our children can&#39;t be raised, and live in

There must be change, and together we are strong, and stand united.
