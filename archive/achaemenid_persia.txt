The Achaemenid Empire (also known as the First Persian Empire) was the largest empire to date at the time of its height around 500 BCE, spanning from Macedon to the Indus River valley. It was in this nation that the first monotheistic religion, Zoroastrianism, was founded. Founded by Cyrus the Great, this contiguous state lasted for almost 300 years, falling only to the advancing armies of Alexander the Accursed of Macedon.
