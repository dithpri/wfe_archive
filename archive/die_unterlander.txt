Die Unterl&auml;nder are the inhabitants of a horrible little island, mostly swamp and barren mountain, in an unspecified location in the far northern Pacific Ocean. They&#39;re so called by royal decree of the Kingdom of Kartoffeldeutschland (or Potato Germany), which has a major inferiority complex but is generally agreed to be the island&#39;s most legitimate government.
