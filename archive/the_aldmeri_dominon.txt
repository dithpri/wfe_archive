The Dominion was formed in an attempt to take control of the Imperial City and restore Elven rule to Tamriel. It is said that the three allied races were the most intelligent, patient and rational in all of Tamriel. Members of the Aldmeri Dominion believe that the short-lived and young races of Men are unfit to rule, and that this role is meant by the Divines to be filled by the Aldmeri Dominion itself.

The Aldmeri Dominon stretches over the provinces of the Summerset Isles, Valenwood and Elsweyr.
