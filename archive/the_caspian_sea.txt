The Caspian Sea (Russian: Kaspiyskoye More, Persian: Darya-ye Khezer)is a landlocked sea between Asia and Europe (European Russia). It is the world&#39;s largest inland body of water, with a surface area of 371,000 km&sup2; (143,000 sq. mi.), and therefore has characteristics common to both seas and lakes. It is often listed as the world&#39;s largest lake, though it is not a freshwater one. The sea&#146;s name derives from the ancient Kaspi peoples, who once lived in Transcaucasia to the west. Among its other historical names, Khazarsk and Khvalynsk derive from former peoples of the region, while Girkansk stems from Girkanos, &#147;Country of the Wolves.&#148;
