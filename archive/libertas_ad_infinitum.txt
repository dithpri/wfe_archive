The region Libertas ad Infinitum is founded on several principles:

1. Liberty. This means that no administrative action will be taken against anyone for mere expression of opinion. This also means that all nations have the right to govern their nation as they see fit. This principle is the primary among all.

2. Integrity. This means that the authorities are accountable to the law. Any authority found abusing their power will have swift action taken against them.

3. Democracy. This means that power and decisions will be doled democratically.

Should the founder ever step out of bounds, members are encouraged to leave and found their own region.
