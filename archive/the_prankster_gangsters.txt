Welcome to the pgn. We do roleplay that is semi-realistic. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to telegram me. Each person gets a planet of their own.
Unrelated to the roleplay, please send me an endorsement so raiders can not have the position.



this is the map, if you would like a planet, telegram me.
