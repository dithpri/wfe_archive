Welcome to the pgn. We do roleplay that is semi-realistic. You will be given a planet and you can develop it as you wish. Passive planets will get stronger over time. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to telegram me. 
Unrelated to the roleplay, please send me an endorsement so raiders can not have the position.
