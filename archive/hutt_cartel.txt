Welcome to the Hutt Cartel, a Star Wars region that seeks to be some much more than just a community for Star Wars enthusiasts, indeed we also seek to serve just about anyone, no matter if they like Star Wars or not as well as role-players, or those looking to hide from their enemies.

This region is neutral and will not join forces with other regions involved in warfare (but some of our members might be persuaded to help you), but does welcome the people of warring factions to stop by. No matter if that means to rest, or to hide, or to use us as a jumping point or puppet storage. The Hutt Cartel is a shady organization for shady people.
