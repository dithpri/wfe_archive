The Segmentum Tempestus is a planet which contains a cluster of nations, each with their respective borders and governments. Said nations maintain a ceasefire but sometimes conflicts can occur. There are no rules on how warfare may be conducted besides anything that is way too overpowered and doesn&#146;t match with the technology level. There does need to be a casus belli, or &#147;an act or event that provokes or is used to justify war.&#148; Other than that, there&#146;s a lot of freedom on what you may do or not do. Any and all RP actions are subject to being voided as people may tend to bullcrap their way through roleplay.
