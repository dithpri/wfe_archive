The Segmentum Tempestus is a section in space in the southwestern quarter of the Milky Way galaxy which contains a cluster of incredible advanced nations, each with their respective celestial bodies or planets. Said nations maintain a ceasefire but sometimes conflicts can occur. There are no rules on how warfare may be conducted besides anything that involves black holes, as they can cease life as we know it. There does need to be a casus belli, or &#147;an act or event that provokes or is used to justify war.&#148; Other than that, there&#146;s a lot of freedom on what you may do or not do. Any and all RP actions are subject to being voided as people may tend to bullcrap their way through roleplay.
