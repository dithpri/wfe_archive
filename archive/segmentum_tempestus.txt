The RP has fantasy magic and the period for the technology is the late 1690s and early 1700s where muskets and hand cannons began to appear more in armies. The era of pike and shot. The region is aware that some people who control their nations might be the greatest statesmen but the worst military leaders, so to compensate, they can ask for advice if they are not so confident in themselves when facing off another player in a formal war. Military is not the only way to have fun.
