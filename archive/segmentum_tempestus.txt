The Segmentum Tempestus is a section in space in the Southwest of the milky way galaxy which contains a cluster of nations. Each nation owns their respected planets and maintain a ceasefire but sometimes wars happen. There are no rules on how warefare should be conducted besides anything that involves black holes and there does need to be a Casus belli or &#147;an act or event that provokes or is used to justify war.&#148; Other than that, there&#146;s a lot of freedom on what you may do.
