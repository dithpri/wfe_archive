[color=dimgrey][i][b]Laboratory 17[/b] was shut down some time ago due to the...questionable ethics of their experiments. Unfortunately, government agents lacked the funding to remove the results of the experiments, and the paperwork to get that funding mysteriously disappeared. So the experiments of Laboratory 17 live on, no longer tortured by science, but still by madness...[/i][/color]
