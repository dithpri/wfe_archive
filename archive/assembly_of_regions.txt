[b][color=darkblue]The Assembly of Regions is an interregional organization built on the principles of democracy, participation of members, interregional cooperation, and the betterment of the communities within our member regions. We work to ensure that members have, not only their regional communities, but also an international community to turn to for activities and interaction.
