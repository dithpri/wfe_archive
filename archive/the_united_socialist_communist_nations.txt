The United Socialist Communist Nations (USCN) is a &quot;group&quot; of nations dependent on the idea of Communism and/or Socialism of any said type.

We operate in a similar way to the United Nations, holding General Assemblies and having a Security Council.

We speak primarily in English.
We operate on the basis of mutual respect and meetings throughout the group.
We host meetings in our Discord Server between periods of time.
