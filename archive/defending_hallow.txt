[b]Hello and Welcome. We are a city high in the mountains.  In the center of that city, is a hallow.  Welcome to Defending Hallow[/b]

[color=darkblue]We are a fairly old region and most of our old inhabitants are long dead.  But Join if you want to be part of a rich and growing history.
Please endorse your delegate,[nation]Taco Bell Republic[/nation].  We are a retired region.  Most of us are just looking to be social and not engage in any high risk military actions.
We hope you enjoy your visit![/color]
