The Lands of Isolation are an enormous space in the middle of the Third Ocean. Nations in this region do not care for influence or niceties with other nations, only to be left alone to their own devices. There is no such thing as a regional government here, and your nation is not forced to be social with other nations, however may be if wanted. This region is not a fan of the World Assembly, as we do not believe in being externally governed, and that nations should just be left alone.
