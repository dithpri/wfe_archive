Welcome to Mbhetsa continent

&quot;Africa is luxury but one of the necessities of life.&quot; -Henry Ward Beecher

Mbhetsa is founded on the ideal of two simple words: &quot;Community First.&quot; Other regions will offer you government, activity, Minerals , excitement; we have these things. What Africa has to offer is the unique Community First mentality, and a first-class community.

Community First means... 
- We are an open and respectful society, 
- Our focus is the community; bells and whistles are secondary, and 
- The best way to get something out of Africa is to become an active member of the community!
