Welcome to the homepage for the SLDC.

Shen Lao is home to some of the worlds most authoritative, corrupt, abusive governments.
They have joined together, and have a running international operation of undermining WA Resolutions. The de-facto leader of this group, Thao Yen, is particularly corrupt and abusive with his powers and wishes against democracy in the region; blocking the elected WA Delegate entry on terms of his origin.

They need to be dismembered, if to make the world a little better.

[b]**The SLDC is not an official department of the WA, it is collection of collective ideals presented by WA officials from Jinwoy.[/b]
