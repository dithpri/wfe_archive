A Sagittarius Constellation nebula discovered by Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux in 1745. It is approximately 6000 light years from Earth. It contains the Omega space station, which serves as the central hub of the Terminus Systems, as well as the unmapped Omega 4 Relay.

Most of its explorable environs is the territory of criminal elements. The Kalash, hailing from the planet Eingana, control much of the resourcing and colonization efforts, and there is substantial pirate and mercenary presence on various worlds.
