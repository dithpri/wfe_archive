This is [region]The Legions of Heaven and Hell[/region]
You are welcome to your stay, and stay as long as you like at that.
We chat idly here, but we also Role-Play if you are into that sorta thing. (No ERPing on the RMB, please. Keep that in your Telegrams.)
We will have a form of Hierarchy... once we gain more members in the Region. 
No Drama. Anyone who starts it will be banjected, and if they want back in, I will hold a poll for the residents to decide if they should be given another chance. 

Boss:
Fixer:
Sev:

(If you get my roles, I will love you eternally)

NOTE: If you aren&amp;#39;t a raider and wish for embassies, I will accept. 
If you are a raider and wish for embassies, Telegram me at [nation]Kyndercorp[/nation] to discuss.
