This is a Region used mainly for Role Plays. It is open to any who wouId like to join, and I heartily encourage new Nations to ask how to RP (Role Play) and anyone would be happy to explain it. If they refuse to, they will answer to Jason. 

And if you get tired of life here, you are welcome to move to Next Generation Alliance. They will welcome you there.

For RP&amp;#39;s:
OOC: Out Of Character
IC: In Character

The Legions of Heaven and Hell is located on a very large planet named Immensus. Given the name, which is Latin for &amp;quot;Endless,&amp;quot; you can visualize it now... almost, at least. 

The Brains: Shadow Hunters
The Most Random: Xexorir/Army of the Unseen
The Beauty: SilverBloods
That One Guy You Don&amp;#39;t Want To Piss Off: Kyndercorp
