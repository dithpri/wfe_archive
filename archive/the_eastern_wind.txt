- Situated in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, the Eastern Wind is a military/economic alliance with the main goal of helping neighboring countries in times of dire needs. The Eastern Wind has no previous experience with war (thank god), but if have to, we&#39;ll show no mercy.

- Outside countries from Western Europe, etc, have the right to join this alliance. The goal of this alliance, in the long run, is to let our influence be spread to as far east as possible.
