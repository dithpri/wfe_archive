First founded by House of Hawkings, this Hawk-themed region is currently a  nest of[B][region]The Black Hawks[/region][/B].[hr]

The Kingdom of Hawks was, from 927 to 1707, a sovereign nest to the northwest of Hawken. At its height, Hawks spanned from the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Hawken &amp;amp; several smaller Nests. Hawks as a nest began on 12 July 927 AD after a gathering of birds from throughout Hawken at Squaklet Point, Beakin, but broadly traces its origins to the Feathery-Talon nest of Hawken &amp;amp; the petty nests that followed &amp;amp; ultimately united.[hr]
