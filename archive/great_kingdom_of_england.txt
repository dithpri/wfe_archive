First founded by House of Lancaster, this English-themed region is currently a [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_british_commonwealth][b]British Commonwealth[/b][/url] region.[hr]

The Kingdom of England was, from 927 to 1707, a sovereign state to the northwest of Europe. At its height, England spanned the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain &amp;amp; several smaller islands. England as a state began on 12 July 927 AD after a gathering of kings from throughout Britain at Eamont Bridge, Cumbria, but broadly traces its origins to the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain &amp;amp; the petty states that followed &amp;amp; ultimately united.[hr]
