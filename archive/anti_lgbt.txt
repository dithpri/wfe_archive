I don&#39;t support LGBTQIA rights. Marriage is between a man and a woman. There are only two genders. Gender &quot;identity&quot; is just confusion. You all have the right to exist, but your life is sin but just like almost every sin, it&#39;s a forgivable sin. Also if you send me a telegram calling me anything that violates the site rules, you will have your telegram deleted and you will be blocked
