In the year 2020, a third international conflict broke out and ten years later, it turned nuclear. By the year 2050, Earth had been decimated and the surviving humans were scattered across the devastated planet. At this time, aliens stumble upon Earth and rescued the surviving humans. The humans were taken to far away star systems with planets that were connected through an interplanetary alliance. This alliance was the League of Planets. The League of Planets was the intergalactic version of the UN on Earth. 500 years later, humans have been fully integrated into the League of Planets and have been active in interstellar politics.
