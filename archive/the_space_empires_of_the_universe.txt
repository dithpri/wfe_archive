Welcome to the Region, please Endorse Crazyland of Dictators, for now (for protection from raiders).
Main focus: Exploration of Space, Conquer the Universe and Exact power in the World Assembly.
Time period: PMT and FT.
Rules: 
1) Everyone within this region and the AIP is an ally, therefore attacking a neighboring country (without just cause) will get you banned from the region and branded an enemy.
2) Must be a member and follow the rules of the AIP.
Suggest:
WA members must follow the WA rules, therefore suggest creating a Protectorate nation to handle your dirty work.
Since Nuclear Arms are banned from the WA, your Protectorate Nation should have them.
Goal of the Day: -Recruit.
