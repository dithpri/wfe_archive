[b]&amp;#127796; Welcome to Goami &#150; The Embassy Lounge &amp;#127749;[/b]

You&#146;ve just stumbled into Goami, a region where embassies come to rest, visitors drop by from time to time, and the bartender has been missing since 2023.

Grab a seat. Order a drink. Contemplate existence. If you see something strange in RMB, just nod and pretend it&#146;s normal.
