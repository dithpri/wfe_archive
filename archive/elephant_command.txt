ELEPHANT Command, is a region dedicated to fun and other activities players can enroll in, such as military-related roleplaying and elections for spots in the EC Command Government.

Make sure to endorse our regional delegate, The Republic of Bertier.

Roleplaying games will commence as soon as we get 25 nations or more, to ensure we have a good game. We will also hold election when we hit 25 nations.
