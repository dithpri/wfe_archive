Located east of the Splatlands, the Inkadia region is home to the biggest metropolis in the area, Inkopolis City. Various cultures have spawned from the sports and fashion scenes here.

This region is NOT a serious roleplay effort; while Splatoon roleplay and content is both welcome and encouraged, it is not the main focus of this region.
This region exists to casually interact with the game mechanics of NationStates. Any activity past that is a pleasant bonus.
Please set your expectations accordingly.
