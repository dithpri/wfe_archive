[hr][b]The Economics Advisory![/b]
[color=#04E45D]This week&#39;s advice comes from a issue called &quot;Give us money!&quot; In that issue poets in your country will be asking for funding to improve their business. From my experience, funding your poets increases sales in poetry and other books, which in turn, brings your economy classification up a level.(Good to strong) And gives you a banner for providing quality libraries for your citizens.[/color]
