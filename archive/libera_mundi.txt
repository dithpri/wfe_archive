Lore(BASIC): The terms of the Treaty of Versailles that ended WW1 were much harsher, with a German Nazi government coming to power in 1922. A second Russian civil war brings down the Soviet Union and the germans invade and install a fascist dictatorship in 1924. The Great Depression ends in 1932 as the US helps a new democratic government in the former USSR come to power(New Transeurasia). WW2 happens and New Transeurasia takes over most of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe(Except Greece). NATO is formed with the US as a founding member, and practically every nation in Europe either being a founding member or joining at a later date.
