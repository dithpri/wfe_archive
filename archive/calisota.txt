&amp;#127912; [b][region]Calisota[/region][/b] is a fictional U.S. state, created by Carl Barks in his story &quot;The Gilded Man&quot; (Four Color #422) and used in comic books produced by the Walt Disney Company. [b][nation]-Duckburg-[/nation][/b] is among the cities located there. Presumably, so are Goosetown, Mouseton, and most likely St. Canard, since the Audubon Bay Bridge connects St. Canard to Duckburg.

Although it has many fictional elements and a variable climate, Calisota is probably roughly equivalent to Northern California. Duckburg has occasionally been said to be seated north of Los Angeles and San Francisco. A map in Don Rosa&#39;s The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck shows that Calisota covers the part of California north of Sacramento.
