Post-Civil War South Africa has caused a chain reaction of chaos throughout Southern Africa and beyond. Platinum and other commodity prices have skyrocketed, food has become scarce and war crimes have become rampant. A brief period of calm has come across the region as many new countries and identities begin to consolidate their power, but a state of war still officially exists despite minor ceasefires. The future of Southern Africa is uncertain, but its peoples continue looking beyond the horizon for their respective nations towards opportunity. The rains down in Africa are blessed and bloody.
