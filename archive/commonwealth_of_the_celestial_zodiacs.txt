[color=royalblue][b]The Commonwealth of the Celestial Zodiacs[/b] is a vast continent filled with magic and wonder. The continent is divided into 24 sovereign states, each governed by one of the Zodiac Ladies&#151;divine manifestations of the twelve signs of the Eastern zodiac and the twelve signs of the Western zodiac. These powerful beings are not mere figureheads, but living embodiments of their celestial signs, wielding immense magical abilities tied to the cycles of the heavens. Though each Zodiac Lady rules her realm independently, all are bound by a divine covenant forged eons ago to preserve harmony across the land. [/color]
