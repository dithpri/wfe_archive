Welcome to The Swedish Army!

President: [nation]Y U NO LIVE HERE[/nation]
Vice President: [nation]Castlevania II[/nation]
Secretary: [nation]Black Lantern[/nation]



Not much to worry about, we&amp;#39;re not really an army or into raiding. Just some friends who made a region. And of course, anyone else is welcome to join. - Castlevania II

A republic of freedom, and majestic whales; we wish for peace, and harmony between the lands. (And if required, we go to war.) You already got the welcome telegram, so you pretty much know about the place already. If you need more clarification, just shoot me a telegram at Scotschcavalia! Thanks for joining.

ATTENTION OUTSIDERS: We are looking for a WA member who knows what they&amp;#39;re doing.
