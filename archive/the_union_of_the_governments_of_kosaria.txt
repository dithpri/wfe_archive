After a long civil bloodbath of opposing ideologies, The Old Empire of Kosaria split into 4 separate, but United Countries: Kosaria, Western Kosaria, Eastern Kosaria, and Northern Kosaria. The opposing political leaders all agreed to be under a singular Union, having no political authority of the other, but sharing the same cultural bounds, same currency, and same defense systems. Under the Doctrine of the UGK (The Union of the Governments of Kosaria), there would be a free, centrist land, Central Kosaria, dedicated to diplomatic relations of all countries and serve as zone that all are welcome to.
