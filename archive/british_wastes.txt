It is the year 2381, and the ruins of the old United Kingdom, destroyed first in the fires of the Resource Wars, then annihilated in the Great War, is now home to a number of warring kingdoms and warlords vying for control, like during the time after the Romans pulled out thousands of years ago. Society here in the Wastes has regressed back to medieval times, with swords and shields being most prominent. For the warring kingdoms, it is a sign of power to use Old World firearms and technology. The Kingdom of Cahiff isn&amp;#39;t one of them. Holding on to only the Old World city of Cardiff, the Kingdom enjoys relative peace and security from its neighbors to the east and south.
