[b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]The Eastern Pacific Armada[/url] brought some new sailor recruits to visit your region as part of R/D for pride!

[color=#e8ef2b]Your region was immensely interesting, and we encountered many new food and drink that was traded for this WFE![/color] 
 
[color=#194b19]We also met some savage barbarians attempting to assault our ships, and we promptly blasted them out of the water. Their shipwrecks will soon be reclaimed by the sea.[/color] 

[color=#e8ef2b]If you would like to enlist with the EPSA to see the world, come join us![/color]
