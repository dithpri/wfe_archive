The Chaotic Nations of Misfits Alliance (CNMA) is a recently created region that follows the ideal of: &quot;Your Nation. Your Rules&quot;. However, the nations conforming the CNMA have reached an understanding among them to keep a diplomatic and amicable relationship; showing support to each other when needed. The CNMA doesn&#39;t believe belligerence, conflict, and war are the way to go when solving disputes within itself or with other regions. However, they will defend themselves if threatened or attacked.
