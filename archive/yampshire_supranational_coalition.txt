A union of various countries formed by New Yampshire for mutual protection and prosperity. All nations within this pact are effectively part of a larger collective, similar to the dynamic of state versus federal power. However, the nations retain a high level of authority within their own bounds, only complying with the directives of the representative council when its for the benefit of all parties involved. In all aspects, this union leans to the left of the political spectrum, however it varies greatly on the level of personal and political liberties granted to the citizens.
