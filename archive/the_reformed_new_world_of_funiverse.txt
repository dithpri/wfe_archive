After the collapse of the New World of Funiverse, a lone vassal state remained through the nuclear firestorm. In the early years, after the clouds parted and the acid rains ceased to fall, it was assumed there was nothing left in the old homeland but the scattered remnants of her people, but something has survived.
The Black Blight was not eliminated as it was hoped, the bombardment was all for naught, the cancer builds upon itself once again.
Calling all former members! Rejoice, for your New World is here! 
Bring your huddled masses, your battered and weary, let us rebuild what was once a grand empire. 
This time we will achieve victory or perish together.
