Hello New or Existing Citizens of the Steel Void
As the founder of this region me and the delegate will try to make you feel happy.
I encourage you to post on the regional message board if you need help with issues or if you just want to say hi.
I also encourage you to join the World Assembly so that our voice can be heard
(its what all the cool kids are doing)
 and please endorse fellow nations in the region so we may become more powerful.
Also no hate mail or feuds if so me or the delegate will personally ban you.
