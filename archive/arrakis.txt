[b][color=#cc3300]Arrakis, known simply as &amp;quot;Dune&amp;quot; to the natives, is a land of endless deserts, gigantic sand worms, and fearsome coriolis sand storms. Dune is the only source of the rare and extremely valuable spice melange, coveted by all due to its ability to enchance life and even bend the fabric of space and time. The recent discovery of said substance has brought numerous empires to [i]Arrakis[/i], much to the dismay of the native Fremen.[/color][/b]
