[b][u]Allied States of Scandinavia[/b][/u]

[I]A free confederation of Scandinavian States, divided in ideology but united in culture. Divided, they stand as weak. As small. As isolated. But united, we stand as strong. As great. As together. Only together will Scandinavia be the strong power it deserves to be in this world. We are the forefathers of the world&amp;#39;s greatest nations. Together, we will overtake those nations.
