A collective of the nations comprising the vast continents and islands of Urlasiandia. Our annual meetings were established to maintain peace and prosperity. The representantives of each nation participate in an auyuasca journey together in the Ivainian jungles to discover our paths foreward. Member Nations are free to live how they see fit, but please for everyone&#39;s sake, just don&#39;t mess with Apaloosia&#39;s boats. Don&#39;t mind the Aussie, he&#39;s really a nice bloke. We have vikings too.
(This is basically my alterate history world, but any are welcome.)

Love your brother, love your sister, love you children, love your land.
