A collective of the nations comprising the vast continent and islands of Urlasiandia. Our annual meetings were established to maintain the peace and prosperity of the region. The representantives of each nation participate in an auyuasca journey together in the Ivainian jungles to discover our paths foreward. Member Nations are free to live how they see fit, but please for everyone&#39;s sake, just don&#39;t mess with Apaloosia&#39;s boats. And don&#39;t mind the Aussie, he&#39;s really a nice bloke.

We fly no flags but our own.
Down with the WA. 
Reject the one world governmental conspiracy.
