[b]Note: If WA Delegate alters or expel the authority of current President, Vice, Senate, Representative, and other officers, it will get banned.
WA Delegate is lower than President in our region but higher than Vice President. Its actual Executive authority: can appoint an Officer(like the military, communications, economy, and etc.)or a low representative or lawyer.[/b]
And do not expel the current 27 countries.
