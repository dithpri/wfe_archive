Our region is the main region. Our colony&#39;s name is New World Jazz.
Note: If WA Delegate alters or expel the authority of current SWA, Vice, Senate, Representative, and both officers, it will get banned.
WA Delegate is lower than SWA Delegate in our region but higher than Vice President. Its actual Executive authority: can appoint an Officer(like military, communications, economy, and etc.)or a low representative or lawyer.
And do not expel the current 19 countries.
Aside from that, WA Delegate can do anything freely.
(We also elect a new Vice President.)
