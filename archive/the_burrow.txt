[b][color=#6F4E37]The Burrow[/b][/color] was the family home of the Weasley family, located on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. It was a thoroughly magical dwelling that became a second home to Harry Potter. 

The Burrow was held up with magic and was cluttered inside, but welcoming at the same time. Following the death of Albus Dumbledore, the Burrow became the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. &#151;harrypotter.fandom.com
