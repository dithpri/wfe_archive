We&amp;#39;re just here to play an online game instead of going outside and socialising.

What&amp;#39;s wrong with spending a day reading and looking up gifs of your OTP? If you, too, are a fangirl/boy, then move to The Burrow! We don&amp;#39;t give a flying flobberworm about actually taking this game seriously. One of our founders is an evil dictator (Slytherin), another a benevolent Queen (Ravenclaw) and the last a happy-go-lucky Empress (Ravenpuff).
Join us today if you like Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Sherlock, A Song of Ice and Fire, LOTR, Team StarKid, The IT Crowd, vampires (not Twilight), Once Upon a Time, lizards, pizza, fire, porn, and rabbits.
