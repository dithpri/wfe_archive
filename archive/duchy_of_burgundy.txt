[b]The Duchy of Burgundy[/b] (Latin: [i]Ducatus Burgundiae[/i], French: [i]Duch&eacute; de Bourgogne[/i], Dutch: [i]Hertogdom Bourgondi&euml;[/i]) existed from 1032 as a successor of an ancient and prestigious patrimony and a large division of the lands of the Kingdom of the Burgundians. The duchy roughly conforms to the borders and territories of the modern region of Burgundy, but its dukes came to own considerable possession of numerous French and Imperial fiefs further north in the Low Countries collectively known as the Burgundian Netherlands. In its own right, it was one of the larger ducal territories that existed at the time of the emergence of Early Modern Europe from Medieval Europe, reminiscent of the Middle Frankish realm of Lotharingia.
