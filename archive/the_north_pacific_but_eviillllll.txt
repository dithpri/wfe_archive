[b]Evil North Pacific[/b]
[i]&#147;The North Pacific, but it&#146;s evil&#148;[/i]
Where the democracy is gone, the debate dust, but the rum still plentiful! 

Welcome to the glorious realm of TNP But Evil (TNPBE)! The exact opposite of  TNP, TNPBE is an absolute dictatorial monarchy led by a  warlord. Who just wants to be left alone to his evilness!
