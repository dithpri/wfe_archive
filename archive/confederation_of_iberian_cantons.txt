This confederation is a supranational project with a spanish cantonalism movement origins. Egara won independence from Catalonia when this won its independence from the Third Spanish Republic. Then, Skotady (in south of Egara) won independence from Catalonia and rejected to be annexed to the People&amp;#39;s Republic of Egara, but Skotadians and Egarenish governments signed a treaty of confederation with the hope that other Iberian locations abet the New Cantonalist Movement and join them to the Confederation of Iberian Cantons.
