[color=green]Islamya[/color] is a region of freedom, democracy and justice as per tenets of modern civilization. 
We are on the lookout for active members who shall contribute to the growth of a non-sectarian, secular , tolerant and vibrant democracy. 
At the moment, the region is going through a revolution and hence there might be minor hiccups, but in the long run, the region will rise to be an inclusive , pluralistic role playing community.

Meanwhile, [color=blue]Christmas[/color] celebrations are on and citizens are requested to take part in full swing to remember the birth of the Lord  !!
