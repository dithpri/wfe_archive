Our father, who lifts in heaven,
Hallowed be thy gain,
Thy swole be come,
Arms will be done, On earth,
as it lifts in heaven,
Give us this day our daily pump,
And forgive us our rest days,
As we have also forgiven our spotters,
And lead us not into cross-fit,
But deliver us from leg day,
May thou bless these gains I&#39;m about to receive,
Amen.&amp;#65279;
