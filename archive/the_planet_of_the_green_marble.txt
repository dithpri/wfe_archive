In 13 000 b.C. Osiris Dilumasson gained the control of The Four Elements by pouring out his soul to a small gem. In 472 A.D. Christians destroyed the gem and the heretics that worshipped it. It took over 15 centuries for people to figure out how to join the parts back together, but after the World War (1914-1926) it was decided that the world must unite, and so must the Gem.
