The [b]Paraway[/b] is an interdimensional highway that connects various isolated realms to the [nation]Paracosmos[/nation]. The system is managed by the [nation]Waji[/nation], a curious telepathic race of benign humanoids. Embassies permit communications, but otherwise trade and physical access to the system is only available for interior realms.
