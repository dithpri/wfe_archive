[b]Paraway[/b] is an interdimensional highway that connects various isolated realms. The system is managed by the Waji, a curious telepathic race of peaceful humanoids. Embassies permit communications, but otherwise trade and physical access to the system is only available for connected (i.e. within the region) realms.
