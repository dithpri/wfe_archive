Welcome to this wonderful region known as [region]Yuri Paddochi[/region]!

First thing you might want to know, we&#39;re [b]democratic,[/b] so we hold votes on who the next Delegate should be. But, you [b]DO NOT[/b] need to be democratic to join. You can decide whether or not you want to participate in the voting that is happening, the choice is yours. 

We might update the rules factbook as time goes on, so please, read it every 2 weeks to keep updated. And even if nothing happened, you just might need a refresher. Also, keep updated on the polls, we just might have something to keep you entertained for about 10 seconds. If we haven&#39;t emphasized this enough, contact our staff for help. [nation]Gaccu[/nation], [nation]Ryoseirui[/nation] and [nation]Maxcon[/nation].

We all hope you enjoy your stay in [region]Yuri Paddochi[/region]!
