The Ashlands of America is a post-apocalyptic region inspired by the devastated, irradiated, and factionalized remnants of the United States following a catastrophic global nuclear war. Each nation within the Ashlands represents a unique faction, ideology, or survivor culture, all rising from the scorched ruins of the old world.

Despite the decay of civilization, these nations cling to purpose&#151;some reborn in democratic hope, others ruled by might, doctrine, or ancestral memory. Cooperation is tenuous. War is frequent. But all know this truth: humanity endures.
