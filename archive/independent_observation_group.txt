Welcome to the IOG, this region exists for those who find some of the policies of the WA to be objectionable while still wanting to be a cooperative group.

It is for this reason that this region was founded, we found the actions taken by adversarial groups in the WA to be overextending their reach on the grounds of Human rights to which there is no legitimate claim. We wish to remain as cooperative in so far as we are able, but do not wish to give over all our self-governance to those not within our borders.
