Context: Set in an alternative timeline where events of the 20th and 21st century diverged drastically. By 2054, the world is clinging to humanity and is grappling with the consequences of the Third World War.

Overview: The timeline of The Microcosm begins with a shift in 2032, when a catastrophic event similar to the Great Dying occurred, exterminating more than half of all animal life, turning many territories into wastelands, and many seas dried up. All of this set humanity on a radically different path.
