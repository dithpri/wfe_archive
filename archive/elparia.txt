[quote=new_ducklands;28882023]Also, one more week left on that RP before it begins. Check the live updated list in #announcements (In Discord, duh) and pick a leftover country! We still have some countries that would be great, such as [strike]Spain[/strike](taken) and Yugoslavia![/quote]
A new RP is up, and [i]anyone[/i] can join! Check the discord for more details.
