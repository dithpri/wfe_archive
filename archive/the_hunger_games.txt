Hello there Capitol or District Citizen! We are a group of Hunger games Enthusiasts who both RP in the world of Hunger Games as well as have our own Games on our discord!


Hunger games simulations exist all over the internet. The problem is, everything is randomized. The winner is determined by chance. This discord fixes that. We host games once every 3 weeks where the results are determined by player&#39;s actions, decisions and abilities. These games are totally player-based and human-ran. Many have said this is the closest you can get to the Hunger Games without actually going into the Games!
