Welcome to the Eulias Frontier, a land far to the East where Role Players roam free across these lands, creating stories on people and nations as they go. You are welcome to join us. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you are new at Role Playing and need a place to start out, or an old time Role Player looking for a place to relax. All Role Players are welcome to the region and may call this place their home.

This is a land without regional governments and brutal politics. This is a land without the controversy of gameplay. This is a land for Role Players to relax and grow in their writing.
