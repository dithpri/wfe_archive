Elections on the 18th of every month. 
I can not change as the WA Delegate, so if you support the leaders policies, endorse me. I have transfered all control over to him except I have the WA vote. I vote on the will of the leader, who represents the nation&#39;s here. More endorsements I have, the more votes we get, and the more we can change.  (I being the Legion Imperial)
Leader represents our collective, so if we feel he is not good, as a group we can vote him out of office, and vote someone else in to create a new election.
BE HONEST-DON&#39;T VOTE YOURSELF
