Elections on the 18th of every month. 
Leader represents our collective, so if we feel he is not good, as a group we can vote him out of office, and vote someone else in to create a new election.
BE HONEST-DON&#39;T VOTE YOURSELF

We currently have the following political parties
-The Kek Military Protectorate
-The Kek Socialist Workers Party
