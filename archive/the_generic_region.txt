To be part of the Generic Region is to devote your life to Grinch Bab. If you do not comply with this request, you will be hunted for sport. Once we find you, you will be beaten to death with a rusty club. Then you will be fed to the animals in the death pit of doom. If you decide to comply, you will be treated as an ally and will be backed by all of the Generic Region. As for the history of the Generic Region, we were driven from a distant planet known as &quot;Nirn&quot; to get away from a war caused by political tension between an Empire and an Aldmari Dominion. How we got here on earth was a long story, but in short, we took a Dwarven space craft off of Nirn to get here. Now, we spend our days worshiping Grinch Bab!
