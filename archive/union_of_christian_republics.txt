After we brought freedom to America, justice to Europe, the Gospel to the World, we created the UCR to defend Christian Nations against any threat. Many times we have suffered through hard long times and at all times we will defend the weak and the poor and those you cannot defend themselves. In God we Trust and in Our Lord Jesus Christ we will forever trust, Amen.
