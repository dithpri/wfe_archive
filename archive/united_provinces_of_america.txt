[color=red]&quot;E pluribus unum&#148;[/color][/b]

Newly founded, it is our aim to become the largest and best American themed region in the whole of NationStates. Taking inspiration from the politics of the early Republic, we will go back and step into the shoes of the Founding Fathers. Together as a community we will create an offsite forum run under a federal system of government and build a strong, powerful region.
