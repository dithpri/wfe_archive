The [b]Tripartite Pact[/b], also known as the [b][region]Berlin Pact[/region][/b] was an agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan signed in Berlin on 27 September 1940 by, respectively, Adolf Hitler, Galeazzo Ciano and Sabur&amp;#333; Kurusu. It was a defensive military alliance that was eventually joined by Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, as well as by the German client state of Slovakia . Yugoslavia&#39;s adherence provoked a coup d&#39;&eacute;tat in Belgrade, and Italy and Germany responded by invading Yugoslavia and partitioning the country. The resulting Italo-German client state of Croatia joined the pact on 15 June 1941. --Wikipedia[hr]
