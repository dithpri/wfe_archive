[b][i]Welcome to [region]The Jade Spires[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This forest is ancient. The trees here have stood for untold generations and their wood is more durable than most stone. It is said, truthfully, that no known tool in Armello can cut them, so people have let them be.

Elyssia, with her interest in architecture, has come here to study the trees. She hopes to devise tools capable of harvesting the trees&#39; lumber for the benefit of all. Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points will help inspire her and claim the woods!
