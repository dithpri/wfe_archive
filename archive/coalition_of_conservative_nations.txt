We are a Coalition of Nations committed to Traditional Values, Fiscal Responsibility, and Small Government.
We oppose all forms of authoritarianism, whether from the radical left&#151;Communism, Socialism, and ANTIFA&#151;or from the far right&#151;Fascism, Nazism, and Racism.

We uphold liberty, national sovereignty, and the dignity of all peoples. United by shared heritage and respect for order, we pledge to defend freedom and preserve the traditions that sustain civilization.
