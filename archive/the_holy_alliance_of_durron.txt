After the Great Durronion Civil War, which saw the western half of the Durron continent fighting the eastern half of the Durron continent over whether they should grant the nations under the GNK(Greater Nations of Kuraku) alliance independence or not, the Ten Holy Nation&#39;s of the Durron continent permanently split off into two different factions-one of these factions was HAD, or the Holy Alliance of Durron. Bound together by faith, brotherhood, and the sword, these six nations lend their special forces(known as Dragon Knights) to fighting evil and injustices across their splendid continent. They are Durron Hi, Durron Mori, Durron Kuji, Durron Numa, Durron Koya, and Durron Kochi.
