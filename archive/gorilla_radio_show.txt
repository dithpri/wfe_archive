October 11th, 2021. A radio transmission is heard faintly. Through the static, you can hear it faintly: Chimpanzee screaming.

November 1st, 2022. A seismic anomaly. NationStates&#39; greatest scientists are baffled. A fully formed radio tower of unknown origin has emerged from the ground in the Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania. Landmasses accumulate around it, whorling in a screaming, gnashing vortex. At the center - Chimpanzees. Billions and billions of Chimpanzees.

In their hands, an anomaly exists to separate them from the extant wild population surrounding them. A can of Pabst Blue Ribbon each, and the keys to your parents&#39; Ford Escape. And brother?

They&#39;re about to start driving.
