[hr][color=#8C840D][b]Note:[/b] Catholic voted to eliminate the offsite government and its constitution in favor of moving all official activities to the NationStates website.  If you&#39;re interested in helping us write a new constitution, please post on the regional message board.  We want our new government to be small and simple; we want to conduct all votes by means of in-game polling.[/color]
