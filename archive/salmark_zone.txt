[b][u]ATTENTION[/u][/b]

News has arrived of a &#39;zombie outbreak&#39;. Efforts to contain this hazardous infection have so far been unsuccessful.
To combat this issue we [b]must[/b] work on a [b]cure[/b].
For this reason, we will temporarily [b]close the regional borders[/b] and [b]eject any nation that does not cooperate in our efforts[/b],
until the threat has been eradicated.

[b]Stay sheltered and avoid contact.[/b]

Good luck.
