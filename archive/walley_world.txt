Welcome to [b]Wallys World[/b], a region forged in fun, friendship, and the occasional cross-country road trip. Inspired by [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Vacation]the legendary Griswold family vacation[/url], we stand united in our quest for adventure.

Every nation here is bound by an unbreakable code: [b]have fun, be cool, and help your neighbors[/b].

[i]&#147;Sorry folks, park&#146;s OPEN!&#148;[/i]
