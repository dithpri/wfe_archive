[b]&#134; Teutonic Order &#134;[/b]
The Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem
[i]Ordo domus Sanct&aelig; Mari&aelig; Theutonicorum Hierosolymitanorum[/i]

The Teutonic Order carried the spirit and traditions of the great military religious orders of the Middle Ages far into the modern period.  No earlier date for the foundation of the order than 1190 is given on recognized authority, its actual beginning, like that of the other orders of its kind, being humble and obscure.
