This region was effectively disbanded and destroyed by its delegate, Texacoe in August 2013.  It is preserved here as a memorial to that tumultuous time, and so that no enemy may claim it as their own.

The original Federal Islands was founded on September 5, 2011 by [nation=short]Neutricland[/nation], who returned to (then abandoned) TFI2!  It was refounded on September 11, 2013 by [nation=short]The Federal Islands Regent[/nation], a puppet of [nation=short]Shallowell[/nation].  Any who wish to contact the direct successor to this region should visit [region]The Federal Islands 2nd Gen[/region], and not [region]The Federal Islands 2[/region], as they would have you think.  Or contact people here.  Suit yourself.
