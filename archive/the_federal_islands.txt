This region was effectively disbanded and destroyed by its delegate, [nation=short]Texacoe[/nation] in August 2013.  It is preserved here as a memorial to that tumultuous time, and so that no enemy may claim it as their own, as well as to function as an embassy of sorts for TFI2 nations.

The original Federal Islands was founded on September 5, 2011 by The Federal Republic of Neutricland, who is now passed.  It was refounded on September 11, 2013 by [nation=short]The Federal Islands Regent[/nation], a puppet of [nation]Shallowell[/nation].  Any who wish to contact the direct successor to this region should visit [region]The Federal Islands 2nd Gen[/region].  Or contact people here.  Suit yourself.
