The United Global Powers was founded in 1942 as the Unity of only the best nations and governments availabe. Together these nations stand, together we fight. The United Global Powers seek to establish unity in the world and an end to all major wars. But, unfortunately, realize that in order to create and ensure long lasting peace we must take up arms. If the world wants peace, it must prepare for war. The United Global Powers is ready to stand and fight for that belief for the future of our nations.
