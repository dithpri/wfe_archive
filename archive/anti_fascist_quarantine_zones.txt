Repository of former fascist nations and [nation]trashika[/nation] puppet.
[b]Remove fascism![/b]
I used to be a fascist, but I realized I was wrong. I really believed in a better world, I fought for a long time to give freedom of speech to fascists and even promoted it. But I was wrong, I only promoted a racist and overbearing monster. Fascists, change in the name of freedom!
[b][nation]Trashika[/nation] apologizes for the evil he caused and is committed to the anti-fascist struggle.[/b]
[nation]Trashika[/nation] wants to make up for it, that&#39;s why the nation of [nation]Trje[/nation] was created.
