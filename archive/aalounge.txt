Current Game: The Resistance!

The Resistance, update 1: The first leader will be [nation]Lesser Cashistan[/nation]. He has the responsibility of delegating with the rest of the players and deciding three players to occupy the first team. After he proposes a team, it will go to vote and everyone will publicly vote &#39;Aye&#39; or &#39;Nay&#39; (majority rules). Discussion is key here, use the discord to debate who should be drafted to the team and save the RMB for posts that need to be pinned as to reduce clutter. For more information, refer to my post on the RMB. Good luck, trust noone.

Game 1 - In Progress. (Players:  Conch, Wars Verai, Tieopia, ZebraEz, Helaw, Cashistan, and Antartican Republic.
