Welcome to the Empire of Pelanthium!
We are an accepting nation who does not discriminate.
Feel free to ask questions on how the roleplay works. 
For new nations:
-Look at the dispatch called &amp;quot;RP Map&amp;quot; and choose a free country to found your nation!
-However you can only start with a country around the size of Mexico
-To work out how many troops you are, a piece of land size of Egypt is worth 100,000 troops.
-To take more land you must RP a takeover 
-Feel free to telegram me if you have questions
