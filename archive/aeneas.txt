Aeneas is a Modern-Tech, human-only role-playing region with three main focuses: realism, fairness and consensus. We take everyone&#146;s views into account, no matter how new to the region they are, and we work hard to create driven RPs within an atmosphere of fun and co-operation. 

Aeneas is all about quality RPing regardless of what the story tells. As long as you are considerate of others&#146; views, you can lead your nation down the path of malevolent dictatorship or on towards the perfect republic. If all of this interests you, then why not give Aeneas a try!
