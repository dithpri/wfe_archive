[b]Welcome to Novapax![/b]

[color=Darkblue]Here in Novapax, we strive for an active  and engaged community that can get on with developing their nation&#39;s identity and interests at their own pace. The forums are the best place to do that, so if you are interested in sports, economics, culture or geography, there will always be a thread for you. If you are new to the region, don&#39;t hesitate to give an introduction of your nation in the RMB.[/color]
