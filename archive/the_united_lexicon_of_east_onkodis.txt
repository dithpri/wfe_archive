After long periods of warfare between rival nations, and a series of devastating national disasters, and in particular the desolation created by Z-Day, the only surviving nation is [nation]Tierra De Los Libres[/nation], which guards its borders closely to ward off any remaining infected, not even accepting refugees, though air drops of food are often sent out to those who live beyond the border, and airborne military support.
