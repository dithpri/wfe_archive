[color=#ff69b4]In order to celebrate Colonel [nation]ROM[/nation]&#146;s birthday, Captain [nation]Nimarya[/nation] aided him in going out on an impromptu tag run so that they could spread the festivities to the other regions of NationStates! We&#146;ve left this region a slice of birthday cake, a half-empty can of sprinkles, and enough glitter to decorate the entire place in birthday cheer! 

We&#146;ve also left an invitation so that if you&#146;d like a bigger share of the cake next time, you can join us in the NPA [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=485374]here[/url]![/color]
