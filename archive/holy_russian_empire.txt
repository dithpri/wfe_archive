One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Holy Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. It played a major role in 1812&#150;14 in defeating Napoleon&amp;#39;s ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. It was often in conflict with the Ottoman Empire (which in turn was usually protected by the British).
