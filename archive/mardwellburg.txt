No more selling out to other regions, Mardwellburg is free once again!

Mardwellburg is a closely-knit, friendly little region founded by the alliance of Mardwellberg many years ago. Founding nations were [nation]Corptonia[/nation], [nation]Birkenhead[/nation] and [nation]Matallian Aaland[/nation]. In 2021, our region celebrates a new age, founding member [nation]Matallian Aaland[/nation], along with a new governing body, including the Vice-Delegate [nation]Corner Crying[/nation].

We hope to see our members support civil rights for people, those who repress their subjects, should do so equally for all of them. regardless of ethnicity, gender identity, or sexuality.
