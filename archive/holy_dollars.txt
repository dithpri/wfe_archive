In god&#39;s wallet we trust

Land of the rich, enemy of the poor and non-believing. The Holy Dollars believe in God first and money second, or vice versa, which ever so long as those two are your top two.

Together, with oppression, corruption, and fists full of dollars, we will run the world behind the scenes under the pretense of god.
