[region]North Bunny[/region], the laidback region of countries (A.K.A just [nation]Bunnylandis[/nation]) that just want to sit in the corner and dabble in their own little world. This all occurs while attempting to not embarrass themselves in the land we call the Internet. The region of those who are too socially awkward to do anything than banter and lead their country in this game (no roleplay, raiding, highly sensitive political issues, etc.). Also, yes, suggestions for a new flag are allowed if you find the adorable fluffball in the current one horrifying. However, suggestions must only be of other adorable fluffball bunnies.
