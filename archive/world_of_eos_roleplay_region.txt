A Roleplay region for the casual Roleplayer who wants a nice, detailed RP that doesn&#39;t take itself to seriously and isn&#39;t run by over-controlling admins and mods that make it more like job application process rather then a fun, engaging narrative-based game.

Set in a World with 4 Continents, Aurica (Europe) Lumaria (Asia) Gwondea (Africa) and Amuria (The Americas) beginning in an Industrial Revolution (Victorian Age tech in beginning) If you want to join just send a Application Telegram to Tichan.
