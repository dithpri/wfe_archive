[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region].

With speed and precision, no region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut. All shall tremble in fear at the sight of our wings and talons![/b]

&amp;quot;I declare this region free at last.&amp;quot; [b]D&amp;#39;aw. So close ;)

Praise the Kaiser! Long live the Emperor! Glory to the King!
