[b]Post-Apocalyptic North America[/b] is loosely based on the Fallout series by Interplay Entertainment, 14 Degrees East, and Bethesda Softworks. Although the series is set during the 22nd and 23rd centuries, its retrofuturistic setting and artwork are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s America, and its combination of hope for the promises of technology and lurking fear of nuclear annihilation.

The region is based on a geopolitical simulator of North America in the Fallout series. The very first region of it&amp;#39;s kind, and a fun place for new and old players alike.
