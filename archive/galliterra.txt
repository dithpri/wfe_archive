[color=darkblue]Welcome to [b]Galliterra[/b][/color], a vast continent stretching from tropical southern shores to frigid northern reaches.

Early Latin settlers made their home in the southwest of Galliterra, their dialect evolving into new tongues and modern nations. Other languages and cultures have found their place as offshoots, from colonization, or from invasion, making the continent a home of diversity.

Galliterra is an RP-focused region, designed for the nation and world builder - ideally a region for a few active players who want neighbours and intertwined histories.

Galliterra is oriented towards the main NS forum.
