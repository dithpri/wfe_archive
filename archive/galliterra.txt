[color=darkblue]Welcome to [b]Galliterra[/b][/color], a vast continent stretching from tropical southern shores to frigid northern reaches.

Early Latin settlers made their home in the southwest of Galliterra, their Gallo-Romance dialect evolving into newer languages. These descendant tongues have dominated ever since, though other languages have found their place as offshoots, from colonization, or from invasion, making the continent a home of diversity.

Galliterra is for the nation builder - players that want a base to build their nations and canons. Galliterra is oriented towards the main NS forum.
