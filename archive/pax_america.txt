Pax America looks to promote prosperity for its member states and encourage strong values. 

This region is semi-democratic. The delegate will be selected and assigned by the Founder, United Sentiniles People, based on numerous factors and will be not elected. All nations will have a say on how we vote. 

 Immigration will not be restricted but will be monitored with border control background checks.

 We encourage everyone to join us on our path to glory.
