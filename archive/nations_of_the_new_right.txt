The Nations of the New Right is a region built upon principles of the New Right in Mattantia, its dominions in the MRC (which are nation puppets IRL), and other surrounding regions, with ideologies across the right-wing spectrum. The NNR adheres to a new form of political conservatism, with an economically libertarian, socially moderate to authoritarian, and reactionary outlook on politics.

Political positions: Centre-right to far-right

Right-wingers welcome. Communists and anarchists will be ejected. Most embassies accepted.

Good luck invading, but the founder stays around and the WA delegate gets no power outside of making polls and deciding on WA affairs.
