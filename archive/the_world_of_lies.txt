Working out the size of the spherical spacelionball isn&#39;t that difficult if we assume each lion ends up as its own little sphere of meat (and considering the effects of the vacuum of space on otherwise-unprotected lions, yeah, they&#39;ll be meat soon enough). We know the mass of each individual lion sphere, but we also need to know its likely volume if we&#39;re to explore the consequences of a spacelionball - and, funnily enough, a search through the scientific literature comes up empty-handed for studies where scientists have gone to the effort of dunking lions in water and measuring how much water was displaced.
