Welcome to the Free Territory, a region of Anarchy!

Lead by Anarchist Brigade, which only uses its power when direly needed, this region is fully anarchy.

You still must follow NS rules, failure to do so will result in action from the site mods.

Anarchist Brigade will only do anything if a delegate tries password protecting/banning people, by which it will unban the person and turn off the password lock.

Nobody will care, because nobody is here, but voila.
