The Volcheknian Badlands is inhabited by a motley collection of nations: its founder, the United Collective of Volcheknia, the freedom loving Borderlands of Lostasia, the strong and stoic Oppressed Peoples of Kuszleika, the eccentric Kingdom of Tazmosia, a peaceful nation of science obsessed androids, the fiercely independent lands of Hirech and Hiczech, and a mysterious dark haze that consumes the horizon in the distance.
