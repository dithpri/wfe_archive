The Volcheknian Badlands were founded by the United Collective of Volcheknia, and once housed many different nations. After &amp;quot;The Great Extinction&amp;quot; most of them gradually fell to disease, war and social disorder. Today, only a handful remain, and have spread into the land once controlled by the fallen nations.
