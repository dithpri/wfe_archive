The Volcheknian Badlands is inhabited by a motley collection of nations: its founder, the United Collective of Volcheknia, the freedom loving Borderlands of Lostasia, the strong and stoic Oppressed Peoples of Kuszleika, the eccentric Kingdom of Tazmosia, a peaceful nation of science obsessed androids, the fiercely independent lands of Hirech and Hiczech, and a mysterious dark haze that consumes the horizon in the distance.
With internal strife dissolving Volcheknia and bordering Fronchia for the second in as many years the Badlands begin to be recognized as a Frontier. Will the region ever see peace again?
