A beautiful steppe, surrounded by a mountain range. This wonderful region is controlled by the amazing and benevolent Dictatorship of Volcheknia, which is bordered by the liberal hippie land of Lostasia. A across the mountains lies the horrific anarchy of Hirech. Proud Volcheknian border guards patrol the land to keep dissidents from corrupting the pure soil of Volcheknia.
