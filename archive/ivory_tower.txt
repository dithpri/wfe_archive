This is the Ivory Tower. 

Isolated from mundane worries, protected from strife, it rises from the lands of revery and fancy, rising above their confusion.

Inside the Tower, there is a serene tranquility, where you may pass as much time as you like... but beware that you leave before you become a permanent fixture.



Be welcome to this region, even if it is only for a short time.
Unless you are an invader, in which case you will be dealt with as quickly as possible.
