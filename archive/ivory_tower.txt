This is the Ivory Tower. 

Isolated from mundane worries, protected from strife, it rises from the lands of revery and fancy, rising above their confusion.

Inside the Tower, there is a serene tranquility, where you may pass as much time as you like... but beware that you leave before you become a permanent fixture.


In honour of the season, the Tower is decorated with holly and glowing lights. The forest outside has been decorated with Christmas ornaments.


Be welcome to this region, even if it is only for a short time.
Unless you are an invader, in which case you will be dealt with as quickly as possible.
