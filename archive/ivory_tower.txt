This is the Ivory Tower. 
Isolated from mundane worries, protected from strife, it rises up out of the Forest of Dream. Birds travel to and fro from south of the Vixen Valley and beyond the Open Sea.

Inside the Tower, there is a serene tranquility.
Be welcome to this region, even if it is only for a short time.
Unless you are an invader, in which case you will be dealt with as quickly as possible.

But now the ravens come cawing a warning and citizens are rushed to the Tower&amp;#39;s dungeons for their own protection. Dark clouds have gathered and the south wind reeks of carrion. A dark horde is approaching from across the Open Sea. A horde of the ravenous undead.

Now sound the drums of War, the drums of Apocalypse.
