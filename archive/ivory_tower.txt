This is the Ivory Tower. 
Isolated from mundane worries, protected from strife, it rises up out of the Forest of Dream. Birds travel to and fro from south of the Vixen Valley and beyond the Open Sea.

Inside the Tower, there is a serene tranquility.
Be welcome to this region, even if it is only for a short time.
Unless you are an invader, in which case you will be dealt with as quickly as possible.

Now alight the scavengers on the carcasses of the undead and the living breathe sighs of relief and shout out their joy! WE SURVIVED Z-DAY! HOORAY FOR US ALL! ^^
