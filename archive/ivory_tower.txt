This is the Ivory Tower. 
Isolated at the edge of all spaces claimed by others, it rises from pristine wilderness into perennial dusk.
This is a quiet place, where you may tarry a while if you seek a time of silence, of stillness.
Nothing much happens here.
But there is peace.
And you are free to leave - and return - as you please.
The Tower is always here, waiting.
