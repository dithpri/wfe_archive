The United Sovereign States Alliance (USSA) was established in the aftermath of World War III, forged from the necessity for collective security and cooperation among nations facing the challenges of a post-war world. It was officially formed approximately five years after the conclusion of the conflict, as member states recognized the need for a unified approach to address common threats and promote shared values. Thus, the USSA came into existence around the year 2030, marking a pivotal moment in global geopolitics and diplomacy.
