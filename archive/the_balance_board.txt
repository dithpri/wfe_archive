The Balance Board is an alliance of nations that wish to keep a balance of power within the World. It will function similarly to the United Nations of the past, where nations are not necessarily allies but are rather cooperating under a single banner to maintain peace to the best of their ability. The alliance was started by the progressive nation of [nation=long]Comtawa[/nation], and it is a sister alliance to the [region]KCP[/region]. Those who know the ultra-secret passcode are welcome.
