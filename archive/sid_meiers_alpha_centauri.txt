[b]&quot;No longer mere earthbeings and planetbeings are we, but bright children of the stars! And together we shall dance in and out of ten billion years, celebrating the gift of consciousness until the stars themselves grow cold and weary, and our thoughts turn again to the beginning.&quot;[/b] [i]-Lady Deirdre Skye, &quot;Conversations With Planet&quot;, Epilogue[/i]

We, the original seven factions, merged our consciousness with that of Planet and it&#39;s Progenitors.
