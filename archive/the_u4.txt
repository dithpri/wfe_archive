[b]What makes Hawks rise? It is rising day after day and beating the fendas to the punch and showing them what a true raiding organization like [region]The Black Hawks[/region] are made of. It is rising up in the face of adversity and difficulties; overcoming and succeeding no matter the odds. It is making the impossible possible and not letting yourself be told that no you are not able to do that. Tonight we showed what it truly means to be a hawk.[/b]
