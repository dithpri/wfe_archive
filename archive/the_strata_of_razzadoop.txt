[color=purple]Hello and welcome to the Strata of Razzadoop! [/color]

We are a recently created region, consisting of new players, created as a way to learn together as a region instead of a group of individual players.

As we steadily grow in number, our mission and our true goal really becomes clear: to allow the newer players or returning players a chance to grow as a group and rely on each other as such.

We are a casual group, but we are welcoming of hardcore players as well. The mission here is a peaceful one and we only ask that it reflects off of our players and bring more people in to spread our goal a little more.
