Do you believe in violence or war?,

If you don&amp;#39;t, then this is the place for you to come.

The founders and members of the &amp;#39;The Democratic Pacifist Party&amp;#39; are people who also do not believe in war or violence, this means that no violence or war will ever happen in this region and will not occur at any given time.

Hope you feel safe in my region, as war and violence is forbidden.

Thank you,

Conor Clarke
Founder and Leader of The Democratic Pacifist Party (DPP) and The Anti War and Violence Group (AWVG)
