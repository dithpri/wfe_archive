Thick clouds of smoke, the byproducts of an astounding age of industry, war, and magic rise to the heavens from the factories, gambling halls, and blood-draining factories of Wistlor.

Airships and steam, blood, and aether-powered tanks and machines wage war upon each other.

Armies of mage-abolitionists, nobles, and nations gather, while the agents of The Outsider, a god-like figure, operate in secret.

If you decide to join Wistlor, you can expect to be part of an immersive Steampunk and Magic roleplay that encompasses technology, military, government and society.
