&quot;Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I&#39;ve gazed along the open road

Many times I&#39;ve lied, and many times I&#39;ve listened
Many times I&#39;ve wondered how much there is to know

Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream, and a pocket full of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what he&#39;s been missing
Many, many men can&#39;t see the open road&quot; -Houses of the Holy (1973)
