The realm of the lands of the Damned Earth upon which judgement from thy heavens came one autumn dawn in 2040, and of those who fought back against heaven and hell to uphold their existence when the lord of the heavens unleashed his wrath on mankind, who were forced to call upon the devil to come to their aid, forever tainting the few survivors of the apocalypse with great sinfulness, who used the advancement of science to create the weapon that managed to defeat its ultimate creator, banishing him to the heavens and saving the few million survivors of what was once a world of 9 billion.
