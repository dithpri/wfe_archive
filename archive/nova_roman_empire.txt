Ave Caesar, motutuni te salunta!

The Imperium of the Nova Roman Empire has been restored. Gaius Iulius Churchillius hereby declares full Imperium under Rome. Rome offers peace with the barbarian scum that exiled her client states if they wish to remain peaceful and a subject under Rome, if not, then they will be exiled from the Empire.
Hail Caesar!
