Rahanor the Great, the namesake of our great empire. He led the original settlers through inhospitable wastes, keeping them alive by inspiring their will to drive them all forward. However, when they arrived in their promised land, it was already settled by strangers. We didn&#39;t care who they were, they were in our land. Rahanor led an unstoppable bloodbath across their land, now ours, leading every battle personally and stepping up to leading the foundation of the center of our empire.
