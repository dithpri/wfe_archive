[b][u]EAT THAT, BLACK RIDERS! DON&amp;#39;T INVADE REGIONS WITH FOUNDERS![/u][/b]

Back to normal now. This region is friendly towards newbies, everyone&amp;#39;s welcome (except Nazis and raiders). The focus however should lie on fantasy nations, pony nations fit in good as well. If you want to join, just ask, I&amp;#39;ll tell you the password. :)

Edit: But who should want to enter a single-nation region without any activity? :P
