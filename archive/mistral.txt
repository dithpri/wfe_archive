Welcome to [b][color=mediumseagreen]Mistral[/color][/b]! A distant continent and welcoming refuge for its nations and people. From civilized metropolises to sparse wastes, kings to communists, and democracies to dictatorships, Mistral is almost a world unto itself.

Players are free to join if they seek a place to focus on nation-building and a map. Generally an MT region. Otherwise fairly casual.
