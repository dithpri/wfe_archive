The Conservative Republican States are for people who believe in both Conservatism and Republicanism. If you want to join or construct embassies, please make sure your country or region is founded on these principles.

When the amount of people increases in the [region]Conservative Republican States[/region], there is a high chance I will start up programs such as voting and may accept delegates with access to regional control.

I plan to change the flag [b]very soon[/b] to something better. Stay tuned!

If you have any questions, feel free to message [nation]Tanzarmia[/nation] and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Also, make sure to invite all of your friends!

[b][color=red]Enjoy![/b][/color]
