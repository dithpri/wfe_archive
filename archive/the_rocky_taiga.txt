[b][u]New Legislation in The Rocky Taiga![/u][/b]
A stunning new proposal from [nation=noflag]The States of France[/nation] entails forcing all nations who are WA members to endorse the WA region delegate, being himself.  This outrageous new position will make appointing a new delegate impossible because everyone will be endorsing the current one.  And the punishments for not following the legislation, destroying trade and tourism industries for having a different opinion, we moved past this hundreds of years ago!  This is nothing but a power grab by [nation=noflag]The States of France[/nation] and it can not be allowed to continue.  I urge you, for not the good of one nation, but for the good of the region as a whole, to vote NO for issue one!
