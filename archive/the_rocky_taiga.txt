[b][u]Currency Contest![/u][/b]

We are hosting a region wide currency contest to find the official currency of the region.  If you have an idea for the official currency, telegram [natoin=noflag]Extorant[/nation] with your idea.  We need the name of the currency, and [color=red]its value in comparison to the USD.[/color]
Submitions close on October 10th, and a final poll will open on October 11th.
