[b][u]Council Seats Up For Grab!![/u][/b]

Congratulations to the two winners, they will be announced publicly when both of them accept their new temporary roll.  Said roll will last until December 1st.  On December 2nd, the lottery will reset and tickets will be eligible for claiming.  Do not contact Extorant about claiming tickets until December 2nd, if you go against this, you will be excluded from the lottery for that month.  

When both winners accept their new roll, we will announce the date, time and agenda for the upcoming council meeting.  If one or both of them fail to accept their roll by October 30th, a new winner will be selected and informed.
