[color=Green][b]Welcome[/b][/color]
The residents of the medium sized [region]The Rocky Tagia[/region] region like to have fun and be free. Political and economic freedom are the building blocks of this supportive region. So come on over, sit and watch the burning houses, breath in the chaos, and avoid the killer gas.
