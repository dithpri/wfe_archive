[b]Rules for the Regional Map[/b]
1. Don&#39;t occupy too much land, that&#39;s for the colonies.
2. You can roleplay for your map in the RMB. But here&#39;s a rule: No fail RP.
3. Don&#39;t request me ([nation]Buda[/nation]) to add company names to the map.
4. Empires ([nation]Buda[/nation], [nation]Gacha Empire[/nation]) are only allowed to colonize other areas. Any nation caught requesting me to colonize a part of land will have their request denied.

[b]NOTE: COUNTRIES LIKE [nation]The Jazzyist Empire of Kurosawa[/nation], AND [nation]Chuha Party[/nation] ARE NOT NEEDED TO BE ADDED TO THE MAP. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN MAPS.[/b]
