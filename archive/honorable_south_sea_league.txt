We aren&#39;t the Honorable East Indian Company, and we aren&#39;t the South Seas Trading Company. We are the League of Nations based in the South Sea, or otherwise known as the Indian Ocean. Over time, a loose union of island federations formed and united in order to preserve their institutions and identities. Now we have expanded our bounds from the Bering Sea to the Mozambique Channel and continue to protect the peoples for who we serve. We are an institution of Nations, for Nations.
