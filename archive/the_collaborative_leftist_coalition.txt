We are a democratic group of leftist governments. We ask all residents to retain their civil and political freedoms above GOOD. We support the advancement of all peoples. We ask that all member nations be a part of the following classifications or be working to reform their ways toward the following classifications: Leftwing Utopia, Civil Rights Love Fest, Anarchy, Scandinavian Liberal paradise, Left Leaning College State, Liberal Democratic Socialists, New York Times Democracy, Iron Fist Socialists, Democratic Socialists, and Inoffensive Centrist Democracy.  We are officially anti-moderator, we believe that moderators are an oppressive force which only harms regions, and nations.
