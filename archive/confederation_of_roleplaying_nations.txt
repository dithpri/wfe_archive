[b]The Confederation of Roleplaying Nations (CORN) has the goal to keep alive small regions through the establishment of diplomatic relations with similar entities and the creation of a roleplay game. This region is the core of all the Confederation.
The choice of the creation of a confederation is because of the biggest possibilities of autonomy that it leaves to each member.
