[b]The Confederation of Roleplaying Nations (CORN) had the goal to keep alive small regions through the establishment of diplomatic relations with similar entities and the creation of a roleplay game. This region was the core of all the Confederation.
The choice of the creation of a confederation was because of the biggest possibilities of autonomy that it left to each member.

EX Confederate Regions:[region]Free State of Wisconsin[/region], [region]Greater Agora[/region], [region]Republic of Italy[/region], [region]A Region[/region]
