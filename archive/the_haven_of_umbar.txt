[b] [u] Welcome to pirate port city and haven of Umbar [/u] [/b]

Umbar is a gargantuan port city and home of the pirate corsairs of Umbar. Constructed in the First Age by the settling Numenoreans who constructed a massive navy to attack the hated Gondor with. Alas , Gondor refused to condone these attacke and so mercilessly destroyed and captured Umbar. Until a mighty siege led by Umbarad the Corsair King retook Umbar and severed the commander&#39;s head from his body. Outraged at the Gondorian sacrilegious treatment of their home attacked Pelargir and turned it into rubble. Umbar serves the Dark Lord and is allied to Mordor.
