[region]Apathy[/region], a region for casual nations who don&#39;t really care. Freedom is granted to pursue, or not, whatever goals your little heart desires. However, there are two rules that if broken can result in a nation being chased out via angry mob of villagers armed with pitch forks, torches, and plasma rifles.[list=1] [*] No Harassment (The ban hammer falls on the unruly and the obstreperous.) [*] Do not annoy the Founder with messages, or with requests for an Appointment. (The founder will ignore you, and if you persist, you will face the consequences.)[/list] Embassy invitations are received with apathy. [region]Apathy[/region] does not recruit. It doesn&#39;t matter if you come here, or not.
