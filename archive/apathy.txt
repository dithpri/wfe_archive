Founded by the great [nation]Shaggtopia[/nation], and refounded by [nation]Macavity The Mystery Cat[/nation], [region]Apathy[/region] is a region for casual nations. [b]Where No One Cares![/b] Nations have nigh unlimited freedom to pursue whatever goals your little hearts desire. However, there are two rules that if broken can result in a nation being chased out via angry mob of villagers armed with pitch forks, torches and plasma rifles:

1.) No Harassment or Obstreperous behavior (the ban hammer falls on the unwary).
2.) Do not annoy [nation]Macavity The Mystery Cat[/nation] with requests for Appointment. (The founder will ignore you if you ask more then twice, and then ban you at the loss of apathy.)
