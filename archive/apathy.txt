The Region of [region]Apathy[/region] was originally founded in antiquity by an unknown founder, now lost in the mists of time. By 2011 [nation]bogus bolus[/nation] was recorded as Founder, with [nation]Shaggtopia[/nation] refounding the region in 2017. The current iteration of [region]Apathy[/region] was founded by [nation]Macavity the Mystery Cat[/nation] as a region for casual nations who really don&#146;t care. 

Nations are granted almost unlimited freedom to pursue whatever goals their heart desires; but there are two rules that if broken can result in a nation being chased out via angry mob of villagers armed with pitch forks, torches, and plasma rifles.

1.) No Harassment, or Commotion which disturbs our feeling of Apathy.
2.) Do not annoy the Founder with requests for Official Appointment, or suggestions for improvements.
