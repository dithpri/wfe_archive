Founded by Shaggtopia, Apathy is a region for casual nations. Nigh unlimited freedom to pursue whatever goals your little hearts desire however there are two rules that if broken can result in a nation being chased out via angry mob of villagers armed with pitch forks, torches and plasma rifles.

1.) No Harassment (seriously don&#39;t be that clown, the ban hammer falls on the unwary.)
2.) Do not annoy Shaggtopia with requests for Appointment. (The founder will ignore you if you ask more then twice and ban you at the tenth.)
