[color=midnightblue][b]Welcome to the region of Mbret: a historical monument important in the history of Vuori Kunin-Grrs, aka La Navasse.

[hr][i]This region&#146;s founder, Vuori Kuningas, inspired the player La Navasse to create an alternative nation, Vuori Kunin-Grrs (though it was founded before La Navasse was created), as well as to create the short-lived region MBRET Vuori Kuningas with his first nation Ala-Guorkar.

It&#146;s rather curious to see how a founderless region that was about to cease to exist, with zero nations, inspired so much with it and its founder&#146;s name.[/b][/i][/color]
