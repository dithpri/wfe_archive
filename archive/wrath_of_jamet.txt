[color=#466198]Welcome to [region]Wrath of Jamet[/region]. The region a Post Modern Tech region that features a completely different political climate than that of the real world, as well as a secret event to take place later on. There will be a 1 month period after the region officially opens to decide what countries exist, after that the countries and their traits are fixed. Meaning no new players will be able to make their own country.
