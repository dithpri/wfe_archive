[i][b][color=#FF6700]You are in the 1970s.[/color][/b][/i] [color=#FF6700][i]Can you dig it?[/i][/color] Sit back, put on your boogie shoes, and get your groove on!

We are a funky &#39;70s-themed region, that welcomes all cats who want to lay down the boogie, or even want to rock.

Our official Discord server is [b]Studio 54[/b], a club that welcomes all nations, regardless of whether they are in The 1970s or not (or even if they are on NS). Roleplaying is welcome, but not required. We have fun and games, bots, and music. Can you feel it?
