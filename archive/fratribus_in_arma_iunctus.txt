[b]Motto:[/b] We Shall Push Through Adversity and Survive.

This Region was a thriving and active region of many different nations. 

Following the extinction of founder Obodzovacia Armada and a raid by one of those &amp;#39;lovely&amp;#39; raiding regions it was decided that Fratribus in Arma Iunctus was no longer a safe region. WA Delegates had administrative powers and without a founder it was impossible to keep secure the NEW region is [region]Magni Fratres in Arma[/region]  

This region will remain with the memories and posts until it inevitably perishes. 
thank you very much
