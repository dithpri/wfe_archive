The Nordland Confederation empowers smaller kingdoms, petty kingdoms, tribes, dukedoms and other small realms. The confederation focuses on tackling issues between the realms within it, outside influences and other major incidents and political understandings. 

While there is no criteria to enter the confederation, it would suite you better to:
-Have a nation in a northern area
-Identify with Norse, Celtic and other northern cultures (Fantasy or real)
-Seek cooperation and empowerment by working with other northern realms
-Have an affinity for northern paganism and germanic cultures (for RP reasons and for fun)
