[i][b]Gentlemen...[/b][/i] All I ask for is war, war so grand as to make [region]Hell[/region] itself tremble. [b][i]Gentlemen,[/i][/b] I ask you as fellow brothers in arms what is it that you really want? Do you wish for further war as I do? [color=red][i](Voice begins to raise)[/i][/color] Do you wish for a merciless, bloody war? A war whose fury is built with iron and lightning and fire? [color=red][i](Dramatically raises voice)[/i][/color] Do you ask for war to sweep in like a tempest, leaving not even ravens to scavenge from this Earth!?
