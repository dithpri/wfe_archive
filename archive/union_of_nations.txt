Welcome to the Union of Nations. The U.o.N&#39;s only desire is to protect and further their own freedoms and agendas as a united force. People and nations of different stances and agendas are welcome.

Nations with military and and police prioritized agendas will be requested to take up protectorate duties over those who do not. The protectorate duties are only set in place for defense of those nations, not as an invasion of sovereignty.

So whether your focus is Military, Economy, Environment or otherwise, The Union of Nations is happy and proud to accept you.
