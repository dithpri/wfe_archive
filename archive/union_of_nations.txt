IC: The Union of Nations is a transnational governmental body whose aim to to ensure peace and cooperation between nations. 


OC: This region is intended to be an RP world. All nations in the Union of Nations are a part of the same world, in the same universe, in the same time period. The running theme is for nations that either currently exist or have come into existence since the end of WWII. All world history is the same as irl until the end of WWII. Nations do not have to be &quot;real&quot; nations, but if someone has already taken Germany on a map, and you&#39;re nation is a german RP, then you&#39;re out of luck. Nations must take into account the cultural, linguistic and political situations in the land their country intends to occupy.
