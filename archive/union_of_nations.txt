The Union of Nations is a region that is founded upon sovereignty and freedom of its member-states.

[color=blue]NOTICE: The UNION OF NATIONS is now under Martial Law. Pending the return of its founder, all council positions are abolished, members may arrogate to themselves what office they desire with the approval of the WA Delegate, and no further endorsement is allowed save to the current WA Delegate(as a raiding precaution). These edicts shall remain until such time as the martial law is declared defunct[/color]
