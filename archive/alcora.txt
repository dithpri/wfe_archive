Alcora is an attempt to protect national sovereignty among member states from threats both external and internal, and to adhere to a degree of societal standards. The immediate goal is to face the revolutionary movements that fight guerrillas wars against these authorities, to limit the spread of the action of these movements, and to prepare the defense of these territories against an expected conventional military aggression from the hostile governments of neighboring countries.
