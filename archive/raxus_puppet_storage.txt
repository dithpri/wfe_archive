[Color=scarlet][b]If you want to join the Raxulan Empire and be inactive at the same time, then we have a place for you, it is here.

If how ever you decide to be active (post once a week at least) then you feel free to leave and join the heart of the Empire.

But if you are going to be inactive then drag your lazy useless corpse here and keep it here.[/b][/color]
