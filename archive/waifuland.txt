[b][Region]The Black Hawks[/region] were in the kitchen tonight, working together to cook up a good raid. However, they used the strangest tools in their culinary frenzy. Smashing vegetables with hammers and adding potato chips and feathers (while of course actually cooking it with a flamethrower.) Surprisingly, the end result wasn&#39;t half bad, and they had a fun time getting there. 

More cooking shenanigans are sure to come so you&#39;ll wanna be in our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]nest[/url] for next time!
