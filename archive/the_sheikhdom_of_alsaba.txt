Alsaba is a region set in times similar to the Abbasid Middle-East, in and around the 10th century. Our region functions on pure and rational discourse, and the main governing body is the Assembly of Sheikhs, which each nation has a say in. Join for a democratic, political, and historical depiction of the medieval Middle-East and for a chill and welcoming community. Hope you enjoy your stay here at Alsaba. Also, as soon as you enter the group, we encourage you to join the World Assembly and endorse Dymosia, which ensures our steady growth in regional power.
