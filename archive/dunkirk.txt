[b]Dunkirk[/b] is a commune in the Nord department in northern France. It lies 6.2 miles from the Belgian border. The population of the city (commune) at the 2012 census was 90,995 inhabitants.

During the Second World War (1939&#150;1945), in the May 1940 Battle of France, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France aiding the French, was cut off from the rest of the French Army by the German advance. Encircled by the Germans they retreated to the area around the port of Dunkirk. The German Army could have easily destroyed the BEF, especially when many of the British troops, in their haste to withdraw, had left behind their heavy equipment.
