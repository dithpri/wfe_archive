The [i]Denizenship of Dedicated Dictators[/i], or [b]DDD[/b] for short, is a region meant for absolute rulers, [b]NOT[/b] democracies.

[b]DDD RULES[/b]-
1. We do not discuss democracy on the regional message board. If I see any post about democracy, your nation will be ejected and banned from the region, for democracy is not what this region is about.

2. We do not discuss politics or other controversial topics on the regional message board. I don&amp;#39;t want my region to get into an altercation, because I despise drama.

3. You can swear on the regional message board, but do not use it in every sentence, please.

4. You must endorse the Founder of [b]DDD[/b] to keep your place in the region.
