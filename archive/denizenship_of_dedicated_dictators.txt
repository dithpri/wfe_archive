The [i]Denizenship of Dedicated Dictators[/i], or [b]DDD[/b] for short, is a region meant for absolute rulers, [b]NOT[/b] democracies.

Our region&amp;#39;s flag, a red eye, represents the eye of the Founder, how violating [b]DDD[/b]&amp;#39;s rules, will always be caught.

[b]RULES[/b]-

1. We don&amp;#39;t discuss democracy on the regional message board. If I see any post about democracy, you will be ejected and banned from the region, for democracy is not what this region is about.

2. We do not discuss politics or other controversial topics on the regional message board. I don&amp;#39;t want my region to get into an altercation, because I despise drama.

3. Mild swearing is tolerated, but don&amp;#39;t use it in every sentence.

4. We speak English.

5. You must endorse [nation]Le Karrm[/nation], the [b]Founder[/b], to stay.
