Wisconsin
&quot;Forward&quot;

Welcome to Wisconsin

A place for education and intelligence, opportunity, and the people are free to live how they choose.
So come romp around the forests, and dairy farms, and swim and boat in the lakes. Come and explore the breweries. 
Wisconsin is a beautiful and truly great place!
