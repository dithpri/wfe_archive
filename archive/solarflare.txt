Hello, and welcome to SolarFlare! This region is a good place for nations who want to stay mostly isolationist, like myself.Here we are Pro-WA, Pro- Security Council, and pro democracy! 

We are neutral until provoked in attacker/defender wars. We currently have no allies but wish to be friendly with all regions. 

Currently there isn&#39;t an endorsement limit, but when we hold elections for the WA delegate, you should endorse your candidate of choice and withdraw all other endorsements.

 The discord link below is for Role plays, but I suppose you can use it for what ever you like (as long as it&#39;s appropriate.)
