The Lunar Spellcast Isles are for nations whom allow only one religion to be practiced by its people, one that worships the moon, night, and the stars, and/or focuses on the casting of spells, welcoming the supernatural elements of the universe into it&#146;s followers lives, banishing those who cause harm to an individual, group, or nation, and generally working with various magics. Once your nation becomes large enough to have a national religion, you are allowed to ask to have it added to the list of official religions of the Lunar Spellcast Isles.
