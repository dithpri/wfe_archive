We are fascists, and we are proud. Not everyone here is racist, as fascism itself is not racially motivated. We take pride in our heritage, and we reject degeneracy (anime doesn&#146;t count.) We are a proud Christian region, and we accept anyone of the Faith, as long as you are also fascist. We are anti-left, and we hope to one day liberate the regions who have been targeted by leftist extremists.
