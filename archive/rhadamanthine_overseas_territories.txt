The [b]Rhadamanthine Overseas Territories[/b] (RHADOTs) consist of the Rhadamanthine Overseas Protectorates (RHADOPs) and the Rhadamanthine Overseas Colonies (RHADOCs). 

RHADOPs are self-governing protectorates defended by the Rhadamanthine Forces (RhadFor) and who, in return, enter into preferential trading agreements with the Crown Commonwealth. Their citizens are eligible to join RhadFor and contribute to the defence of the Rhadamanthine Overseas Territories.

RHADOCs are partially-self-governing colonies whose trade, business, industry and home affairs policies fall under the jurisdiction of the Rhadamanthine government and who are defended by RhadFor.
