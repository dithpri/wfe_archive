The Coalition of the Armored Bear will respect national sovereignty over all else. You will be able to govern as you see fit. If you join you must endorse the world assembly delegate or will face  ejection.  We will provide military assistance to those in our region. We will support our members. A change in delegate may be requested on the regional forum. Any attempt to simply take over will result in immediate ejection. All bans must be approved by the Chief Director of the Coalition unless a takeover is imminent. The WA delegate will take a regional vote on how to vote in the world assembly.
