A word from our Commanding Officer[/b]
This mission started out as defense, as we had intel that this region was to be raided by fascist forces. However, we looked into the region and realized that it was right-wing in disguise. Look at one of the RO titles &quot;Exterminator of Homosexuals&quot;. Therefore, we decided to liberate the region from the chains placed upon them. Thank you!
