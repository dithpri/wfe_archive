A region of the economically obsessed, Wheres Georgeopian nations are invariably obsessed with tracking where their currency goes in the world.  All national leaders have accounts at www.wheresgeorge.com to prove how obsessed they are.

Not the first region founded upon this ideal, but hopefully the most awesome.

New member nations are expected to post their WG? profile links upon joining Wheres Georgeopia.  If you&amp;#39;re not already member, create an account.  This is non-negotiable, since that&amp;#39;s the entire point of the region!
