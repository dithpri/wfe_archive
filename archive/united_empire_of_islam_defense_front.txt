This region has been built on the ideals of freedom, liberty and the right to self-determination. The United Empire of Islam has long stood as a region renowned throughout NationStates and has recently suffered from a coordinated campaign to smear its name and ruin its reputation. Unsavoury individuals have decided to launch a venomous attack on the United Empire of Islam and we will fight back. The United Empire of Islam has always been known for its involvement in defender organisations and its diplomacy with some of the largest regions and is innocent of the false charges made against it.

Long Live The United Empire of Islam!
