Greater Dienstad is the quasi-reincarnation of Imperial Armies, with its own twist and with its own image.  The region is a hodge podge group of nations with vastly different clients and cultures; the region was founded and recognized as a region post-bellum (War of Golden Succession). Anybody can join!
