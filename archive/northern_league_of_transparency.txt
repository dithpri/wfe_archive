Otherwise known as the (NLT), the Northern League of Transparency formed originally to provide a state like approach to group of nations that provide full diplomatic, economic, and social transparency for each other. This league allows for free transnational travel and free passage within each others borders of military and diplomatic personnel. All nations retain their sovereignty and are free to enter and exit as they please. Important to note, if a fellow nation in the League goes to war, all other nations are automatically allied and in support of the warring nation. In times of war, a nation may request troops, food, water, ect. but no nation is required to provide such items.
