[i]Having heard word of the sunny weather, we in [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b] have decided to take a collective vacation to the Mediterrannian (how do people spell this?) to take a rest after all the joy we spread daily. As such, we have decided to party around the Mediterranean, and you get to join us! It&#39;s not voluntary, so kick back, endorse the delegate, and join the party tent [b][url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]here[/url]![/b][/i][hr]
