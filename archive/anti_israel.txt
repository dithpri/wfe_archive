[hr][b][color=blue] As long as in the heart, within,
The Jewish soul yearns,
And towards the ends of the east,
an eye still gazes toward Zion,

Our hope is not yet lost,
The hope of two thousand years,
&amp;#119046; To be a free nation in our own land,
The land of Zion and Jerusalem. &amp;#119047;[hr]Region taken so no Anti-Semite acquires it.[hr][/color][/b]
