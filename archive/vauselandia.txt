The Vauselandia Region is a thriving, police-state Region. Political enemies are routinely assassinated at the request of the supreme-powerful Leader of the Nation Cameron I of West Vauseland. Any Nation is welcome to succumb to constant military re-buffering, political uprisings, and frequent riots in the many shanty towns spread across the Region. Any Nation to then challenge these upstanding protocols shall immediately be considered an &quot;enemy to the Nation of West Vauseland.&quot; Take care, and always Sacrifice All To The Government!
