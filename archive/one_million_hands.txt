Force is terrifying to the weak. One Million Hands unites the strongest nations to work together as an unstoppable force and with hard work and effort, create a unified world under one strong region. We are more right-winged and we believe in strong ideals, and we are open to debate amongst ourselves. Strong leadership is a must-have, and nations that are against our ideals are against our people and our cause, making them enemies.
All nations are seen as equal and have the freedom to propose new ideas without punishment of any kind.

Forum will open soon with more information.
