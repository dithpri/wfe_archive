Founded in 2015, the Secular Atheist Federation(SAF) was formed by the United Human States to further reason, logic, and learning. While not explicitly illegal, religions are seen as a negative influence and are discouraged. There are no legal allowances for religion, and only various government officials can perform civil unions. The primary supported philosophies of the SAF are Secular Humanism and Universal Objective Naturalistic Morality. Only nations that espouse the ideals of the SAF are allowed to join. Any theocracies are explicitly forbidden. Any nation that suppresses science will be forced out as well. Authoritarian nations are discouraged, but not forbidden.
