[u]Welcome to [region]Terra Incognita[/region], [color=gray]a misty land[/color][/u]

We do not believe in any specific ideology, but tend to have strong armies and a focus on scientific advancement, disfavouring religion. Set in steampunk 1935, we broadly use the technology of WWII with some fictional elements.

[strike]Most of us are also very corrupt[/strike]

We have officially adopted a currency: &Eacute;meraudes

If you move to this region, please endorse our Delegate, [nation]ALS Confederacy[/nation].

We have a discord - join it to claim a place on the map (pinned below). Link [url=https://discord.gg/PFnWmZM]here[/url]; most regional activity takes place on the discord, so it is a good idea to join it.
