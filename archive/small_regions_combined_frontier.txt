[color=#0040BF]This is the combined frontier region for [region]Etrie[/region] and [region]South west tree[/region], e.g the [b]Small Regions Combined Frontier[/b] (the [b]SMCF[/b]) project.[/color]
[color=#FFBF00]If you have spawned here, you are encouraged to go to one of those regions.[/color]
[color=#0040BF]However, you can of course stay here if you would like. [b]If you do decide to, please join the World Assembly immediately and endorse our WA Delegate, [nation]Dead Region Raider[/nation][/b].[/color]
If you are a small, non-frontier region (with less than 10 WA nations) and would like to be part of the SMCF,
telegram Dead Region Raider.
