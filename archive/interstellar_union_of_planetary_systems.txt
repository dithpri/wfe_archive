Many planets have moons. And sometimes, colonies span the entire moon system orbiting planets. This region is for sentient civilizations who have colonized Planets, systems, and moons. In terms of discussing, we don&#39;t do much. However, with enough civilizations in the union, we can colonize many, many universes. On the political spectrum, we&#39;re mostly centrist or right-leaning, maybe also left-leaning.

We may also raid sometimes, and make others bow down to the empire!
