[b][i]Welcome to DTMT.[/i][/b]
 Or, for us classy folk, [u]Don&#146;t Touch Me There[/u].

We&#146;re just a group of nutty folks who all &#145;work&#146; at the same place. This means that most, if not all political discussion is held IRL, and mainly declarations are the only things posted on the RMB. Despite that, randoms are allowed and welcomed, provided one of our members offers you the passcode.

 [u][b]RULES[/b][/u]

[i]Don&#146;t use insensitive language, constant swearing, and racial slurs.[/i]

[i]Be respectful to one another and don&#146;t RP obnoxiously.[/i]

[i]Do not type multiple messages to convey a single idea, and keep the RMB as clean and straightforward as possible for further archiving.[/i]

[b]In-Game Time - IRL[/b]

1 Day - 30 Minutes
One Week - 70 Minutes
One Month - 280 Minutes
One Year - 6 Hours
