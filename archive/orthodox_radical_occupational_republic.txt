This place of worship is being remodeled by the Church of Franco-Wolfism, along with with our fellow Snark worshippers and Frontierist faithful brethren. 

Proper orthodox Franco-Wolfism will be enforced with extreme prejudice, heathens and heretics, be they wolfist revisionists or franco-defenders, will be evicted from the premises of this sacred temple.

The construction of this temple was sponsored by the Evil Wolf fearing faithful from [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], [region]The Pacific[/region], [region]The West Pacific[/region], [region]Talonia[/region] and [region]Ijaka[/region].[/b]

[color=darkred][i]United in prayer and reverence to Evil Wolf[/i][/color]
