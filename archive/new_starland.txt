[color=grey]New Starland is a free region where anyone can practice any ideology. Communist? Welcome! Democratic? Welcome! Worship North Korea? We don&#39;t care! Nations are encouraged to debate issues in the RMB of any kind. Do you want to ban movies? Contact a leader, we will arrange a 7 day debate,  and then have a vote! Votes can be overturned to. Someone ban movies and you just finished a movie that you sunk all of your GDP in because you were drunk? Contact the VETO OFFICER, and we&#39;ll do another debate and launch a poll. More info in the &#39;Polling&#39; dispatch.[/color]
