Murrica is a confederation of many different countries united by one religion: Argilism. According to the principles of this religion, it is ruled (at least in name) by the deified spirit of long-dead Henry Clay. His &amp;#39;commands&amp;#39; are interpreted and carried out by the mysterious Croppers, an organization part mystic cult and part secret police. They roam across the various nations, performing their rituals of rotation and whispering the Question That Must Never Be Answered: Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
