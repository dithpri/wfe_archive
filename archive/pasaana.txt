[color=blue][b]Sometime after the Battle of Endor, Luke Skywalker came here on a mission to discover more about the Sith and Jedi. Lando accompanied him and helped track down the ship of the assassin Ochi, who was searching for Sith relics. He then hid here in the treadable for many years.

In 35 ABY, after the Emperor revealed himself and the Final Order was announced, Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and BB-8 came to Pasaana on the trail of the planet Exegol. The Resistance members would find the remains of Ochi of Bestoon, obtaining his dagger with the Sith inscriptions needed to locate the Emperor&#39;s wayfinder in the wreckage of the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station on Kef Bir.[/b][/color]
