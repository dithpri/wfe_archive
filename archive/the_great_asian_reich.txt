We are an alliance of nations seeking to invade and control the entire world; and to exert our influence throughout it.  All nations are insured a spot in our military and a responsibility of invading and spreading our power and influence.

&amp;quot;From the wave-crashed coasts, to the mountain-tops, we will conquer these lands, we will reinstate a government of the majority of the World; we will be, the one, true, great Reich.&amp;quot;

NOTE:  We are still growing, but if you join me, you will be a governor of the world, in time.
