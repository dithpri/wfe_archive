Welcome, to [b]Evria[/b]

Beyond frozen mountain peaks, cruel oceans, and haunted forests, lies a hallowed land of perpetual turmoil. Unmarked graves litter the realm of Evria, where thousands are sacrificed each day in the name of hollow ideologies and petty national pride. As Evria&#39;s inhabitants gaze onwards to the future, a faint glimmer of hope does yet remain. But for how long will the spark last?

All hail our magnificent and benevolent leaders!
