It was Lulu Suzuhara&#39;s birthday, and she set out to celebrate! The paranormal investigators and the Major Explorer Group were also out in numbers, shutting down many locations (including [/color][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_backrooms][color=#D7AFA8]The Backrooms!?[/color][/url][color=#D7AFA8]), but even then, couldn&#39;t stop her from visiting a few and having a blast! Of course, after every location she visited, the place turned haunted afterwards. As the night continued with the moon shining ever brightly over the horizon, she decided to head back home though not before stopping by the cafe to have some cake!
