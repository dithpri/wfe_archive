We worship mother Ethel and will probably die listening to preachers daughter lol. 
We are an inclusive region who&#146;s only requirement for joining is that you have listened to preachers daughter all the way through at least once. 
If you join, we can chat about Hayden&#146;s music in the message board or we can wage war on other countries on behalf of your nation. We all got each others back in this region. 
Together, as one fandom, my vision is that we can build a community of nations all united under one cause: forcing everyone in the known universe to listen to preachers daughter.
