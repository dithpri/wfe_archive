Order: Carnivora
Family: Ursidae
Genus and species: Ailuropoda melanoleuca[/color]
[color=Brown]GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION:
Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing, and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.[/color]
[Color=cyan]Giant pandas live in broadleaf and coniferous forests with a dense understory of bamboo, at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year characterizes these forests, often shrouded in heavy clouds.[/color]
