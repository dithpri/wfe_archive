Greetings. I am Traberabia. Some notices are that your nation must not be a democracy, communist, monarchy or dictatorship. You must be a Statership. Means that states, provinces and territories must have many rights. also, a statership has one family that rules the nation. but the nations decisions are made by the people. Bit T&#39;willian nations must be Christian or Jewish.
