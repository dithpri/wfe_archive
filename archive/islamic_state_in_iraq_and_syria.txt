[color=green]The [b]Islamic State in Iraq and Syria[/b] (ISIS) is the armed Caliphate of Allah liberating the lands of Iraq and a Greater Syria, and defending the pious Muslims from the infidels, the imperialists, and the apostates![/color][hr]
[i]The Caliphate is not just a political entity but also a vehicle for salvation. The Muslim who acknowledges the one omnipotent god and prays, but who dies without pledging himself to a valid Caliph and incurring the obligations of that oath, has failed to live a fully Islamic life. Therefore, the vast majority of Muslims in history, and all who passed away between 1924 and 2014, died a &quot;death of disbelief.&quot; However, by the power of Allah, Islam has been reestablished by a new Caliphate, the Islamic State.[/i]
