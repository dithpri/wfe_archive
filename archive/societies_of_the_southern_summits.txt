The Societies of the Southern Summits (SSS) is a loose economic and diplomatic union created in the year 1968 between the founding nations of The Empire of Aurora Veritas, Upper Meracydia and the Republic of Helvatia in order to endure a trade blockade from the Greater Boreal Union. As time went on and new members were added, the union quickly grew into an effective military alliance, which to this day protects its members from raiders and imperialists alike.

Although each member has their unique societal structure and core beliefs, the Union welcomes all potential forms of government and economic models, safe for those that structurally abuse human rights of their citizens and neighbours.
