[color=blue]Dabor Dan and Welcome to Yugoslavia![/color]

[color=gray]Tito is dead and so is his dream of brotherhood and unity among the south Slavic peoples. Our beloved red star has since been replaced with the eagle. but our name lives on from Belgrade&#39;s streets in Serbia to the mountains of Montenegro onward to the minarets of Kosovo.[/color]

[color=red]Busts and Memorials linked to our beloved Yugoslavia&#39;s past shall remain untouched as a testament to the golden age ushered in by Tito prior to 1980.[/color]
