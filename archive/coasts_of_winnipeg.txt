Coasts of Winnipeg is a small community of nations located in the coastal region of Winnipeg.

Historically, the CoW have been extremely diverse in ideals and goals, 
agreeing only to a live-and-let-live policy not to engage in all out warfare.

In recent years, some of the CoW&amp;#39;s core nations have formed closer alliances.
Others have been leveraging for greater power in the region as much as cooperating to benefit the region in its entirety.
