Coasts of Winnipeg is a small community of nations thrown together in a barren zombie-ravaged world.

Historically, the CoW nations have been extremely diverse in ideals and goals, 
on occasion even resorting to all-out warfare and name-calling.

Since the zombie apocalypse of 2014 the nations have been forced to unite, drawing even the most rebellious of nations in the region to cooperate in the name of survival.
