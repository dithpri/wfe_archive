Our organization unites those who believe in the power of national traditions, sustainable development and pragmatic management. We support governments that prioritize the safety of citizens, economic stability, and cultural identity &#150; rather than blindly following fashionable but destructive doctrines.
Together, we will resist the aggressive imposition of alien values, protect freedom of speech from the censorship of &quot;political correctness,&quot; and promote real solutions instead of populism and social experimentation.
