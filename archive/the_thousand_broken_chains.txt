The Thousand Broken Chains is a series of island nations residing in idyllic harmony. Originally founded to escape the hustle and bustle of bigger, more populated regions, The Thousand Broken Chains soon became a refuge for nations wanting a bit more peace and quiet. All are welcome, as long as they respect the rules: no fascists, no bullies, and no trolls.
