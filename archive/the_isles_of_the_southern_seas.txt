Welcome to the Isles! The Isles is a region of several separate islands, small or large. In this region, we welcome newer nations to the fold for safety from the terrible continental powers. Monarchists and Democratic nations are allowed entry, as are Socialist and Authoritarian regimes. Individually, we are weak and small island nations, collapsing at the seams, yet together we can knit together into a glorious region of prosperity and power.

Join this welcoming region and help it to grow and prosper. It would be better for us all if you tasted the sweetness of our kind diplomacy then our sharp swords of battle.
