greetings one and all to the socialist union... we are a completely democratic group of role players and all even the smaller nations have equal say, it helps if we all know you in person but that is not required, we do have a strict social policy about rudeness and spamming and have peace agreements to stop any conflict, we would welcome you with open arms, we love new members and will treat you how you treat us, we also have a role playing aspect that you may wish to join at any time, please just relax and let the union worry for you... we wish you welcome and invite you to all our festivals and activity&#39;s

thank you
Un-challenged president Nicholas Riha
