&amp;#39;Eastern Natiostate&amp;#39; is the eastern side of the continent of Natiostate.

On this side, state-owned industry is significantly more common, while the private market is much more regulated; taxation is not viewed as theft (so long as it is diverted to something that benefits the majority), and as a result, taxes are much higher. Governments are much larger, and political systems are more majority oriented.
