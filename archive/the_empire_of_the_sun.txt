The Empire of the Sun is a small region ruled by the Benevolent Princess Celestia. It is open to anyone willing to add their number under her banner. 

Humans and Ponies alike are welcome, as well as any Changelings, as they have suffered needlessly due to actions taken by one Princess Luna, whom Celestia hopes will one day come to her senses.
