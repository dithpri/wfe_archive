[color=blue][b][i]The Alterian Rift is an astral anomaly that houses Ulnar, where the xel&#39;naga seeded the universe with life. 
It contains such unrelenting forces that it should shred anything that enters it into its base particles. 
Within it exists a pocket between universes. 
While within the rift, no transmissions can be sent in or out.[/b][/i][/color]
