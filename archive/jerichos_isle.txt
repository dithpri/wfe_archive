Greetings friend.
Though this region is small, we humbly welcome and accept all.
Here, you are safe. 
Here, there is freedom.
Here, you are heard.
Here, you are welcome. 
 The sports here are phenominal, the people are incredible, the landscape is a perfect barrier against any danger- the rest is whatever you make of it. 
Join us brother. Join us sister.
