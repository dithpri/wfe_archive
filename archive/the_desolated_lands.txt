[b][color=red]Home of TDL Empire[/b][/color]

Welcome to [b]The Desolated Lands[/b]. We plan to spread desolation to the furthest regions of the world.
The TDL Empire is currently creating a massive and stable empire within the NS World.

[b]We were founded in December 2003 and ceased military activity in September 2004. We are no longer an active raiding region but we will remember the history of the TDL[/b]
