The Northern Archipelago Alliance (NAA) is a strategic coalition formed by the nations of the Northern Archipelago Region to promote mutual security, economic cooperation, and political stability. Though the member states differ in political systems, cultures, and economies, the Alliance serves as a framework to balance regional power dynamics, particularly in response to the militaristic ambitions of nations like Ventagon.
