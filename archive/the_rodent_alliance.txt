This is the headquarters and safe haven of the Rodent Alliance, dedicated to the fanatical protection of all small, fuzzy creatures - especially those that like gnawing holes in things.  Visitors are welcome as long as they don&#39;t cause trouble.  Enemies will be undermined from below, or possibly eaten by the undead.
