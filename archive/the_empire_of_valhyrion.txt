The Empire of Valhyrion is one of the most powerful and expansive empires in the known world. Born from the Great Expansion, the Empire now stretches across vast lands and multiple territories, including 13 nations that have been brought under its rule through the Treaty of Sovereignty. These territories, once independent kingdoms and nations, have sworn allegiance to the Empire, ceding full control to the Emperor of Valhyrion.
