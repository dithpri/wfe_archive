The Dread Masters were six powerful masters who served the Lord-Imperator for centuries as prophets, generals, and advisers. Their name was earned when they studied the power of the Phobis devices, artefacts that had driven even the most depraved lords mad with terror. This power allowed the Dread Masters to destroy entire ruins during the Great Word Assembly War; they had mastered the art of battle meditation to the point that they would inflict an awful, mysterious terror upon members of any given region. In order to avoid being compromised, they kept in constant motion in an region that roamed the world.
