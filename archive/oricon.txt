[b]The Dread Masters:[/b]
[b][color=#00ace6]The Roman Empire tried to invade our HQ! This amuses us, as we are the real controlling force!!! But oh, in the name of invaders, we salute you! On other matters, we are not declaring war, but Kyorgian must be ejected, to hopefully never return. Anyway, the Dread Masters are n[/color][color=lightblue]o[/color][color=magenta]t[/color] [color=#00ace6]that bad, though we like to &#39;play&#39; with our regions sometimes. We control [region]The Holy Empire of Pure Evil[/region], [region]Ebola Quarantine Zone[/region], [region]Hecrueya[/region], [region]Norwich[/region] and a ton more. We are allied with [region]Totalitarian Freedom[/region], [region]Free Coalition of Governments[/region].[/b][/color]
