The Alliance of Isolationist Nations, or TAIN for short (pronounced like rain, but with a T instead of a R), is a region dedicated to the proposition that national sovereignty is a good thing. Nations shouldn&#39;t have to answer to some international panel if they don&#39;t want to. Be proud of your country. Nations should be able to do what they want. If that&#39;s what you want, join The Alliance of Isolationist Nations.
