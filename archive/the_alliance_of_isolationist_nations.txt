The Alliance of Isolationist Nations, or TAIN for short (pronounced like rain, but with a T), is a region dedicated to the proposition that national sovereignty is a good thing, and that nations should determine THEIR future. Nations shouldn&#39;t have to answer to some international panel if they don&#39;t want to. Some may argue the existence of this region is hypocritical, as it is an international authority, but the only reason this one exists is so that nations aren&#39;t crushed under regulations from other international authorities. As evidenced by that, if you join this region, there are no requirements, like joining the WA or endorsing certain people. We were founded November 10th, 2020, A.D.
