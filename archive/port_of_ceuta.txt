[b]Here is Ceuta[/b][hr]

Ceuta is a Spanish exclave and autonomous city on Morocco&#146;s north coast, facing Europe across the Strait of Gibraltar. With 18.5 square kilometers and about 85,000 people, it has been strategic since antiquity. Taken by Portugal in 1415 and ceded to Spain in 1580, its status was confirmed in 1668. Today it is a free port outside the EU customs union, relying on shipping, duty-free trade, and cross-border commerce, while also serving as a military base and EU frontier.[hr]
