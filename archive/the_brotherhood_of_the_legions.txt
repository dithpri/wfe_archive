[color=red][b]Welcome to the Brotherhood of the Legions![/b][/color] 
You have joined a global order with nations all working together in harmony to unite the world in the name of peace and realize the true potential of mankind. The Brotherhood champions the common people &#150; the 80% of the world&#146;s population that struggles to get by in zones torn by war, wracked by poverty, and abandoned. 

The powerful oppress the weak in the hollow name of freedom and the only counter to the fascists power is the Brotherhood. The legions meet strength with strength in the name of peace and progress. The legions are the only hope against fascist tyranny. [b]Brotherhood&#133; Unity&#133; Peace.[/b]
