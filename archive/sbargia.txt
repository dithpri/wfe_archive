After the SBARG players had connected to The Game, and entered the Medium...
Many shenanigans had been done, but now the players were getting bored.
It was decided:
&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s use time and space shenanigans to make nations in the Medium.&amp;quot;
This is their story.


SBARGia is a region for SBARG and SBARGv2 players. 

Nonhuman nations are only allowed if they fit a quality test -- if players think a non-human nation sucks, it will be reviewed and voted on.
