As noted above, this is an alliance in the name of Social Democracy.  No extremists (so no, no far-right nor far-left welcome) and only a defence of the inherent right of humanity to essential necessities, including quality healthcare, education, financial aid, and the guarantee of political and civil rights for every citizen and resident of their nation.  A strict adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is also required.
