[color=#ff8f9a][b]&amp;#127800; WELCOME TO SUOU YUKI&#39;S EMPIRE, THE OTAKU SYNDICATE! &amp;#127800;[/b]

&amp;#127800; As your devoted imouto and ultimate otaku, I&#146;m excited to share our little corner of the universe with you. We&#146;re a [b][i]BREAKAWAY REGION[/i][/b] from [region]New Animeland Regional Union[/region], [b][i]SEEKING[/i][/b] our [b][i]OWN INDEPENDENCE[/i][/b] to fully embrace the anime lifestyle! &amp;#127800;

&amp;#127800; I&#146;m determined to [b][i]EXPAND[/i][/b] the Otaku Syndicate&#39;s influence through [b][i]STRATEGIC DIPLOMACY[/i][/b] with other regions. But if that doesn&#146;t work out? Well, we&#146;ll have to consider a [b][i]SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATION![/i][/b] So far, we&#146;ve [b][i]SUCCESSFULLY[/i][/b] taken over [b][i]4[/i][/b] inactive region/s and [b][i]0[/i][/b] active region/s! &amp;#127800;

&amp;#127800; I hope you enjoy your stay here! MWAHAHAHA &amp;#127800;[/color]
