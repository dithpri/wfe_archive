The Peaceful Confederation of Autonomy is grounded in 3 basic principles:

1. National Peace

2. Personal Liberty

3. Individual Autonomy

This confederation of nations believes that only small governments can allow for maximum liberty; i.e., less power to the state, more power to the individual. In fact, it might not be such a bad idea to eliminate the state altogether - but such things are simply debatable conjecture.

We are pro-capitalist, anti-communist, and stay far away from WA matters.

Anyone is welcome to join, so long as you can abide by these principles.
