The Peaceful Confederation of Autonomy is grounded in 3 basic principles:

1. National Peace

2. Personal Liberty

3. Individual Autonomy

This confederation of nations believes that only small governments can allow for maximum liberty; i.e., less power to the state, more power to the individual. In fact, it might not be such a bad idea to eliminate the state altogether - but such things are simply debatable conjecture.

We are pro-capitalist, anti-communist, and stay far away from WA matters. Out of principle, we also do not participate in embassies.

Anyone is welcome to join, so long as you can abide by these principles. Message [nation]Endurion[/nation] with any questions
