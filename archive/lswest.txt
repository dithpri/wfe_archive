[color=blue]LSWest[/color] is simply a way of sorting all of the [color=blue]LSWest[/color] students who wish to join into one accessible list for us to view as well as for us to avoid the incessant notifications. Maybe it&#39;s easier to deal with elsewhere but the South Pacific currently has 3000 notifications for me and it&#39;s really irritating tbh. Also, this is the best way for the region mechanics to become accessible to a small group and possibly increase the accumulation of influence, with [color=gold]Adennia[/color] serving as a watchdog against raiding by non-[color=blue]LSWest[/color] nations.
