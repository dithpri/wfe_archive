[color=blue]LSWest[/color] is simply a way of sorting all of the [color=blue]LSWest[/color] students who wish to join into one accessible list for us to view as well as for us to avoid the incessant notifications.

Also, this is the best way for the region mechanics to become accessible to a small group and possibly increase the accumulation of [color=gold]influence[/color], with [nation=long]Adennia[/nation] serving as a watchdog against raiding by non-[color=blue]LSWest[/color] nations. To better be able to run my country into the ground morally, I am leaving the World Assembly and stepping down as delegate.
