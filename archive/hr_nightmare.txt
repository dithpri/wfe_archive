Freedom isn&amp;#39;t free, and you won&amp;#39;t find a nation more staunch in its defense of that idea than you will in our little corner of the world. Freedom of every kind is in abundance here - enough to make every little day-to-day action a potential lawsuit in most countries. You probably won&amp;#39;t even be able to brush your teeth without making a lawyer soil himself from anxiety. But you know what? You don&amp;#39;t care. 

It&amp;#39;s your country. Live life the way you want to.
