Star Vigil is a small, but growing coalition of sovereign nations. While most of the nations that the region consists of are in close proximity of each other none of them technically share any borders as it was agreed upon to keep varying levels of land between each nation reserved for emergency expansion, mass migration, and peace talks. Territories designated for these reservations are considered demilitarized zones.
