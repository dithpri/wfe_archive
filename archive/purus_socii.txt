Purus socii is Latin for &amp;quot;pure allies.&amp;quot; This region is dedicated to peace and prosperity everywhere. We help each other out and give helpful advice whenever is needed. The founder, the delegate, nobody is above anybody. We are all equals in God&amp;#39;s eyes. (Not trying to offend anyone&amp;#39;s religion)
