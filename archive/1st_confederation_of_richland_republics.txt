The Confederation of Richland Republics was a joint alliance of several nation states that joined together to protect themselves from outside barbaric nations. It is a very diverse region where each state operates in their own way. However, disagreements tend to happen on a daily basis and even though these nations are a part of a confederation, violence among them has plagued their history time and time again. On March 7th these nations all celebrate Supreme Leader Day in which they give homage to their region&amp;#39;s founder, hero, and Supreme Leader Mr. Richards. &amp;quot;ALL HAIL THE GREAT LION OF THE LIBERATED CONFEDERACY OF THE RICHLAND STATES!!!!!.
