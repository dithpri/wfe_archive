[b]Welcome to the Foreign Union![/b]

Greetings! We are the Foreign Union, a place where capitalists, communists, and everything in between come together, usually without violence! Here is a place for the students of our school to discuss political views and explore new ideas of governance. If you wish to join, message The Fully Automated Gay Space Communists or ask one of us in person, and we will give you the password. We are a small region, but we look forward to expanding it so that it encompasses a wider range of different nations and political views! We are happy that you have come to check us out and, again, welcome!
