Zen is a world discovered accidentally by scientist performing experiments on unknown crystals. The result of the experiment was that it ripped holes in between universes and caused new phenomena which we called &amp;quot;portal storms&amp;quot;. These storms caused portals to rapidly open and close between the two universes. BOOM! A portal opened on you and now you&amp;#39;re in another universe where everything is just gigantic floating islands in space each with an atmosphere. Anyway, this happened to millions of people, animals, buildings, climates, etc. So now you, your family, and everyone else on your floating island (and the unhappy creatures who already live there) have to join together and make their own nation of portal storm survivors. Good luck.
