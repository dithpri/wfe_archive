[b][color=teal]Welcome to New Olympus![/color]

[color=red][region]New Olympus[/region] is a relatively new region, which all are welcome to join, though people of certain ideologies may be given evil looks. And, as we&amp;#39;re new, we need a few nations to help us build up, through doing stuff like setting up the regional government and getting a recruitment system going before the new TG system makes our growth more difficult.[/color]

[color=purple]Your help is also needed so we can establish a regional Constitution, Army, Government and whatever else needs setting up.[/color]

[color=blue]If you choose to join, enjoy your stay![/color]
