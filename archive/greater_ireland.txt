[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to celebrate Valentine&#39;s Day around NationStates, raiding some regions in the name of love. Along the way, they dropped some chocolates and roses over some regions, and sent some valentines to a couple of (now former) delegates.

Roses are red, violets are blue. I wanna spend the next nine seconds of my life with you! 

Will you be our Valentine? [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Come Join Us[/url] on a raid, and help us share the love.
