&quot;[i]They call themselves the Junimos...
Mysterious spirits, these ones.
I&#39;m not sure why they&#39;ve moved into your region, but you have no reason to fear them.[/i]&quot;

&quot;[i]We are the Junimos. Keepers of the Forest.
We are happy to aid you, if you are one with the Forest.[/i]&quot;
