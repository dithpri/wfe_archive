This region comprises of mostly authoritarian nations, although it lies open for any willing to join. The founder, Edward II von Preusen welcomes you to the commonwealth, in which all nations prosper. The commonwealth is a break-away region of Kaiserreich. The King of New Preusen saw it necessary, due to strict and unrealistic policies. Although Kaiserreich remains the main rival of the Commonwealth, the region looks favourable towards diplomatic solutions of any conflict, including the rivalry. To join our discord, please approach New Preusen.
