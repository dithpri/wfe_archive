Welcome to the United Alliance, a roleplaying region. Carve out an empire for yourself with cunning diplomacy, intrigue, and military prowess in our Twentieth Century theme.

Following the devastating [b]Second Great War[/b], which led to victory for the villainous United Empire and its New World Order against the democratic Allies, the world has been thrown into the darkness of the [b]Cold War[/b].  Will democracy finally triumph, or will evil cement its global hegemony?
