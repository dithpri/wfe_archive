A universal faction that strives to protect the righteous and punish evildoers. All citizens must serve in the military for one year, though 75% of this time is not spent on duty. The Alliance does not care for social justice, but instead focuses on larger and more important affairs. Citizens who protest or act against the Alliance are brought to justice and punished accordingly to their crimes. The Alliance does not support tyranny or cruelty. Allied nations are known to be police States, though the laws are very agreeable and acceptable.
