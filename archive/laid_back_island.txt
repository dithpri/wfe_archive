[B]Welcome to The Laid back Island[/B]
The Laid Back Island is a young region that supports roleplay, pacifism, and small regions. The founding principle is the belief that all people are equal and deserve equal rights (Egalitarianism). I was inspired by my other nation [nation=long]Lekey[/nation] of [region]The Black Hawks[/region], to found this region. Feel free to join if you want to.
