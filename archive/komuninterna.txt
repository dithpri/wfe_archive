The new Comintern (Communist International)! Socialist homelands of the whole globe, unite in the pursuit of communism, unity! This organization is revolutionary, and we will not tolerate revisionists and reformists, political debate will be openly allowed, as long as it is not fascist. The name is in a semi-extinct language called Nheengat&uacute;, I was also inspired by Mandarin and Cyrillic/Russian.
