Rose Island was an abandoned amusement park near Charlestown, Indiana, situated on a peninsula (the &quot;Devil&#39;s Backbone&quot;) created by Fourteen Mile Creek emptying into the Ohio River. It was a recreational area known as Fern Grove in the 1880s, mostly used as a church camp. It was so named due to the many ferns that grew there. The Louisville and Jeffersonville Ferry Company acquired it and developed it in order to increase the use of its ferry business. As Fern Grove it thrived on church picnics and family outings.
