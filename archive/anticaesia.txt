A cold desolate continent of ice and snow, much resembling Antarctica. The continent&#39;s few inhabitants (~20,000) were brought under the control of the supreme leader who uplifted them and established himself as dictator. This continent now serves as the private property of the supreme leader, who is also president of a powerful republic far away. (hence his ability to take the continent)
