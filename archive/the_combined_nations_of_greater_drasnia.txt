the former west drasnian empire saw it take over most of Drasina and some of the neighbouring Feravel as well as smaller states such as roulaini and East Dasnia. The collapse of the empire has left west drasnia in an overriding position of power. Borders returned to normal with the eexception of north drasina, which became several states and eventually became a protectorate of West drasnia.
