the former west drasnian empire saw it take over most of Drasina and some of the neighbouring Feravel as well as smaller states such as roulaini and Dasnia, which was ravaged by a violent civil war after the empire gave it it&#39;s freedom and the people of east dasnia ran back to the safety of the empire. The collapse of the empire has left west drasnia in an overriding position of power. Borders returned to normal with the eexception of north drasina, which became several states and eventually became a protectorate of West drasnia.
