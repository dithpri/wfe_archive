The Global Alliance Organization is a group of nations that focus on making the world a better, safer, and healthier place by reducing carbon emissions, using green energy, offering above average welfare systems, equal rights, eliminating crime, and giving everyone a fair and great change at a great life. Eliminating crime is tough, but can be done by making prisons less violent, and instead rehabilitation centers that don&#146;t punish the crime, but fix and treat the underlying mental/physical problem that causes the crime. We also focus on making scientific advancements to improve this world, not harm it. To join us you must have a Civil Rights rank of &#147;Average&#148; or above. You must also have a Political Freedoms rank of &#147;Average&#148; or above.
