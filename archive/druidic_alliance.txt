This alliance was founded on the grounds of many nations having fallen into ashes through hate-filled war. Through the ashes, the nine nations destroyed fell into rebellion with no laws or government. However, numerous NCOs and officers from the nations lead small remainders of their tiny collective militaries against the anarchy and created a new nation on the fallen grounds of Druidic Domain. There is now a peaceful alliance for this one nation.
