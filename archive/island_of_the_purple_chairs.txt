Longer than last weeks and yet just as interesting. Is our education system in need of a recall? Cheers for the narrator and creator, Ken Robinson. Also, cheers to Ken Robinson&amp;#39;s accent. Now sip your tea!

Don&amp;#39;t Hug me I&amp;#39;m Scared is an... interesting video to say the least.

In the end, how you interpret it is all up to you.
