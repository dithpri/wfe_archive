The Chita Republic was a short-lived workers&#39; republic based in Chita from the end of 1905 to the beginning of 1906. Chita, a city in eastern Siberia, Russia, and a place of exile for early revolutionaries and combatants of the Russo-Japanese War, was a center for worker unrest in the early 1900s. During the Russian Revolution of 1905 armed revolutionaries under the leadership of the RSDLP headed by Viktor Kurnatovsky, Anton Kostiushko-Voliuzhanich, and Ivan Babushkin organized themselves into a &quot;Soviet of Soldiers&#39; and Cossacks&#39; Deputies&quot; and took control over the city, declaring the Chita Republic in December 1905.
