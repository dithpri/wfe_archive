Sambhala is a place of peace, tranquility, and happiness. Shambhalasians believe in a society where all the inhabitants are enlightened, and strive to be Buddhist Pure Land. Shambhala is ruled over by a line of Kings of Shambhala known as Kalki Kings, monarchs who uphold the integrity of the Kalachakra tantra. The Kalachakra prophesies that when the world declines into war and greed, and all is lost, the 25th Kalki king will emerge from Shambhala with a huge army to vanquish &amp;quot;Dark Forces&amp;quot; and usher in a worldwide Golden Age.
