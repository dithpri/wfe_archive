In Tibetan Buddhist and Hindu traditions, [b]Shambhala[/b] is a mythical kingdom hidden somewhere in Hollow Earth. It is mentioned in various ancient texts, including the Kalacakra Tantra and the ancient Zhangzhung texts of western Tibet. 

Hindu texts such as the Vishnu Purana mention the village Shambhala as the birthplace of Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu who will usher in a new Golden Age.

The legends, teachings and healing practices associated with Shambhallah are older than any of these organized religions. Shambhallah may very well have been an indigenous belief system, an Alti-Hymalian shamanic tradition, absorbed into these other faiths.&#151;Wikipedia[hr]
