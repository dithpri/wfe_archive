[b]Legends speak of a masterful thief, known by the name of [color=#cccc00]Mr Money[/color]. He stole the jewels of royalty, used fraud to obtain endless wealth, and it wasn&#39;t to give back to the poor. Even the underworld we pirates live in loathed him.

This embodiment of greed hid his treasure on a hidden island nobody could find. However, he got caught trying to [color=#542100]steal the Rum[/color] &amp;#129347; from us, knowing full well there are rare bottles worth a hefty sum among the [color=#0000ff]Pirate King[/color]&#39;s reserves. We made him [color=#1d7eed]walk the plank[/color], obviously. &amp;#9760;

He was carrying a map, so we followed it and found the fabled island. We pirates of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_west_pacific][color=#cc0000]The West Pacific[/color][/url] have come to pillage Mr Money&#39;s precious booty with the help of [region]Caer Sidi[/region], [region]The East Pacific[/region], [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], and [region]Equilism[/region][/b]
