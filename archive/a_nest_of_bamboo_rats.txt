[b][color=red][u]Congratulations![/u] [/color]

[color=orange]You&#39;ve discovered [region]A Nest of Bamboo Rats[/region] somewhere in your house, perhaps in the attic? In that case, you need to call Pest Control and they&#39;ll exterminate these pesky Bamboo Rats, hopefully for a reasonable fee. [/color]

[color=purple]Just kidding! :p[/color]
