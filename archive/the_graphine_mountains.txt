We are a region of science, we promote the development and advancement of technology and the schools of thought. We are a secluded mountain Region, not many reside here, Though we hope that many will come to us for out technology which may or may not include weapons. Though the occasional politics are necessary, we generally find it boorish and would rather focus on our Sciences. Overall we are peaceful, we do not wish for our work to be destroyed. Please do not bother us, unless you are here to purchase something. Hail Science.
