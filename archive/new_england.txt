Welcome to [region=GREAT Britain]&amp;#39;s outpost in North America.  New England is a vacationer&#146;s paradise.  It contains some of the most beautiful country in the new world and is the best place on the continent to ski in the winter, go boating in the spring, visit beaches in the summer and see the leaves change in autumn.    For our permanent residents, New England has robust industry, well-educated citizens and the best universities in the World.
