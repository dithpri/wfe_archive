[color=#BF4040][b][u]Welcome To Astrum![/u][/b][/color]

[color=#BF4040][b]Astrum[/b][/color] is a closed-world, worldbuilding and roleplaying project. Set in a world with a setting similar to dieselpunk, Astrum offers gargantaun airships trailing the smoky skies, as well as peculiar vehicles making their way down below. Astrum is one of the few, if not the only, region on NationStates offering roleplaying and worldbuilding set in a dieselpunk world.

Feel free to join us, while we&#39;re still here!
