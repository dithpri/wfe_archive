Long thought to be merely the stuff of legends, Greater Slabodia, founded by the Eponymous Peruvian man about town, is a region built on the ideas of freedom, equality, dancing, compassion and generally having a great time all the time. We are a strong region, united by our complete lack of common beliefs: we all want to have fun, so that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing, unless you don&amp;#39;t want to have fun, in which case feel free not to.
