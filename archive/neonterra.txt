The year is 2063, and humanity is still isolated in this planet, there is no hope reaching the stars, for all that man has made in the field of technology is useless, entertainment, holograms, neural implants, nanobots, everything is serving under the corporate banners and other zealots nations around the world.

There is no hope for a better future, because it died when all the interest in outer space, in exploration of our exterior faded and dissapeared into the darkness of space and time itself.
