An angel came to me in the night.  

Here are the new rules.  

Everyone is welcome, including Blacks and Hispanics.  We will not shoot you or send you back to Guatemala.  Indeed our most important rule is NO GUNS. [color=blue]Thou shalt not kill.[/color]

Our second most important rule is DON&amp;#39;T BE GREEDY.  It&amp;#39;s not all about me, me, me.  

Our third important rule is you have to be gay.  NO, JUST KIDDING, but if you are gay, come out of the closet right now.  It is not a hot button issue here, and some of the Guatemalans are seriously cute.

If I think of anything else the angel told me, I&amp;#39;ll let you know.
