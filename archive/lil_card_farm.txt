[i]Well what do you grow in this farm you speak of?[/i]

[b]Why, cards of course![/b]

[u]The fields of cards around here are tilled and maintained daily by The Glorious Capitol&#146;s personal card farm. [/u]

(Even though this is a designated card farm for The Glorious Capitol, feel free to store your puppets here as well)
