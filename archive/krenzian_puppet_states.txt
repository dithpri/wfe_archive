The Krenzian Republic has arisen from the old government to provide security and luxury for all people under the Krenzian banner. The main party in power, the NUP, has then expanded it&amp;#39;s influence to many other nations around the great republic. To secure the rise of Communism the republic has given the nations a chance to align themselves to the NUP party.
