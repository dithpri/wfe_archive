Huzzah, huzzah, all that good stuff.  This place was no match for a charge by our angry fighting hoes, and Pimp Slap now owns the place.

Have a good day and don&amp;#39;t worry &amp;#39;cause nothing will change.  Be happy.

Here, enjoy some of my music.

PS.  I&amp;#39;m thinking of using this place as a raiding base, or maybe a roleplaying region.  I&amp;#39;ll make a poll.
