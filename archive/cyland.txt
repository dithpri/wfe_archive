Roleplay:

Cyland is a region devoted to a [b]Realistic Map based roleplay[/b]. Cyland allows players, both new and old, to create a nation with the culture, ideology, and people of their choosing and play it out with other nations on our map! [hr]

Government:

Currently, Cyland will be controlled directly by the founder until such a time that a constitutional convention can be called into order. However, the ideal system of government will not need the founder to operate. It will feature an executive branch and a senate.  [hr][hr]
