The World Alliance is a region where all nations, big or small, capitalist or communist, can be defended and represented in the World Assembly. Here all nations are safe and can speak and be heard by the world.

&#149; We believe in:
   &amp;#10146; Peace and cooperation
   &amp;#10146; Alliances, embassies (we accept almost all embassies, please propose)
   &amp;#10146; The right to be represented
   &amp;#10146; Multiple ideologies 

&#149; We do not approve of:
   &amp;#10146; War or tensions between regions
   &amp;#10146; Racism, fascism or, indeed, any kind of discrimination
   &amp;#10146; Raiding or bullying
   &amp;#10146; Invasion or applying pressure on other nations/regions

We are currently accepting all embassies except those from raiders or war-centered regions (ex. DEN, The Black Riders...).
