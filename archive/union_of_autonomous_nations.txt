Founded by Alelusia, the Union of Autonomous Nations aims to be a safe haven for anyone who fears having a militaristic, dictatorial ruler as the head of their region. It also aims to be a friendly, relaxed, democratic region, without discrimination or hate.

The owner of the region is the Democratic Republic of Alelusia, which allows all types of nations to reside here and gives full freedom of speech to them, unless they use it to offensively attack other nations, in which case Alelusia will consult with the other Officers to discuss the situation and evaluate any course of action. Playful teasing is allowed.
