Founded by Alelusia after it had been unjustly expelled from the Union of Independent Nations, the Union of Autonomous Nations aims to be a safe haven for anyone who fears having a militaristic, dictatorial ruler as the head of their region. It also aims to be a democratic alternative to nations residing in the aforementioned region.

The owner of the region is the Democratic Republic of Alelusia, which allows all types of nations to reside here and gives full freedom of speech to them, unless they use it to offensively attack other nations, in which case Alelusia will consult with the other nations with Executive powers to discuss the situation and evaluate any course of action. Playful teasing is allowed.
