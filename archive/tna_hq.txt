L.N.A or T.N.A Is an alliance called after the invasion of Slin Hifen. The invaders, Slin, and some other have joined this alliance to strengthen ties between nations. While they all have different ideologies, they are very patriotic about [region]the South Pacific[/region] and will protect it from filthy outsiders! Overall, this is a defensive pact.
