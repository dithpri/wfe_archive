Finding many civilized islands surrounding Kazonast&amp;#39;s water-logged borders, the country&amp;#39;s government decided to create a nation in order to help maintain peace and control in the middle of the North Atlantic. Nations who Kazonast&amp;#39;s government feel well represent similar ideas and morals are welcome to join, assuming the fill out the proper paperwork, of course (remember, peace and control).
