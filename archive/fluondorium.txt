Fluondorium was once a strong &amp; powerful region until The Great Fluondorium Cataclysm.Once a long time before the Fluondorion people lived in great harmony and peace praying and giving gifts to there gods little did they know that was all about to change.300 years before the Gods waged war on the whole of humanity destroying everything in the process eventually sealing away the very thing that caused that.No after 300 years of slumber the Evil awoke and was unleashed once again killing 3 of the 7 gods in the process only after the aid of the mortals were the gods able to defeat this evil once and for all leaving the region in a state of unrest now the gods seek to rebuild this once glorious region.
