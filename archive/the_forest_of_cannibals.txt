A mysterious island inhabited with cannibals has risen from the depths and is inhabited by cannibals. This is a region for all those that go to my school. Discussion of any and all sorts is welcome in the region but[b] Bigoted comments will be suppressed on the regional message board[/b]. Other than this we will adhere to the rules of National-Sovereignty, if you don&#39;t know what that is i suggest looking up The Vanguard Treaty, and leave Nations to do as they wish

For all those that are a part of the WA, please, endorse [nation]Mutant Cannibals[/nation] to continue peace and stability in [region]The Forest of Cannibals[/region]
