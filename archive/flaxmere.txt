Flaxmere remains strongly committed to democratic elections despite the presence of some rather undemocratic states among its membership. Accordingly soon the region will undertake its very first election! The election will occur on the 16th of the month and will include the following positions.

Regional Delegate to the World Assembly:

Secretary General (Deputy Delegate):

Commander General of the Military:

Secretary of Internal Affairs (Recruitment):

In future we will add further positions as the region grows, in the mean time all those interested should indicate their preferred position on the regional message board so that the vote can occur on time. The voting period will be two days in length.
