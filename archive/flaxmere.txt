Flaxmere is well known for its deep fissures along ideological lines, periphery states often adopting a strong authoritarian and oppressive style of government in order to compete with the more developed, grouping of core states.

As a result of its polarized membership, Flaxmere is always open to the addition of new members from across the political spectrum.

Soon we will be forming a forum in which members states can have a yarn and generally plan their respective moves.
