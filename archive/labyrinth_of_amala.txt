I had a dream, a long, long time ago...
A dream of destruction...
A dream of resurrection...
Of a world where man had perished...
And demons wandered free...
A dream of something wicked...
And the ultimate freedom...
Where you were dead...
And so was everyone else.
Are you sure you&amp;#39;re ready? To hear about my dream?
Good.
Because...
It wasn&amp;#39;t a dream.
