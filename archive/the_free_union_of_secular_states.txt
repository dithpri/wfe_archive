The Free Union of Secular States (FUSS) was founded with the many goals in mind; most of all, cooperation of scientific advancement, the goal of maintaining freedom for those in all states, and championing the Separation of Church and State. 

FUSS adopts the constitution of The Free Land of Monoamine, which is currently in the works of a constitution after secession from the peoples&#39; former nation.

Furthermore, until constitutional law is in place, nations are to follow the general tenants of FUSS to their discretion at risk of penalty. This will be loosely enforced in the absence of proper law.
