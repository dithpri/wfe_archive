This region was formerly resided in by the founder, a puppet of [nation=Tinhampton]. This region has now been refounded to protect it from being hawked by raiders, etc. [b]The original founder, [nation=Ivory Isle], or any of the former natives of [region=Auroran] (which has been taken over by a raider group), is welcome to return if he so chooses.[/b][hr][b]OLD WFE:[/b]

[i]Greetings all,

[u][B]Ivory Isles will be closing soon.[/B][/u]

I have stretched my puppet nations to thin. And I would like to ask each member of Ivory Isles if they would like to move to [u][B][region]Auroran[/region][/B][/u], my other region that I have. Auroran was first established before Ivory Isles. So please join [u][B][region]Auroran[/region] [/B][/u]because I have stretched my nations to thin. Thank you.[/i]
