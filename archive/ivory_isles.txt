Greetings all,

[u][B]Ivory Isles will be closing soon.[/B][/u]

I have stretched my puppet nations to thin. And I would like to ask each member of Ivory Isles if they would like to move to [u][B][region]Auroran[/region][/B][/u], my other region that I have. Auroran was first established before Ivory Isles. So please join [u][B][region]Auroran[/region] [/B][/u]because I have stretched my nations to thin. Thank you.
