[b]New Delegate Elected in Balder[/b]
PostBy [nation]Roavin[/nation]

In breaking news, [nation]Solorni[/nation] has stepped down from the throne of [region]Balder[/region], to the world&#39;s pleasant surprise. With the assistance of the South Pacific Special Forces, Balder will now become a part of His Royal Majesty King [nation]Sandaoguo[/nation]&#39;s eternal domain.

From now on, there will be no corruption of Balder&#39;s government towards the interests of Imperialists - rather, it will be safely held in the eternally diplomatic hands of Glen Rhodes, who will stage totally open and democratic elections that anyone can win. No longer will the same few players cycle through all the positions. That was the old Balder, and this will be a new one!
