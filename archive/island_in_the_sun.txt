When you&#146;re on a holiday
You can&#146;t find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too

On an island in the sun
We&#146;ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can&#146;t control my brain


When you&#146;re on a golden sea
You don&#146;t need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

On an island in the sun
We&#146;ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can&#146;t control my brain

We&#146;ll run away together
We&#146;ll spend some time forever
We&#146;ll never feel bad anymore
