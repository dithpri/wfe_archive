ASPEN&#39;s official monster hunting region

Welcome to HEMELBLOEIEN, Aspen&#39;s monster hunting region, where the sky shines blue and orange, and the weeds grow quick, while your crops grow late.

You are being pursued by monsters deep beneath the earth, but maybe, you can tame them, you can ride them or make butter from their eldritch milk, or maybe,

They&#39;re so abhorrent and irredeemable that only through death can they be freed, or maybe...
That&#39;s what you become when you stay here,

but,

they fetch quite a dollar if you bring their heads back.
Welcome to Hemelbloeien.
