Hemelbloeien: THE ANCIENT REMENANTS NO LONGER REMAIN

[colour=skyblue][b]Year is around 2023, and whatever remains of what once existed is no longer. All we know, is when the flower blooms, the end is nigh.[/b][/colour]

[b]Unspeakable horrors of the ancient world lurk under the bright and colourful surface. The world, once bright and vibrant, is still [colour=blue]bright[/colour] and [colour=darklavender]vibrant[/colour], but [colour=magenta]saturated[/colour] and [colour=cyan]nauseating[/colour]. Every few generations, the flower blooms once, and the purge will begin, when those horrors resume their endless cleansing, in a fruitless endeavour to mask the rotting world, beneath a false serenity.[/b] ok, try to make a nation here.
