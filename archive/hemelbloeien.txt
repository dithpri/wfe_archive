Roleplay region for Aspen

Where is everybody?

Welcome to HEMELBLOEIEN, Aspen&#39;s backup RP region, where the sky shines blue and orange, and the weeds grow quick, while your crops grow late.

In these lands, split in two, something happened to this planet. Wherever you are, your primary goal right now is to feed your nation, and keep away from the maw of the ancients, but maybe, you can tame them, you can ride them or make butter from their eldritch milk, or maybe,

They&#39;re so abhorrent and irredeemable that only death can save them from their old crimes, or maybe...
That&#39;s what you become when you stay here. Welcome to Hemelbloeien.
