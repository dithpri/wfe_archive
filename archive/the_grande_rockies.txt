Hello my Friends!
Welcome to the Grande Rockies! Be sure to endorse me, our WA Delegate, and our regional nation to keep influence flowing. 

Five reasons to join The Grande Rockies:

1. We often hold games and polls! These are really fun.

2. Role-play. We think that most new nations can agree that RP on the forums is confusing, so why not join a tightly knit community where role-play is easy!

3. Everyone gets a ton of influence. Since we are small, nations with no endorsements still get a ton of influence from the algorithm.

4. If you join you are probably going to get an admin role.

5. We are all friends! Everyone here enjoys life, unlike those massively huge fodder regions like The North Pacific.
