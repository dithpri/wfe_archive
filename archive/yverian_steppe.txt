The area known today as the Yverian steppe, in south Aor, was once home to wandering tribes of both Yverian and Steppemen tribes however when the industrial revolution stated the Yverian tribes were the ones who sought to industrialize.

Many years have past since then but Yveria ,and the Yverian steppe, have stayed untied.
