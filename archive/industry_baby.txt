Baby back, ayy, couple racks, ayy
Couple Grammys on him, couple plaques, ayy
That&#39;s a fact, ayy, throw it back, ayy
Throw it back, ayy

And this one is for the champions
I ain&#39;t lost since I began, yeah
Funny how you said it was the end, yeah
Then I went did it again, yeah

I told you long ago on the road
I got what they waiting for
I don&#39;t run from nothing, dog
Get your soldiers, tell &#39;em I ain&#39;t layin&#39; low
You was never really rooting for me anyway
When I&#39;m back up at the top, I wanna hear you say
He don&#39;t run from nothin&#39;, dog
Get your soldiers, tell &#39;em that the break is over
