After the Great Vermintide nearly wiped out Civilization in the World, eradicated a species, and crippled the world economy, Humanity formed a global community to combat the possibility of this ever happening again. Ronoistan is a relatively new state to this world, rising out of the ashes of a Breesopia that was nearly destroyed in the Vermintide. The perpetrators of the Vermintide, the Skaven of the United Clan Eshin and Skurvy, still exist on this planet, humans remain fearful of another vermintide finishing them off. However the Skaven seem to have changed. Working peacefully with other nations, for they are secure in their knowledge that they still hold the largest militaries on the globe.
