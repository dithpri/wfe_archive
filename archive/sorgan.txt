Sorgan was a breathable, forested swamp planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. With a small native population, it was the only inhabitable object in its system. In 9 ABY, it was home to a Klatooinian tribe, which frequently raided a small krill farming village. The raids were eventually put to a stop by the combined efforts of mercenaries Din Djarin and Carasynthia Dune, along with the villagers.
