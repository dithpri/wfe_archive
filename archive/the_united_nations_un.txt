We are not a traditional region. Most regions act almost as nations into themselves. We do things differently. 

We&#146;re looking to build a region with real political dynamics, where members need to negotiate with each other to sway votes, agree deals and get resolutions passed. 

This won&#146;t be for everyone, but if you&#146;re open to playing the game, you&#146;re welcome. All we ask is that, even in the high of political disagreements, all members treat others with respect. 

The region&#146;s institutions are similar to the real UN, with a General Assembly consisting of all countries, a Security Council consisting of some permanent members and some elected members, and a Secretariat that will implement resolutions passed by the GA and SC.
