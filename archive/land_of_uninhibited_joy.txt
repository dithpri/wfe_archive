This is for anyone who just does not care. 

Or cares WAY too much.

&#147;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t much care where &#150;&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Then it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which way you go.&#148; 

If you care about forums, The World Assembly, actually interacting with others, this might not be the place for you. Or perhaps it is.
If you don&amp;#39;t really care about that kind of stuff, and just need a place to put your nation(s), then this is the place to put them. Or maybe not.
Forums are nonexistent at worst, irrelevant at best. Unless they aren&amp;#39;t.
Of course you can come and go as you please.
