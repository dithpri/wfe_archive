A military alliance and officially an invader region, but our military is actually independent from the R/D game. Our alliance is named the Global Alliance to keep with the two traditions of bad alliance names and two-letter alliances. The main purpose of this alliance is to promote unity and stability, but also to help resolve conflicts and ease tension, and to promote global peace and wealth.

We are recruiter friendly, but limit yourself to one post in 24 hours.

We only invade fascist, nazist, reactionary, and far-right regions, and only do so occasionally.
