[b]Welcome to Tweed Heads![/b]

Tweed Heads is a city in New South Wales. It is located on the Tweed River in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia, in Tweed Shire. Tweed Heads is located next to the border with Queensland, adjacent to its &quot;Twin Town&quot; of Coolangatta, which is a suburb of the Gold Coast. It is often referred to as a town where people can change time zones &#150; even celebrate New Year twice within an hour &#150; simply by crossing the street, due to its proximity to the Queensland border, and the fact that New South Wales observes daylight saving whereas Queensland does not.
