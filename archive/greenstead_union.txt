Hello and welcome to the Greenstead Union region. I am Ben on Discord and hope you will enjoy this region and Nationstates. Tell other Greenstead Union&#39;ers and this region will prosper.

Introduce yourself and join the WA if you like. Endorse all other members of the WA in the region, if its not too much trouble.

These words were spoken by our late founder, Ben, who perished shortly after founding our wonderful region in an accident involving matches and a lot of baked beans.

Federal Of Greenstead, Founding nation of Greenstead Union. I&#39;d like to personally welcome you to Greenstead Union. Please make yourselves at home!
