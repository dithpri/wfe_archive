LIBERATED by a coalition of African Nations!  No longer will we allow the colonization, subjugation,  brutality and enslavement of the people of the African continent by foreign powers.   This once peaceful African region has been ravaged by fascist colonialist forces from Europe.  But now the forces of colonialism have either fled back to their European homes, or lie dead on the battlefields of Africa!  Never again shall your occupation of our continent go unchallenged.  AFRICA RISE!
