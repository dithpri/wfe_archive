We are a colony of mimes, following a grizzly civil war leaving seven survivors.  After the civil war, our disputes fizzled, just as our men&amp;#39;s bodies did in the Sun, and from then on our rage turned to camaraderie. Now, our seven nations have become one (with inflection). What may have initially seemed a curse, was actually a moment of greatness as the most deadly mime task force was created. Using cunning and deadly arts, they swept across the region raping and pillaging, thus repopulating the barren region. The enormous influx of retarded horses and AUSTINS into the region have created a booming fur and scalp industry which continues to fuel the progressive nature of this region.
