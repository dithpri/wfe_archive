The first people were Chinese imegrants who created Hongululu. 4000 years later Greek, Italian and Turkish imegrants colonised the coast of the Rangborial region and created a country now known as Halarci. Multiple tribes and kingdoms were starting to form all over the Rangborial region and sometimes got into war or traded. 300 years later the two countrys now as Halarci and Hongululu were formed. The Halarcians were also the people who first found Hongululu but did not tell anyone about it till two years ago.
