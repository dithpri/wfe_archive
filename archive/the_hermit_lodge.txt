[hr]
[color=Green]The Hermit Lodge is for those Nations who do not wish to be disturbed. It is a safe haven for those nations who have been betrayed or need a time of peace and quite after strenuous political debates or failing to be elected into a place of power. Using the regional chat board is not prohibited but is frowned upon.[/color]
