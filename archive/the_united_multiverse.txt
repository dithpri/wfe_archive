Welcome to The United Multiverse. While we may be different nations ourselves, we believe that it is important to unite the world together and cooperate within the World Assembly, while allowing nations to govern themselves outside of the laws set by the World Assembly. We will cooperate and construct embassies with all regions committed to our principles. We have positions in Regional Governance available to all.

[i]Our RMB is open to all residents of embassy regions[/i]

[b]Ground Rules[/b]

We expect that all embassy regions &amp; member nations will have names that are respectful of all people (including IRL). For example, [region]Gypsy Lands[/region] is a bad name
