Welcome to [region]The United Multiverse[/region]. This region is an experiment in an anarchy. There is no government, no control over who becomes the World Assembly, and to the maximum extent possible, no rules.

[b]The one exception is that this region is not to be used in any way that would be advantageous to raiders.[/b]

[i]Our RMB is open to all residents of embassy regions, we will accept all embassies within reason[/i]

[i]This region is maintained by two puppets of [nation]Flying Eagles[/nation], a proud member of [region]10000 Islands[/region].[/i]
