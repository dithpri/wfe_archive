Welcome to [region]The United Multiverse[/region]. This region is an experiment in an anarchy. There is no government, and no control over who becomes the World Assembly. The only rules I as founder will enforce are common sense ones that exist across the whole internet, such as no racism. Have fun!

Within reason, we will accept all embassies. Our Regional Message Board is open to all residents of embassy regions.

[nation]The United Universe[/nation] and [nation]Confused No Name[/nation] are both puppets of [nation]Flying Eagles[/nation].
