Plie is a great place and really we dont give a stuff if your part of the region or not however regional roles are available.  World Assembly members are not welcome.  Non inference in your nationstate means just that.

Pile has a successful track record in dealing with zombie uprisings when they happen.

The choice is yours if you want to be a member of this region but since we do not wish to influence you we set up a region. Nations of Pile get a placeholder like one you see below.

Embassy requests will be looked at, it will not result in your region recruitment targets getting met so don&#39;t bother if this is your aim and we also take a dim view of nations who cancel our embassies, or regions that implode through boredom.
