Plie is a great place and really we dont give a stuff if your part of the region or not however regional roles are available.  World Assembly members are not welcome.  Non inference in your nationstate means just that.

The choice is yours if you want to be a member of this region but since we do not wish to influence you we set up a region. Nations of Pile get a placeholder like one you see below.

Embassy requests will be looked at, it will not result in your region recruitment targets getting met so don&#39;t bother if this is your aim and we also take a dim view of nations who cancel our embassies, or regions that implode through boredom.
