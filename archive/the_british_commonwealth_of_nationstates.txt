The British Commonwealth of NationStates has been created to give players the opportunity to experiment with the ludic possibilities of NationStates. The region will operate within the broad framework of British Constitutional Monarchism and will extol &amp;quot;British Values&amp;quot; (and in the process explore what this might mean).

Entry to the region requires a password, which can be requested by sending a telegram to the Commonwealth Secretariat care of the Procurator, currently, Lord Hollingworth of the Commonwealth of Blessed Isles. Entry is not automatically granted, but neither is it readily withheld.
