People have for ages upon ages seen it as a place of evil, of damnation. They are wrong...
This Hell is ruled over in a fair way, and it is as if a paradise for those who are sinful, but good - those attracted to the same gender, those who did not worship God, those who followed a different religion, and all those many others who fell short of the Creator&#39;s high standard, yet were not inherently evil. All those dwell this Netherworld freely.
An alliance has been made by this Hell, with other free realms, to together unite, and combat the Heavens themselves - to combat Yahweh, also known as God, the Creator. Join us now, and fight -or produce- for freedom!
