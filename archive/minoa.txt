[b][color=#199ed9]Welcome to Minoa.[/color][/b]
Re-established for its namesake 4 June 2015.

[color=#444][i]Minoa is an independent Greek-themed region dedicated to roleplay and factbooks. The region&#146;s name comes from the Minoans, which existed in the Bronze Age. The region is abundant with culture, sea life, technology, forests and birds (yes, everyone loves BIRDS).

In Minoa, anything in roleplay is possible: including giant seagulls and luxury hotel hostesses trying to run a country![/i][/color]
