[b]Kalosorisate stin Minoa:[/b] the Minoans have lived on into the modern age and now is a region of its own again...

Established 25 March 2025, Featured 5 September 2010, Minoa is a democratic region and it will always be free from invaders: even if all the Greek regions were to fall to the invaders, the founder of Minoa vows to defend you from those who try to suppress the Greek way of life. We also keep [region=Soviet Russia] from evil and corruption.

Ancient Minoa laid the foundations of [region=Greece] and as a modern region we must respect them all as if they were part of our family.
