[b][color=#009ddc]Kal&oacute;s&iacute;rthate sto Min&oacute;a![/color][/b] Minoa is an independent Greek-themed region that stands against racism and extremism, not to be confused with [nation=Minoa], whose nation name wasn&amp;#39;t released when we started this. The Minoans have been here since the 27th century BCE.

Remember, Ancient Minoa laid the foundations for [region=Greece] so we must respect them all as if they were part of our family. Sadly, the WFE doesn&amp;#39;t parse Greek. :(
