Bonjour, welcome to The French Isles

In 1688, Jaque Russo (Also known as Jaque the Wretched) Behead King Archibald the Third for executing his brother. He then decided to turn the monarchy of Ashkenapur into a near lawless republic. After 325 years it had solidified into a prosperous and varied region.

If you like french culture, pirates, or both, then you can come join, all that we ask is that :

1. you include the Fleur-de-lis in your flag

2. be cool

hope you enjoy your time in The French Isles
