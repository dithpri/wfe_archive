Spectrum is an inclusive region for all gender, sexual, and romantic minorities. We are also welcoming of allies. Wikipedia defines [i]spectrum[/i] as &amp;quot;a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary infinitely within a continuum.&amp;quot; That is what we hope this region will become!
