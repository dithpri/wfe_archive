This is the homeland of the Coronavirus and Coronavirus-based nations are encouraged to join. However, other species such as the Black Plague and Ebola are welcome as well (so are other joke nations). We would also be happy with anyone joining too. This region will be run as a democracy with a founder to protect from raiders. We&#39;re fairly new so we don&#39;t have much in the way of worldbuilding [i]yet[/i]. All you have to do in order to have a place in the region and (maybe) start roleplaying is to lodge a post on our board (other regions [i]are[/i] canonical in this region). We are also extremely small-nation friendly and hope that we will grow into a thriving community with rich lore and some influence. Until then, happy existing!
