[B]Earth, &quot;the pale blue dot,&quot; as described by the famous American astronomer, Carl Sagan, after viewing a photograph of Earth taken in 1989 by the [i]Voyager 1[/i] spacecraft as it left our Solar System. &quot;Everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives, on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.&quot;

Shouldn&#39;t we do our best to care for that fragile little blue planet? 

Remember, only you can prevent forest fires![/B]
