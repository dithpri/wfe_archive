Once upon a time, a region existed, named the Illuminati Council. This region was full of corruption, puppets, and power-hungry idiots. A new region has been carved, out of the sloppy leftovers of the old Illuminati Council. That is the region whose Factbook Entry you are reading right now. In other words, it&#39;s this region, The New ILC.

In order to be a fully functioning member of this region, you must be a member of the World Assembly. World Assembly can vote, be legitimate party members/leaders, and hold office. However, regarding officeholders, I know that some of you may have your WA members in a separate region. Regular nations can run for office, but only if your WA nation comes and endorses you for said office position.
