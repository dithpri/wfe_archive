The EFU is pro-everything. There is no discrimination, and no hatred towards ANYONE, and if this rule is broken you will be removed.
The EFU strives to be a place of safe sanctuary, and a place of activity forever. We ask our members to do one thing: stay positive! 
This is a major Role-Playing region and everything done should not be take personally. Role-playing as your nation is highly encouraged, but always feel free to express yourself.
We thank you for joining the EFU group, and may your beliefs shine bright!
