[b]The year is 202x. Crime is legal, and shark attacks are widespread. Today, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] set out to take on the dusty desert in their Ford Model T to raid some poor innocent regions and fight sharks. They were able to find some chips and queso in a few regions and successfully stole some Rush CDs from a shark.
