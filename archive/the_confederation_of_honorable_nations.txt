Welcome to the Confederation of Honorable Nations, a loose coalition of nation who wish to pursue honor, politeness, and chivalry (with varying degrees of success. No one is perfect!)
Our Constitution was hastily put together, so it may have some holes. Also note that not much activity goes on here; it&#39;s mostly just nations going about their everyday business of addressing issues and growing their countries.

Here is a list of our member nations:

[nation]Hirishara[/nation] (founder)
[nation]Montinora[/nation]
[nation]Chessboardia[/nation]
