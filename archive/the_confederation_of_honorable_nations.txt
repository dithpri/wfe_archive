Welcome to the Confederation of Honorable Nations, a loose coalition of nation who wish to pursue honor, politeness, and chivalry (with varying degrees of success. No one is perfect!)
A multinational team of legislators and leaders are working on a Constitution by telegram to give some order to the political process, but until then we really don&#39;t have any political system in place. We only had three nations until yesterday (February 16), so we hadn&#39;t needed any official system yet. Now that we are big enough to warrant one, we will create one.

Here is a list of our member nations:

[nation]Hirishara[/nation] (founder)
[nation]Montinora[/nation]
[nation]Guy 176[/nation]
[nation]Ocean Breathes Salty[/nation] (temporary ambassador)
[nation]Light124[/nation]
[nation]Chessboardia[/nation]
