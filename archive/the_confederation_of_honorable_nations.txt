Welcome, good sir/madam, to the [color=red]Confederation of Honorable Nations[/color]!

This is a coalition for nations which hold dear the tenets of [color=blue]honor, politeness, and chivalry[/color]. We may never reach high influence in the Assembly, but if we do, we will try to sway its decisions in the name of honor. We will also seek to set up and maintain diplomatic relations with other honorable people no matter what their views.

All kinds of nations are welcome to join, from benevolent dictatorships to anarchies, but since we value honor, any political view which promotes something dishonorable (e.g. legalizing murder or allowing forced labor) is by definition against the values of this Confederation.
