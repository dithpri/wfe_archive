Welcome to the Confederation of Honorable Nations, a loose coalition of nation who wish to pursue honor, politeness, and chivalry (with varying degrees of success. No one is perfect!)
We are in a period of turmoil right now. A bunch of nations have just joined and have very different views on what this region should be. This is the first time we have been a big enough region to have to deal with this kind of thing. A multinational team of legislators and leaders are working on a hasty Constitution to give some order to the political process, but until then it might be best not to join.

Here is a list of our member nations:

[nation]Hirishara[/nation](founder)

[nation]Guy 176[/nation]
[nation]Change Is For The Better[/nation]
[nation]Ocean Breathes Salty[/nation]
