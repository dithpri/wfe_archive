[b]The Federal Republic of [nation]Communist Lukania[/nation] needed nations to mine resources it did not possess.[/b]

[i]It established puppet governments across the world, making them supply it with oil,uranium, and precious metals. Today, these nations became even more loyal, submitting to Lukania and forming a protectorate alliance. 

After their resources were depleted, Lukania was generous enough to give &quot;National Salvation&quot; programs, saving the people and making them tied to Lukania for all eternity.[/i]
