Welcome to the United Federal States.

In 2012, several states drafted and adopted &amp;quot;The Declaration of Immediate Causes which induce and justify the succession from the Federal Union&amp;quot; and formed the Coalition of Sovereign Territories. Since then, the UFS has been sending soldiers to the front lines to end this modern civil war.
