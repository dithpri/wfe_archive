Welcome to the United Federal States.

The United Federal States (UFS) was formed after multiple states adopted the &amp;quot;The Declaration of Immediate Causes which induce and justify the succession from the Federal Union&amp;quot; and formed the Coalition of Sovereign Territories (CoST) in 2012. For the past three years, the UFS have been attempting to suppress the rebellion and return the states back into the Union.
