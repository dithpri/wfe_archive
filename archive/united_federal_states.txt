Welcome to the United Federal States.

The United Federal States was formed after Texas, Alaska and Louisiana adopted the &amp;quot;The Declaration of Immediate Causes which induce and justify the succession from the Federal Union&amp;quot; and formed the Coalition of Sovereign Territories (CoST) in 2012. Since then, UFS forces have been attempting to regain control of the succeeded states and bring them back into the Union.
