An archipelago made up of relatively large islands relatively isolated from the rest of the world. The islands consist of people who value their independence and personal freedom. The nations that form the region live in apathy of each other and (usually) stay peaceful, focusing on keeping trade between them free and sorting out differences without large explosives and boom sticks.
