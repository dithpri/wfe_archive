In a distant galaxy, there exists a planet named Perpetuum, which has been trapped in a perpetual state of war for centuries. The inhabitants of Perpetuum, known as Perpetuates, have been utilizing a stagnated technology reminiscent of the early 20th century, specifically the era of World War I/II. The planet is divided into two major factions, the Alliance of the Eastern Front and the Coalition of the Western Commonwealth, each vying for dominance over Perpetuum and its depleting resources.
