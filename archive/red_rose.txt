Nothing like the beauty of a Red Rose.

&amp;quot;....and when you smile, red rose, it&amp;#39;s just like blue sunshine...&amp;quot;

[i]Some say there is a legend behind the Red Rose, a story from the days of the Crimson King of The Crimson Order in The North Pacific and elsewhere.  They say that the Crimson King would leave behind a single red rose wherever he traveled across the NSverse after the end of his Delegacy in TNP.  A gift of beauty for the game for which he risked his reputation to save it from stagnation and oblivion. ADMIN bless Red Rose and The Crimson King.[/i]
