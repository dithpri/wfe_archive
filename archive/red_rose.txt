Nothing like the beauty of a Red Rose.

&quot;....and when you smile, red rose, it&#39;s just like blue sunshine...&quot;

[i]Some say there is a legend behind the Red Rose, a story from the days of the Crimson King of The Crimson Order.  They say that the Crimson King would leave behind a single red rose wherever he traveled across the NSverse after the end of his Reign.  A gift of beauty for the game for which he risked himself. ADMIN bless Red Rose and The Crimson King.[/i]
