[color=darkred][b]UNITED COUNTRIES OF EARTH[/b][/color]

[color=blue] The United Countries of Earth is a roleplaying region. It will include all of Global Earth, so the entire planet is the playing field. WA membership is not required, but is highly recommended. Every nation will be given land of their choosing within the planet. Keep it land connected(besides islands) so do not have patches everywhere around the world. After land is claimed the leader of each nation will have a seat in the World Senate, of which every nation will have the right to recommend and vote for different legislation that must be followed by every nation within the region. The Senate will be overseen by the Founder and WA Delegate of which must remain neutral. [/color]
