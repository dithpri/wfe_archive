[b][color=Blue][u]The Original Conservadom[/u][/color]

There are frauds running around using variants of the name &amp;quot;Conservadom&amp;quot; and having the temerity to claim they are the real Conservadom. It&amp;#39;s laughable because, for example, &amp;quot;True Conservadom&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Cool Conservadom&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;New Conservadom&amp;quot; are NOT &amp;quot;[region]Conservadom[/region].&amp;quot; 

Do not fear, the one and true Conservadom will be remain in the hands of someone who truly cares about her, [nation=short]Newtered States[/nation].  I will safeguard her from those who hate her, and take my place as the best Conservadomer that there  ever was.

There is but one true Conservadom, and this is it![/b]
