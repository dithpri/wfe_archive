We are a region dedicated to the end-result of communism following the model set forth by Stalin. Since Comrade Stalin&amp;#39;s unfortunate death there have been countless lies spread about the great leader, beginning after Krushchev&amp;#39;s so-called &amp;quot;secret speech&amp;quot; at the 20th Party Congress of the Soviet Union and continuing on today. In the last several years thanks to the opening of the Russian archives, much evidence has shown to defend Comrade Stalin. We are dedicated to defending his name.
