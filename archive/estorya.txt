In the year 1946, [nation=short]Estorya[/nation], in the north-east corner of Androyica, implemented stupid economic policies, leading to a crash.  Various regions of the crumbling nations banded together to recover.  Some received help from foreign forces, while others attempted recovery on their own.  All of them fought for power over each other to take control of the once-unified land.

This war-torn chaotic wasteland is...
Estorya!
