Altimearians,

In the past there has been turmoil in this great region. This region is perhaps not great for its size but it is great for its heart. Altimear has always been, and always will be a nation of freedom and acceptance. I started this region to become closer with my friends on this game, to always know where they are, in an essence for ease of access.

Altimears favor will never change. We will always support friendship over any sort of government(or lack there of). That is the truth

Your friend and ever-loyal leader,
[nation]Banin[/nation] of Altimear
