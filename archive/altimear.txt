Dear Altimearians,

We must band together Altimearians. Our region needs a stronger WA delegate. I would ask that all nations check their regional telegrams so they can keep up with Altimear happenings. I need all nations in Altimear that can, to become a WA member and endorse [nation]The Arkam Asylum[/nation]. We need to be stronger and stand together.

Altimear maintains its policy of friendship over all. Altimear will always be a friendly nation without discrimination. Altimear needs everyone in our nation. For all of Altimear. Altimear! Altimear! Altimear!

Your Great Leader,
[nation]Banin[/nation]
