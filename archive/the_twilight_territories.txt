These are the Twilight Territories, a region in perpetual twilight. We are not quite in the light and not quite in the dark. We are not quite evil, but not necessarily good either. This region is all about balance. For an unknown reason, all that come never seem to leave. So welcome, welcome to the Twilight Territories!
