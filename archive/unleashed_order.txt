Unleashed Order is an agglomeration of nations following all forms of ideology. Nations here rarely dispute, but when they do, they may choose to settle their disputes diplomatically or with methodical use of bombs (whichever sounds the most appealing). The region adheres to a strict representative democracy, where everyone&#39;s voice is heard, and everyone is welcomed with open arms. Family and friends are encouraged to join, so have fun!
