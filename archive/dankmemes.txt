Also, [u]endorse the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=region_admin/region=dankmemes][b]delegate and all regional officers[/b][/url] upon entry.[/u]

Now, for a few quotes from someone near and dear to us:

Feb 13: &quot;If I don&#39;t stifle raiderdom to nothingness by the time I leave this website - Damn My Reputation!&quot;
Feb 20: &quot;Today [...] DankMemes&#39; Slendermen managed to raid two regions...&quot;
Mar 6: &quot;Raiding is a macaroni, and defending is the noodle. Put them together, and you get gameplay.&quot;
