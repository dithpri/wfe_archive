[b][color=maroon]The South Pacific Socialist Republic[/color][/b]

Welcome to the legitimate government of [region]The South Pacific[/region] formed in May 2013 by the glorious Chairman Milograd to liberate the minnows of the vile manipulations of the forum based oligarch, jaywalking airgangster bourgeoisie. For over a week the superior tactics of the Chairman held the capitalist pigs and their out of region mercenaries at bay until finally the forces of The People&amp;#39;s Liberation Army were overrun. We have been pushed back to here, where we wait. The time to strike is soon. The minnows will be free of their chains again soon!!!

HAIL THE MINNOW!
HAIL CHAIRMAN MILOGRAD!!!
HAIL THE SPSR!!
