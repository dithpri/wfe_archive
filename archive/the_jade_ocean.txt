The Jade Ocean, like it&#39;s name the waters here shine like jade in almost any light. The islands of Vastait are central here and are surrounded by other beautiful landscaped large and small, all previous claims on them by Vastait have been renounced to allow for new colonists. The tropical lands and waters are filled with exotic plants and animals. The sea borders are guarded by a vigilant fleet of ships and aircraft that go around in rotations, the borders of Vastait and it&#39;s partner nations are patrolled the same way.
