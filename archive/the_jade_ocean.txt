The Jade Ocean. As it&#39;s name implies, the waters shine like jade, whether this is from the right amount of light or the chemicals being flushed into them, we don&#39;t know. The area is filled with islands of varying shapes and sizes, each with it&#39;s own breathtaking landscapes and perfect for habitation. Currently The Jade Ocean is under high alert, and so military ships, helicopters and cars patrol the lands and seas around the border; shooting trespassers on sight. The nation of Vastait however, is open to accepting certain nations into the lands under certain circumstances and is always open for inquires.
