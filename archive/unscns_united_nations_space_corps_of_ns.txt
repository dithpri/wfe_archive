When I die, please bury me deep! Place an MA5 down by my feet! Don&amp;#39;t cry for me, don&amp;#39;t shed no tear! Just pack my box with PT gear! &amp;#39;Cuz one early morning &amp;#39;bout zero five! The ground will rumble, there&amp;#39;ll be lightning in the sky! Don&amp;#39;t you worry, don&amp;#39;t come undone! It&amp;#39;s just my ghost on a PT run!&#148;
