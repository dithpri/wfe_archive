     It takes a strong man to deny what&amp;#39;s right in front of him. And if the truth is undeniable, you create your own. The truth, Nation, is that you&amp;#39;re here because you wanted to feel like something you&amp;#39;re not: A hero. I&amp;#39;m here because you can&amp;#39;t accept what you&amp;#39;ve done. It broke you. You needed someone to blame, so you cast it on me. A dead country. I know the truth is hard to hear Nation, but it&amp;#39;s time. You&amp;#39;re all that&amp;#39;s left and we can&amp;#39;t live this lie forever. I&amp;#39;m going to count to five, then I&amp;#39;m pushing the button.
