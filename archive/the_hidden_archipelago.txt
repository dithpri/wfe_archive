The Hidden Archipelago is is vast array of islands, stretching lazily towards the far horizon.
The largest of the landmasses can play host to tens of individuals, while the smallest are mere beaches on which can be found one man, his fishing boat and a fridge full of Vimto.

The Hidden Archipelago is home to whichever nations choose the move their infrastructure to its pleasant shores, unregistered populations may include pirates, zombies, werewolves and ghosts, all of whom enjoy our millions of miles of coastline and temperate, tropical climate.
