The Republic of the Free Rohirrim, or more commonly Rohan, was founded by several Star League Defense Force units who had joined General Aleksandr Kerensky towards exile, but were separated from the Exodus by a freak misjump that tossed their ships far into the Deep Periphery. Because of their isolation, Rohan enjoyed three centuries without warfare, and the peace and resulting prosperity made Rohan a powerful nation, albeit one disinterested in expansion. However, Rohan&#146;s possession of working lostech and their ability to manufacture such has made them the object of greed among those who know of them, and thus Rohan&#146;s relatively small but powerful armed forces often see combat.
