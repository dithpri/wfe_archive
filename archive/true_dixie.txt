Pushed away for eternity.

Exile day [Semi Off and On]

To those in [region]Dixie[/region]


If the elections insist apon returning to regional &quot;Allies&quot; this will be where I return and to live out the rest of my life



I&#39;m not ready to come back.... Maybe never.
I have been reading your messages. 

I will keep Contact much as I Feel like. But I will not be forced to Come Back, nor to be Discussed with.
Especially with that vote idea.

As Much as I Believe &quot;They&quot; discussed should be rehabilitated... They shouldn&#39;t be ejected. Thats my answer.
