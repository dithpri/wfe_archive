A region where there are many a holy places, and many a wicked places. Whether you are spiritual or not, you will find a welcoming home here.
The monks who live up on Poppy Hill are masters of peace and virtue. They constantly battle with an evil spirit to the west of the land; they try to subdue its tyranny day in and day out. 
They tell of a fortune. One where a boy is born, possessing a will of fire. Said to become a monk and to one day awaken that flame from within him. He will defeat the westward spirit and bring balance to the land.
But myths and legends are just that, myths and legends. We will all just have to wait. Wait and hope.
