Gondolin was a hidden city of the Elves located approximately in the middle of the land of Beleriand in Middle-earth. It was founded by Turgon the Wise, a &Ntilde;oldorin king in the early First Age. It endured the longest of all the &Ntilde;oldorin kingdoms in exile, lasting nearly four centuries during the Years of the Sun.
