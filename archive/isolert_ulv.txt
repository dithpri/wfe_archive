The region of Isolert Ulv is a massive region located just south of Penger-Drevet Avskum, full of island communities with several larger nations dominating the bigger landmasses (the largest supporting 2.924 billion registered citizens). The larger country&amp;#39;s often abuse the smaller island communities, using them for nuclear testing and training exercises. Every once in awhile, a group of these communities will group together and form a larger country, becoming a capable competitor against the other abusive nations for the regions resources (or so they like to believe). This creates a varying degrees of conflict throughout the region, but as soon as anything to large scale begins to make itself clear, the militaristic superpowers step in.
