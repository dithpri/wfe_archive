The region of Isolert Ulv is a massive region located just south of Penger-Drevet Avskum, full of island communities with several larger nations dominating the bigger landmasses (the largest supporting 2.924 billion registered citizens). Recently nations have been taking sides between two alliances- [i]The Allies[/i], formed by [nation=noflag+short]Darion Industrys[/nation] in an attempt to invade [nation=noflag+short]Ifcult[/nation], but this failed as soon as he realized that IFcult were the only ones who would join him. Soon after Ifcult joining, [nation=noflag+short]Areska[/nation] joined for the protection promised, as it is the smallest of the superpowers. This was a perceived threat to [nation=noflag+short]Ulfrzka[/nation]&amp;#39;s military dominance, who then formed a &amp;#39;defense&amp;#39; pact with [nation=noflag+short]Maztika[/nation] known as [i]The Pact[/i]
