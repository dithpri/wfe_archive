The region of Isolert Ulv is a massive region located just south of Penger-Drevet Avskum, full of island communities with several larger nations dominating the bigger landmasses (the largest supporting 2.924 billion registered citizens). In a recent turn of events, [nation=noflag+short]Ifcult[/nation] has changed sides and joined [i]The Pact[/i], leaving [nation=noflag+short]Darion Industrys[/nation] with [nation=noflag+short]Areska[/nation] and [nation=noflag+short]Tzixua[/nation]. Now that [nation=noflag+short]Darion Industrys[/nation] is severely outnumbered, [i]The Pact[/i] are attempting force a treaty upon it backed up by threats of military action and economic sanctions, in an attempt to secure regional peace and stop a sort of &amp;#39;Cold War&amp;#39; of which recently occurred happening again.
