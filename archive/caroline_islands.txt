The [b]Caroline Islands[/b] ([b]Islas Carolinas[/b] in Spanish, [b]Karolinen[/b] in German, are a widely scattered archipelago of tiny islands in the western Pacific Ocean, to the north of New Guinea. Historically, this area was also called Nuevas Filipinas or New Philippines as they were part of the Spanish East Indies and governed from Manila in the Philippines.

The group consists of about 500 small coral islands, east of the Philippines, in the Pacific Ocean; the distance from Manila to Yap, one of the larger islands of the group, is 1,200 miles (1,900 km).

Most of the islands comprise low, flat coral atolls, but some rise high above sea level.
