Here lies the ruins of a place once known as North America.  This is district 12 one of the trusting districts of panem.  One that you can trust to starve you to death.  Anyways, the 13 districts (yes, once there was 13 districts) rebelled and the capitol destroyed district 13 and know forces each district to send a male and a female tribute to fight to the death in an outdoor arena.  The fighting to the death is televised live and every one from the districts are forced to watch it.  One lone victor servives and serves as a reminder of the rebellion and that the capitol cando what ever they want to the districts including destroying them.
