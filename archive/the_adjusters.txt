[B]Welcome to [color=#000080]The Adjusters[/color][/B]
Because the world needs someone to nudge it in the right direction, or perhaps throw it off track on purpose. We plan to fill these shoes for NationStates, whether it&amp;#39;s by infiltrating a regional government, giving raiders more credit than due, or causing mass hysteria in a region and wait for it to implode, we will do it all. Oh, we also do a bit of roleplaying.
