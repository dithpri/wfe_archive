The United Nations of Hamzgovina is a group of nations that formed together after a nuclear holocaust in 2248 left the world misshapen and crumbling. After the fallout, groups of people created their own nations. They all came together to form the Act of New Charleston. The act was made to rebuild the Earth, or what was left of it. The only four nations that have signed are [nation]North Congoria[/nation], [nation]Quakeria[/nation], [nation]New Hamzgovina[/nation] and finally [nation]Hamzgovina[/nation]. There are soon to be many more.
