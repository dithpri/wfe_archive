[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to Wolfmania![/color][/b]

[color=blue][b]Wolfmania is a region created to keep nations from any harm. We offer Role Playing Tips, Practices, and Teachings. I listen to my people when they explain about creations of Military, discussion about the forums, or how they made their sandwiches. WA Delegate is needed. 

I expect you to treat everybody equal, and be on you&amp;#39;re best behavior. Enjoy you&amp;#39;re stay.[/color][/b]
