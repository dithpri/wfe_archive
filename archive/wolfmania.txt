[Color=Skyblue][b]Wolfmania is a delicate, noble region that is highly pacifist and is full of Democracy. But I am a young nation, you see, looking for a way to become large. If we all come together, we can create a world that we wish to live in. I only want, one day, to hope that Wolfmania will succeed of being big and helpful to other regions. And yes, everyone is welcomed.[/color][/b]
