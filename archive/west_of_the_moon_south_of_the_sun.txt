[color=blue]The ultimate region for hardcore chillin&amp;#39;.[/color]

[b]Feel free to share your Nation&amp;#39;s National Anthem, or National Playlist on our messageboard of &amp;#39;sick tunes bra&amp;#39;. Of course, you&amp;#39;ll have to join our region first, so make sure to do that first.[/b]

Our region is renowned worldwide for its multiculturalism and its openess to other ideas, fashion senses and species. Thus far, we are home to millions of music geeks, LOTR loverboys, and Monty Python &amp;quot;holier than thou&amp;quot; unfriendlies. Look out; they will kick you if you walk too close to them.
