This Region is a Role Play region of some NS veterans, and also newer players, that want to expand RP opportunities, both within and outside the region. Yes, we are [i]NOT[/i] a closed canon RP region. We believe we share a world with many other great RP regions and encourage crossover canon RP.


We have plenty of space for more members, new, or not so new to NS. TG the Founder about RP opportunities and links between regions or about getting on our Discord chat. See the below link for applying to the region, listed after the maps.
