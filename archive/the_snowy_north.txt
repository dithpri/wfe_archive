Far beyond the point where most ships are willing to sail,
beyond a shroud of fog, snow, and hail,
there lies a land that defies belief
a place of ice and snow that knows no relief. 

The Snowy North is a frozen region of ice and snow, whose people are hardy and whose governments are hardier. Feel free to come and join us.
