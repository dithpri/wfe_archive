Ho, ho, ho! From St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day to Halloween, the Holiday-themed nations of NS need a region to call home. This is a mostly democratic region (I still hold Executive power), and it is mostly for holiday-themed nations. All political ideals are welcomed, and debate is welcome. Happy Holidays!
