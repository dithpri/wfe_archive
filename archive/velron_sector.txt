The Velron Sector is a region under the proprietor of [i]moi[/i], the Ben Boys, otherwise known as the Benevolent Dictator, Rule for Eternity, Benny, and (if the situation calls for it) &amp;quot;that dumbass&amp;quot;.

I myself am available for roleplaying if my personal schedule allows it, as are most of the people here: this is, after all, a region dedicated to a collection of RPers (whom are rather close, if small, at this time). Keep in mind that the dominant tech is Future Tech (FT), though don&amp;#39;t let that discourage you from offers.

From the greatest Ivory Tower Reality Disconnect Zone,
The Ben Boys
