The Region of The Little Dragons was entered the world of NationStates in 2011. The Region is made up by a series of Kingdoms that take pride in their own individual heritages of strength. The dominant Kingdom in TLD is Drakonei who were the original peoples who settled in this land. The kings of Drakonei lent land to valuable allies who they were indebted to. These regions maintain their own individuality but are still bound by the loose confederation of TLD. We stand by our Lord, the Immortal Ego, as our everlasting cum flows to that nerd and protect the Princess Cosmo at all times; this is the TLD Oath.
