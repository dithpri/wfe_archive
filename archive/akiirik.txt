Akiirik is a growing region of Vengeful nations, who understand that it is wrong to take a region from its owners. It was built from the ashes of Daliir, a noble and peaceful region that was taken from its leader. Since this fateful fall, 
Akiirik has gained multiple allies, been deceived, and, at one point, was attacked by the same monsters that had stolen the home of multiple nations.

*Please note that although our goal is in fact to destroy the Black Riders, we hold no malice toward the nations who live within. They are doing their jobs, as we are ours.
