The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization whose purpose is to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations.It is the world&#39;s largest and most familiar international organization.

The World Assembly is the world&#39;s governing body. It&#39;s your chance to mold the world to your vision, by voting for resolutions you like and scuttling the rest. However, it&#39;s a double-edged sword, because your nation will be affected by any resolutions that pass. Unfortunately you can&#39;t obey the resolutions you like and ignore the rest. In other words, it&#39;s a hot-bed of political intrigue and double-dealing.
