We are a region based on the values of nationalism, corporatism, Christianity, conservatism, and tradition. Our ideology and beliefs are modeled of off the Iron Guard, a fascist political organization active during pre wwII Romania. However all kinds of fascists are welcome and even non fascists who are christian or conservative are accepted.
