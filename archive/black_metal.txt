Re-established and absorbed into the chthonian realms of the Satanic Cathedral. Under the sinister glorious embrace of the Pentegram Flag. 


Deep within the withered souls of night,
Comes winds of past winters darkest heights,
Amid the baron misty forest along frozen pines,
Emerges black flame like some sacred relic in time.
Messages from akasha flow as if some wintry powder,
Realizing it was sent by the demons from our lord unholy father.
