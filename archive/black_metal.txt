Recaptured and pugnacious invaders expelled in anguished blood-curdling screams to the infernal depths of Tartarus. The Baphometic pentagram flag ascends once more.

Long live the valiant demonic regiments of the Satanic Cathedral. Long live the indefatigable forces of darkness!
Ave Satanas! Hail Satan!
