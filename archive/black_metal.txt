Mightiest am I, 
but I am not alone in this cosmos of mine. 
For the black hills consists of black souls, 
souls that already dies one thousand deaths. 
Behind the stone walls (of centuries) 
they breed their black art. 
Boiling their spells in cauldrons of black gold. 

 Far up in the mountains, 
where the rain fall not far, 
yet the Sun cannot reach. 
The wizards, my servants.
