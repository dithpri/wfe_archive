This is the hub for Mortal Kombat NS roleplay and a casual hangout.

This universe picks from all eras and games so nothing is off the table as long as it roughly sticks to the themes of Mortal Kombat. Of course there is always room to expand and creativity is always encouraged.

The six major realms provide for a variety of intrigue and maneuvers. The technologically advanced Earthrealm, the daemonic overcast of the Netherrealm, the mutations of Chaos Realm, The dark age sorcery of Outworld, the iron grip of Order Realm and the heavenly cascading waterfalls of Edenia - all are reachable through the realm that is not a realm, the nowhere place in between, the astral web... The Nexus!
