The Nexus, a region for those who have excellent experience in technology and mechanics. This region exists canonically in post WWIII and post Civil War II where the United States collapsed and emerged into factions. We prefer those with a strong economy and great arsenal. After all, we are called The Nexus. We don&#39;t particularly care if a nation is heroic or villainous, this region is about balance, so we want those who have middle ground. Endorse whoever the hell you want, raid a region, do whatever. Just remember this inspiring quote: &quot;You can&#39;t sue us.&quot; Touching, ain&#39;t it? Join The Nexus today!
