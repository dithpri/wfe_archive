The Union of Socialist Republics (USR) is founded on freedom, unity, and abolition of oppressive and backwards regimes. We push liberalism and progress, rather than implement conservatism. Thus we use revisionary methods of improving our nations being. We are a league of socialists, communists, anarchists, and liberals, however socialism is our main goal. We would very much enjoy it if any left-leaning regimes join our cause in a fight for freedom and prosperity for the people.
