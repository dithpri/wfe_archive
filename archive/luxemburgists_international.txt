[b][color=black]This region was refounded at 10:00 BST on 7th April 2012, because it stopped existing. If it had been left, it would have been claimed by fascists. As it is, it is kept in a sort of suspended animation by us ([u][region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region][/u]) at the moment. It&amp;#39;s not a conquest or a liberation, just protection.

Any members of the original region, please telegram [u][nation]The Fascist-Free Lands[/nation][/u] and we&amp;#39;ll sort something out.[/color]
