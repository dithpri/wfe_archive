Cappadocia, a semi-arid region in central Turkey, is known for its distinctive &#147;fairy chimneys,&#148; tall, cone-shaped rock formations clustered in Monks Valley, G&ouml;reme and elsewhere. Other notables sites include Bronze Age homes carved into valley walls by troglodytes (cave dwellers) and later used as refuges by early Christians.
