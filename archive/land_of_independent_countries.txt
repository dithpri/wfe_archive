The Land of Independent Nations is a Past Tech role-playing region. Feel free to join in on current role-plays between nations, or make your own. 

While nations of any size, religion, or ideology are accepted, you should definitely be past-tech. As long as it&amp;#39;s swords and bows and not rockets and rifles, you should be fine.
