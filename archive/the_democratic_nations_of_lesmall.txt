Enjoy a region of democratic choice where every nation has the opportunity of representation in governing. The region holds democracy as the most important way to protect civil and political liberties. Oppressive regimes are not welcome but any nation willing to take part on the continuous democratic experiment is welcome to apply. The only requirement is to contact the current Consul so that they can approve your entry and give you the password. Once accepted, you are accepted as equal among our open arms!
