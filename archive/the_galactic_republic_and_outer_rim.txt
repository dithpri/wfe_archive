The Galactic Republic, also known as the Grand Republic or simply as the Republic, was a democratic federal union spread across light-years of space. Old Republic and first Galactic Republic were terms affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, with the Old Republic also referring to the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY.
