This region proved a match for the pitiful and woefully inadequate charge by [region=The Black Riders]!

Walking backwards upside down, these silly nations got lost and ejected after failing to take the region:
[nation]General Halcones[/Nation]
[nation]WraithFIN[/nation]
[nation]Coraxion[/nation]

Next time maybe they will see it is stupid to invade regions with a founder.

In the mean time, have fun roleplaying in Ecco. The portal has been active for a while, although no one has discovered it in either NoNaF or Ecco yet.
