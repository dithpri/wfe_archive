Motto: A ripple sends Waves
Rules:
-One nation per person unless a telegram is recieved. More info later on this
-Before You play, you must claim a territory on the map. Please telegram me or Khazdurmodan if you want further explanation about territory
       -Also you are free to claim ANY territory in the map (including those already claimed). If the land is occupied, you must have a war.
-The world is set, Territory is not, feel free to fight for land, but no new discoveries.
-Keep counter play in mind. Remember your actions determine whats fun and what is not for everyone.
-The Center Island (Ecco) is free for all, where there is a portal to NNF (it is not active yet.)
