The Gang of Four was a group of Chinese politicians fiercely loyal to Chairman Mao and his ideals after his death, and vehemently opposed the reforms proposed by figures such as Deng Xiaoping or Chen Yun. Headed by Mao&#146;s widow, Jiang Qing, the group sought to preserve the Cultural Revolution and socialist economics. When Deng came to power, they were all trialled and sentenced to prison, where two out of four died. The other two died free.
