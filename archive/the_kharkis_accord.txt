An alliance between the Union of the Wungus and it&#39;s new trade partners in order to promote greater economic and military collaboration and to assist developing nations with great potential. The Accord was proposed by the Wungusinian foreign minister Joakhem Harpzier to the Botter cabinet after breakdowns between the Wungus and it&#39;s previous trade alliance - SWAG - over the issue of apartheid and the Wungus overbearing on various nations&#39; borders.
