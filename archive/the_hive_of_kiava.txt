The Hive of Kiava is a collection of nations of all different political, economic, social, and cultural values, covering an incredibly diverse number of ecosystems from cold, isolated mountain towns to warm, breezy island beaches. The Hive of Kiava stands united despite our many differences by eternal bonds of friendship and goodwill.
