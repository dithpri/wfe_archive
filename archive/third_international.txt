The communist international - also known as comintern - is a political organisation that fights for the freedom of workers of all nations. Comintern is led by a small executive committee of heads of state. Member states of the communist international must follow socialist policies, must be dedicated to the end of world capitalism, and must participate in comintern&#39;s activities.
