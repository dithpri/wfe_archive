This region represents the Southeast, as in the Southeastern United States. This region is ideal for all nations whose names refer to current or historical geographic entities of the southeast corner of North America. While the region is contiguous with the territory of the defunct Confederate States, no political ideology is endorsed or implied; all are welcome.
