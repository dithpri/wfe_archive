Fun fact: Over 35% of all data transferred across the Internet is porn. Probably not accurate. But whatever BBC World News tells me must be true. Some reports place it at 4%. Considering 91% of the data ever created by humanity has been made in the last 2 years, I assume its [i]probably[/i] hard to track that kind of stuff outside of very small samples.
