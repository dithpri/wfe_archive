Not so much as an empire as a collection of loosely bound states under an emperor who is elected.

Elections for the most glorious [b]Emperor[/b] are held weekly.

Electors represent the nations allowed to vote for the next Emperor. The Emperor is always an elector. A maximum of seven electors may be put into place.
To become an elector you must be sponsored by an existing elector and voted in or be given the status by the Sovereign Emperor himself.

In the event of a tie, the current Emperor remains until a majority vote.
