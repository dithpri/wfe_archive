ACWFN Is a loose organization of nations who band together mostly to make bad puns. Founded by Nearly Finland (Which bears the Canadian Flag), and based in Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavat. Anyone who reckons their nation to be funny may join, however, you may be ousted if your standard of living is, well, crap. You can do whatever the hail you want while in this region. Nearly Finland doesn&amp;#39;t like you doing bad stuff, but we let you get away with it unless the World Assembly gets on our backs about it. Unless it involves nuking people. Have fun.
