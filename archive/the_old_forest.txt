The Old Forest is a type of woodland nowadays described as a temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The west and south of the forest are dominated by &amp;quot;oaks and ashes and other strange trees&amp;quot;, which were generally replaced by pines and firs in the north. Beeches and alders are found here and there in the forest, and willows are dominant along the river.
