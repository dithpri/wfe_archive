The region of Nafyria was founded and is controlled by the Nation of Tyrolk. This region is ruled with an iron fist and pure tyranny, the nations in this must conform to the political beliefs of Tyrolk or they face invasion or even nuclear obliteration. Anyone who gets in the way of these beliefs or goals will face potential invasion, slaughter, and even a complete take over and transformation.
