Welcome to the region of Magnesaundris, a corner of the globe where conflict flourishes and the brutalities of war are displayed in their most hideous form. From the highest mountains to the most trackless deserts, no place nor person is safe from the vile consequences flaring from the flames of human disagreement.

Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum.

This is a historical and modern roleplay region I created for myself, my universe, and my nations. You are more than welcome to talk to me through telegrams and consider joining, but it might not appeal fully to your interests. 

I don&#39;t plan to do any form of gameplay with this region. That means no raiding or any of the sorts.
