[colour=blue][b][i]The Jervis Bay Territory is a territory of the Commonwealth of Australia. It was surrendered by the state of New South Wales to the Commonwealth Government in 1915 so that the Australian Capital Territory would have access to the sea.  It became a separate independent territory in 1989. The Jervis Bay also has some of the whitest sand on Earth.[/i][/b][/colour]
