The NationStates Leftist Alternative (NSLA) is a project that seeks to combat the perversion and distortion of leftist goals and beliefs.

Discussion is encouraged, as long as it is in good faith and follows the sitewide rules.

Nations of any belief, ideology, or political position are welcomed, and we encourage diversity of opinions.

Among leftist members, left unity is held in high regard here. While we may disagree on certain positions, the fight against capital should override sectarian infighting. However, debating leftist positions is promoted, and unity does not override your right to your position.

This WFE will be updated whenever possible.
