&#147;We must recognize that we can&#146;t solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power&#133; this means a revolution of values and other things. We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism are all tied together&#133; the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.&#148;
