We respect a diversity of tactics, so long as they attack the enemy and advance our common cause. We will defend everyone&#39;s right to fight the best way they know how.

[Capitalism] as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evils. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.
