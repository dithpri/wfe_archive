A perpetually wind-swept region of grassy hills and white cliffs overlooking a cold blue sea. Formally established in 2018 by the Kingdom of Bautizar as a place to kick up one&#39;s heels and relax at the kitchen window with a mug of tea while you watch those ships battling their way out of the harbor. The borders are currently closed due to the onset of Z-Day 2018.
