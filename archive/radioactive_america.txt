The year is 2200. One century ago, America was at peace. But everything changed when the bombs fell. 

In a matter of minutes, in a spiteful nuclear exchange over since-forgotten political contests, America&#39;s major cities were - from its teeming cosmopolitan metropolises to its rustic rural capitals - obliterated. 

But mankind finds a way to carry on. So it will. With robots and miniaturized nuclear reactors scavenged from the corpses of burnt out power armor.

This region is loosely based off the [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki]Fallout franchise[/url], but diverges after the [url=https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Great_War]falling of the bombs[/url]. We encourage original faction ideas, though it&#39;s obviously fine to take inspiration from the games / other media.
