This is a region founded for nations who&#39;s dominant religions consist of multiple deities, belief structures, and traditions. Founded on Germanic Pagan beliefs, but all original religions that came before the founding of Christianity are encouraged to join. The region is still but a fledgling thing, so the regional factbook isn&#39;t complete yet. I, the founder of this region, president of Aglesh, Hampus Gunnarsson will be working to solidify the region and hope to create a sort of haven for those with pagan religious beliefs. The RMB is always open and if anyone wants to discuss regional matters or roleplay, its there for that. All speech is speech, and its all perfectly fine here as long as it doesnt violate Nationstates rules.
