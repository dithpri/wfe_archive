The LAAT is a region formed from a small group of nations who live separately yet cooperatively at the bottom of the ocean, in the very center of the Bermuda Triangle. There, the diverse cultures blossom under the representation of their co-leaders. These nations originally came from all over, secretly immigrating to seek peace and protection from the outside world. The LAAT founders were the first UUs from New England and hippies from Northern France, who in the name of peace, liberality, and cookies, colonized LAAT in the 1800s. Most of the population came to LAAT looking for the same liberal viewpoints, but recent events and the risk of being found have led to a small, dedicated group of conservatives.
