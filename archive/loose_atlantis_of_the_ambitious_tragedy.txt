A free region, LAAT is the home for socially progressive nations with education, peace, the environment, free speech, economic assistance and social rights among their priorities. The region hopes to become a powerful and intelligent member of the NationStates world, and picks the nations it admits very selectively. Because of this exclusiveness, all nations within LAAT enjoy many special privileges of being part of a tight knit community of excellent nations destined for greatness. Please be at least fairly courteous to your fellow nations.
