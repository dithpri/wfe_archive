[b]Beta Timeline[/b]

Greetings leaders of Atterrium and leaders following the region, I am pleased to announce that we are approaching our beta launch of the region.

Our First Continent:
[i]Havryn, consisting of two landmasses and numerous islands of different sizes, has been completed. Our simplified biome map and blank map awaiting nations are complete.[/i]
Our OOC Discord:
[i]The OOC Discord is set to be launched next Wednesday (17th), but will remain closed until we launch the beta.[/i]
Our Forum Threads:
[i]Our application thread will not be posted until the beta launches, however we have gotten our draft to the point we feel is acceptable. [/i]

I look forwards to launching the region this month.
