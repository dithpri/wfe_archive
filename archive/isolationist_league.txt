The Isolationist League is a region of isolationists who want to keep to themselves, who want a quiet region to park their nation so that they can run their nations in peace without being bugged by others. The motto of this region is [i]&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll leave you alone if you leave us alone&amp;quot;[/i]

The two main requirements to join are:

1: The desire to keep to yourself and be left alone
2: If you&amp;#39;re a member of the World Assembly, kindly endorse Saint Neutralia so that it remains the regional delegate. (only required if you&amp;#39;re in the WA).

Any nation interested in joining can contact Saint Neutralia to request the region password.

This region is willing to establish embassies with other regions if they respect our isolationism and leave us to ourselves afterwards.
