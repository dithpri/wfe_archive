The Isolationist League is a region of isolationists who want to keep to themselves, who want a quiet region to park their nation so that they can run their nations in peace without being bugged by others. The motto of this region is [i]&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll leave you alone if you leave us alone&amp;quot;[/i]


This region is willing to establish embassies with other regions if they respect our isolationism and leave us to ourselves afterwards.
