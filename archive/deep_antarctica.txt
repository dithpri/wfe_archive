In Deep Antarctica, many isolated, environmentally-unfriendly nations hide away from the so called &quot;Tyrants&quot; of the North.

The Deep Antarctica Congress is made up of the leaders of all nations within the region. The World Assembly was cut off from the Deep Antarctica Congress after a major conflict severed the only remaining Embassy in the founding nation, Aleph Zero. Ancient city ruins can be found across the ice sheets of Deep Antarctica, due to the previous war in the region.
