The Astvelian Region is a region located in the North Hemisphere with a rather cold climate. Long, beautiful winters are characteristic of this area. Nonetheless, summer months are also quite warm and give yet another breath-taking view of the Astvelian lands.

Currently, the Repulic Of Abistinia is working to make Astvelia a modern, well-organised region that can be able to hold a number of regional activities. Law and Order are, therefore, in the hands of the Abistinian government.

Countries that want to be part of a highly developed region can join. You are welcomed to make Astvelia a great region.
