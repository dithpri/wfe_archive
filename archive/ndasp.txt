Nazi Party fools 


The party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of World War I. In the early months of 1918, a party called the Freier Ausschuss f&uuml;r einen deutschen Arbeiterfrieden (&amp;quot;Free Committee for a German Workers&amp;#39; Peace&amp;quot;) was created in Bremen, Germany. On 7 March 1918, Anton Drexler, an avid German nationalist, formed a branch of this league in Munich called the Committee of Independent Workmen.[24] Drexler was a local locksmith in Munich who had been a member of the militarist Fatherland Party[25] during World War I, and was bitterly opposed to the armistice of November 1918 and to the revolutionary upheavals that followed in its wake.
