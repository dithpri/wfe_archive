Wolf&#39;s Lair (German: [b]Wolfsschanze[/b]) was Adolf Hitler&#39;s first Eastern Front military headquarters in World War II. The complex, which would become one of several F&uuml;hrerhauptquartiere (F&uuml;hrer Headquarters) located in various parts of occupied Europe, was built for the start of Operation Barbarossa in 1941. 

The top secret, high security site was in the Masurian woods about 5 miles east of the small East Prussian town of Rastenburg (now K&amp;#281;trzyn, Poland). Three security zones surrounded the central complex where the F&uuml;hrer&#39;s bunker was located. Despite the security, the most notable assassination attempt against Hitler was made at the Wolf&#39;s Lair on 20 July 1944.
