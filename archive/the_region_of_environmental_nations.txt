Important reigonal news

Regional constitute voting

I decide to delete all tags of the region, and make a regional constitute by ideas from all member nations.
Democracy is promised, and to grant that, I am starting to get ideas.
It&amp;#39;s the chance for your nation to change the region yourself, and let the world see this region is democratic.
The regional constitute is important and changes the regional governing. 
It&amp;#39;s open to post ideas, and I&amp;#39;m waiting!
