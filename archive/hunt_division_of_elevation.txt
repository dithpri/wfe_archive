It is my distinct honor to welcome all new members to the Hunt Division of Elevation. Here, at HDoE, we are inclusive to all, respect and honor civil rights, political rights, and human rights. We are also tremendously dedicated to ensuring that all individuals are heard and have a say in our processes and policies. &#147;We rise up!&#148;
