The island of Heilige Huhen(referred to as a &#39;continent&#39; by the Drayonian state) is approximately 37,423  miles(60226 kilometers) in total surface area. It is located in the lower left section of the Pacific ocean, and was first claimed and colonized by the Confederation of the Rhine during the early 1800s. Today the large island is home to few ethnicities, mainly of Germanic origin. The island is mainly made up of hills and grassland, which&#39;ve been sparsely populated by semi-rural militarized towns.
