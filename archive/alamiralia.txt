Though now defunct and survived by its successor state, [region]The United Multiversal Confederation[/region], this region is still kept active as a part of the Alamiralian Civil War Memorial Project-- an effort started on the first anniversary of the war that resulted in this region&amp;#39;s permanent independence from unwanted outside influence. Again, it is requested you move your nation to the UMC, however you may visit the region with permission from Multiversal Border Authority.
