Once a proud region of many a nation, Alamiralia stood as a region united against all odds during bloodshed and a bulwark against foreign oppression. Now, this region stands as a monument to what once was, an echo of the past carried on by its survivors. 

This monument is maintained by the surviving members of the original region in [region]the United Multiversal Confederation[/region]-- the legal continuation of the original postwar Alamiralian government.
