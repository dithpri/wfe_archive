Founded by Divine Empress Dalia Saphirra of Her Apostles in the summer of 2018, the direct goal of the union is to collect bibically-influenced countries into a group. The board has frequent conferences discussing pressing issues that affect traditionalist realms, heavily advocates for in-division trading, as well as offers support to those looking to change their values to represent holiness.
