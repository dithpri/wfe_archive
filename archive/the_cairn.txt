The North: A land or broken and disastrous operations. Day to day is pure survival unless you make it to a Nation Controlled Area (NCA). Very harsh climates. Mostly taiga, Ceres Soveign separates the Cairn from the Wasteland. Nations in the North: The borderlands of Ceres Soveign, the United States of Guten Good, and the Ender Zone.
The South: Cultural Diverse due to being the main hub of the region. Mostly flat grassland, to desperate scrublands that borders the North. Nations in South: The Emirate of Creole, the Freeland of Lust, Lord Dante, the USSR1,  and the Federation of Tenno.
A group has peacefully split off with approval from the Cairn, we welcome the NevorLands with open arms and its, leader the United States of America 1.
