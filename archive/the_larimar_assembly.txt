Founded by the Island of Larimar, this region is populated by both humans and the extraterrestrial beings that created the Order of Larimar millennia ago.
Many strange lights pass overhead at night, but these have been publicly authorised by the Larimartian Traffic Council, so don&#39;t worry.
The region is ruled by the almighty Larimartyr from his temple beneath the Turquoise Oasis at the heart of Larimar Island. Citizens are advised to make a monthly sacrifice of salt and vinegar crisps to the aforementioned strange lights.
