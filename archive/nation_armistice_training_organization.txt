A group of nations dedicated to each other&amp;#39;s survival. We are somewhat secretive, only communicating through secondary, puppet nations. Our goal is to keep ourselves distanced from the politics and war of the Pacific Lands, to develop our nations in harmony, and to assimilate other nations.
