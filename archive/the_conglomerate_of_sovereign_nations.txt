Welcome to the conglomerate!

We are a NS region that recently left another region, because of stupid bickering. We hope this will never happen to us. And we welcome you to be a member of our awesome region!

After the horrors of WWIII, the world shall now be rebuilt with new nations, to ensure peace... Hopefully.
