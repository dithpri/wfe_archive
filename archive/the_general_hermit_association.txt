This is not a true home for Hermits.  The [b] tyranny of Space Madaloria has ruined this once great nation[/b].  Instead, please consider[b] joining the mighty [region]Hermits Cove[/region][/b] where we have discovered the true ways of being a Hermit.

Residence of [b][i]The Order[/i][/b], as lead by [nation]Space Madaloria[/nation] has been destroyed by the almighty Hermit forces! 


[region]The General Hermit Association[/region] is closing down. We&#39;re looking for best candidates to fill [region]Hermits Cove[/region]&#39;s ranks. Glory awaits those who join [region]Hermits Cove[/region] while a boring death awaits those who join another heretic Hermit group.!
***
[b]The Order[/b] is in disarray here. [b]We are lax in our duties, we are confused, we spilled the beans on the flag again.[/b]
