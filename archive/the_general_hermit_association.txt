The 3rd Resurrection of the famous birthplace of the Hermit Race. Please enjoy the beans.

In the 2016th Year since our Lord, Hermit-God, touched His hand on the First Hermit (St. Paul the First Hermit), the Hermit-God has sent this order and hierarchy down to our lowly Earth yet highly esteemed region.
Our Government structure can be seen in the Dispatches section.

We are a Protectorate region of the mighty and Holy [region]Hermits Cove[/region] region and as such an appointed official from [region]Hermits Cove[/region] is sent to [region]The General Hermit Association[/region] and appointed as the [b]Crown-Prince[/b].
We serve and protect the Hermit race.
