The [b]Vale of Arryn[/b] is a fertile valley bordered by the Mountains of the Moon in eastern Westeros. The valley gives its name to the larger realm ruled by House Arryn, commonly called the Vale of Arryn, which includes the Mountains of the Moon, the Fingers, and islands in the Bite and the narrow sea.

The Vale proper is accessible by the high road, which passes through the formidable Mountains of the Moon, and the Bloody Gate. The Vale proper is a tranquil land of wide rivers, and hundreds of lakes. Wheat, corn, barley, pumpkins, and fruit grow in its fertile soil. &#151; [color=336699]A Wiki of Ice and Fire[/color][hr]
