Founded in 2017, the Coalition of Conservative States aims to unite against the reactionary leftist forces of the modern world and uphold the traditions that our forebears achieved greatness with. A highly decentralized organization, the Coalition does not pass laws, but debates issues. The only grounds for ejection from the Coalition are declaring war on a member state without authorization and an ideological shift too far to the left.
