Yovdal is a suppressed nation under the tyrannical rule of the one and (even though he has multiple accounts) &quot;The United Order of United Geronimo States (Why would need to state that he is &quot;united&quot; twice I don&#39;t know) if you do choose to join this region then I must warn you that everything here is not as it seems. We are actually pulling the strings on all the worlds issues and if you are accosted with us we cannot guarantee your safety. I hope you have a great day and wish to see you in your future travels. 


                                                          Sincerely, George Washington xoxoxo
       The first president of the United states (though we only have one united in our name) and resident of Yovdal
