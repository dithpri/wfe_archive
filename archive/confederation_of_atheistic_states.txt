[color=#0000F4]A Place for Atheistic Minds to relax[/color]

[hr]

[color=#f40000]Welcome to the Confederation of Atheistic States, or CAS for short. We allow theists to be in here, just as, say, CCN allows Liberals. Or how the Soviet Coalition allows Capitalists (does it?). We have roleplay (in the Regional Message Board), and we have positions and debates. See below for more details.[/color]
