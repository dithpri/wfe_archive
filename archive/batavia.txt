[b]Batavia[/b] was the name of the capital city of the [region]Dutch East Indies[/region], and corresponds to the present day city of Jakarta. Just as modern Jakarta may refer to either the city itself or to the larger area of the city with its geographic surroundings, which taken together is one of the provinces of Indonesia, so Batavia can refer to the city proper as it then existed, with its various increases over time in urbanized acreage, or it can also refer to the surrounding hinterland.

Batavia was founded as the trade and administrative center of the Dutch East India Company. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
