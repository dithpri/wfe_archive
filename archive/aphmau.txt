[color=#f54293]Hello There to anyone reading this. [region]Aphmau[/region] was raided by me and [nation]Socialist Lop[/nation]. However, it is now under my care. [nation]Astoflo Land[/nation], But my Main is [nation]Down Scoblic[/nation]. I am taking control from the wish of [nation]Socialist Lop[/nation]. Today marks her farewell and departure from the Nationstates website due to her own personal reasonings. Which you can learn about from the First dispatch below. [/color]

All I have is one quote, and one quote only to Lop themselfs as to her final departure today on May 13th, 2025...
