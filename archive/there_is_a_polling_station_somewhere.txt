[color=E18611]We are the Official-[i][u]unofficial[/u][/i] Polling Station for NationStates! We go around regions and give them polls about current events, opinions, random stuff, and RP POLLS! (isn&#39;t that great?!)[/color]
[color=DAC70D]We also provide a working regional government in which will supervise the polls-making and the distributors will make sure that all polls will be distributed to the regions via embassies![/color][/b][hr][b]Links!: The Main Factbook | About Us | Who Works For Us? | How to Join! | Offsite Forums (SOON)[/b][hr]
