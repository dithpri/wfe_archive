[color=pink]Welcome to the Bubblegum Islands![/color]

The Bubblegum Islands is a region with the objective of being the most welcoming possible, and we devote to three fundamental principles to do so:

[b]Respect.[/b]
[b]Empathy.[/b]
[b]Democracy.[/b]

By [b]respect[/b] a lot of words are included, this includes tolerance, friendliness, and a bunch of others! This means all minorities are welcome, and everyone shall be treated with equal respect and kindness. [b]Empathy[/b], which also is an umbrella, including kindness and understanding. It means that before you do or say something, put yourself in the other person&#39;s shoes. By [b]democracy[/b] we mean every resident has the right to vote on their representatives and direct democracy (directly voting into a decision) will be highly frequent as well.
