In Servilite. The regional flag sais : No diplomacy, no conflict.
Just note. Servilite is a bit incomprehensible when it translates with languages that are not Finno-Ugric.
Anyways. We are serious. We do not like embassies and diplomats. We either kill them, or just ban their nation from ever interfering. We believe that if there is isolation. There is no conflict.
