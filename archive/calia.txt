Calia: A Vibrant Peninsula

Calia, a picturesque peninsula, lies between the azure Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Its rugged coastline is adorned with golden beaches, rocky cliffs, and ancient olive groves. The imposing Sierra Caliana mountain range dominates the interior, its peaks shrouded in mist.

Calia&#146;s rich history weaves together diverse influences. Ancient Iberian tribes settled here, leaving behind mysterious dolmens and intricate pottery. Later, Phoenician traders established bustling ports, while Roman legions marched through olive orchards. Moorish architecture graces the cities, and medieval castles perch atop cliffs.
