Unity, Democracy and Liberty. Welcome to the [region]Global Treaty Organisation[/region].

The GTO is a democratic government consisting of regions, non-regional alliances and also independent nations. We hold regular elections for regional representatives and we vote for new legislation. The GTO is simply a government and works [i]alongside[/i] the regions you are a part of - rather than instead of them. 

The GTO works like the WA, except that it gives its members more power. With a clear leadership structure, the GTO gives all its members as much power as they want.
