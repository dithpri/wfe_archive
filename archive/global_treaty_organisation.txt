Greetings and welcome to the [region]Global Treaty Organisation[/region] (GTO). The GTO was founded as an open inter-regional alliance with a democratic voting process to decide on international legislation and resolutions. Each nation has a set of preferences - some may want the GTO to act as a federal governing body (like the federal government of the USA) and others may want to take part in the GTO as a military organisation (like NATO).
