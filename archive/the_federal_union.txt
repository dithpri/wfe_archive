After serious unfortunate events in the Federal Unity, and after much thought and care, Ritzoville has somberly decided to take it upon himself for change. Previously great supporter of the Federal Unity, Ritzoville strived to help the Federal Unity though politics and as a public servant. To no avail, the Federal Unity blasted the land of Ritzoville, slandering the kind country along the way. The people of Ritzoville demanded change, but I as their leader still believed in The Federal Unity. I tried to keep my support, but after recent events, I am sad to say that I have no choice but to create a union on my own.
