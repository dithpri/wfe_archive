Several demonstrations within [b]The United Provinces of Valenia[/b], the Delsolan protectorate have taken place today, calling for Delsola to free its grasp upon the Valenian realm and allow its people to be free and independent. Most demonstrations appear peaceful, however, several rioters have also taken to the streets in many of the poorer regions in Valenia, looting and attacking Delsolan officers and businessmen around the region. There has yet to be an official word from the Delsolan government.
