The Federal Union finds itself on the brink of war as [nation]Engortia[/nation] and [nation]Dolorem[/nation] sign a bilateral treaty on the halting of Communism, by force if necessary. Leftist nations across Asura are taking counter measures, forming two armed camps in the continent. All nations in Asura are taking a stance, whether supporting one side or opposing the violence, to prevent another disasterous war. Should the two alliances go to war, casualties may reach the millions. [nation]Midrasia[/nation] and [nation]Delsola[/nation] are attempting to dissolve the situation before the continent takes up arms.
