Demonstrations within Valenia have died down slightly as the Delsolan government has announced the handing over of power to a local government. However several violent demonstrations continue as many are angry than the new government will simply be a puppet of the Delsolan regime. Banners such as [b][i]&amp;quot;Down with the stag!&amp;quot;[/i][/b] and [i][b]&amp;quot;Freedom not Titanism!&amp;quot;[/i][/b] continue to reign supreme over Cerela square as large crowds chant the old Valenian imperial anthem. Looting within Parlenhaal continues within the western boroughs as many are arrested and several police officers wounded.
