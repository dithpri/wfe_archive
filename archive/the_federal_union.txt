Demonstrations within Valenia have died down with a reduction in violent protests after a string of arrests and increasing numbers of riot police deployed within Cerela city. However some peaceful protests continue within Cerela square and many other areas of Valenia and Parlenhaal, with several high profile nationalist figures calling for protests to continue until &amp;#39;the stag&amp;#39; is removed from all of mainland Asura.
