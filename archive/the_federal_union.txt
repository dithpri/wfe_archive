Ah Hoy mateys! Pirates have been sited recently off the Isolatonian coast carrying what appears to be military grade weapons, nobody knows how they got there or if they are even working for a government. But there has been no intervention by any coast guard authorities as of yet. Our news are currently working around the clock to bring you more information on these doubloon snatching sailors.
