The&nbsp;Great Lakes, also called the&nbsp;Great Lakes of North America&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Laurentian Great Lakes, are a series of large interconnected&nbsp;freshwater lakes&nbsp;with certain&nbsp;sea-like&nbsp;characteristics in the mid-east region of&nbsp;North America&nbsp;that connect to the&nbsp;Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;via the&nbsp;Saint Lawrence River. They are Lakes&nbsp;Superior,&nbsp;Michigan,&nbsp;Huron,&nbsp;Erie, and&nbsp;Ontario&nbsp;and are in general on or near the&nbsp;Canada&#150;United States border. Hydrologically, lakes&nbsp;Michigan and Huron&nbsp;are a single body joined at the&nbsp;Straits of Mackinac.
