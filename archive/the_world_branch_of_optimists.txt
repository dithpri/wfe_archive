Here at The World Branch Of Optimists we like to think positively about pretty much everything. if you have been ejected from a region or even banned you are always welcome here. We won&#39;t judge you whether you&#39;re exactly like Hitler or just plain Corrupt. All Nations are given the same amount of respect here. We all count.
We do not role-play if you were wondering.

Other than that welcome to the T.W.B.O.O and we hope you enjoy being here as much as we do.
