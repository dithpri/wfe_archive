Welcome to The World Branch Of Optimists.
 Here, we are dedicated to keeping positive, and believe in egalitarian values and a quality life for all. 
 If you want to role-play, maybe you can find someone here to join you.
 We do not discriminate against gays or transgender people, because we are free from narrow minded backward thinking.
 Our favorite people here are socialists, communists, and egalitarians.
  

To Hager: Communism does work, look at China, also, actual communism has never been tried, only berated by backwards thinking wealthy Americans.
  An unofficial form of communism that WORKED was early hunter-gatherer civilizations that helped each other.
