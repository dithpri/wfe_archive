[sub][b][colour=#f4efef]Welcome to [i]Moon Age Daydream[/i], the 400th Outer Space region ([strike]and not officially endorsed by David Bowie[/strike]). Moon Age Daydream looks at the ideas of space age engineers and alternate-history enthusiasts and looks to provide an environment friendly to both of those worlds: A hard(ish) sci-fi roleplay region where even Korolev&#39;s craziest designs would feel at home. Though currently small, we hope to someday reach to the stars above.[/colour][/b][/sub]
