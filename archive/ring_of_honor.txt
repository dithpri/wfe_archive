May the Honor of nationstates wrestling live throughout this region. Allow this to be a region of remembrance of your wrestling on nationstates careers. From the start up shows to the legendary Ministry of Darkness to Ring of Honor. We have evolved. 

Many have come and go over the years, for the love of wrestling. No matter where we where from, our beliefs, or age. We all co-exist together as fans of wrestling to the point of taking on as our favorites or for some as an incarnation of ourselves over the years. 

We have enter as strangers but we leave as friends. May you have good luck in your future endeavors.
