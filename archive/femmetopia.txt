[b][color=#ff9999]Welcome to Femmetopia![/b] A region for women, by women.[/color]

Though we are a female-led region, all genders are welcome here. Men may be residents and vote, but are not allowed to hold positions in the government.
The government will be led by the people. No decisions will be made without a vote, everyone&#39;s voice will be heard.



[color=#e6b3ff][i]If you wish to become a government official, send a telegram stating which position you&#39;re interested in, what you can contribute, and how often you plan to be around. Your nation must be a matriarchy or queendom to be considered.[/color][/i]

[color=blue][b]Please endorse [nation]Scartastlandylvens[/nation] for WA delegate![/color][/b]
