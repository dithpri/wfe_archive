[b][color=#ff9999]Welcome to Femmetopia![/b] A region for women, by women.[/color]

Men may become residents as they please, but only women are eligible to become the WA delegate or hold a government position. As a new region, all positions are currently open. 

Female residents will have a say in how we wish to run things. We will collectively decide the delegate nominee, government official, and regional policies. Male residents may give their opinion on matters, but will only be 50% as effective as female opinions.

[color=#e6b3ff][i]If you wish to become the delegate nominee or other official, send a telegram stating which position you&#39;re interested in, what you can contribute, and how often you plan to be around. Your nation must be a matriarchy to be considered.[/color][/i]
