The Persian Gulf, in Southwest Asia, is an extension of the Indian Ocean located between Iran (formerly called Persia) and the Arabian Peninsula. Historically and internationally known as the Persian Gulf, this body of water is sometimes controversially referred to as the Arabian Gulf or simply The Gulf by most Arab states.

The Persian Gulf contains around 674 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, representing approximately two thirds of proven, conventional world oil supply.
