[region]The Black Hawks[/region] were feeling [color=red]chaotic[/color]. 

Chaos is determined by how many teddy bears we could find, and determined we were.

We heard rumours of the legendary teddy bear in your region, and so we slid [color=blue]left left, right right, up up and back back[/color] to play with the teddy bear. The teddy bear also gave us treats, and we left happy!
