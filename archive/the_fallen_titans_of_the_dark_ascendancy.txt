We Are The Rejected. The Betrayed. The Fallen.

We have been betrayed by those we called allies. We have been stripped of power. We were titans, and cast among the weak. We were devastated. and left to die. 

We Are Not Dead. We Are The New Ascendant. We Are Not to Be Forgotten. We Do Not Forget.

The nations of this Dark Ascendancy have been betrayed, humiliated, destroyed, or otherwise cast from power while in the pursuit of perfection. War or politics are rather irrelevant, power will be restored to us however we can arrange. 
Proditores ad mortem!
