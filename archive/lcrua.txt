Welcome to LCRUA (Left Centrist Right Unification Alliance). This region is the original LCRUA region, now a museum region dedicated to our history. The continuation of this region can be found in [region]The LCRUA[/region]. Keep in mind that this region is [u]no longer functional[/u] as a residence for nations. 

The LCRUA is a regional alliance with the goal of closing the ideological gap peacefully, sharing culture and preserving freedom. We accept all ideologies in our current region as long as we get along, so feel free to take a look, contact us or join us there.
