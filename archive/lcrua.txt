Welcome to LCRUA (Left Centrist Right Unification Alliance). This region is the original LCRUA region, the ancestor region of [region]The LCRUA[/region]. This region is [u]no longer functional[/u] and serves as a museum to commemorate our history. The LCRUA is a regional alliance with the goal of closing the ideological gap peacefully, sharing culture and preserving freedom. We accept all ideologies in our current region as long as we get along, so feel free to take a look, contact us or join us there.
