Vurkianverse is closed, personal region of mine. This region stores elements of Vurkianverse or puppet/alt accounts of mine. Story wise, Vurkianverse is one of universes in the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=skalliad/detail=factbook/id=2503718]Multiverse[/url].

[list][*]Original region was referred as &quot;Vurkian Free Zone&quot; but I&#39;ve departed all nations here.
[*][nation]Tutku15[/nation] is my alt and monumental account. Currently [nation]Vurk[/nation] is my WA and main account.
[*]If there is something about roleplay, contact with [nation]Foreign Relations of Vurk[/nation], otherwise contact with [nation]Vurk[/nation]. But anything related to regions (embassy etc.) will be likely to be ignored unless it is only meant to giving me a comunication channel.
[*]These are basically names I&#39;ve reserved for future use.
