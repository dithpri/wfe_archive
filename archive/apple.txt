Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976, to develop and sell personal computers. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. on January 3, 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc. on January 9, 2007, to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics.

P.S This region isn&#39;t meant just for Apple users, anyone is welcome! (I don&#39;t even own any Apple products except an old keyboard myself)
