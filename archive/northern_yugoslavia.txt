The Northern Yugoslavia Region is a geographical area that consists of many of the previously existing Yugoslavian States stretching from Slovenia to the most southern part of the region - Serbia.

Renown for its isolationist policies the Northern Yugoslavian Region is influenced very little from Outsider Factions such as the West. Commonly referred to as Northern Yugoslavia as a whole, the Region is considered to be a united Federation - where all States have relative freedoms in the governing of their States.

Northern Yugoslavia shares a common belief in the idea of their superiority over other bordering Regions and a common goal in the idea of expansion.
