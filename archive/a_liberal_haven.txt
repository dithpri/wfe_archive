[b]Dear Liberals,[/b]

[i]We, the lovable raiders from [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b], [b][region]The Black Hawks[/region][/b], [b][region]Karma[/region][/b], [b][region]Osiris[/region][/b], [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_land_of_kings_and_emperors]the LKE[/url][/b], [b][region]Kantrias[/region][/b], and [b][region]Caer Sidi[/region][/b] have taken notice of your recent activity problems. As the caring raiders that we are, we decided we&#39;d stop by and help out. We have taken the liberty of taking your delegacy to this end, all for a good cause, of course. However, we have heard rumours of faulty security circulating around. This is most dangerous, as certain regions may seek to take advantage of these flaws for their own nefarious ends. To protect you of this fate, we have tightened security. You, too, can help by endorsing the liberty-loving delegate and all ROs.
In Raider Unity,

the Raiders.[/i][hr]
