Founded on August 7, 2003, A Liberal Haven is one of the oldest non-refounded regions in NationStates.

We are committed to world peace through achieving social justice, non-violent solutions to problems, a healthy environment, and strong democracy. 

We welcome all nations regardless of ethnic or religious backgrounds. We promote tolerance and reject intolerance. 

Let us do more than acknowledge and tolerate our differences; let us celebrate our diversity! 

Please endorse the currently elected WA Delegate.
