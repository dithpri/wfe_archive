Greetings from Intera Conteu. This region of this fast-changing earth is based on, to put it simply, freedom. We believe in free choice, free press, free speech, and any other right you can think of, within reason. United as one, we are a democracy that believes in the well-being of our people. 

Regional Motto: Utinam logica falsa tuam philosophiam totam suffodiant!

Note: This used to be an awesome region with about 20 nations in it, and then they all fizzed. It&amp;#39;s had its ups, and it&amp;#39;s had its downs. Right now, it&amp;#39;s on its down.

WE NEED MORE NATIONS!
