[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region], and [region]The East Pacific[/region] decided to watch anime in your region. This time, we watched Dig Delight Direct Drive DJ.

[color=steelblue]It was truly educational, as we learnt many things such as the basics of DJing and VJing. [/color] 

[color=#0A3B59]We also learnt that Banana juice tastes like bananas, and a remix is a remix of a song[/color]
