We are the allied reigons of Foley High School. Born out of the ashes of reigons long fallen. Together we have risen, and we shall prosper within ourselves.

Rules are as follows (Subject to Change):

- Keep it PG-13
- Roleplay is allowed, but is not mandatory
- Have fun, but don&#39;t be a baby
- Any NationStates rule must be followed

Delegates will be decided by a vote every week, good luck on the position.

Officer roles will be applied for and me and the delegate will decide.

But, most importantly, don&#39;t forget your grab and go, have a great day.
