The Cyclone Isles are a group of friends just wishing to play the game together. We are neutral and respect all aspects of the simulation.

That being said, don&#39;t raid here, we aren&#39;t larpers.

I&#39;ve banned the lot of you who tried to ruin our fun the first time. I can and will do it again.
