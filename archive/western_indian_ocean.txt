A vast region of Indian ocean with its large archipelagos of islands, with vast flora and fauna.
The western Indian ocean is home to almost 10 crore inhabitants, and it is termed as an archeological wonder.  Blessed with different flora and fauna, this region is sometimes termed as the &#145;biological hub of the world&#146;. People are mostly Austrloesians and Melanesians. There is a significant European population too, especially the Minnastown ruling dynasty.

&#147;We urge all the peace loving nations to rally behind us to become a third power. We assure together we can thwart all imperialistic ambitions in our sacred western ocean.&#148;
