We Kekistanis started in 2900 BC as what is now Egypt. We fought the Cucks and the Normies in many bloody wars. But sadly Kekistan was defeated and taken by Cucks. Though Kekistan still lives in the hearts of its descendants today. We come from all religious backgrounds, races, and political beliefs. We oppose censorship, the Establishment, identity politics, support free speech, and oppose dictatorships. Come join us in the peaceful protest against Normies, Cucks, Authoritarian Groups, The Establishment, Terrorist organizations, and moronic SJWs.
