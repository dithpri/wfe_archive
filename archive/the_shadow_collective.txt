[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][hr]

This region was previously a planned project between [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation] and his [i]&quot;allies&quot;[/i] at [region]Sanctum[/region], until it was revealed he was a saboteur all along and he then backstabbed them in a beautiful sequence of events. After all, evil overlords don&#39;t need [i]&quot;allies&quot;[/i], [b]they only slow you down[/b].

[b]The Shadow Collective[/b] was also the name of an evil organization of various crime syndicates and non-state actors in Star Wars, led by the elusive [b]Darth Maul[/b], who was in truth using them to achieve his own devious goals... [i]Just like me&#133;[/i][/color]
