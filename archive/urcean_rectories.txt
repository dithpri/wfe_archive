[b]Overseas possessions of [nation]Urcea[/nation] are organized under the supervision of a Rector and are consequently called &quot;rectories&quot;, divided into &quot;civil rectories&quot; and &quot;military rectories&quot;.[/b] Rectors were originally established as temporary governors of newly conquered territories, representing the Apostolic King of Urcea in a viceregal capacity until proper government could be established locally. This system was adapted for Urcea&#39;s overseas acquisitions on a permanent basis, and it remains the system presently in use. Rectors are appointed by the Apostolic King of Urcea (through the Office for Territorial Appointments) in consultation with the Chancellor and Temporary President on behalf of the Daoni. (Canonical.)
