A place for the more compassionate dictators out there. Generally nations wishing to join must have Good civil rights or better. Those on the extreme right are not welcome.

Since this is a side-project in NS I&amp;#39;ll just leave the region to develop on it&amp;#39;s own. But if I see anything I really don&amp;#39;t like I reserve the right to expel that nation without any warning or explanation.

If you are actually interested in developing this region, the post of Premier is wide open. Just come to me with a plan.
