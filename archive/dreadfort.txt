The [b]Dreadfort[/b] is a fortress in the North and the seat of House Bolton in northeastern Westeros. Located on the banks of the upper Weeping Water, it is southeast of the Lonely Hills and north of the Sheepshead Hills. The Dreadfort is north of Hornwood, south of Last Hearth, and southwest of Karhold.

The Dreadfort is ill-omened, for it is said that the Boltons still keep torture chambers and a special room where they hang the flayed skins of their enemies, including several Kings in the North from House Stark.&#151;[url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dreadfort][color=006666]A Wiki of Ice and Fire[/url][/color].[hr]
