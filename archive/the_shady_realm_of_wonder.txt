Attack Union of the Kind Ones,
They have been unjust!
Get rid of our founder, he doesn&#146;t support us! He left the region (as he was ordered to create this region) and works for them!

What I, as founder say:
These individuals want to take over our region &#147;Union of the Kind Ones.&#148; One of them had a government position and tried to take us over. We banned them and they wanted a second chance to come back and be responsible. We built this region so they can prove themselves responsible and possibly come back. Clearly they failed.
