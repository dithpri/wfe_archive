A very happy Thanksgiving to all from the [color=red]Europeian[/color] [color=blue]Republican[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color]! We just stopped by to share our turkey and all the fixings with you, prepared by Cat&#39;s Nana! 

Later on, if you&#39;re a little stuffed and football becomes boring, stop by [region]Europeia[/region]! We&#39;ll be waiting!
