Terokh Jeruth, best imagined as &amp;quot;the Great Tree of Possibilities,&amp;quot; sprouts an infinite canopy of leaves, each resembling a possible age. All ages that can and ever will exist attach to its limbs. It is up to you whether they flourish or wither. Writers often suffer unstable ages before they perfect their Art, so don&amp;#39;t get discouraged.

[b][i]What&amp;#39;s an Age and how is it different from a nation?[/i][/b]
An&nbsp;Age&nbsp;is a pocket universe you can visit by writing a&nbsp;descriptive book&nbsp;and a&nbsp;linking book&nbsp;leading to it. Scholars raise many questions on whether ages are created or merely linked. Unlike nations, ages do not share borders, so you can only travel with a linking book matching a specific age. Never leave without a link home!
