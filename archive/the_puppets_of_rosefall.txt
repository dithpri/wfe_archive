This is a puppet storage region of [nation=long]Rosefall[/nation]. Levels of lore vary a lot, from not at all to very well thought out. The user who created these nations is in an attempt to try to connect all nations here, but it may or may not be very connected.

Rosefall resides in the [region]Java Sea[/region], not this region. This region is separate from the Java Sea because Rosefall wished to remain with its allies there, but still wanted a place to dump it&#39;s puppets, so this nation was created.

If you want to make an embassy with Rosefall, please allow us to redirect you to the [region]Java Sea[/region], as this puppet region will accept very few.
