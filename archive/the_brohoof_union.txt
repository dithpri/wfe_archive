The Brohoof Union is a Union of ponies who like to horse around and stuff. The leaders of the nations in this Union all have different ideas on how to run their state, which results in some minor invasions and trade embargos from time to time, yet they are still united by their common  love for ponies with big plots. 

If you ever meet a pony that asks you to stay out of her shed you better listen to her. No seriously dont mess with her shed.
