The Galactic Trade Federation (GTF) currently finds itself based in the Milky Way galaxy, but is not above expansion to other regions of space. The GTF, itself, is an intergalactic commerce guild, trade cartel, megacorporation, and lobbying group that was founded as an association of business, nations, and trade groups. The Federation is steadily growing in order to dominate entire star systems and all major trade routes within its territory, and seeks to possess a regional private military.
