This region is a very large archipelago where many nations may reside. Despite being apply named the &#39;Keichinian archipelago&#39;  most of the land does not actually belong to New Keichan, rather instead being made of up many tribes just waiting to be recognized on a national scale.

These islands are also known for their beauty, and nations taking advantage of the ecosystem or ruining it will either be forced to change or leave all together. Speaking of beautiful! Tourism is widely accepted and so are civil rights! 

Welcome! Enjoy your stay!
