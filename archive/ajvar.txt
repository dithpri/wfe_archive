[b][color=darkred]The name ajvar comes from the Turkish word havyar, which means &quot;salted roe, caviar&quot; shares an etymology with &quot;caviar&quot;. Prior to the 20th century, there was a significant local production of caviar on the Danube, with sturgeon swimming from the Black Sea up to Belgrade. Domestic ajvar, meaning &quot;caviar&quot;, used to be a very popular dish in Belgrade homes and restaurants. However, the domestic production of caviar was not steady starting in the 1890s because of labor disputes, and eventually a special pepper salad was offered as a substitute in Belgrade restaurants under the name &quot;red ajvar&quot; (crveni ajvar) or &quot;Serbian ajvar&quot; (srpski ajvar).[/b][/color]
