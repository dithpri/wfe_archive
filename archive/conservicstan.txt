The march towards America becoming a third world nation has begun.  Get ready to see your taxes rise, your 401k&#39;s wither, your gas and heating bills go up. You suburbanites can expect a crime wave.  

You persons who finally found employment in manufacturing can expect to lose your jobs to the influx of illegals. But that&#39;s OK, because many of the new factories will go back to China, the place that purposely released a virus to oust Trump.

And the person who occupies the White House is a criminal, but you won&#39;t hear it on the news.
