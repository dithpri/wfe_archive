The Occidens Elyrianus is a historic and culturally rich region, often described as the western heart of the Elyrian world. Stretching across fertile plains, ancient river valleys, and highland fortresses, it has long been a crossroads of peoples, empires, and ideas.

Its two principal powers are Elysei and Ulysar. Though sharing deep historical ties and a common Elyrian heritage, the two nations have followed divergent paths. Elysei, forged in federation and inspired by the legacy of antiquity, seeks to embody democracy, philosophy, and unity in diversity. Ulysar, by contrast, bears the proud weight of imperial tradition, ruled by emperors and shaped by the ideals of discipline, order, and martial strength.
