A Large Wasteland stretching for Miles. It Is Inhabited by Domes that keep the populace safe from the harsh environments outside. The Domes are connected through tunnels underground. There are mutated animals in the wastes that would kill on sight. There are also small settlements that have managed to survive the doomsday event that has been long forgotten.

Dome 1 was the first built and holds all of the important people who make the decisions for the other domes.
