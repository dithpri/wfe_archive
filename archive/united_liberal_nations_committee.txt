A region that welcomes liberal values and puts the citizens first. While the founder of this region is merely a fledgling, they are a split off faction of a communist nation known as Osvanir. Osvanir oppresses their citizens and the ruler of Amaricama (as well as a small number of other Osvanirians) made the decision to split off. If there are any concerns about a fellow nation here being anything other than liberal, please contact Amaricama immediately. We are currently looking for other nations to join us, so please invite any nation you feel would like it here.

If you wish to join, send a telegram to Amaricama and you shall receive the password.
