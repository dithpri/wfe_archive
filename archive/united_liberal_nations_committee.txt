Our committee welcomes nations who value the people above all else. Our founder, Amaricama, was originally part of a nation that treats it citizens like cattle to be used. While no names will be mentioned, we implore that you have no contact with nations that treat their citizens so. Nations are not required to shun these other nations, however it is highly suggested. If you wish to invite a nation to take up residence here, contact our founder so that they mad do research over whether they may be allowed to join the committee. If you wish to join, also contact our founder so they your nation may be investigated.
