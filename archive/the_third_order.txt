 The Third Order constituted the overseas French colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from 2016 onward. A distinction is generally made between the &quot;first colonial empire&quot;, that existed until late November last year, by which time most of it had been lost, and the &quot;second colonial empire&quot;, which began with the conquest of The Union Of World Socialist Republics in 2016. The second empire came to an end after the loss of bitter wars with Liberal&#39;s and Communists (2016), and peaceful decolonization elsewhere in July 2017.
