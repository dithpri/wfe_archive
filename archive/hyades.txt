[b][region]Hyades[/region][/b] is be an [b]FT:STL[/b] region set in the real-life Hyades Star Cluster, an open star cluster which contains a huge variety of stars in close proximity to each other (conductive to lots of trade, communication and settler migration between star systems).[b] Set 20,000 years into the future[/b], with the first human settlers arriving in the cluster only ten millennia before that, [b][region]Hyades[/region][/b] is part vibrant spacefaring civilisation and part interstellar Wild West depending where you are in the cluster. With a diameter of 14.1 light years, a good starship moving at relativistic speeds can cross the cluster within the space of a human lifetime.
