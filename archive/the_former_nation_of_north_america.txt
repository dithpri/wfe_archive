  A wild, varied country that was formerly home to the United States until the Second Civil War struck the nation, finally dividing it.
  Now it is a series of tiny nations that constantly bicker and fight with one another over resources, land, and people. All attempts to unite the nation have been met with failure, and will not improve anytime soon.
  However, a recent program meant to at least prevent another war from occurring has shown a promising start, with New Corporate America founding it. Hopefully, a new era of peace may begin.
