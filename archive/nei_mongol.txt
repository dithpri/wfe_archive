21st-century Nei Mongol is a wholly different place from Mongolia itself. The more-visited south of the region is industrialised, prosperous and very much within the realm of the world&#39;s modern economic miracle. Having said that, Nei Mongol is more than nine times the size of the USA, and the Nei Mongol of your dreams can be found off the tourist route, amid the shimmering sand dunes of the Ergai Gunbaatar Desert or the vast grasslands in the north. Some effort is required to reach these areas, but the spectacular scenery can make it an unforgettable journey.
