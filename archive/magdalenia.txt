This is Magdalenia. You can read more about it in [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=magdalenia/detail=factbook]my factbook[/url].
If you want to move here... I don&amp;#39;t know, maybe. Telegram me and we&amp;#39;ll talk about it.

I just added the &amp;quot;recruiter friendly&amp;quot; tag. I&amp;#39;m going to keep the region locked, but [b]if you&amp;#39;re a recruiter, you may send me ([nation]Magdalenia[/nation]) a recruiting telegram [u]IF[/u] you read at least the &amp;quot;overview&amp;quot; section of my factbook first and understand the nation you&amp;#39;re recruiting.[/b] (Unless yours is a Nazi region, in which case, don&amp;#39;t waste your time, just go straight to Hell.)

I moved to the region [region]Louisiana[/region] because I got bored with being a hermit here. I left a &amp;quot;regional caretaker&amp;quot; behind so this place doesn&amp;#39;t CTE, just in case I ever want to move back.
