[b][color=blue]Welcome to [region]The United Nations Proving Grounds[/region][/color][/b]

After our loss of [region]World War Proving Grounds[/region] to the terrible invaders from the [region]DEN[/region], we reunited realizing the true reason we are part of a region, to be united in alliance against other terrorizing aggressive regions. [u]We are united to keep the peace and provide mutual protection during times of conflict. We stand side-by-side, brothers in arms.[/u] [b]We are here for you, we will hope you are here for us![/b]

[b]We will hold World Assembly Delegate elections every week[/b]. Though I, [nation]Sherman Land[/nation], will remain in executive founder power to prevent being taken over again.
