The UNFW is a region in which people are always allowed to join and have fun. Here, nations can do and be what they want, just as long as they follow the basic, common sense ground rules: No racism, no discrimination, have fun, and most importantly, have fun! The UNFW is here for the players, the nations, and the leaders. We have established a proud and pleasing federation for people to express, not only themselves, but also their nations.
