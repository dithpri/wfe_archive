Welcome to New-Confederate States of America! A region founded on both state&amp;#39;s (national) rights and individual liberty. This region will attempt to preserve the culture and civility of the Old South while discarding that which most find heinous. It is also our goal to establish a tradition of open, participatory, and transparent democracy.
