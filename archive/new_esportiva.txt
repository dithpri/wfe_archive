Welcome to the region of Esportiva, the youngest of the three big sporting regions. We are a friendly region who are big fans of sport, and new nations, of course, are always welcome. There are a few trophies in our cabinet already, but we&#39;re always looking for some additional silverware.

- Important channels on esper.net IRC - #esportiva for regional chat, #nssport for community chat and #nstransfers for, well, transfers.
