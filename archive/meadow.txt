[color=green]Welcome to [b]Meadow[/b], a peaceful region built upon the principles of freedom, democracy, and love for nature. Come, have a seat and relax. Watch the clouds roll by over the lush, verdant hills. See the deer breaking away in the distance. Listen to the call of a heron as it passes over a nearby pond. All is well in the Meadow.[/color]
