Pavor is a psychological horror/adventure game. The story of Pavor takes place on a fictionalized version of the Doll Island (Isla de la munecas), an island off the coast of Mexico that, as the name implies is covered with various dolls of all shapes and sizes. The game is split up into five chapters, each following different characters from different time periods as they explore this haunted place, and uncover the truth about its origins and the spirits that haunt it. Every horror fan is welcome!
