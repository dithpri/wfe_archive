The United Nations is an organization dedicated to maintaining peace between the nations of the world. The organization consists of three organs: The Secretariat, the General Assembly, and the Security Council.

The United Nations is not a military organization and as such, cannot declare war. It may intervene in nation&#146;s affairs in the event that it threatens international stability, which would result in the deployment of peacekeeping forces.
