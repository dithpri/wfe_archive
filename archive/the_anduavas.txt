Welcome to the Anduavas!

Currently there are certain time and resource gated functions that we are waiting to unlock. These include assigning regional officers, such as Vice-Delegate, so the region can be controlled in the absence of the WA Delegate. For stability, when enough influence has been secured, the region will change to Governorship. Ability to host polls, open embassies, and other functions will be delegated to those interested.

Further, map design of the region is in progress to compliment the breaking news segments published by the Anduavan News Network that have been tracking recent happenings in the region. If anyone has comments, questions, suggestions, or concerns, please reach out to the current WA Delegate!
