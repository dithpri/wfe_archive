Welcome to the greater continent known as the Anduavas, consisting primarily of 4 nation-states located in a semi-connected landmass (with room for other nation-states to still develop).

The initial nation-state to evolve in this region&#39;s history has come to be known as the Allied States of Anduava, or the ASA, and is the primary driver of diplomatic action between the remaining nation-states in the region who have joined together largely out of the interests of protecting themselves against the aggressive growth (politically, technologically, and militarily) of Colboria.
