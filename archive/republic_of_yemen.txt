Yemen (Listeni/&amp;#712;j&amp;#603;m&amp;#601;n/; Arabic: &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1614;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1614;&amp;#1606;&amp;#8206; al-Yaman), officially known as the Republic of Yemen (&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1580;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1607;&amp;#1608;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1577; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1606;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1577; al-Jumh&amp;#363;r&amp;#299;yah al-Yaman&amp;#299;yah), is an Arab country in Western Asia, occupying the southwestern to the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen is the second largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km2 (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east. Yemen was the home of the Sabaeans (biblical Sheba), a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and probably also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea.
