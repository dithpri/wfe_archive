Warning: If you want to join, you must not have &quot;Socialism&quot; as your economic system. You can check your economic system in the &quot;Policies&quot; section of your nation&#39;s main page. You can change from socialism to capitalism by waiting until you have an Issue that allows you to change to capitalism and choosing the option that permits the change.
