[b][region]Hezbollah[/region][/b] receives military training, weapons, and financial support from Iran and political support from Syria. Following the end of the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in 2000, its military strength grew significantly. Despite a June 2008 certification by the United Nations that Israel had withdrawn from all Lebanese territory, in August, Lebanon&amp;#39;s new Cabinet unanimously approved a draft policy statement which secures Hezbollah&amp;#39;s existence as an armed organization and guarantees its right to &amp;quot;liberate or recover occupied lands&amp;quot;. Hezbollah became a part of the government for the first time on June 13, 2011.
