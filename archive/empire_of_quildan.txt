[b]Hello thur![/b][color=sunset] Welcome to the Empire of Quildan (quill-DARN). As you can see, it&amp;#39;s a barren wasteland at the moment - but don&amp;#39;t be put off! It was only founded last night so we&amp;#39;re progressing quite fast, actually. The forum is under construction, but do have a look if you want! 

So, if anyone sees this message, feel free to move in here and watch me build a prestigious region![/color]
