Founded in 1767 by Winston Frizger, the United Republic of Authoritarian States was a small group of nations with one thing in common: government control. Although as the years went on, civil unrest brew stronger as the more peaceful nations wanted out of the violent Authoritarian rule. The URAS relented and in 1937, the Nations that formed the region were granted the right to choose their own government. Although the region is still majorly Authoritarian, there are many Democratic nations sprinkled throughout.
