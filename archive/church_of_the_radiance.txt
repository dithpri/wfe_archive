[b]The Paragons of World Balance Creed[/b]

To go along the path is to become one with it.
Where there is illusion, truth cannot thrive.
Without faith, one cannot reflect.
Curiosity is the driver of understanding.
Science is the driver of wisdom.
Bondage is the antithesis of transcendence.
Wanderer, look within and awaken yourself.
We must ground ourselves and awaken others.
Ecstasy is the driver of the life-force.
It is in flowering that we are guided.
Faith is the truth of faith, and of us.
Without balance, one cannot grow.
We dream, we believe, we are reborn.
