The dictators league is a coalition of dictatorships (and absolute government types) Governments are given the freedom to decide their own fate but if asked by a higher member with imperial approval you must obey (dont wory thats not likely to happen). Governments are allowed to be compassionate but must retain some sort of Dictatoral flare.

Racism and other forms of discrimination is UNACCEPTABLE and will result in an immediate and permanant ban. 

The League is generally a friendly place, and you do not have to be a serious player anyone looking for fun is welcome into the league!
