The dictators league is a coalition of dictatorships (and absolute government types) Governments are given the freedom to decide their own fate but if asked by a higher member with imperial approval you must obey (dont wory thats not likely to happen). Governments are allowed to be compassionate but must retain some sort of Dictatoral flare.

Racism and other forms of discrimination is UNEXCEPTABLE and will result in a imediate and permanant ban. 

 For all rulers with imperialistic ambitions. The dictators League consists of a large area on the eastern coast continent of Pangea. The area that consists of the nations that form the Dictators league is also known as The Empire of Transoxania so if you decide to join welcome to the Empire!
