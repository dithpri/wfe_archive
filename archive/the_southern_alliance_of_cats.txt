[color=blue]Welcome to the Southern Alliance of Cats![/color]

This region was created when the nation of [nation]Catakia[/nation] got bored and left [region]The South Pacific[/region]. If you want to join here, then that&#39;s great, but if not, I suggest clicking on the link above to join The South Pacific (Go Drama Llamas!).

So, umm...that&#39;s about it.
