[color=blue]Welcome to the Southern Alliance of Cats![/color]

This region was created when the nation of [nation]Catakia[/nation] got bored and left [region]The South Pacific[/region]. If you want to join here, then that&#39;s great, but if not, I suggest clicking on the link above to join The South Pacific.

Check out our riddle region: [region]Riddles and Stuff[/region]. We&#39;re going to post riddles there that [i][b]anyone[/b][/i] in the world can answer. Also, anyone from an embassy nation (of [region]Riddles and Stuff[/region]) can post there. Hopefully people will want to be our embassies.

So, umm...that&#39;s about it.
