[i][color=#7F0000]Child of Adam and Eve, you are entering a realm unknown, one filled with wonder. You may return to the world of men, but none will believe you. This is the kingdom of legend, home of Aslan, land beyond the lamp-post. Welcome, traveler, to [b]Narnia[/b].[/color][/i]

Narnia is a kingdom divided. The noble Pevensie monarchs, the evil White Witch, the Caspian dynasty, the Calormenes, and the marauding Telmarines vie for power, all under the watch of the mighty Aslan.
