The authentic Jewish Defense Council is back, Liberated by [nation]Great Israel[/nation], this proves no one can exterminate the Jewish Nation, we still stand strong!


The region defends Jews from all around the world, and teaches them how to defend themselves. The region is not for Jewish Nations only, but anyone who is Pro-Zionism is more than welcome, and be treated as part of the family. However, everyone will have to contribute to the region somehow. A nation could not be a corrupt dictatorship, corporate police state or psychotic dictatorship.
