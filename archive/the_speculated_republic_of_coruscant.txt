Coruscant is a commercial super power regarded as the capital of the galactic republic and the economic haven in the galaxy. Ever since the election of Machmoud Inadinnerjacket as Supreme Chancellor, the system has been in turmoil as to whether or not political freedoms are necessary, however Inadinnerjacket&amp;#39;s reforms are generally accepted among a wealthy capitalist conglomerate of nations. Socialism is outlawed and all those who speak of welfare or income tax are to be recruited as storm-troopers to fight on the front lines. Coruscant is the beginning of the next great region of the galaxy and all those unclogged by communist grime are invited to join. May the force be with you.
