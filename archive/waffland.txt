[b][color=#014AAD]Colonized by Waffland in the 19th and 20th Centuries, all nations here are part of the DWN (Dominion of Waffish Nations)!

Non-Waffish nations may visit this region, but outsiders may not stay!

We do not have a WA delegate, so endorsements are banned!

There are no rules, just don&#146;t do anything that seems like a bad idea :p

Enjoy your stay!
