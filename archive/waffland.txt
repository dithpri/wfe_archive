Hello! This is a region dedicated to Waffland and its colonies. We will construct embassies with almost everyone and you can visit any time, but we do not allow for countries to permanently stay as this region is dedicated to Waffland and Waffland only. We do not have many rules if you decide to visit, just don&#146;t do anything that sounds like a bad idea :p

Also, keep in mind that the map does show many &#147;nations&#148; on it, but all together they are a part of Waffland. They are separated into states/provinces that are allowed to govern themselves for the most part. It also does show many provinces that do not exist, and those will be created soon but are being postponed so that way they don&#146;t all have the same or too similar of a population.
