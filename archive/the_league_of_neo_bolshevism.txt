Two new, aspiring socialist nations have risen from the ashes of the old world... After WWV, when the United States and its allies were obliterated, a new, Authoritarian system called &#147;Neo-Bolshevism&#148; by its proprietors spread like a cancer across the remaining bastions of human society. Two leaders in this new world have decided to form an alliance. Realizing they have similar goals, they formed the League of Neo Bolshevism, an alliance of Authoritarian nations dedicated to complete governmental control and the pursuit of total power at the detriment of the Proletariat &#147;useless eaters.&#148; In this Brave New World, where the rich get richer and the poor remain ignorant and weak, only the strong will survive..Join or be conquered.
