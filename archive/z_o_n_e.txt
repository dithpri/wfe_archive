An area of [region]The Planet X[/region] which the normal laws of reality do not apply, and remnants of seemingly [color=purple]extraterrestrial activity[/color] lie undisturbed amongst its ruins. The Zone contains a place called the &quot;Room&quot;, said to grant the [b]wishes[/b] of anyone who steps inside. The area containing the Zone is shrouded in secrecy, sealed off by the government and ominous hazards exist within it.
