[u][i]What we do[/i][/u]

The fundamental purposes of the BDK are to promote greater social, political and economic harmony and prosperity among the nations of the Germanic sphere. The BDK reasons that nations whose economies are interdependent are less likely to engage in conflict. Militarily, it ensures every member state to be defended and held to these guarantees, making sure no nationality or Germanic brother is left behind.
