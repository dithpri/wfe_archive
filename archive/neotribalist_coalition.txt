We are a coalition of nations who strive to increase the cause of neotribalism, an ideology that transcends the left/right political spectrum. We believe that liberalism and conservatism are natural parts of societal evolution and must coexist. 

Neotribalist find a common tie in a goal rather than race, religion, or ethnicity. We believe humanity will one day exist as a unified global tribe.
