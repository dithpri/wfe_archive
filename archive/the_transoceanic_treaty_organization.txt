The TransOceanic Treaty Organization, or [color=4057A7]TOTO[/color], is both a Military and Economical alliance of Nations that currently works to maintain stability around the globe.

[i]History[/i]
The Organization was formed during the Even Worse Depression in the 1940&#39;s to stabilize the members&#39; economical standings by lessening trade restrictions among them.
During the not-quite-red-but-not-purple-either scare of the 50s and 60s, the scope of the organization expanded to military means as well. This includes the sharing of strategic information, increased collaboration, and a Special Operations Task Force. 

[i]Current Operations[/i]
Currently members are engaged in multiple minor conflicts in Africa, under the umbrella name [color=CE0000]Operation Rosanna[/color].
