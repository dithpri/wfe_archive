The Leigon is a mighty region that is run by Big Boi and El Handshake, two memers who have nothing better to do.
[nation]Tercania Islands[/nation] is not a puppet, its an actual person, he just has regional power.
[nation]Wig benus[/nation] is not a puppet either, he owns the region and spams his RMB.
This place is literally the Hell of [region]Pangea Oceania[/region], ask either [nation]Wig benus[/nation] or [nation]Tercania Islands[/nation] via telegram for the password, we don&#39;t accept raiders, unless you&#39;re friendly about it and kindly ask to advertise your raiding region, but otherwise no raiding.
