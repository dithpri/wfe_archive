Hail to Your Lordship!
Welcome to The Elder Realms, a region dedicated to Medieval Roleplay. 

Our region is set within the world of Thaide during the 2nd century following the fall of the Old Romenean Empire. 
In this chaotic world. Kings and Princes vie for supremacy in a never- ending battle between rival dynasties; each seeking to claim the Golden Throne.

Gather your Forces, Conquer your Enemies and Forge your Empire

The Annals of History are yours to write so ride forth and claim your destiny
