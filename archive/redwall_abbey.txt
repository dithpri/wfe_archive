Redwall Abbey is closing. See [nation=short]Abbot Mordalfus[/nation]&amp;#39; factbook for more info. Here&amp;#39;s the original WFE:
Welcome to Redwall Abbey! We are dedicated to three things: enjoying our lives working together in peace and love, defending (when necessary) our home from vermin hordes, and preserving the timeless characters, myths, quests, and settings from all of Brian Jacques&amp;#39; [i]Redwall[/i] books. Our doors are always open to all creatures, regardless of species. Be aware, though, that if you have a mind to disturb our tranquility, we shall be firm in our opposition! Redwall will always be free!
