It is, first of all, worth addressing what Leitungism is not.

It is not:
-National Socialism
-Communism
-Capitalism
-Fascism

It is Leitungism. What is that you ask? Well, let&amp;#39;s see:
-The total rule of government and state
-The banning of political parties as they propose a threat to national interests
-The consideration of grievances on an economic and social level
-The destruction of the past and its many traditions
-The replacement of these old traditions with Leitung Thought

Join up if you wish. It would be greatly appreciated if this spread.

&#147;All uphold Leitung thought!&#148;
