The Terra Imperius Archipelago is a large and ancient region ruled and populated by the remnants of the old Terra Atlanticus Empire. Advanced shielding and cloaking technology has kept the nations in the region virtually undiscovered until recent global environmental concerns forced the Imperial senate and the Congress of Royal houses to vote unanimously for the region to end the self imposed isolation. This was done in order to campaign for a global call to action in an attempt to secure the survival of not only the people of Terra Imperius, but the whole of civilization.
