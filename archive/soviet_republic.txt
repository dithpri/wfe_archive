The Soviet Republics are a collection of Communist regimes that were formed in the aftermath of the Second World War and subsequent redefining of the Soviet state following Joseph Stalin&#39;s death. Each Republic is considered a member state in the greater nation itself, which is what the region stands to represent. However, non-Republics can be represented here as allies to the greater union as a whole.
