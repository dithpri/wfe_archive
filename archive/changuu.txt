I am Northern Ateria, and I am here to ask you a question: is a nation not entitled to the sweat of its brow?

&quot;No,&quot; says the man from the Far Future Tech Space Empire, &quot;you must rely on robots to deal with your problems!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; says the man from the Utopian Democracy, &quot;you must deal things with diplomacy always!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; says the man from the Dystopian Orwellian Dictatorship, &quot;you must be based!&quot;

I rejected those answers.
