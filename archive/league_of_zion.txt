A region (under construction) dedicated to peace and coexistence for the Holy Land and all its inhabitants.

[b]THIS REGION IS FOR PEOPLE FROM ANY SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AS LONG AS YOU BELIEVE IN ISRAEL&#39;S RIGHT TO EXIST, TO SELF-DEFENCE WITHIN REASON, AND THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION. HATE SPEECH TOWARDS ANY GROUP WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. BICKERING OVER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS WILL RESULT IN AN EJECTION.[/b]
