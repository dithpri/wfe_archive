A region where anything can happen. A land where you can roleplay as your country or just have casual chats! I hope that as your founder, I will do my best to make a productive region. Please be polite to the Directors. I put them in place for a reason. To keep the chat safe. If you ever see a problem with anything they&#39;re doing, feel free to contact [nation]brigandacia[/nation]. Also, please read the constitution [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=919889]click here[/url]. The Alagaesia Defense Force [region]The ADF[/region].
