A region where anything can happen. A land where you can roleplay as your country or just have casual chats! I hope that as your founder, I will do my best to make a productive region. Please be polite to the Directors. I put them in place for a reason. To keep the chat safe. If you ever see a problem with anything they&#39;re doing, feel free to contact [nation]brigandacia[/nation].Also, please read the constitution [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=919889]click here[/url].

We need a WA Delegate so this region can have more of an effect on the international level.
Voting should be more than just a blank slate!
