[region]The Western Gothic Republics[/region] is a grouping of a select-few powerful nations that control an area in west Germany. The political climate is somewhat tumultuous in how power is shifting, with minor republics such as [nation]Brevant[/nation] springing up after a civil war with Durnlande over issues of personal freedom. Other, more powerful nations such as [nation]Gynce[/nation] and [nation]Blacre[/nation] still retain their independence through means of financial bribes in the form of trade tariffs. One constant source of disturbance to the daily lives of everyone in the region are the nations known as [nation]The Maroon Isles[/nation] and [nation]Marstoph[/nation].
