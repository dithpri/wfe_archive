Welcome to Kami no Chikara; the once home to the KNC&#39;s Divine Force; which operated out of the region of [b]KNC Military Outpost[/b].
After the region fell into disarray and many years being dormant, the region CTE. The Guards were able to take over the region and display it as a trophy, seeing into the major attempt in a region condemning KNC&#39;s military actions within the WA. The original owner was able to regain access to the region, but then the WoS dropped by and hawked the region.

This region is now the property of [B][i]The Warriors&#39; of[/i] [region]Solitude[/region][/B], a gameplay military for the region of [B][region]Audax[/region][/B].
