[i]Serpientes de Muerta[/i], The Snakes of the Dead, is a group of islands, coves and sunken ships where no Empire, Kingdom or Government dare traverse. The people rule themselves and no one tells anyone else what to do.

No one is judged by the size of their crew, their race, their color or their offensive might. What is important is how much you value your freedom and how much gold you can spend on the next barrel of rum!

We are the Serpents. Are you one too?
