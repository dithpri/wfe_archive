[hr][i]&amp;#10030;Welcome to [u][color=#FF2400][b]The Union of the Autonomists[/b][/color][/u] More Commonly Known as [color=#FF2400][u][b]Autonomia[/u][/b]&amp;#10030;[/i][/color]
[hr][color=#FF2400]&amp;#10030;[b][i][u]Autonomia[/i][/u] is a region made up nations that prioritize giving power exclusively to the revolutionary working classes of the world, whether it be from the Council Communists, Anarchists, Heterodox Marxists, and anything in between, we recognize the only way to achieve the Communist dream is not through party politics, commissars, and bureaucrats alike, but rather through the tools of refusal, class war, education, revolutionary spontaneity, common ownership, and any other tool that empowers the International Proletariat to dictate their own fate and develop their autonomy[/b] &amp;#10030;[/color][hr]
