The Continent of Abyssria is a land of Old States. And while, it could be considered Young compared to the ancients across the world. 

Theese Lands are full of history.

From ruins of nations such as Triare and New Alesund, to The Ancient mega Cities in Pandothra and WyntersVeil. There is much to see and much to do

So, I Welcome ALL. From Travellers and Tribes, to Merchants and Kings. I welcome All to the Abyssal Realms




&quot;A land where the realms denounced and forsaken stay. Hidden in the shadows we lie and pray. For now we wait, for now we stay, until we meet the light of day.&quot; - Ancient Poem of the Abyss
