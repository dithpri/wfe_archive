[b]THE COMINTERN[/b][hr]

The Communist International, abbreviated as Comintern, was an international communist organization founded in Moscow in March 1919. The International intended to fight &quot;by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State.&quot;

The Comintern, in the spirit of its real world predecessor, is a region which seeks to united all countries of NationStates in the struggle to create an international communist world order. We welcome all nations which share this vision and seek to deepen their understanding of communism.
