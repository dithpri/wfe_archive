[color=red]Welcome[/color]
to the George Bush region, a region that has interesting discussions, weekly polls and prides itself on a fair democracy where everyone has equal opportunities. We hope that the recent... unpleasantries which have occurred at Palmy Boys won&#39;t discourage you from considering our region as a fair, equal opportunities region where our leaders don&#39;t lie and cheat their people. We seek to better the great school of Palmerston North Boys High, we believe in the motto &quot;socks up, standards up&quot;.
