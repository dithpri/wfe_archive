[b]The [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy Reserve forces struck again, this time dropping anchor in the Temple of Tombs! With incredible stealth and speed, one could call this a rather cool-idge operation. If you&#39;d like to raise your sail alongside us, and plunder lost temples too, we&#39;d love to have you join the ERN.
