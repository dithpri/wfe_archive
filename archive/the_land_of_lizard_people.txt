[b][color=#006400] The Land of Lizard People has returned! Some losers started a fire while we were busy touching some grass. We&#39;re back now because they forgot what a governor is. It&#39;d be funny to publicly humiliate them, but it turned out the whole point of their operation was to leave their mark and advertise their pathetic region! So, all traces of them have been scrubbed. Just join [region]The Black Hawks[/region] if you want to raid because they&#39;re better in every way. Shoutout to [region]Artificial Solar System[/region].

passworded when the cool lizard dudes have testing or other important business and can&#39;t be online as much. 
if you raid us, we will retaliate. [/color] [/b]
