The Cornellian Empire once spanned the region, providing law and order. Following a great war over the succession to the Empire that divided it as different factions fought to control the succession, it collapsed into disunity. One-hundred and fifty years later, the old structures are gone, with some nations clinging to old traditions along with their independence while others have become entirely independent. There are those who would revive the Empire and those who would prevent it from reviving.
