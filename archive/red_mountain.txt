We regret to announce that your scheduled Aeazen Combine revival is, in 99% of all cases, false propaganda created and distributed purely because the nation proclaiming it has nothing better to do.

Should the 1% of cases occur and the Aeazen Combine actually returns, NationStates Administration has placed Aeazer and other ex Aeazen Combine members on Delete On Sight status. Should NationStates Administration fail to handle the matter, AVE Command will, with appropriate brutality.
