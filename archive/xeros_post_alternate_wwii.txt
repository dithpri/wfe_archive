After the defeat of the Allies in World War Two, many major nations involved decided to annex or overtake other nations and create new orders and re-organise their governments. This included Germany, The USSR, Japan, and Italy. Also, tight unions between heavily destroyed nations were made. These were the North American Union (US and Canada), the Allied European Citizen&amp;#39;s Union (Britain, France, Poland, and the Netherlands), and the Pacific Union (Australia, the Philippines and other Pacific and Indian Ocean islands.) This group is for those nations. Contact New Greater Germany or The New Russian Soviet Union by telegram if you are interested in joining.
