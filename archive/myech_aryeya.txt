A vibrant, beautiful region filled with happy, hard-working, moral men and women.  Each village and town elects a representative, based on merit (who is best-suited), who then elects a leader among them to head the council of representatives.  As it applies to each county within the region, it so applies to each state within Myech Aryeya, and thus the entire region as one whole.
