[color=#ED4719]This region was once a long-standing holding of [region]North Korea[/region]. However, on 3/7/25, dozens of Lamp Post puppets [i]([nation]Lamp Post XI[/nation] - [nation]Lamp Post XXXIX[/nation])[/i] belonging to a member of [region]The Red Fleet[/region] ceased to exist. This region was subsequently seized for the state along with many other regions.

Glorification of the horrific regime in North Korea will not be tolerated.[/color]
