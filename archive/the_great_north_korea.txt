[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]This region was once a long-standing holding of [region]North Korea[/region]. However, on 3/7/25, dozens of Lamp Post puppets [i]([nation]Lamp Post XI[/nation] - [nation]Lamp Post XXXIX[/nation])[/i] belonging to a member of [region]The Red Fleet[/region] ceased to exist. This region was subsequently seized for the empire along with many other regions.

Glorification of the horrific, and frankly reactionary, regime in North Korea will not be tolerated.[/color]
