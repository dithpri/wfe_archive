The isles of Kaklarain, are located in an ocean, somewhere or other, near old Darlexia. There are many landmasses, such as Darlexia, and Finvarr. There are many, many, many, other small Islands there, too many to list. All is well, besides all that is not well, and there is food too share. There is no &amp;quot;one leader&amp;quot; in the Isles of Kaklarain, and new laws are voted on, with votes coming from each citizen of each nation. Its short name/nickname is &amp;quot;the Isles&amp;quot;.If you would like to join the Isles of Kaklarain, send a telegram to New Darlexia.
