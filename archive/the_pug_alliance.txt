Is not an Alliance but a Holy Empire.

ROLES WE HAVE
God: Latinean Republic ruler. Can do anything he wants.

ROLES WE NEED
President: The president. He is in charge of border control and war. He can also make polls. The polls are not like voting. The polls just show the president what people think. He can still veto or accept laws from polls.
Vice-President: Can make polls. He is also in charge of  everything the President has except he can&#39;t make his executive decisions from the polls.
Council Member: Each member can control one of the things that officers get. They are lead by the Presidents. Like the government departments.

We do have voting polls and the god can appoint anyone to president, though he lets voting happen sometimes.
