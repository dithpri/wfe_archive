[b][color=1A51D7]WELCOME TO THE ANGLOSPHERE![/color][/b]

The Anglosphere is an alliance, of the principle Anglo, or Anglo-influenced nations. The Anglosphere generally includes:

[b]- The United Kingdom
- Ireland
- Canada
- Australia
- New Zealand
- The United States[/b]

Sometimes, [b]South Africa[/b] and [b]India[/b] are thrown in, depending on who you ask. Why an Anglosphere, you may ask? Well, it is quite obvious to see that these countries share common laws, a common language, a common culture, and are all very close military allies. So, Brits, Canucks, Aussies, Kiwis and Yankees, this is your place!

A continuation of [b]The Anglosphere[/b], which was first under nazi occupation, to eventually be under communist occupation. This region shall remain free! [i]God, King and Country![/i]
