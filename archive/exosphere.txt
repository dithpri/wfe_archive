The [b]ExoSphere[/b] is an area located deep inside the subspace, where (through natural quantum-tensor-effects) two otherwise completely isolated extra-dimensional Civilizations are able to get access to our space-time reality. Therefor the two Empires with access to the [b]ExoSphere[/b] are among the most remote and isolated Civilizations ever existed. 

There are some very limited contacts to the [region]SICON[/region]-Alliance and the [region]Ctan IsoSphere[/region].
