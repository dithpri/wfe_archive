The [b]ExoSphere[/b] is a remote, isolated region located deep inside the subspace. It is a small network of different subspace sanctuaries physically isolated from the universe. 

The [b]ExoSphere[/b] is a super-maximum-security sanctuary - artificially created by [b][nation=short+noflag]the Therians[/nation][/b] more than 150,000 years ago. Since that time the [b]Therians[/b] successfully maintained their peaceful isolation.

There are some limited contacts to the [region]Exo 01[/region]-Region.
