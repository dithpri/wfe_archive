The Keelde Reef islands are a massive Chain of Islands literally in the middle of nowhere where the bottom of the sea randomly rises from a deep drop off into a massive reef supports many small and gigantic islands. We here at Keelde have just about everything you could want but in a tiny dose so it isn&#39;t so chaotic and if we don&#39;t have it just ask and we can make it for you! If you decide this is the place for me just contact the Founder Daplia through Telegrams and they will give you the password!
