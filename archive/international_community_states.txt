Region Name: [region]International Community States[/region]

The International Community States is a sprawling archipelago located in a temperate zone, centered around the prominent and historically significant Cobra Island. The island chain was formed decades ago by a series of volcanic eruptions that reshaped the landscape and brought forth a diverse range of biomes, from lush tropical forests to barren volcanic plains. The region&#146;s natural beauty is as varied as its political systems.
