Polish Jew; Raphael Lemkin, in his work Axis Rule in Occupied Europe (1944), coined the term &amp;quot;genocide&amp;quot; by combining Greek genos (&amp;amp;#947;&amp;amp;#941;&amp;amp;#957;&amp;amp;#959;&amp;amp;#962;), &amp;quot;race, people&amp;quot; and Latin c&amp;amp;#299;dere &amp;quot;to kill&amp;quot;.
his work on defining genocide as a crime dates back to 1933, and it was prompted by the Simele massacre in Iraq
