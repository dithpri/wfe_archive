Welcome to Yamstan Invasioxz a region formerly owned by [nation]Yamstan[/nation] untill all his nations were deleted from him spamming and ban evading the United Federations. Shortly after Yamstan got deleted [nation]Voopmont[/nation] had an idea to raid the region to keep its important history to show what some of the region was like before we raided. Thanks to everyone who made this region stay alive.
