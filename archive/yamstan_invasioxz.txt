They were [nation]Yamstan[/nation], originally founded on October 12th, 2019, and [nation]Yamstan ultima[/nation]. Yamstan&#39;s spamming was directed at [region]The United Federations[/region] (TUF) but Yamstan also spammed with other alternate nations pretending not to be themselves in [region]Urana Firma[/region] and [region]The Nouveu Coryan Corporation[/region].

Though Yamstan and all his nations were promptly banned after intervention by the Holy NationStates Moderators, their region&#151;Yamstan Invasioxz&#151;was salvaged by people from TUF, including [nation]Voopmont[/nation] and [nation]Free Neuferialis[/nation]. This region now aims to act as a museum to the history of Yamstan, TUF, and everyone else involved in this drama.
