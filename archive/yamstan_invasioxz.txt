Yamstan Invasioxz was reincarnated into a more internationally friendly region at 12:00 PM on Saturday, November ninth, 2019. Only half a day after all [nation]Yamstan[/nation] puppet nations ceased to exist, it was &quot;raided&quot; by members of [region]The United Federations[/region], as they were the main target of mass spam by [nation]Yamstan[/nation]. These raiders include [nation]Voopmont[/nation], [nation]The Dragunrenifogon Empire[/nation] and [nation]Free Neuferialis[/nation].

Thank you to [nation]Voopmont[/nation] for coordinating the operation, [nation]The Dragunrenifogon Empire[/nation] and [nation]Free Neuferialis[/nation] for endorsing Voopmont and helping out, [nation]Gyelidor Colony[/nation] and [nation]Imperial YEET Empire[/nation] for assisting and [nation]Yamstan Historian[/nation] for overseeing the region.

co-written by [nation=noflag]Voopmont[/nation] and [nation=noflag]Imperial YEET Empire[/nation]
