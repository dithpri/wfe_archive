We&#39;re all a bunch of weirdos wearing war paint who take glee out of being very strange rulers. Basically a laid back community where you can roleplay as your nation or just be comeplete nutcases.
Not many rules, just no sexual roleplays or godmodding unless you&#39;re having a silly roleplay that isn&#39;t supposed to make any sense, in which you better let the other people know first!
