A wise person once said that I have to many alts for everything (other people have more, but I simply don&#146;t feel like using an auto alt thing) but [nation]wubdich[/nation] isn&#146;t cool, he&#146;s pragmatic and big brain, but not cool. You know who is cool? Someone like [nation]Animu Place[/nation]. That&#146;s a cool nation for cool people. So I&#146;m gonna say Animu place said it and see what happens.

Also I need an alt dump so...
