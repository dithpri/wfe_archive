This is a haven for those who have realized the way this universe works, for it spins only around itself, not around another universe. A haven for those who promote greed, selfishness and illegitimacy; a haven for survivalists and opportunists alike; that is Self. A haven for the flower inside one&amp;#39;s self to bloom. 

Self is based off Max Stirner&amp;#39;s Union of egoists, which was never originally founded until now. Egoists and the like are very welcome here. We see the fusion of civil liberties, laissez-faire economics and democracy to be the perfect transition stage for the state to fade out, leaving an egoist autarchy in its place.
