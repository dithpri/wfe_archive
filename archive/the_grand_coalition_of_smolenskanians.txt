This region is a group of nations under the dominion of Super Jewland, a prosperous nation which established dominance through colonization and complex one-sided alliance systems, eventually actually benefiting her subjects. Now all nations in the Grand Coalition coexist and aim to help one another, but still answer to the head nation of Super Jewland. The climates and political systems are vastly different from nation to nation, but the one thing binding these nations together is the leadership of Super Jewland.
