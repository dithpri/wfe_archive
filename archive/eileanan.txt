Eileanan is a region in the Pacific Ocean, consisting of many undiscovered islands.

In this archipelago, people have come to live here to minimize their impact on nature and be far away from conflicts created by other societies.

Together we live here in peace and prosper, becoming one with nature while also advancing our scientific knowledge.
