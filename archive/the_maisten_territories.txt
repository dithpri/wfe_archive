The Maisten Territories are a cluster of islands and a continent, along with underground cave system, near the equator. It is run exclusively by the Maisten Conglomerate, made of Dravtomil, Veny, and Trothlocham. The Conglomerate was founded by a treaty made between the nations after the 73-year-long &quot;Besk&#39;r-Taan&quot; (&quot;Grand War&quot; in Dravtomilian).
