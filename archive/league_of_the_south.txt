The League of the South 
After Dalton the Great was banned from the gulag he the supreme leader founded the league of the south. Dalton and his army of Rejects as the gulag likes to refer to them will not sleep until the day that Grant and his stuck up, bitch boy friends pay. 
 The League of the South stands for those who can not stand for themselves, we will fight for those who are oppressed, and we will fight evil til it is purged from the earth.
  We have to defend our proud heritage, because our rights are being infringed upon by the government. It is time we take a stand and fight for our freedom.
