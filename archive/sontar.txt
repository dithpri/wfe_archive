[spoiler=What is Raiding?]
[i]Raiding is how warfare is engaged in the NationStates world. Raiding is done by moving nations - known as &quot;puppets&quot; - into an enemy region, called a &quot;target&quot;. Once in the enemy region, all the puppets endorse one nation, called the &quot;Imp.&quot;. If the Imp. has the most endorsements at update - the time the game processes issues - then the Imp. becomes region&#39;s delegate, and the target is annexed by Sonar.[/i][/spoiler]
