[spoiler=What is Raiding?]
[i]Raiding is how warfare is engaged in the NationStates world. Raiding is done by moving nations (puppets) into an enemy region (target). Once in the enemy region, all the puppets endorse one nation (point). If the point has the most endorsements at update the game processes it, then the point becomes region&#39;s delegate, and the target is annexed by Sonar.[/i][/spoiler]
