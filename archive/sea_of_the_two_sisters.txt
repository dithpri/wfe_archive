Created when twin sisters Jomiru and Urimoj decided that they wanted to rule a nation. With the help of their father&#39;s money, the sisters founded their own nations and this region. Anyone is welcomed to join the region, especially if that nation is more laid-back. There is no pressure to do anything, but no one&#39;s stopping you from doing things either. There are no requirements to joining. That is all.
