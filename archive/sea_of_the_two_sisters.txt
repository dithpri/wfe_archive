Created when twin sisters Jomiru and Urimoj decided that they wanted to rule a nation. With the help of their father&#39;s money, the sisters founded their own nations and this region. Anyone is welcomed to join the region, especially if that nation is more laid-back. There is no pressure to do anything, but no one&#39;s stopping you from doing things either. There are no requirements to joining. Anyone is open to voting in the very serious polls without having to be apart of this region. That is all.
