If you are on Nationstates right now when you should be doing something else, say an assignment, an important paper or even some chores, this is the region for you.
We are anti-raiding, so it&amp;#39;s password protected. Send me a telegraph and I&amp;#39;ll wire you the password to the region.
In the mean time, I would tell you to stop procrastinating, but since I&amp;#39;m probably doing that very thing right now that would be exceptionally hypocritical of me.
