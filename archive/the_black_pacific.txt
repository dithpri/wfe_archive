Greetings, and Welcome to [b]The Black Pacific[/b].
[i]We are a special Region, and we will preserve our right in the shadowy depths of the Pacific.[/i]
Rejected and Refounded Nations are welcome, as well with any other nation!

Our Regional Currency is currently the [b]Savioric Dollar[/b]. Consider adopting it, we will sometimes hold polls on new regional currencies.

Once we reach 50 nations, I&#39;ll be holding a poll for our regional animal.

The World Factbook shall be amended over time. Thank you for reading.

To those &quot;Druador&quot; raiders that think they can hold us down. Try again ;)
