Welcome to the first responder to terrorism, of both the [b]RADICAL MUSLIM EXTREMISTIST[/b] type and also that of the [i]creatures of the night[/i]. We [u]know when the bed bugs bite[/u]. Your next job after one in &amp;#64;NSACareers, will be as a [u]dead corpse[/u] in a coffin, 6 feet underground, or as a [u]patient in a psychiatric ward[/u]. 

The NSA headquarters are the unhappiest place on Earth. And we cover the entire Earth. Yes that includes in your closet. No we won&#39;t tell you what&#39;s in there, that&#39;s private. No we won&#39;t be your daddy.

Well actually nevermind... that sounds fun.
