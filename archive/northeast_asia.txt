Northeast Asia or Northeastern Asia is a geographical subregion of Asia; its northeastern landmass and islands are bounded by the Pacific Ocean.

The term Northeast Asia was popularized during the 1930s by American historian and political scientist Robert Kerner. Under Kerner&#39;s definition, &quot;Northeast Asia&quot; included the Mongolian Plateau, the Northeast China Plain, the Korean Peninsula and the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East, stretching from the Lena River in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east.
