Welcome back. The scoundrel attack from the Black Hawks is over. Victory is ours. We are now a Defender region.

North of the Hortfallian Mountains and south of the Territh Sea, there lies a small region tucked away. This is North Hortfallia. Will you create chaos or peace, are you liberal or authoritarian, will there be conflict and death? That will all be decided here, in the United Nations of North Hortfallia.
