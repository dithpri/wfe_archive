Cowabungonia is a group of large, strangely shaped islands located in the Lostat Sea near Terra Australis Incognita. It has a freaky weather system resulting in a wide range of climates and landscapes. Much of the land is unclaimed territory, home to pirates, ninja&amp;#39;s and anarchist surfer dudes, all living and fighting in peace. Ones in a while a country will pop up, enforcing its own laws on its own little (or big) piece of the pie. This is no problem to any of the previous inhabitants. In fact, they enjoy the diversity, and the chance to find a job as privateer, special agent or slightly less anarchist professional surfer dude. The common regional greeting can be guessed.
