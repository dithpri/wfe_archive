Millenia ago, a group of brave seafarers traveled south, eventually reaching a group of fertile, pleasant islands. These were the first settlers of Denicia. Denicia soon became a melting pot of different cultures, as millions immigrated from all around the world to settle here. The very first nation to be established was Sakurina, famed for its great weather and environmental beauty. Then, in 1256 AD, in a mass exodus, millions fled from the north, looking for a place without persecution. This became what is now Neim. In a civil war in Sakurina, Fred the Chicken was founded. These 3 nations became allies, and work together towards prosperity for their region.
