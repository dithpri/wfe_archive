   A league of socialist republics that strive for earthly equality, democracy, and prosperity. It&amp;#39;s nation&amp;#39;s believe socialism is the best way to do this, and to root out the corruption that a communist or socialist government sometimes leads to, ejects nations whom have an oppressive or non-democratic leader. Also accepts highly liberal capitalist nations, as long as they support their people through welfare, public hospitals, education and general public facilities.
