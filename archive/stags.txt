I don&#39;t know who you are. I don&#39;t know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don&#39;t have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of stats; stats I have acquired over a very long or very short career. Stats that make me valuable for people like you. If you don&#39;t join now, that&#39;ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you join, I will look at you, I will accept you, and I will support you.
