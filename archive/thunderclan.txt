[color=lightgreen][b]Welcome to ThunderClan![/color]

Named after the great clan of Warrior Cats fame, we are a small region looking to grow. We accept people of all cultures, races, and opinions (except for raiders and fascists). We are still small, so anyone can have a say in government. It would help out a lot if you joined or at least sent a puppet![/b]
