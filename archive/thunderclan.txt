Welcome to ThunderClan!
[hr]
[color=orange]This is ThunderClan. Nothing can stand up to a storm, even the mightiest trees bow under it&#39;s unbeatable wrath. All cats tremble before it. Lightning banishes shadow, Dark clouds swallow the wind and rain makes the smallest of rivers seek revenge. We will not back down. Any warrior that dares to cross our path will be destroyed. You have been warned.[/color]
