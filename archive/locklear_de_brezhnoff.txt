Welcome to Locklear de Brezhnoff! We are a respectful, peaceful region with a healthy respect for the natural world. While we like to maintain peaceful relations with all, we will go to war if such action is necessary to protect our people. 

Peoples of all ideologies, philosophies and species are welcome in this region, but we will not tolerate war-mongering, deliberate excessive environmental disturbance or violent acts of hate.

While it is by no means a requirement, it would be greatly appreciated if member nations paid a small acknowledgement to the region by adding the pentagon/lightning-bolt insignia to their flag. See Dragoste and Slavsia for examples.

Welcome, friends, and stay a while!
