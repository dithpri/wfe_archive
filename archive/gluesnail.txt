This world-wide region is made up of only the finest dictatorships and capitalist countries. Where beheading is the mildest form of punishment, our thriving region is on the verge of uranium discovery and industry. We can assure you that this uranium will only be used for medical research purposes (*laughs*) only. The Gluesnail Region has a strong alliance with the North African Republic of Wadiya. Not to worry though; the always faithful Region of Gluesnail has a very &amp;quot; Aladeen&amp;quot; relationship with your country.
