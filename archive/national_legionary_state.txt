[b] &#147;By our audacious act, we break from the dominant mentality of this century and of the world. We kill in ourselves a world in order to build another, a higher one reaching to the heavens. 

The absolute sovereignty of money is broken to be replaced by the power of the spirit and of moral values. We do not deny
and will not deny the role and necessity of the material in the world, but we do deny and always will its right to preeminence.&#148; [/b]
