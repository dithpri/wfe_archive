The name &amp;quot;Eutopia&amp;quot; comes from the Greek for &amp;quot;good land&amp;quot;. It is a large island at an unspecified location in the North Atlantic, that was discovered and then forgotten by the Phoenicians, Arabs, Vikings, Spanish, French, and English, and as such may have been behind some of the legends about Atlantis.

The leaders of the nations in Eutopia enjoy playing strategy games by Paradox Interactive, such as Europa Universalis 3. Others are welcome who display suitable decorum.
