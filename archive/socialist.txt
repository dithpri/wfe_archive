[b][color=darkred]Welcome to Socialist![/b] We keep The Red Flag flying here, forever [region=Antifa]![/color]

[color=red][i]The people&amp;#39;s flag is deepest red,
It shrouded oft our martyred dead,
And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold,
Their hearts&amp;#39; blood dyed its every fold.

Then raise the scarlet standard high.
Within its shade we live and die,
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,
We&amp;#39;ll keep the red flag flying here.[/i][/color][hr][b][region=In The Flesh]: [i][color=purple]This is what happens When an Unstoppable Force meets an Immovable Object.[/color][/i][/b]
