Founded in the middle of the ocean in the mid 1980s by some people with nothing but a boat and a dream, The West Atlantic Organization (WAO) has since grown to include hundreds of other boats, some brought legally and some not-so-legally. Most of the older ships have been anchored and modified to the point where they are essentially just floating platforms, making the WAO into a thriving and stable community.

The WAO is governed by the West Atlantic Assembly, which ostensibly upholds the tenets of democracy in the region. Any WAO member may submit a proposal to the WAA, although the order of the voting queue is left to the discretion of the WA delegate and the founder.
