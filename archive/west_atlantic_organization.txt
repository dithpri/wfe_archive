Founded in the middle of the ocean in the mid 1980s by some people with nothing but a boat and a dream, The West Atlantic Organization (WAO) has since grown to include hundreds of other boats, some brought legally and some not-so-legally. Most of the older ships have been anchored and modified to the point where they are essentially just floating platforms, making the WAO into a thriving and stable community.
