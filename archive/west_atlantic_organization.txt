Founded in the middle of the ocean by some drunk guys on a boat sometime in the 1980s (no one is sure of the exact date), The West Atlantic Organization (WAO) has since grown to include hundreds of other boats, some brought legally and some stolen. Most of the older ships have been anchored and modified to the point where they are essentially just floating platforms, making WAO into a thriving and stable fishing community.
