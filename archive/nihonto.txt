After being open for over two years, I have unfortunately decided to close Nihonto. We have had great memories, but seeing how dormant this region has become, I may as well close it down. For the the existing residents, I highly recommend that you move to [region]Aenaroth[/region]. It is an active region founded by [nation]Red Dusk III[/nation].

Thanks for all of the fun memories!
