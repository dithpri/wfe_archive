The Eastern Territories are home to the core lands of Cephoroth. It had once been the jewel of a gargantuan empire that spanned the continent, who&#39;s leadership was both free and fair. In recent years, the highly centralized government fell pray to its own expanse, and dozens of civil wars have left the continent in tatters as various political and militant groups fight to see their culture restored to power in their original regions of growth. It is here in the Eastern quarter that the original government still sits within the borders of the prosperous Aurum Libertatum. Here, long time loyalists and unlikely allies bide their time, waiting for an opportunity to bring new laws to the ancient confines of a long since past empire.
