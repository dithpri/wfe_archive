The Holy Roman Empire, also known as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation after 1512, was a polity in Central and Western Europe, usually headed by the Holy Roman Emperor. It developed in the Early Middle Ages (beginning in either 800 or 924), and lasted for a millennium until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars. Initially, it comprised three constituent kingdoms&#151;Germany, Italy, and, from 1032, Burgundy&#151;held together by the emperor&#39;s overlordship. By the 15th century, imperial governance became concentrated in the Kingdom of Germany, as the empire&#39;s effective control over Italy and Burgundy had largely disappeared.
