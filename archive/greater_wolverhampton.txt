Greater Wolverhampton is a region not quite in areas considered Wolverhampton and governed by the eternal, grand master and noble dictator Phil Philand III of New Philand.

Only nations abiding to the rules of the lost texts of the not as eternal, master chef and awful dictator Phil Philand II of New Philand may join this mighty region.
