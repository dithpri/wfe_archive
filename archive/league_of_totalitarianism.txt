[b]LEAGUE OF TOTALITARIANISM[/b]
With a new world order emerging, favoring the collective struggle rather than the individual struggle. We believe that the government is the solution to all earthly problems and that the people must give their total allegiance and unquestioning loyalty to the leaders of their nation. The League of Totalitarianism is prepared to continue this fight against the failing democratically-governed nations.

Those that dare question the hand that feeds them will starve themselves.
