[b][color=darkred]Free[/color] [color=darkblue]Nations[/color][/b] is a new region to be officially founded in 2016.

The [b][color=darkblue]Free[/color] [color=darkred]Nations[/color][/b] will be a group of like minded nations seeking to spread the influence of liberty and justice. [b][color=darkred]Free[/color] [color=darkblue]Nations[/color][/b] will support democracy, limited government, individual freedoms, free markets, defenderism, national sovereignty, and justice for all.

Please send all questions to [nation=short]FreeNations[/nation]. Be patient with responses, I&#39;m an old NationStates player who is not very active at the moment.
