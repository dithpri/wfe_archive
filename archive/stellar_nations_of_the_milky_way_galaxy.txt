Hello! This is kind&amp;#39;ve a region just for me, and a timeline I might write when I&amp;#39;m older that will takes place 2058-700,000 AD, and describes humanity&amp;#39;s path from a hypothetical WWIII to a dominant power in the galaxy. But this won&amp;#39;t be too detailed...we&amp;#39;ll, not yet anyway.
