[b]Our Essential Manifesto:[/b]
[i]In in order to promote peace, unity, and the advancement of mankind, we have joined together as equal governments which value our own religious traditions, beliefs, and laws. To view any nation as lesser than another on the basis of their beliefs is the worst of crimes and hinders the advancement of the values we wish to promote.[/i]

All nations are strongly encouraged to join the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url] and remain active. Inactive nations or those who seek no WA involvement may be [color=red]kicked[/color] from the region.
