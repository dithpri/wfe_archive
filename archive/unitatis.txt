Unitatis is a recently formed region, with only a few members. We are looking to expand and become a much larger region. To do this, we need you to help. First, talk to all your friends and convince them to join! This will help our region grow and prosper. With as small a region as ours as well, if you show good performance, there is a chance you will get some kind of leadership position. Second, if you aren&#39;t already signed up for the World Assembly (WA), please do so. Once you have done that, please endorse [nation]Cavalieri Notturni[/nation], as they are our current WA Delegate. Third, make sure to have fun, and do not be a jerk.
