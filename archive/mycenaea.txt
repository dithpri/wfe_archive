[region]Minoa[/region] and [region]Mycenaea[/region], like [i]ying and yang[/i], are two independent and unaligned transcontinental regions with competing visions.

They are named after the Greek civilisations that existed in the Bronze Age: both regions compete to be abundant with culture, sea life, technology, forests and birds (yes, everyone loves BIRDS).
