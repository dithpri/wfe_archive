This region is a response to the indignity suffered by Iranian Muslims in the World today, the absence of a genuine Shia region for Iran, and the negligence towards the lessons of the Imam Khomeini and his Islamic Revolution.

Islam can be the one true liberator from oppressive colonialism and capitalism. Martyrdom against injustice is part of Shia Islam. Muslims require guardianship in the form of supervision by the leading Islamic jurists. Such rule is necessary, as it would protect Islam from deviation from traditional sharia law, and in so doing eliminate poverty and the plundering of Muslim lands by foreign infidels.
