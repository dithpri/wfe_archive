Welcome to InGen! I am Jonathan Alfred Hammond also known as John Hammond or Dr. Hammond. I created InGen to follow my dreams! My dream was a seemingly impossible one but thanks to my wonderful Head Genetics Scientist Dr. Henry Wu and my Leading Paleontologist Dr. Laura Sorkin I made my dream... Dinosaurs that&#39;s right a real life dinosaur not Animatronics or animations but actual living and breathing dinosaurs and I will soon open a Park called Jurassic Park so thank you for reading about my company.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Alfred Hammond
