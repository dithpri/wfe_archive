The Federation of Independent Nations (or FIN) is a Federation of Anti-WA or Ex-WA Nations who choose to believe in the FIN Parliament rather than the bureaucratic corruption of the WA. 

FIN believe that the WA has become too infested with Admins, Existing Legislation and Hollow Proposals to actually govern over 18,000 nations. The Federation demand the right to recede and prevent the WA from corrupting further. Membership lf FIN&#39;s governing body, the Federation Parliament, is actually voluntary, as opposed to the WA, but its Legislation is actually enforced.
