Eumaglia is a fictional world on a fictional Earth analogue whose earliest origins date to July, 2016. This region serves as a focal point for those involved in the project, whether they are simply storing their nation-states accounts here or engaging in lore development.

Eumaglia is not open to applications at this time, and I do not have plans to do so in the future.
