[b]Our Regional Anthem!:[/b]
O Kanada!
Our home and smoking land!
True patriot love in all thy joints command.
With glowing bowls we see red eyes,
The True North strong with weed!
From far and wide,
O Kanada, we stand on guard for thee.
God keep our land glorious with weed!
O Kanada, we stand on guard for thee.
O Kanada, we stand on guard for weed.
