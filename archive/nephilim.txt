[i]Nephilim[/i] is a region for any nation affiliated with national governments involved with [b]Imperialism[/b], [b]Dictatorship[/b], [b]Fascism[/b], [b]Socialism[/b], and [b]Monarchy[/b]. We will intervene in national wars for the betterment of our political and domination-based agenda. We do have a constitution describing any nations political and independent rights. If you are not with us then by Definition you are against us. We are generally a Totalitarian regime. Trade is regulated, all nations are obligated to fulfill the councils, and the Emperor&amp;#39;s orders.
