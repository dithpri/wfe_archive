The Lost Domain is a realm that exists between the Corporeal Domain (i.e. &quot;Earth&quot;) and the Umbral Domain, a dimension of darkness where nothing exists.

These nations exist within this expansive domain, and they all must live with one another despite being radically different from one another in terms of landscape, inhabitants, and governing styles.

Currently, the Lost Domain is looked after by the Lux Consilium, a high order of beings who see themselves as superior to all other governing bodies.
