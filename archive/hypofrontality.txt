Transient Hypofrontality?

[b]Welcome to Hypofrontality - Named after our naturally good friend Transient Hypofrontality[/b]

Here at Hypofrontality, we are trying to experiment with tonnes of different concepts- all relating to the lines of trying to be as human as possible, whilst also exploring the nature and possibilties that the forefront 4th industrial revolution will bring, such as EQ reliance or appreciation.

Feel free to experiment, and If you come up with interesting ideas or concepts please share. For this is as much about real politics/living as it may be internally
