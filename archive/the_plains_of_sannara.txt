Thousands managed to escape, including the royalty. The survivors managed to find new land and settled in a place they called Sannara, meaning free land.

The people naturally broke off and separated into groups, and eventually managed to form small city-states and were able to trade amongst themselves. Over time, the people of Sannara realized they had to create a strong society where they could all have the opportunity to thrive, as they once did in the past. The city states decided to unite and to re-create what they had once had in the past. The people then adopted the name: The Allied States of Sannara and founded their slogan &#147;Ability is nothing without opportunity. Unite and lead&#148;
