The National North American Defense Treaty is a roleplay military alliance for countries that are in North America (duh)

After World War three, or the last war as it was dubbed in Eagle Pass Schools, The United States, Mexico, and Canada could not survive on their own. As a result, parts of their country started to break away. Some of them made the NNADT to protect from European powers who try to invade the much smaller countries in the western hemisphere.
