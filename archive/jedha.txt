[b][color=orange]The historical and spiritual significance of Jedha led the moon to become a world of worship for those who believed in the Force, and a holy site for pilgrims who sought spiritual guidance.

Sometime before the Battle of Yavin, the Galactic Empire occupied the moon to control its kyber crystal resources that were once used by the Jedi Order as components for their lightsabers. The occupation later provoked an insurgency to oppose the Imperial tyranny, coordinated by the rebel extremist Saw Gerrera.

Jedha&#39;s heritage and Gerrera&#39;s resistance led to it being chosen in 0 BBY for the first test of the Death Star&#39;s superlaser, a superweapon capable of destroying entire planets.[/b][/color]
