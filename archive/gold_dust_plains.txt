You step off of the train onto an old, oak platform. In front of you is a red sunset over rolling plains, in the only part of the world where the grass is golden naturally, blowing in the winds. To the west is a dirt road, lined by oak saplings. A Ford Model T pulls up, and your chauffeur exits and calls for you. After an hour, in the distance you see a massive building, resembling a gothic castle. On the metal sign, it says &quot;Gold-Dust Plains.&quot; As you exit, you are led to a large room with a massive bed covered in expensive fabrics. A wine bottoe, saying &quot;Gold-Dust Vinyards, Chardonnay, 1978&quot; is set upon a table by your bed with multiple glasses. You go to prepare for business tomorrow, and to go sleeo as you hear a wolf howl far away.
