[b]Another Fash region blown out of the water by [u][color=red]THE RED FLEET![/color][/u]

This region was founded by [nation=Nordic Saxony], founder of [region]Axis Nations Alliance[/region], after he returned following the occupation of ANA by ANTIFA troops for over a month - so naturally upon his return he created a [i]new[/i] region that lasted just three short months before [color=red]The Nautical Brothers and Sisters of The Red Fleet[/color] steamed in, under whose capable guardianship this region will remain.
