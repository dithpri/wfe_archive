Diplomacy International is a relaxed region that accepts all types of nations, from Anarchies to Theocracies, to Corporate Dictatorships. 

The region, however, is run democratically. Anyone is allowed to make a suggestion which will then be voted upon if necessary. Diplomacy is the number one concern, so feel free to speak your mind!

Newcomers wishing to hold a [b]spot on the map[/b] should notify the founder. You may request as much or as little territory as you like, WITHIN REASON. 

The founder is also happy to make [b]national flags[/b] for anyone who wants one. Just ask!

Have a nice day and be awesome to each other!
