A collection of lovely nations, where bunnies roam, and old people bake cupcakes, girl scouts sell chocolate door to door and everyone greets each other with a &amp;#39;wink and a giggle&amp;#39;. Economic stablility is a must and David McWilliams gospel is the foundation of all knowledge. Flowers could almost be a form of currency, this region is so pleasant, but the Yoke does us just fine. Robust Political Freedoms and strong Civil Rights are pillars of Lovely Nations society. The regional anthem &amp;#39;Electric Avenue&amp;#39; by Eddy Grant rings out on official meetings of government. Bicycles.
