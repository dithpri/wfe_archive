[color=green][b]WELCOME TO THE PARTY ![/b][/color]

We are a region with a proud democratic tradition. [i]Ally and vassal of Liberty.[/i] [color=red]we welcome all countries who seek a peaceful home region[/color] By coming here you will be entitled to speak your mind.

We are also all about peace, love, and understanding. We let the people decide what they think the best coats of action is, and have no armed forces. Our security system is top notch, though. The only drugs allowed are black drugs (coffee), as you don&amp;#39;t need them to have a good time. Parties are fun.
