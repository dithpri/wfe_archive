Spanning Multiple Star-Systems, this region relies on teleportation to stay connected. Due to the high altitude, and Technology-based life, individuals in this region excel in all things technological, and permanently keep in mind &amp;quot;the Big Picture&amp;quot;. This arises from the unadulterated view of the vast expanses of space, the minescule appearance of the planets below them, a constant reminder of the insignificance of their personal goal, even lives. This keeps every individual working together; not necessarily towards the &amp;quot;common good&amp;quot;, but towards an environment and status that will be acceptable for all as an indestructible foundation upon which to base the future.
