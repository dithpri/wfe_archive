you wake up... you are at a big hill napping on the side... its dark, and cold, and rainy. you have a jacket on though... its not dark and cold and rainy in a scary way. it feels oddly peaceful...
suddenly, you hear a dog barking loudly followed by hissing and  angry meowing.
welcome to the house cat region!
