[B]Welcome to The [region]Crystal Empire[/region]![/B]

We&#39;re a small, developing region for those who enjoy pastel coloured ponies and are always welcoming of new friends. You&#39;re free to roleplay or talk about anything you really want, provided you keep it civil.

Nations are strongly encouraged to join the WA and decide amongst themselves who is to be the Delegate, the only thing I ask is that any vote a Delegate takes is a consensus vote from the region, as the Delegate is voting on our behalf.

Thank you,
[nation]Imperious Crystalis[/nation]
