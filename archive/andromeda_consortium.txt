[b][color=darkblue]Welcome to Andromeda![/color]

Administered by the ASU, the galaxy hosts a plethora of independent nations living peacefully amongst one another. Each nation cooperates with each other to create a better galaxy for all. There is the occasional conflict, but not much happens that would otherwise jeopardize the unity within Andromeda. The ASU and its allies negotiate with the UGFLSPN and its allies in the Milky Way to create a stronger intergalactic bond. Feel free to traipse through and socialize.
