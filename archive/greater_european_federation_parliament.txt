We the former members states of the Greater European Federation herby declare that this Parliament is now in exile for the near perceivable future. We herby thus declare that [nation=Greater European Federation President]&amp;#39;s actions are thus unconstitutional. Therefore the establishment of [region=Iron Europe] by the [nation=Greater European Federation President] was unconstitutional. This government is the legitimate government of the Greater European Federation, and thus we ask that all members who have withdrawn from the GEF main region return there represenatives to this region.
