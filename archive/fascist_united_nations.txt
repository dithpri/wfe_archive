[i]Get these damn fascists off my lawn![/i]

Region raided by Kophee23 on May 24th, 2023. We say &quot;raided&quot; when the kids didn&#39;t even have enough brainpower to put up a fight before we could join the WA. That said, they basically surrendered after we just suppressed them; easiest raid of our lives.

[color=darkorange]Subsidiary of [region]OrangeJuice[/region]. We&#39;re not exactly a raider region, but fascists aren&#39;t our jam. Don&#39;t be fascist, kids.[/color]

If you want to check out the nations who started this region, they&#39;re over in [region]the Capitalist Socialist Paradise[/region]. (They&#39;re good now. I don&#39;t know what happened, but as long as you&#39;re tagged anti-fascist, I guess.) Otherwise, come over to [region]OrangeJuice[/region]! We&#39;re a small community looking to grow its members, and we&#39;d love to meet you!
