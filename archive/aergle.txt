Aergl&egrave; is a world lost in a sea of stars. The Realm of [nation]Dhammarat[/nation], once a vast and mighty empire, is located in Arbrea&#39;s northwestern corner. The empire ruled many lands and peoples, achieving enormous power and unprecedented wealth. In the end, though, its rulers attained high levels of greed and knowledge, but not enough wisdom. The War of the Dhammaratian Succession ravaged the lands, only culminated by [i]Dhaula Varlauve[/i], the Great and Ultimate Devastation, which toppled everything and everyone.

After the apocalypse, Dhammarat and the rest of Aergl&egrave; found peace, but the price was too high: a devastated land and an almost empty country where people fight to thrive again.
