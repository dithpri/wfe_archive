[region]The Kingdom of Eladar[/region] is a peaceful alliance, based on the values of compassion, shared prosperity, honour and the freedom to flourish. It is especially welcoming to [color=red]Communist[/color] states. Many [color=black]anarchist[/color] and [color=red]socialist[/color] states can also find their home here. Other ideologies may also apply, just leave a message before doing so, we aren&#39;t too strict :)
