They couldn&#146;t find common ground on the age old debate: [color=blue]Cats vs Dogs.[/color] Half of the Hawks promptly pointed towards [color=purple]Dogs&#146; unwavering loyalty[/color], while the remainder rebuked in favor of [color=lightblue]Cats&#146; overbearing meme-ability.[/color] The Debate grew so large that some of the hawks flew into this region to proclaim once and for all: [color=purple]DOGS[/color] are superior.
