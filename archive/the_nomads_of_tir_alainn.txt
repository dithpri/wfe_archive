This remote mountainous region is home to both Fae and Humans. Witches have tend the Old Places for generations, keeping the magic alive and the land lush and fertile. Yet the faery nobility, neither trust nor mingle willingly with humankind, except for the occasional caprice. 

Yet the future of the Fae depend upon the nobles&amp;#39; willingness to change their elitist ways as the Nations and Peoples move into a technology heavy future. Where the fortunes of the Land play a backseat to the hunger for the modern technology.
