This is a lovely place where you can basically do what ever you want. You can do whatever you want when you feel like it. This is a free region to all including outsiders. We have beautiful wildlife where the deer run wild and coons get in your trash. You might get mad at them but if you capture it in a live trap you may transport it to another place.

We have a beautiful beach right beside the Pacific Ocean. But if you are caught littering you will be kicked out of the region
