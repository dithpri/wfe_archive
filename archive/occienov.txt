All people are welcome so long as they&#39;re able to be respectful. Play your country however you want, so long as you, [i]yourself[/i], are respectful when interacting with other people, or when out of character. That said, if your country acts like a dick, you&#39;re liable to get war waged on you. 
Magic and other fictional devices are allowed.
