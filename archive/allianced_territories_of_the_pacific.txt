The Allianced Territories of the Pacific or the ATP is a region for those who want to break free of massive regions that don&#39;t give everyone a say and don&#39;t listen to the smaller countries. Here in the ATP everyone is treated equally and everyone is listened to. We believe in civil rights and democracy but will support you no matter what you believe. Finally, thanks for reading this entry and I hope you join our region.
