Hello and welcome to Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is without a doubt, the Holiest City on Earth. From the Jews arrival brought by God after Moses parted the Red Sea and their exile in the desert, to Jesus&#39; triumphant entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, to His crucifixion just outside of its walls at Golgotha, Jerusalem is a city with great reverence amongst all Abrahamic religions.

All are welcome to Jerusalem.
