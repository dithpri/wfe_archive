Alternate History is a type of Speculative Fiction (often called &quot;Uchronia&quot; or &quot;Anachronism&quot;) set in a world where one or more historical events unfolded differently than they did in the real world. Often set some time after the event (called a &quot;point of divergence&quot;, or PoD, by fans of the genre), such stories typically describe a Present Day world vastly changed by the difference, or follow another major historical event in light of the change.
