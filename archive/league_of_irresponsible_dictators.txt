Nations once at war with each other for hundreds of years, their nations starved and burnings, the leaders finally agreed to meet for peace at a summit. Some of the most powerful and feared men ever to exist, all in one place. After months of talking, a decision was almost agreed upon. That was until an argument was started, a gun as drawn, and a shot was fired. Then another, and another, and a hundred more. When the dust was finally settled, it was clear what needed to be done. The nations came together and their new leaders created a treaty. No longer would they fight each other, The League of Irresponsible Dictators was created, and may all who stand in their way fall.
