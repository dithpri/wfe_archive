The Under-Empire of Skavendom stretches from one end of the Old World to the next. Its borders are not defined in the same sense as those on the surface. The fact that the Skaven have been sighted in places as far away as Araby and Cathay indicates they are a widely-traveled race. Skaven do not willingly travel under the open sky. Instead, they use a variety of underground avenues when moving great distances. These passageways have been millennia in the making, and the most widely-used have felt the pitter-patter of billions of Skaven feet over the centuries. As with any surface city, the size of a Skaven settlement depends on the amount and types of resources available.
