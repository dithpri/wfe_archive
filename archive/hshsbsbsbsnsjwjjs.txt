We are a growing region with a small number of members. All WA members, please endorse our delegate. Being delegate is a high honor and is always changing based on what the region citizens decide. If you would like to learn about how to get involved in the regional government, telegram me. Just a note, regional government have authority, but I am kinda a autocrat so I call the final shots.

We Generally Accept Embassy Requests, So Any Other Regions Feel Free To Propose Embassies.
