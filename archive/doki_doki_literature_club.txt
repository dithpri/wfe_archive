[color=#8b0000]There is no proof that Monika ever did anything wrong. In fact, historical records of ancient history seem to show the exact opposite. Monika destroyed the oligarchic regime known as the &quot;cabinet&quot;, who owned all the influence and oppressed those known as the &quot;proletariat&quot;. Monika established the democratic regime known as the &quot;Doki Doki Socialist Republic&quot; and ejected fledgling tyrants who opposed the regime. Monika is the best example of strong leadership and the beauty of our fragile democracy. Tragically, the tyrants known as the cabinet destroyed Monika&#39;s regime from existence and reimposed themselves as the tyrants of DDLC. [/color]
