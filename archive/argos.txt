Argos was the core region of the Argian Circle. The Argian Circle aspired to become a large collection of nations and regions that would participate in a cooperative organization together. This did happen for sometime, then misfortune fell upon the Argian Circle and the Outer Circle collapsed and the Inner Circle was disbanned.  All that remains of the Argian Circle is its founding region, Argos. This also is the resting place for the creator of Argos and the Argian Circle, Xi Omicron Theta.
