[colour=red][b]REGION CLOSING[/b][/colour]

I have decided that I don&#39;t want to run a region anymore. I have since relocated but even so, there is one big reason why I have ordered this region&#39;s closure.

I still retain executive power over this region even after I move, which is problematic, as I would still remotely control the region, and if you decided you wanted an executive change, I would be the only one to do it.

You guys can certainly re-found Frahuntzerland somewhere or another region.

I&#39;m very sorry I have to be doing this, but in seven days, this region will shut down for good.

It&#39;s been a fun, but I&#39;m done leading a region, and I apologize for any hurt I have caused.
