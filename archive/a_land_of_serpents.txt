A place for the kingdoms of serpents, where we keep our environment (and weather) as our highest priority, and make sure to bring peace to all serpents all to better serve our serpentine overlords.
After all, don&#39;t we all want the serpents to be able to bask in the sun on the frond of a palm tree while we tend to their every whim?
Preferably, we will use the Snek Mices as currency, but others are acceptable.
Do not feel like you aren&#39;t allowed in if your environmental beauty/weather/eco friendliness isn&#39;t very good- it is the grasp for the ideal that counts!
