[b]The alliance of the Great is a region that uses force and diplomatics to help each other out. We have a Policy of acts which is included below.

Policy of acts:
act 1- If you are attacked you can tell us and we will vote on weather to help or not
act 2- If you attack someone do not expect us to help. We will vote but you need %50 of the vote for us to get involved
act 3- If a vote it passed everyone has to follow that vote

We are always looking for new members and people to go for votes and to help in wars.
