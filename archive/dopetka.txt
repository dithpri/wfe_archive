The land of the stupid, and the home of the arrogant. You probably don&amp;#39;t want to be here. It&amp;#39;s kinda like hell on Earth. So be wary traveler, of the nations in the land of Dopetka.
Founded by [nation]Gargleville[/nation], the region of Dopetka is a land full of tension. No other nations are left, due to the anarchy that they became, or the heretical viewpoints that they held. All that remains is the nation of Gargleville. Yarrg Harg fell into anarchy. Spaghettiland was conquered in a full on war, as was Rainbowasteland. No country is safe. The mighty armies of Gargleville shall march. For as always, and forever more, The Gods Demand Sacrifice.
