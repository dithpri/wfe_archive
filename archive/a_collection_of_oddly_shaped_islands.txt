This island collection was invaded by DEN, it was occupied for near a month.  Shortly before the invasion Anakonian intelligence realised what was about to happen and withdrew all forces into hiding.  A month later Anakonian military forces counter attacked from hidden bases and utterly routed the invading forces after a short and precise land, air and sea strike against DEN occupying forces.
