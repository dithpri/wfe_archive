This is the Warrior Clanlands.  We are small, but we have survived so much.  I&amp;#39;d take this tiny region over the rotten Black Riders any day.  We have a long and sad history, which has been trod upon by the prideful Black Riders.  Long live the Warrior Clanlands, and RIP Septer, may she rest with Starclan.
