[b]Our resident bear, [nation=short]Ursidae[/nation], was shaking off the effects of his winter hi[i]bear[/i]nation, and found himself sleeping when it came time for update. Leaving him to his slum[i]bear[/i], his fellow hawks flew out in search for some [i]bear[/i]ries, so that he might recover some of the blub[i]bear[/i] lost over the winter. After getting their [i]bear[/i]ings, the squad of birds flew without [i]paws[/i], launching a [i]bear[/i]ial assault on this region and making off with its foodstuffs, before returning to their [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_black_hawks]cave[/url] [i]bearing[/i] as much as they could carry.
