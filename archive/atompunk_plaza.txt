[b]The Atompunks are the baddest of the bad, and the meanest of the mean, blazing across the nuclear wastes in their power armor, and laying some waste of their own with the help of their mighty mini-nuke catapults. If there&#39;s something that needs an ass-kicking, they&#39;ll be there to kick it with a thousand megatons of blinding kickassery. To be an Atompunk is to be a walking, talking bringer of death, and to bring that death with a cool veneer that would make Ice Man look room temperature.

They&#39;re not-so-lean, they&#39;re rough and mean, they got the means to clean the wastes out, and their cleaning supplies kill ninety-nine-point-nine percent of germs with extreme prejudice.[/b]
