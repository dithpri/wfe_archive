[b][i]The Pure Land is a haven and oasis for all spiritual seekers and people of all religious or non religious persuasions, of all political expression, of all social class and self-description, and of all background and past in NationStates.  

The Pure Land is a community which has formed to discuss philosophy, religion, science, wisdom, politics, economics, society, and life and death. Topics not here mentioned that might stimulate conversation are encouraged and nothing is barred as taboo. 

The Pure Land is a place for dialogue and free expression through the message board, a place to roleplay as a religious themed nation, or just a place to send a nation to be part of.[/b][/i]
