[b]Valkyrie&#39;s Lament[/b]

[i]Came down with the storm, silver sword in her hand,
Thunder in her whisper, mercy in her command,
Blessed by the gods, cursed in blood and gore,
No life but for death, no love but for war.

Oh, she don&#146;t pray, she don&#146;t kneel,
She just weighs what a soul&#146;s worth in steel.

She takes the lost, the bold, the fallen,
Lifts their names where the gods have callin&#39;,
Where the battle cries turn into songs,
And every death feels like it belongs.

Ooh, Valhalla calls.
