[i]On April 1st, 2012, NationStates banded together to achieve a goal: to beat Max Barry&amp;#39;s 25 million shares ([url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=ipo]Shares?[/url]) on one nation. With five minutes on the clock, we tried to combine but got the error message &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m afraid I can&amp;#39;t let you do that.&amp;quot; Wondering what was going on and freaking out, we found [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=news/2012/03/31/index.html]this[/url] and ourselves with over 44 million shares.
