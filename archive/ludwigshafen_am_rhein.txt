[b][region]National Socialist World[/region]

The industrial City of [region]Ludwigshafen am Rhein[/region] in [region]Rheinland Pfalz[/region] Germany was founded in 1844 and is located on the Rhine river opposite [region]Mannheim[/region]. The National-Socialists developed the city in 1933. Many small houses with gardens were built, especially in the Gartenstadt, with the aim to create a &#148;Greater Ludwigshafen&#148; by agglomerating smaller towns and villages in the vicinity. Thus Oggersheim, Oppau, Edigheim, Rheing&ouml;nheim, and Maudach became suburbs of Ludwigshafen, raising its population to 135,000.[/b]
