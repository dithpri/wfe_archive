Isengard was built in the Second Age around the tower of Orthanc by the N&uacute;menoreans-in-exile in the days of their power in Nan Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains). Its location was at the northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon and together with the fortress of Helms Deep to its south protected the Gap of Rohan.
