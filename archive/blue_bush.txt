Blue Bush is a hard-core military focused region, with no room for soft-hearted pansies.

Our region is legendary for legends, our bacon and horrible puns. And the purple cows with wings.

We are a strong military power with no regards to the environment. Every family must have one Hummer and a small nuclear weapon (keep away from children).

Remember, bullets are cheaper then band-aids.
