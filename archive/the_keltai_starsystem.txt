Many races merged on these great lands after the Rapture, a event where the Rodori and Vahric cultures fled to the worlds which they once inhabited for various reasons. The world before was corrupted by violence and plagued by war. Great ancient gates connected the war torn world to this paradise and when the Rodori found their brothers and the Vahr found their world consumed by fire and blood they fled into a world which they would forge into a haven.
