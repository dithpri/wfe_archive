A simple land, filled with Badassary... And then everything changed the sloth nation attacked. Last time we met our hero&amp;#39;s they ventured forth on a quest to find all 7 dragon balls along with their trusted pokemon. But after being tricked into loosing his 5 Exodia cards it would be much more difficult to become the Hokage of Konoha. However by using the power of their devil fruit our intrepid trio may still be able to defeat Kirra and save Alucard from the dastardly NHK.
