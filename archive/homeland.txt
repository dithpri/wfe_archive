Welcome to Homeland. The region of Homeland is a peaceful region for those of peaceful kinds. If you are not of said &quot;peaceful kinds&quot; our Gateway Guards will be more than happy to escort you to the Void. Upon entry to the region please send a telegram to the High King and Steward stating whether you are a Stormcloak or Imperial, and whether you are on the side of the free people of Middle Earth or Sauron. We will not treat you differently than others depending on your side; we would just like to know what side you are on.
