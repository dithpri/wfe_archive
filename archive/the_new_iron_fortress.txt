[color=red]Born from [region]Antifa[/region]&#39;s destruction of [region]The Iron Fortress[/region], this former Fascist region has been captured by the mighty Anti-Nazi/Fascist Warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

An undercover operation led by [nation]SwitzIsNotHere[/nation] and supported by [nation]Golden Hind[/nation], once again proves that an active Nazi/Fascist founder is no boundary for Anti-Nazi/Fascist justice![/color]
