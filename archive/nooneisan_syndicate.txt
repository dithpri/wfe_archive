The Nooneisan (pronounce non-A-san) Syndicate is a small group of nations in a mutual assistance union that is open for entry but will review new nations and assert their inclusion worthiness. This region does not make contact with other regions in NationStates and hopes to have the gesture returned. 
Please role play... please.
