*static* We are fighting for our right to live. To exist. And should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: &quot;We will not go quietly into the night!&quot; We will not vanish without a fight! We&#39;re going to live on! We&#39;re going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day! *static*: END TRANSMISSION
