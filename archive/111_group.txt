We are one and one are us
We will be brave in darkness and turmoil
We will survive until the break of dawn 
We will stand together as one 
Kim Chi and Mind you dont shunt my nation aside 111
111 Group is one
And we are all 
With hope of a billion new stars
Twinkies and Cheeto&#39;s
Cheeks all around
Cheers! Raise yur glass
To us
Up!
