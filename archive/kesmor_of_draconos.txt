This region Kesmor started with Draconos. the god-king of [nation=short]Culveria[/nation], and of dragons (including dragon-like creatures like wyverns and sea serpents) and cats. Draconos and his kingdom was not very accepted in many places. Then one day one brought to his attention, he could make his own region, full of his favored ones and followers and allies. So he made it, and he opened it to all so that all could come here. He is constantly waiting upon his throne to meet new rulers of nations that join him. He welcomes all, but just asks that they revere him or accept him as there god, or at least respect him. If you have come here then welcome! Oh, and please be respectful and do not criticize, it would be most appreciated.
