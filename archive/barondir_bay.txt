In 1090 LIR, Human explorers established a fortress in Barondir Bay.  The region, carved by glaciers many aeons past, was claimed by the Frostlings when &quot;the world was frozen in ice.&quot;  The Lizardmen claimed the region when &quot;the earth rose from the sea.&quot;  And the Azracs claimed the region &quot;when the world&#39;s inhabitants swam in magma and breathed flames.&quot; Each race claimed to be there first.
