The Potato Union is an economic/military alliance founded by the nations of Jan Visi, North Keyton, and Deskeuburg. Created in 1987, The Potato Union was made to create a stronger bond between the 3 nations, but since then, The Potato Union has grown to include many more nations that need extra support economically or militarily.
