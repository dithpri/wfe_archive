&amp;quot;Enjoying Chocolate Cake since 1337!&amp;quot;

Our Lovely Delegate:

Head Of The Military:

Here at the region of Farquonia we have a system that is like a mini World Assembly only difference is that all decisions made in our Regional Assembly only effects members of this region. Anyone can apply to be a government member. (Of course, unlike the WA which instantly sends an acceptance email we actually have some of our existing government members check over your application.) Check out our official discussion thread for more info.

We love chocolate cake. Praise chocolate cake.
