Welcome to  the Region of Strange Travelers. This group is that of friends who, after lots of distractions, we work together to play games and hang out. We do co-op, group online, and solo play, making Lets-Play&amp;#39;s and being generally, all-around derpy is what we do best. You can see our videos on Youtube.com, and we work under the main names of Oblio95, Leprechaunjinx, and mathmeistro95. THANKS ALL!
