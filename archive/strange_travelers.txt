Welcome to  the Region of Strange Travelers. This group is that of friends who, after lots of distractions, we work together to play games and hang out. We do co-op, group online, and solo play, making Lets-Play&amp;#39;s and being generally, all-around derpy is what we do best. You can see our videos on Youtube.com, and we work under the main names of Oblio95, Leprechaunjinx, and mathmeistro95. THANKS ALL!

UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL!
