[color=purple][i]Is it madness,
My dear,
Which drives a
Man of my genius,
To strive for an impossible prize?
Or is it the striving for that which is ever just out of reach,
Which prevents madness from overtaking me? I do not fear death...[/i] for I am DOOM![/color]
[hr][b]Ten thousand futures have I looked at. A hundred thousand. And in only one does mankind finally unite, and flourish... and survive. Only one. Doomworld.[/b]
