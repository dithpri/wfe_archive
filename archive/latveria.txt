[b]Welcome to Latveria! A technologically advanced region lead by the powerful absolute monarchy of [nation=short]Doctor Doom[/nation].[/b]
[color=green]Today, I make no demands... no threats. But, one day, I shall voice demands, and all shall obey them.[/color]
[color=darkred][i]Knowledge is power. In all the universe there is no greater truth.[/i][/color]

[color=purple][i]Is it madness,
My dear,
Which drives a
Man of my genius,
To strive for an impossible prize?
Or is it the striving for that which is ever just out of reach,
Which prevents madness from overtaking me? I do not fear death...[/i] for I am DOOM![/color]
[hr][b]Ten thousand futures have I looked at. A hundred thousand. And in only one does mankind finally unite, and flourish... and survive. Only one. Doomworld.[/b]
