The Hayastani Assembly of the Caucasus is a region dedicated to the gathering of nations in the Northern Middle Eastern and Caucasus Mountains areas of the world. This region is dedicated to the unification and association of these nations, the conservation and preservation of the highlands, and protection of all ethnic and minority groups in the area.

Nations must be liberally- and democratically-minded, excel in political freedoms and civil rights, be dedicated to protection of the environment, and be generally pacifistic.
