Greetings, traveller!

This region will serve as a [b][u]Jump point[/u][/b] to all regions, although more specifically, Star Wars-themed regions.

All are welcome, whether it be to shelter from others, to park puppets, or to Lightspeed to Hoth!

We&#146;ve lost a few X-wings and TIE fighters here, if found please report to nearest Star destroyer.
