The [region]fellowship of the wyrms[/region] is the collection of all countries and nations that live on the plant Illari. All counries with soil on Illari must abide by all rules, restrictions, and laws that the Lexington Accords and the Illarian Senate put into place. The fellowship wishes to bring peace and prosperity to Illari, and justice to those who have wronged us. Originally formed by the counties named [nation]Corgivale[/nation], [nation]Ahila[/nation], and [nation]Duke nukem 2 eletric boogaloo[/nation], the fellowship has expanded to all Illarian countries and hopes to establish trade and alliances with whoever shows their face.
