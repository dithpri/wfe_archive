The Sphere is a planet in the realm of Science Fiction. Only invited nations are allowed here.

In-Universe, the Sphere is just a colony planet near enough to Earth that it is reachable via low hyperspeed.
Two nations were able to escape a theocratic genocidal government on Earth and reach the Sphere, and then they funded a rebellion on earth to thwart the theocratic and racially-supremacist genocidal government. Since then, the old theocracy had relocated to the Sphere as well and is engaged in a holy blood war with the two colonies.
