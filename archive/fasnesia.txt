Since the Roman Empire existed, the Fasnesians have always wanted to be powerful. In 1966, Zenezca got independence. In 1971, Fasdania got independence. In 1992, Crosszenezca got independence. In 2006, Kenay got independence. We are all united under one language and heart. We fight, but still need each other to survive.
