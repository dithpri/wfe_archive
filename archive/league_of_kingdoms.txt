A loose coalition of independent nation-states which are free to control themselves as they see fit. Regional government is controlled by:

[b]WA Delegate:[/b] None
[b]Regional Governor:[/b] [nation=long]radan[/nation]
[b]Cartography Minister:[/b] None

A regional forum has yet to be established, meaning the position of [b]Communications Minister[/b] is still available for those interested.
