A loose coalition of independent nation-states which are free to control themselves as they see fit. 
Regional government goes something like this:

[b]WA Delegate:[/b] None
[b]Regional Governor:[/b] [nation=long]radan[/nation]
[b]Cartography Minister:[/b] [nation=long]eloian[/nation]

[b]Next Governor Election in:[/b] [color=red] 3 weeks [/color]
