We welcome all in the school, but first, here are the rules:

1. Don&#39;t beg for administrative positions. If you are seen as fit for an administrative role, you will be promoted to a position. 
2. Please keep the number of countries per person in the region to a minimum. (Maximum 3 Regions)
3. Offensive country names or mottos are not welcome. If you do it, your country WILL BE BANNED PERMANENTLY.
4. All officers should notify the founders if another officer is abusing their powers.


 We encourage all members to hold a position in the World Assembly, as it increases region influence.
