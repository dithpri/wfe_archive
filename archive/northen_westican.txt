History:
It all started when King &amp;quot;Frank Mezatorypskin II&amp;quot; became the ruler of the former Kingdom of Ritzeniya (Also,Duke Ludwig&amp;#39;s former homeland),in today&amp;#39;s Europe.
Duke Ludwig was displeased by Frank Mezatorypskin&amp;#39;s rulership to citizens,so Duke Ludwig decidid to make a better place than Ritzeniya,and he started an investigation for new territorys.Once Duke and his sailors landed,he made a historical speech,who&amp;#39;s document is today saved in a Kybetian museum in Zeharmelonia.
