[b][color=red]Norona Holy Land[/color][/b]
A central pacific volcanic island mass, home to the [u]Devout Subservients of [nation]Norona[/nation][/u].  A highly religious peoples who practice [b]NeoNoronism[/b], they believe that their leader, [b]Goddess Norona[/b], is an immortal divine figure, and hold severe contempt for those who disagree. 

The center of the island is uninhabitable volcanic rock, with lush life all around, except for towards the east.  Known as the [b]Blighted Vast[/b], it&#39;s desert dunes are void of all life, with few travelers able to venture more than a hundred miles in.  Survivors return with a sickness of unknown origin, only to die weeks later.

[b]Tekoma&#39;s Tooth[/b], named after Norona&#39;s nefarious twin brother, is a rugged, mountainous land with extremely dense trees and oppressive terrain.
