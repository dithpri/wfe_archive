[color=blue]In the past, the Jalvian Archipelago was a group of closely related nations. However, following the Silver Campaigns, they have been merged into an empire now referred to as the Jalvian Empire. The leaders of the nations remain in power, now as the leaders of imperial provinces. The provincial leaders retain a great deal of autonomy, which may lead to the Empire&#39;s downfall.[/color]
