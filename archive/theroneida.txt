Theroneida is a harsh, yet comfortable land. It has seen many wars in its rich history, primarily fought by the mysterious Legionists. However, the wars stopped and the original colonies have kept a tense, but solid peace for a century. As of now, the land is largely unsettled beyond the old Legionist cities. It is temperate all year round, growing only slightly cold in the winter. The citizens desire commerce and community, and so it must be.
