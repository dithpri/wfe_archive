Iraq is now controlled by the Confederate States of America.  

I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land. 
In Dixieland, where I was born in
Early on one frosty mornin&#39;
Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land. 
I wish I was in Dixie, hooray! Hooray!  
In Dixieland, I&#39;ll take my stand 
To live and die in Dixie!  
Away, away, away down south in Dixie! 
Away, away, away down south in Dixie!
