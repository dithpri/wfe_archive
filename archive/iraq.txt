Welcome to the all-new, united [b]Iraq[/b]!

Traditionally, Iraq has been divided into two parts: [i]Iraq al-Arabi[/i], [b]Babylonia[/b] or eastern Iraq, and [i]Iraq-e Ajami[/i], [b]Media[/b] or western Iran. 

The various Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Turkish, Iranian and other minority communities of Iraq support the peaceful effort to build an integrated, cultural region.
