REBIRTH! Traditionally, the region of Iraq was much larger. It was divided into two parts: [i][b]Iraq al-Arabi[/i][/b] was central and southern Iraq, and [i][b]Iraq-e Ajami[/b][/i] was western Iran.

The people of the land never forgot their roots in ancient Babylonia and Media. This new Iraq is not exclusively Arabic, but offers a wider perspective of the various cultural elements in the Middle East.

NOVELTY! This new administration represents a coalition of Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Turkmens, and Persians of the Christian, Babylonian, Gnostic, Jewish, and Zoroastrian faiths. 

The modern Iraqi minorities have been ignored far too long. Our mission is to fire up the romantic pre-Islamic civilizations that once propelled Iraq to greatness and will do so again.
