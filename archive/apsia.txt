[hr][color=blue][b]Welcome to APSIA[/b]
[hr]The APSIA (Association of Political States and International Affairs) is a group of hearty, hard-working nations trying to get by in a world full of competition and harshness. Formed on November 26, 2015, the APSIA came together to give some smaller voices a bigger combined voice. A revolution has lead to it&#39;s destruction, and eventual recreation on 03/12/2022. [/color]
