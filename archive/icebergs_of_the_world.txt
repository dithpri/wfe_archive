Through the use of recently discovered advanced alien technology, this region consists of inhabitants that dwell on various icebergs both above and below the surface of the waters. Nations in this region are generally isolationist, not wishing to be involved in the outside world; however, they do stick together in times of need and tend to be extremely loyal to others Icebergers.
