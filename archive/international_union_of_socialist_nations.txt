We are a nation which accepts all forms of socialist, international socialism (communism) to national socialism (fascism). We are led by an International Council of Socialist Nations. The military is headed by the Supreme General and the jury is headed by the Supreme Justice. The Union promotes the peace, safety and welfare of it&#39;s people and believe it is in their duty to preemptively defend themselves against any nation they see as a threat. They believe the people&#39;s should listen to their leaders because it is the only way for them to ensure their peace of mind, safety and welfare.
