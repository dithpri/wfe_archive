A world with two layers. On the top? A complex fantasy land filled with magic and fantastical beasts and creatures, species of all kinds. Gods walk the earth. On the lower? A world based mostly in realism where guns, tech and soldiers rule. Humans race to build better weapons and claim the lands that surround them. Play in one, or choose both. We have room for all.
