This region was re-named from Cost Rixana after the invasion of surrounding countries by The Dual-Theistic Holy State of Judo-Islam. After the take-down of that government by the Sycophant (see Sum Tash factbook), the region was named South Albercania. Following this, several island nations joined the region, which prompted the addition of &quot;And Allied Islands.&quot;
