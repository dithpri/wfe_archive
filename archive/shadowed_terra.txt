This place is what WAS earth, until an asteroid started to come towards the planet. The current governments of the time nuked the asteroid, as Hashvra unveiled a large shield around themselves. The Meteor still crashed unto the earth, and still brought devastation, But it wasn&#39;t large enough to destroy more than eurasia by that point. As the nations who survived reeled from the shock, shadowy beings found their way around the planet, absorbing everything mindlessly and insanely. Find your place in this world of Ashes.
