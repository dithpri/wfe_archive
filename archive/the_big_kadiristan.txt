[b] [color=red]Our region, our style, our rules; Here&amp;#39;s the rules.
1-Only Empire/U.K/U.S and Republics allowed.
2-No Nazi.
3-Do not spam on chat.
4-We don&amp;#39;t do formal stuff. It is a region for fun.
5-If you want to enter, you need to play Yahtzee ! (Lol joke)

The Big Kadiristan is one of the largest regions in the whole world. Not about the country amount, about the size on the map. Play yahtzee, be a gamer, watch anime. The most important thing is Yahtzee though. [/b] [/color]
