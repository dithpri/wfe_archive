The Order of Zeca was established 7,000 years ago, to ensure that technological advancement left behind previous civilizations, would not fall into the hands of those who wish to enslave the planet. The first Zeca were descendants of early space dwellers whom landed on earth hundreds of years prior to the establishment of the order. Initially the order&#39;s secret membership was restricted   to only those who were of the Zeca race, however within the last 5 thousand years, the Zeca have accepted members from all cultures and backgrounds. It is now the oldest organization in the world.
