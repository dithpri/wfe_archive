A gathering of numerous religious arms of the central &amp;quot;Sith&amp;quot; core of beliefs and the Sith code:

[i]&amp;quot;Peace is a lie, there is only passion.
Through passion, I gain strength.
Through strength, I gain power.
Through power, I gain victory.
Through victory, my chains are broken.
The Force shall free me.&amp;quot;[/i]

The Sith will be victorious over our Jedi foes!
