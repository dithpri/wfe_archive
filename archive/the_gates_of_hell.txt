A cold hard region. Government is prized at being controlling and oppressive. People in this region are treated like livestock. No other beliefs then the ones held by the state are allowed. Capitalism is key, communism is NEVER allowed, Do not be communist. Civil rights are average in this region with elections held every once in a while.
