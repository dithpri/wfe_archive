[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their frens from The Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army decided to stay up late to go stargazing!

We brought along drinks, snacks and [color=yellow]pineapples![/color]
The only thing we forgot to bring was a telescope, but it was fine as your region&#39;s sky was beautiful enough!

We stayed in your region till late at night before sleepwalking back home! [color=blue]If you see any suspicious sleepwalkers in your region, please do not call the ghostbusters on them.[/color]
