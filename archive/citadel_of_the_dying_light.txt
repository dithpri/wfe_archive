[b][color=red]The Citadel Of The Dying Light welcomes you to our glorious land.[/color][/b]

Welcome to the Citadel, fellow nations!
Feel free to talk to your neighbors in the regional message board, and send telegrams and whatnot.
BUT there is one thing here that we do not tolerate at all: conspiracy. Don&#39;t use fake accounts to endorse yourself and don&#39;t go asking for positions of leadership. Be humble.
Apart from that you can do what you want, provided it doesn&#39;t breach game rules.
Have fun :)
