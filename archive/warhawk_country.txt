A selective, highly centralized region only for a small group of people. Voting on polls is not mandatory, but is highly recommended, as many polls are official votes on the policy of the region. Respect the local authority, and your nation can be free and powerful. Just make sure to embrace new policy, vote on polls, and maintain communication with the rest of the region.
