Welcome to The Crazies... Let me ask you a few questions? Have you ever been tired of authority? Have you ever just wanted to be free of any law or rules? Have you ever wanted to just do whatever you want to?
The answer is here, my friend.
In The Crazies, You are allowed to do whatever you want; Be peaceful, go to war with others, steal things, set things on fire, murder, punch old people in the face, ride your bike, or just go absolutely crazy.
