[b][color=#000061]Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! This region[/b] waited out a charge by [region=Nugut]![/color]

[b]We were occupied by our favorite idiots:
[nation=short]Corvus Corax[/nation]
[nation=short]Vandoosa[/nation]
[nation=short]Hired Contractor[/nation]
[nation=short]Albioney[/nation]
And [nation]Easypete[/nation][/b]
For a solid five seconds, before they all self-destructed without us even bothering to log on and intervene! If this is anything like the last 3 times we got invaded, in a week half of those countries won&amp;#39;t exist. So thanks, [region]Nugut[/region], for once again showing us how badly you and [region]The Black Riders[/region] suck at raiding!
