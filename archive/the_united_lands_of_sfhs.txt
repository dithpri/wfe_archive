We are a solid region that is facing the task of uniting all of the disassembled regions that have been created for the purpose of individual needs... We are unique in the way that we satisfy all needs of our nations... All of SFHS is welcome and when you arrive you can hang a bit and eventually decide on what purpose you want to serve in the long run... If something that you want to do is not currently created, we will be happy to let you lead your new idea! We have survived raids and even hackers.
We always remember to keep things fun and never hold a grudge for more than an hour!
