We are a solid region that is facing the task of uniting all of the disassembled regions that have been created for the purpose of individual needs... We are unique in the way that we satisfy all needs of our nations... All of SFHS is welcome and when you arrive you can hang a bit and eventually decide on what purpose you want to serve in the long run... We will always have something to be a part of!! If something that you want to do is not currently created, we will be happy to let you lead your new idea! 
Since this is a work in progress, if anyone has any flag, welcoming telegrams, etc., then I would like you to telegram me about it...
