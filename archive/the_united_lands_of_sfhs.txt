We&amp;#39;re a solid region that is facing the task of uniting all of the disassembled regions that have been created for the purpose of individual needs... We are unique in the way that we satisfy all needs of our nations... All of SFHS is welcome and when you join, you can hang for a bit until you decide on what purpose you want to solve in the long run. If something that you want to do is not currently created, we will gladly support you in leading this idea...
We always keep things fun and never hold a grudge.
