The Seven Kingdoms is a realm located on the continent of Westeros, ruled by the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the king who sits on the Iron Throne in the capital city, King&#39;s Landing. The name derives from the situation three centuries ago when Aegon the Conqueror set to unite the lands of Westeros, which then contained seven independent realms. The new realm created from Aegon&#39;s Conquest contains nine distinct regions or provinces. -- [url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Seven_Kingdoms][color=663333]Seven Kingdoms[/color][/url][hr]
