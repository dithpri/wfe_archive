WELCOME TO THE FELINE CONFEDERATION! 
This region is home to nations that are ruled by or are worshippers of Cats. 
Together in unity we stand tall to defend our species and prove our supremacy over all others!

NOTE: The Feline Confederation primarily wields a left-leaning agenda, although nations who do not represent these tendencies may join as long as they do not obviously demonstrate or attempt to impose their opinions on a regional scale. 
THOSE WHO SLANDER OUR SPECIES WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED!
