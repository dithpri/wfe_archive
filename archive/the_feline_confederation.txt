WELCOME TO THE FELINE CONFEDERATION!!!
This is a region for nations who ruled by or are worshipers of Cats.
Together we shall stand tall, persevere and demonstrate our might.
The Feline Confederation primarily wields a left-leaning agenda, though nations who don&amp;#39;t demonstrate these tendencies as long as they don&amp;#39;t impose them on a regional scale.
