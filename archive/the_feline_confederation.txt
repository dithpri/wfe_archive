WELCOME TO THE FELINE CONFEDERATION! 
This region is home to nations that are ruled by or are worshippers of Cats. 
Together in unity we stand tall to defend our species and prove our supremacy over all others!

This region is under the control of His Imperial Furriness Emperor Defender Corkan XXXXVIII LXXXXI who delegates power to Regional Chairman His Excellency Baznah Madoodez IH UH InsH, through Founder: [nation]Corkan Territory[/nation]. Those who slander the Emperor shall be severely punished!

NOTE: The Feline Confederation primarily wields a left-leaning agenda, although nations who do not represent these tendencies may join as long as they do not obviously demonstrate or attempt to impose their opinions on a regional scale.
