Welcome to NovoCascadia, a fresh faced, founder run, RP based region. Come on in and flex your creative muscles.

This region supports the values of Libertarian thought in the RMB. This means, that all players can say nearly anything they want as long as they are not explicitly threatening or harmful to another player or [b]Godmodding[/b]. Godmodding will not be tolerated.

You may also ask yourself, &quot;But what is there to do around here?!&quot; Well, let us invite you to break the ice with a diplomatic visit, start a war, bomb your neighbour! The Church of The Emeritus is also open to all those who wish to get into the occult side of RP. Make your stay a fun one!
