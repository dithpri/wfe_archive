[b][color=red]Welcome to the [i]Asus Qusus Region[/i], the [i]AQR[/i].[/color][/b]

[b]Hello New Member!!![/b]

[color=blue]I am [b]Jasper[/b], the leader of the [nation=vernuon]vernuon[/nation]
and the leader of the [/color][b]AQR[/b]. 

[color=green]This region is very brand new and I am looking for founding members to help fill up the spots 
in government and grow this region up to a very strong and influential region. For simplicity&amp;#39;s sake 
I will create dispatches and attach them to this regions page to discuss how things are run in the [/color][b]AQR[/b]. 

[b][color=red]Thank-you and welcome![/color][/b]

[color=grey][b]Below you will see:
