[color=blue][b]Erda[/b][/color] is a new modern-tech alternate world roleplaying region. The region exists to facilitate fun, good-spirited roleplaying between a committed community. Region-wide subjects like world maps and realism restrictions will be trusted mostly to the community as a democratic body, but the admin account will stay around to pass judgement if need arises.
