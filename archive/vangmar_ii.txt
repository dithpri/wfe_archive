[b]Welcome to [region]Vangmar II[/region], criminal. [/b]

This is a place of no honour, for the criminals of the [region]Confederation of Corrupt Dictators[/region] to repent their sins through extraordinary methods deem necessary by the Imperial Council and the Governor-General. Maybe, it can be a place of honour, for all those who exit rehabilitated... maybe you will be able to be rehabilitated as well. But until then, welcome to your new home and hell, Vangmar!
