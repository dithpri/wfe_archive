Hello and welcome to Ibeon! We are a casual region that&#39;s more like an alliance than an actual region. Anyone can join as long as they just want to chill and not cause any problems. You can be a dictatorship or an anarchy and we&#39;ll treat you the same. Just make sure to read the rules below and follow them or Cailex will ban you. Message me with any questions. Thank you, - Brom Jer, Head of Foreign Affairs. :)
