Arvala-7 was a remote desert planet with a barren, rocky surface and breathable atmosphere. During the New Republic Era, it was home to the Ugnaught Kuiil, who lived on a moisture farm with his blurrg. Sometime after Kuiil moved to the world, a group of Nikto mercenaries built an encampment, inside which they kept captive a youngling of the same species as the late Jedi Master Yoda.
