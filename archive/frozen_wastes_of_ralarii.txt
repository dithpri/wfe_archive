The homeland of the Ralarii is a barren frozen snowscape of ice, snow and rock with it&amp;#39;s largest glaciers jutting up into the sky like massive ice walls between the mountains that dominate the skyline. Between the trechourus mountains the terrain is only slightly more hospitable with expansive empty snowfields and ice covered lakes/rivers. The coasts of the land, however are slightly warmer and can accomadate much more plant and animal life then the inner reaches of the region which houses only the most durable of both flora and fauna.
