Opposing our pikes to their horses 

Attacking pikemen with our arquebuses

With our souls united for the same faith

Let the blood flow protecting our Kingdom

The cross from Borgogna, flying in the wind

Sons of Santiago, our tercios are great

Pikemen squadron, protecting the wings,

The only free man is those without fear.

Fight for your siblings, die for your kingdom

Live for the peace on this huge empire.

We won&amp;#39;t be defeated, if we&amp;#39;re captured.

We will only capitulate when we&amp;#39;re dead.

The coat of mail, leather vest,

breastplate and backplate will protect me best.

Rise up your pikes, singing to the sky

I will never be afraid if the tercio is in formation.
