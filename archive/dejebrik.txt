A region that has been created to be free of the World Assembly&amp;#39;s influence and to maintain the independence Dejebrik upholds so dearly.

This region accepts all walks of life regardless of religion, political stances and race. This region is also created for people to socialise and to talk in roleplay and in real life. 

Who needs Delegates to endorse? Who needs the world security council or the world assembly? Come to Dejebrik to create a powerful nation without being watched or forced to participate in pointless affairs.

&amp;quot;One star, One flag, one land, Dejebrik&amp;quot;
 
Please contact me (the founder) for more details on anything.
