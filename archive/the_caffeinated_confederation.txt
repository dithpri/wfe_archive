Welcome to the Caffeinated Confederation. Fascists beware, as Statesburg holds the ban hammer. We follow [region]The Communist Bloc[/region] (Statesburg&#146;s home region) for WA recommendations. Remember to join the WA and endorse [nation]NorPac Liberation Front[/nation] or all your coffee will be decaf. This is a primarily leftist region, but we accept people of all ideologies [i]except[/i] fascism (Strasserism included in the ban.) I swear to Stanfield, get off your high horse and endorse the delegate. Y&#146;all don&#146;t deserve democracy until you actually care about the region.

Current endorsement cap: Half of [nation]NorPac Liberation Front[/nation]&#146;s endorsements, rounded down, currently 2
