Welcome to the Caffeinated Confederation, which actually is owned by [nation]Statesburg[/nation]&#146;s alt. This region is just for screwing around. It&#146;s also kind of a puppet storage region now. However, fascists beware, as Statesburg holds the ban hammer. I hope you enjoy your time here. We follow [region]The Communist Bloc[/region] for WA recommendations. Remember to join the WA and endorse [nation]NorPac Liberation Front[/nation]. I reserve my right to refuse embassies with any regions. This is a primarily leftist region, but we accept people of all ideologies except fascism (Strasserism included.)

Current endorsement cap: Half of [nation]NorPac Liberation Front[/nation]&#146;s endorsements, rounded down, currently 0
