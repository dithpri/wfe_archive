This is an L.C. Bird region.

A region devoted to preserve Marxism, the way it was intended by the genius of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

Welcome, comrade! A few ground rules:

1. Watch your tongue, or you may lose it,
2. Endorsement cap is 2, even for WA Delegate,
3. Accents are encouraged, and you aren&#39;t allowed to imitate a country that is or was previously communist. 
4. Take nothing seriously,
5. The proletariat rules!
