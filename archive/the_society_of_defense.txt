In the Society of Defense, we never make the first move. In this peaceful region, the Senate makes big decisions The amount of police in the society makes crime unheard of. The only lethal weapons are owned by the army and the supreme chancellor. For those who evade war, this Society Of Defense will defend, not attack. The Wolf symbolizes Defense, safety, and the ability to work as a pack. That is why the wolf is our symbol. We defend one another, and work together as a group.
