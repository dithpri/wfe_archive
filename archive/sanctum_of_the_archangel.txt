This enchanted land lies under the benevolent control of the great Archangel Lyzar, Empress of the Holy Empire of Sacra Intergalactica.

Mythical creatures coexist in this realm alongside humans. Due to the fracturing of time, elements of past, present, and future have melded together in an unusual mix of cultures, species, and technologies.

The dieties that created this world passed long ago, and the forces they commanded work of their own free will. As such, laws of nature can be bent, or with proper application of magical force, completely broken.

The Lady Lyzar appoints governors to keep the peace, as well as defend the realm. Failure will result in the archangel&#39;s wrath.  

Will you be among them?
