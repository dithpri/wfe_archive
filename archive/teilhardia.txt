A region infused with the clasped hands of science and religion, seeking to answer the hows and whys of life. Though there are many names for the process, such as complexification towards the Omega Point, we strive towards a goal for spiritual and technological evolution. Guided by the visions of the illuminated ones such as Teilhard de Chardin, Iannis Xenakis, Ray Kurzweil, and Sri Aurobindo, this region is dedicated to the manifestation of their spiraling vision of humanity emerging as a planetary and galactic society, a new being and reality.

There is much to be done. Whoever can appreciate the transcendental and immanent, engage in thoughtful discussion of the future of science, music, philosophy, and spirituality, please join!
