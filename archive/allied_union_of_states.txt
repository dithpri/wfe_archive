Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&#151;
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
&quot;&#39;Tis some visiter,&quot; I muttered, &quot;tapping at my chamber door&#151;
            Only this and nothing more.&quot;
