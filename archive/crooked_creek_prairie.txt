[b][i]Welcome to [region]Crooked Creek Prairie[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This pleasant grassland lies to the northeast of Brunswicke, named after the creek running through it, branched off from the Rabbit River. Tall yellow grass is mostly all there is to behold but someone lurks hidden in those golden blades...

It&#39;s Zosha the Whirlwind, one of the Rat Clan&#39;s most skilled assassins! If she&#39;s come to this prairie, she must be searching for something important.

Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points here in the Prairie will help Zosha find whatever she&#39;s looking for (maybe she&#39;ll tell you herself), earning themselves a very valuable ally and this region!
