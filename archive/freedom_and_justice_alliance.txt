We are a [color=green]just and compassionate[/color] region aimed at defending free people, creatures, spirits, and souls from those who would enslave them. We are the [b]only[/b] fiction/fantasy-themed antifascist region. You can ride a dragon, carry heat-seeking arrows, and protect your comrades with awesome (albeit geeky) magical abilities. Or you can BE the dragon. Or you can have a picture of Rosa Luxemburg throwing a Pok&eacute; Ball. Whatever fits your [color=blue]imagination[/color].

You don&amp;#39;t need to be fantasy-themed or even that active, but you can [b]NOT[/b] be:
 1. Any kind of [b]fascist[/b].
 2. Any [color=red]&amp;quot;anti-revisionist&amp;quot; communist[/color] - that includes Stalinism, Maoism, Hoxhaism, Juche, and sympathetic Leninists.
 3. Any other kind of [color=purple]malevolent dictatorship[/color].
 4. Any other promoter of [color=orange]hatred[/color].
