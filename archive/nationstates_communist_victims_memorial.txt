This region is a memorial dedicated by the ASL to the more than [color=red][b]one hundred million communist victims[/b][/color]. We shall never forget the: Russians killed in the Tsar&amp;#39;s repressions; Latvians, Lithuanians, and Estonians deported to Siberian GULAGs; Ukrainians who perished in pogroms or in Tsarist repressions; Cambodians slaughtered in the killing fields by American Bombing; Poles butchered in Volhynia; Chinese and Tibetans killed by the Kuomuintang or the Qing Dynasty; Eastern Europeans shot while trying to establish their independence; Ethiopians who perished in attempted Italian Colonialisation; South Koreans who died and continue to die in GULAGs; and the other untold victims.
