Welcome to the FFN! The FFN is a right-libertarian hub of freedom and prosperity open to any non-authoritative nations. Here, the biggest issue on the agenda is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 

The founder of this region has permanent Executive authority until the region is further notified. While this may seem rather authoritarian for a libertarian region. The reason the founder of the FFN (Thunria) is granted such authority is to prevent invasions by total dictatorships and authoritarian governments.

Ave Libertas, and enjoy your stay!
