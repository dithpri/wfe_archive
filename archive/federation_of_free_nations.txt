The founder of this region has permanent Executive authority until the region is further notified. While this may seem rather authoritarian for a libertarian region. The reason the founder of the FFN (Thunria) is granted such authority is to prevent invasions by total dictatorships and authoritarian governments.

Ave Libertas, and enjoy your stay!
