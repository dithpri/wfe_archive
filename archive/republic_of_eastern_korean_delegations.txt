The People&#146;s Republic of East Korea is an isolated and tightly controlled nation on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. Known globally as a &#147;hermit state,&#148; the PREK fiercely opposes Western influence and upholds a rigidly nationalist ideology. With strict policies on information and travel, the country remains largely inaccessible to outsiders and has limited engagement with the international community. The regime controls all aspects of life, prioritizing state ideology, loyalty to the Supreme Leader, and resistance to foreign influence.
