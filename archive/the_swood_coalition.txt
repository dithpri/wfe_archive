The S.W.O.O.D Coalition (or the Sovereign Waters of the Ostentatious Dominions Coalition)
[hr]
[color=red][b]STAND UNITED[/b][/color] against regions who would invade you, weaken you and force their beliefs upon you. Here in the SWOOD we believe in fighting for the right to govern ourselves. We are a united group of various government types, from Socialist Democrats to Father Knows Best States, we do not discriminate.
[color=blue][b]JOIN THE ROLE-PLAYING[/b][/color] We regularly post polls to decide certain aspects of the region, nothing that&#39;ll affect you personally. You can also view our global map in our dispatch or by clicking [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=699411]here[/url].
[color=green][b]EMBRACE THE GOOF[/b][/color] We honestly don&#39;t take ourselves very seriously, we banded all anime and replaced it with Dr. Phil.
