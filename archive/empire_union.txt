Hello and welcome to the Union of Empires, an alliance under a peaceful and benevolent dictatorship. Join us to conquer the world and fight against countries to steal their territories. In our country, military service for young people is compulsory, the death penalty is accepted, coups and demonstrations are prohibited by the constitutional law of Empires. Each Empire must deliver euros to the other Allied Empires, under penalty of immediate destruction. We have one of the largest armies in the world, led by the bloodiest soldiers on the planet. It&#39;s time for you to join our Union of Empires if you want an army capable of stopping any attack. Each Empires has its own policy.

Glory to the Unions of Empires.
