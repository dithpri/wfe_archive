This is a region of democratic &amp; peaceful independencies, all within 50 miles of the equatorial regions. Those who seek violent methods of controlling populations rather than democratic consensual methods, will not be allowed to serve this region.  Representatives of each nation will meet every fourth month to ensure peaceful &amp; democratic harmony. Any issues which face a nation without peaceful conclusion, can be brought to joint region meetings every quarter. If peace and quality, harmony &amp; joy are your major concerns then join us whenever you can.
