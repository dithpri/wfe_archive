The goals of the unitary sovereign state is to hold onto the assets of each state and defend them with the collective strength of the individually weak states. The confederation aims to maintain the security and integrity of all states within it&#39;s jurisdiction, even at the cost of democracy or religious acceptance.

However, with the recent blessing of the House of Fulstadt has ascertained the true authority for the Confederation due to the rise of secularism in a majority of the states in the confederation.
