This is lakeview in Iowa, at first you might think it&#146;s a normal town, but residents know that the laws of the universe do not apply to the town. Thus there are immortal forces disguised as humans and animals, The immortal bob (Me) has managed to become mayor.

Lakeview is an RP region coming to you by an alt of Alvosa. You can join as long as you at least sometimes RP with others and aren&#146;t a fascist or raider.

If you just want to chat, head to the bar where you can break the 4th wall as much as you want.
