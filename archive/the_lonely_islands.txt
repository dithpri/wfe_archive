[b][color=darkviolet]Welcome to the Lonely Islands[/b][/color]

[hr]

You have sailed the oceans and you have found these islands, hundreds of them, spread over a thousand miles. A whole lot of isles, islets and atolls scantily inhabited by kind, pleasant people, who have been more than fifty years isolated. All of them wear shirts with the face of &amp;quot;El Che Guevara&amp;quot;, but everything else is good in this island paradise.

But when you decide to stay and live the rest of your life between this kind people, they burn your sh*t and kick your *ss. They tell you to go f*ck yourself. And you are again sailing the waves, on your own. They took your wallet. Fool.

Now the time has past. Your butt doesn&amp;#39;t ache anymore...

[b][color=darkviolet]... But you still visit the Lonely Islands in your dreams.[/color][/b]
