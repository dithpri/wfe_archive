Formally the Gensokyo Alliance Region until founding of this particular Region. {Both named after a land found in the Japanese Bullet-Hell game called Touhou.}
Genso is a World/Universe or simply a region that exists entirely separate from the traditional Earth setting but is still similar in many ways.

The Era and setting of Genso is undefined and fluid, ranging from a simple modern setting or to a far-off futuristic sci-fi setting.


The region is largely made for worldbuilding/entertainment for a small connected group of members that may come and go as they please. Thus it is a largely private region open to only a select few.
