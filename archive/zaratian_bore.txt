Zaratian Bore is a large region composed by almost all types of biomes, here you can find anything between frozen islands to dry deserts.

The two major traditional nations of Zaratian Bore are the Sultanate of Hafal (natives from the region) and the Kingdom of Santi Archipelago (colonizers). These two nations came together after some disputs and decided the majority of the basics for the region, like the official name.

The symbol of the region is the Trout.
