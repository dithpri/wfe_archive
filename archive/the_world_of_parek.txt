The world of Parek is the world which the Gryphons inhabit.
It is a bitter world, but a pleasant one if settled in the rights climates. Its rolling fields, harsh deserts, and frozen tundras are home to three key species.

Humans, Gryphons, and Dragons... The latter of which has been hunted to extinction.

The world itself only houses 988 Million- 398.58 Million of which live within the Gryphonic States, and the rest within the Union of Human Nations.
