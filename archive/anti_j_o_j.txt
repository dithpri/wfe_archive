[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]This region was previously one of the first &quot;Anti J o J&quot; entities, and was as equally futile as all others like it. It was originally captured by a forgotten user, suspected to be of NPO origin. However, after many years of waiting, this region finally CTEd and was captured by the empire on 7/21/25.
