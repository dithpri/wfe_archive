We are based on peace and prosperity. However, we are more than willing to take over a region if we see a need. That being said, we do not plan on it and hope it is not nessecary. We, in this region, are trying to establish equal rights for all without giving all the power to the people or government.

Ebassy Policy- we believe in diplomatic immunity so will arrest no embassy personell. However, you may not have more than ten armed guards for the embassy along with no limos, porches, armed vehicles, etc.

Endorsements- you are free to endorse whomever you like as long as you endorse Aysidinan upon arrival.

Also, if anyone raids the region the Black Eagles we will raid them and feed their corpses to Exantos.
