New France is the territory colonized by France in North America during a period beginning with the exploration of the Saint Lawrence River by Jacques Cartier in 1534. At its peak in 1712 (before the Treaty of Utrecht), the territory of New France, also sometimes known as the French North American Empire or Royal New France, extended from Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. The territory was divided into colonies, each with its own administration: Canada, Acadia, Newfoundland , and Louisiana.
