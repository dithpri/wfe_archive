Welcome to the Islands of Iruen, founded on the 8th of November 2019, we are a small region based on staying to the primitive roots of our ancestors. This may come in many forms from a communist-totalitarian regime to an anarcho-capitalist society, we are accepting of all forms of primitivism. If you are interested in coming back to your primitive roots than join us today.

The only requirement of joining is to be at least in the top 50% of primitive countries.
