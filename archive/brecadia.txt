Welcome to Brecadia. Brecadia is a small, sparsely inhabited region, open to all nations. Whether its those fleeing strife, or whether its those just looking for a place to hide, and wither away, you are welcome here. Be kind; be respectful. These are the core tenets of Brecadia, which we hope all nations here would share. We would happily consider embassies with any regions! Get involved, and we can make something truly great out of Brecadia!
