[b]We here at The International Syndicate are a region built on roleplaying, regional governance, an active community, maps, a newspaper, discussion, openness and equal rights, and far more. Collectively our small group of founders forms an exciting and enjoyable community that is always accepting of new members. New member-states may choose to get involved in our newspaper and arts, our forums, our chats and discussions, our roleplay, regional government, and more.[/b]
