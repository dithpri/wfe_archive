Mudos is a continent on the planet of Oddworld.
It is mostly controlled by the Glukkons of Magog Cartel. The Mudokons were once a slave race but after large meat harvesting and overworking are nearly extinct like most of the other wild life. Many islands are being discovered outside of Glukkon controlled lands and so new nations are being developed without the rapid industriy driven by greed and technological advancement (in most places).
