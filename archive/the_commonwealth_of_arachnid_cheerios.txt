Founded many years ago, the Commonwealth is an association of all states which pay tribute to Arachnid Cheerios. We are a collection of predominantly Communist nations who wish to spread the philosophy of Cheerionianism throughout these noble lands. While most of our nations are Communist, even if your nation is not, you are welcome in our noble lands. Diversity is greatly valued and appreciated. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask our top 5 officers for advice :) 

If you would like to join, please do so and united we can spread the peaceful message of Cheerionianism!
