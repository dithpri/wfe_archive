Hello, and Welcome to Random NationStates Region,

[b]Description[/b]
Random NS Region was a region created by F7 in which users can contribute to a nation called &quot;ValVodia&quot;, with it&#39;s password public - 1234. Even though the hype died and the nation faded into obscurity, there were still a handful of people who stayed with the region. The region lasted 128 days until it was raided (which was very easy to do - i mean the governors password IS PUBLIC)

This region is meant to both succeed the RNS and to honor it&#39;s short-lived legacy. [b]UNITY FOR VALKYRIA AND GDAVODIA![/b]
