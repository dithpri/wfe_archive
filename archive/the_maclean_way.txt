We have long Fridays.

And even longer detentions.

We are devout practicers of Choi Philosophy. Here are some glorious quotes from the Choi Boi ---&amp;gt;

&quot;Do da wok ok pack up thank yuuu goodbye.&quot; - Choi Boi 2016-2017

&quot;There may be miracle in your life, but there is definitely no miracle when you learn. Study hard, amazing result is not far away&quot; - Choi Boi 2018

&quot;I have a dream that my mathletes squad will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by their ability to do maths. Choi Boi 2020
