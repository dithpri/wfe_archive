[b][color=#A70000]Welcome to Asgard![/color][/b]

Re-founded in 2012 with a history dating back even earlier, Asgard was once home to [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=WA_past_resolution/id=95/council=2]the Vikings who stole Christmas[/url][/b]. More importantly, Asgard was home to the best community anyone will ever find in NationStates, the kind of community that cannot be replicated.

Despite attempts to reboot Asgard over the years, we have never come close to recapturing that unique moment in 2012 when Asgard was at its height. Asgard continues to be maintained as a memorial to that time and that community, but the region is and will remain dormant.
