[b]In what can only be described as absolute [strike]cinema[/strike] [color=8cbaed]suinema[/color], your region has been raided by [region]The Black Hawks[/region], with the supporting role being filled by [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] and [region]Lair of the Dragon[/region] in [color=red]Bronyleader&#39;s Graduation Tag[/color]. Along the way, we visited realms of [color=55d1e9]virtual talents[/color], [color=d63722]ponies of the solar variety[/color], a [color=94bdee]fluffy[/color] and [color=fcb0d3]fuzzy[/color] pair of demon guard dogs, and even partied with Elvis! It was a real blast in the end!
