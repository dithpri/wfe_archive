[b][color=crimson]The Crimson Empire is under the overseeing eyes of it&amp;#39;s original founders, and will remain free for eternity. Such is the will of the Crimson Blood[/b][/color]

[i][B]Welcome back, to the empire.
For we return to earn what we desire
Make no mistake, for this time around.
A merger with Raider&amp;#39;s foe will not go down.
Make the mistake, and cross us.
watch your region burn to dust.
Enemies return to your homes.
We Come, there is no stopping us.

[color=crimson]The Crimson Empire[/color] lives on thus
