[i]Despite the tireless efforts of exploration, there will remain those who are never found. 
The shadows that remain hidden, the darkness that shirks from the light.
They will never know our names, never see our faces,
and they will aptly deny the existence of the unknown.
Yet that will not make our existence any less real.
You may wonder, &quot;How can one find something that you can not see?&quot;
Well, let me share a secret with you...    [b][color=red]You can&#39;t [/color][/b]
There is no discovery of the void, it will find you
[b][color=purple]The Abyss, will never be discerned; [u]We will be forever lost[/u][/i]  -The First Shadow [/color][/b]
