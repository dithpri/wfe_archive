[color=blue][b]We are a pro business right wing region.[/b] However everyone, including Communists and left wingers are welcome to stay in our region.

The Golden standard is a union of nations based primarily on right wing philosophies. In here we are under no false impressions of communal living, socialism or being together. Except for the leader and WA delegate positions, all other positions are non-permanent and can be filled by any deserving nation who shows commitment towards improving the region.

We are pro right, pro wealth, pro business and pro capitalism.
We are against government regulation in business and leftism.

We also allow fascists if they obey the rules and if they are fully supportive of business.
