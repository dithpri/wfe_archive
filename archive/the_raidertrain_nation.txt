Raiding. What everyone is interested in. We are a community of raiders and civilian countries. If you would like, you can raid, or you can stay peaceful and watch your economy flourish! If you would like to raid, please make a new account, resign in the WA and apply for the WA in your &quot;puppet&quot; account. Then look for raids in the message board.
