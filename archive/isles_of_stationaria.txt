[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] wanted a calm flight after Project Peregrine.  After their flight they returned to [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]the nest[/url] to die. The so-called &quot;most feared military organisation in NationStates&quot; was no match for 5 tiny countries residing in the Isles of Stationaria. Out of pity, the benevolent leader Jason H. Cumberdale IV let the members of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] stay, although they were bound to indefinite servitude.
