The [b][color=orange]Indian[/color] [color=grey]Armed[/color] [color=green]Forces[/color][/b] have captured the region from [region]Greater Hindu Empire[/region]. When [region]Greater Hindu Empire[/region] created it saying, &quot;Founded by Exiled Political Opponents, to Fight the Leftist Regime that is occupying [region]India[/region], to replace the Leftist regime by a new Hindu Nationalist legitimate regime!&quot; Then the writing on the wall is clear [u][b]India stands for All-inclusiveness and wellbeing of everyone as well as the unity of identities and not for dividing people on identities.[/b][/u]
