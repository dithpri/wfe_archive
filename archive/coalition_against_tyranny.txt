Welcome to [b]THE COALITION AGAINST TYRANNY![/b]

We welcome all refugees, and together we can take back the region overcome by tyranny.

Some may call this raiding, but it is not. it is LIBERATION, and those who liberate will be rewarded tremendously.

Do not be afraid to come, or even stop by to quickly ask for help. Those nations in the WA, the liberators, will come to your aid.
