A group of islands housing the Torelic States, Ethalopia and Nampura. The 2 nations were formed after the Torelic Collapse left the region in shambles. Ethalopia is a nation united via ethnic homogeneity and wealth, while Nampura was formed via the diplomatic joining of 2 militant tribes who have claimed to have initiated the collapse in the first place. It consists of 12 Islands, each named for a god of the old Torelic Religion.
