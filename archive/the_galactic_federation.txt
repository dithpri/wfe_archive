Welcome to: The Galactic Federation
Founded: 28th February 2020 

The Galactic Federation is a force of dominance, an authoritarian state forged from militarism at it&#39;s core but democratic values in it&#39;s underbelly. United under a single Ruler and his Council, ruled by the resource-rich planets and supported by countless loyal citizens, the Federation forsakes freedom in favor of strength and order. From its capital of Csilla, it itself the capital of the Empire of Jabrilia, Imperial leadership exerts total control over the worlds it has conquered, rebuilding its forces to once again march on the unknown regions.
