Welcome to the Territories of Socialists United! We keep The Red Flag flying here, forever Antifa!

The people&#39;s flag is deepest red,
It shrouded oft our martyred dead,
And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold,
Their hearts&#39; blood dyed its every fold.

Then raise the scarlet standard high.
Within its shade we live and die,
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,
We&#39;ll keep the red flag flying here.
