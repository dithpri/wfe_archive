[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by! 

This raid was brought to you by the dominant Somerset Guard today led by Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Leben. Happy 3rd of August!

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

With thanks to the Royal [region]Kantrian[/region] Army![/b]
