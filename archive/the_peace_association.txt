The Peace Association drives to maintain peace between all regions and nations, through the forms of advancement in every area. We aim to have the lowest drug use and allow everyone to thrive under our laws. We accept any religion and ruling style - e.g communism, capitalism - and we wish to become what is known as the UN: a committee accepting of everything that irons out any issues with votes by the form of democracy. Don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t support democracy, as you know, the Peace Association accepts anybody.
