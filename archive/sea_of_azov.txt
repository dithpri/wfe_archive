[b]Sea of Azov[/b]: Inland sea situated off the southern shores of Ukraine and Russia. It forms a northern extension of the Black Sea, to which it is linked on the south by the Kerch Strait. The Sea of Azov is about 210 miles long and 85 miles wide and has an area of about 14,500 square miles . Into the Sea of Azov flow the great Don and Kuban rivers and many lesser ones such as the Mius, the Berda, the Obitochnaya, and the Yeya. In the sea&#146;s western part lies the Arabat Spit, a 70-mile- ong sandbar that separates it from the Syvash, a system of marshy inlets that divides the Crimean Peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland. --Encyclopedia Britannica[hr]
