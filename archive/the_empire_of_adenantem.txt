This ever growing empire dons the goal of possibly controlling the entirety of Earth. It&#39;s leader, known as the Grand King/Queen or The Rainbow Diamond, is a very benevolent, passionate, and devout and pious monarch. With the righteous atop the monarch&#39;s head, they&#39;ll use the word of the Holy Trinity (God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost) to govern all the world. Everyone also has a say in the government&#39;s doing, and you might help make a change for the better. So come to the gates of this grand kingdom and see for yourself what a utopia it truly is.
