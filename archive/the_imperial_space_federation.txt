The ISF is a collection of interstellar planets and systems run and governed by the Imperator of the Vatan of Cylienia. You can still be a member of the ISF without being part of the Cylienian Empire.

To request entry into the Imperial Federation, send a telegram directly to our Department of Imperial Affairs, found within [nation=cylienia], located on Nova Cyla in the Epsilon Praesulius system, Middle Rim.

The World Assembly is useless, and membership in it is not required by any means to enter the region.
