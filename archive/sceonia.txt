Hello! Welcome to our beautiful region of Sceonia. 
We are a small, but very diverse region, in terms of government, geography and history. 
Also there&#39;s only 2 IRL people here. One is Yoteevo and the other is ES/OT/MT

Sceonia is also rich in terms of the fauna: common animals here are foxes, lions, opossums, lizards, falcons, dolphins and strange animals...
