Hello! Welcome to our beautiful region of Sceonia. 
Note: [b]there&#39;s only 2 IRL people here[/b]. One is YO/TI/SF/PB and the other is ES/OA/MT/ET. In the roleplaying and the RMB, we pretend that there&#39;s more leaders, but actually it&#39;s just two. 

We are a small, but very diverse region, in terms of government, geography and history. 

Sceonia is also rich in terms of the fauna: common animals here are foxes, lions, opossums, lizards, falcons, dolphins and strange animals...
