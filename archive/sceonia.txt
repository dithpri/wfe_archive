Hello! Welcome to our beautiful region of Sceonia. Also known as the land of cringy roleplays
We are a small, but very diverse region, in terms of government, geography and history. Or something like that.
Sceonia is a roleplaying region, but we roleplay only with each other inside the region.

Hmm. Yeah. Oh yeah.
