The world was once one mass, or was it? Like any huge landmass it had small islands that overtime fell off from the mainland. Untold numbers of islands fell off the eastern side of Pangea and have remained hidden in the vast pacific ocean due to how small they ended up becoming. Now the islands rest over a small volcanic region, new islands form and collapse on a almost constant state leaving the people of them to flee from one nation to the next. Hoping for strong nations to survive in the constant changing sea under them.
