This is the world of Eocene. A planet ten percent the size of Earth, with about 13.5 million square miles of water and 5.5 million square miles of land. A land of Dark Old Ones and Legendary Artifacts. A place where Seven Nations have carved up the lands and found a strange harmony while their vile legacy continues to stain the lands.
