[color=red]Hello Comrades![/color]

We are a collection of nations seeking protection from land-grabbers, and other Unions which take advantage of their allies. This Union is to organize all unrecognized nations in the world to one place so they can be seen by the world. Its purpose is to facilitate the voices of unrepresented and marginalized nations and peoples worldwide. We hope that all nations unknown to the world, new or old, find their way here.

All nations that are recognized don&amp;#39;t have to be in the USIS, but it is recommended they join.
