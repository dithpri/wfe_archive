Welcome to the Limbo, comrades!

[b]Story of the Limbo:[/b]
-After escaping [nation]The Scarlet Estate[/nation], the Airship of Cerukan Population entered [b]The Limbo[/b](An interdimensional area with indefined properties). That is where we will stay for a long time.

-We have made alliance with [nation]Planet Lucia[/nation] in order to keep Emily&#39;s troops from getting in. We call it the Lucian Union.
-Also, November 23 is Cerukan Indpendence day. Look out for that.

The first nations to escape into the Limbo are:
[nation]Kavotik Ceru[/nation]
[nation]Kerishkuh[/nation]
[nation]United Cult of Britain[/nation]

[I]So far, the Limbo seems even more better than Earth. Other than the fact that it is a fault inbetween two dimensions, of course.[/I]
