[b][color=lime]Welcome[/color] [color=blue]To[/color] [color=purple]The[/color] [color=red]Eureka[/color] Page[/b]

[color=red]Tired of same old regions[/color], me too! Welcome to [color=blue]Eureka[/color] this is Greek for &quot;[color=reallyred]I have found it[/color]&quot; in other words you have FOUND IT! This region has a lot more freedom, instead of just 1-4 leaders you can apply to be a president and each month new president depending on votes. If the user has been president for 2 months straight they would not be able to run again! Welcome to Eureka have an amazing time!
