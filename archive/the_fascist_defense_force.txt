The FDF serves as the military HQ of the [region]International Fascist Federation[/region]. All troops shall be present here at all times to receive rank changes, commendations/medals, and military-related communications such as training lessons and operational instructions.

The Brothers in the service of our legion all adhere to the noble goal to protect our honour and pride as Fascists and to defend ourselves against harassment and hostile aggression from the brainwashed and the deluded. We are equally dedicated to cleansing pockets of decadence and combating the cancer of the [i]radical left[/i] with surgical precision, lest we allow the beautiful sounds of the world of the NationStates to silence and die under their boot and heel.
