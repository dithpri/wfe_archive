Granhif is a large and geographically remote region of the world consisting of several large landmasses and a handfull of islands, some of which form small archipelagos. The region consists of many different climate zones and features all kinds of geographical features, with several large oceans separating the major landmasses, though the distance between them varies. Natural resources are abundant and the environment is cherished by the first major native group and founders of the first nation in the region, known as Hyphersians.
