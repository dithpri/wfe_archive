Welcome to the Fall semester of 2019! I created this region for you to explore how countries change overtime and how the founding ideals can stay or change as well. Enjoy! 

Rules! 
You may NOT leave this region until the semester is over. 
Do not share the password with outside class students- this is for me to monitor student understanding of government and functions.
