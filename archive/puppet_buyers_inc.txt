You&amp;#39;re on NS, looking at your region, when you see this:

12 hours ago- PUPPET ceased to exist.
12 hours ago- PUPPET123 ceased to exist.
12 hours ago- PUPPETLOL ceased to exist.

And those puppets just keep scrolling down.

You don&amp;#39;t [i]need[/i] 1902 puppets. 

So send them to Puppet Buyers Inc., where puppets can be bought or sold or free- or for a price.

Also request a puppet with name, flag, etc...

At PBI, we&amp;#39;ll handle it for you.
