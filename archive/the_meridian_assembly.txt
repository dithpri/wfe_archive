The Meridian Assembly is a writing-first geopolitical roleplay region set on a fully fictional planet. We prioritize realism, institutional depth, and long-term narrative continuity.
Leadership positions are elected, governance is structured, and all conflict must remain grounded and mutually agreed upon. Godmodding and low-effort participation are not tolerated.
This region is built for serious writers seeking meaningful diplomacy, internal politics, and collaborative worldbuilding.
If you value structure, consequence, and consistency, you may find your place here.
