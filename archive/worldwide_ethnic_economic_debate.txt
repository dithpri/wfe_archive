Worldwide Ethnic Economic Debate (WEED) is a multinational and multicultural region, known for its solutions to all the &quot;smoking&quot; issues of today&#39;s society. The leaders of the member nations of this &quot;joint&quot; region like to gather around the table and discuss the issues that are gathered in the &quot;pot&quot; as they call it. The pride of the members is &quot;high&quot; all year long. Sometimes they &quot;blunt&quot;ly express their opinion, generating some arguments. They are doing what they &quot;can-&quot;, despite the &quot;-abyss&quot; that seperates their beliefs from one another.
