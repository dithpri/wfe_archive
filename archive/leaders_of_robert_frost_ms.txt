All members are scholars enrolled in a Contemporary Communications course at Robert Frost Middle School. Active participation in this virtual world, will allow students to evaluate and develop their perspectives in the real world. Our delegation would be interested in constructing embassies with any region(s) of a mutual &quot;school class&quot; designation to enrich our experiences. Our region is a unique opportunity to explore and discover the dynamics of politics, diplomacy, and communication. We take the road less traveled by!
