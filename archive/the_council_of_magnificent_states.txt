Welcome to the Council of Magnificent States you mortal beings. We are a council of great states that have formed in the year of 8090. We are mature, futuristic, intelligent, and advanced beings unlike you mortals. We do roleplaying during our wars and also, we have council meetings and discussions. However, we are more than a council. We are like a whole person, operating like one, functioning successfully. Please follow the rules listed below:

1. Do not spam
2. Do not criticize other council members
3. Do not swear
4. Be respectful towards others
5. Have fun!
