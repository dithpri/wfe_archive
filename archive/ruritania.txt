A large steppe-plain interspersed with deep temperate woods and surrounded by low mountains in the Eastern Balkans, Ruritania is the traditional home of the Ruritans. After fighting with the NAZI&amp;#39;s in WWII to maintain independence, the nation of Ruritania was split into the People&amp;#39;s Republic of Ruritania in the east and the Confederacy of Ruritania in the west.
