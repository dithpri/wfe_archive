[b][color=#000080][region]THE NEW WARSAW PACT[/region] (TNWP) is the war-torn cousin of a close-knit region where creativity and diversity are encouraged and rewarded, and Orson Scott Card&amp;#39;s Ender Saga is valued above all else. We welcome all who wish to join, regardless of political, social, or cultural ideals and beliefs... Except Nazis. We don&amp;#39;t like them.[/color][/b]
