Containing KonstanzGretchen and Administrative Zones under the partial Administrative Control of KonstanzGretchen Government.

In 2013, a new government (KonstanzGretchen Government) took control of the Futureurasia, Futureurasian Kaminska and it&amp;#39;s KSAR Zones after an administrative change in control.
Now Futureurasia, Futureurasian Kaminska and it&amp;#39;s KSAR Zones have been merged into a new administrative country (KonstanzGretchen), and the former region containing those countries has been renamed KonstanzGretchen Region and is under the majority administrative and territorial control of the KonstanzGretchen Government.
