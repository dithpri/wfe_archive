Unknown Space is loosely defined as all the regions of the galaxy which remain largely unexplored. It consists mostly of the region between the Outer Rim and the hyperspace disturbance at the outermost edge of the galaxy, but also includes dense globular clusters and regions to which hyperspace travel is difficult or impractical. Due to its isolation from the larger galactic community, it has developed its own distinct community and culture; however, the worlds of the region still maintains sporadic relations with the rest of the galaxy.
