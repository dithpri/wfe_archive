The Confederacy is a great region open to all nations.

All who join will be given citizenship protection and will always be given a chance to rejoin if kicked by raids via telegrams.

If you have proven yourself (have been a citizen for +3 months and proven helpful via raiding, defending, helping out the forum etc.), you will gain the rank of officer and temporary power

If you prove your self worthy as an officer you will be given promotions.
