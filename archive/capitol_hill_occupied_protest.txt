Preemptively founded in conjunction with [region]CHOP[/region]. CHOP is a group of traitorous anarchists and Democrat vote slaves who incite violence and disruption against the people of Seattle. They don&#39;t allow independent cameras inside the boundaries of the rebellion to film, for example, [url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/twitch-streamer-claims-he-was-threatened-and-grabbed-inside-seattles-chop]a Twitch streamer was grabbed and then threatened[/url] for filming the events inside. Does that sound like peaceful and responsible behavior for protestors? I didn&#39;t think so. Preemptively destroyed by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation].
