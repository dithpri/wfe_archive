A place for writers in MHB to share their ideas and current projects!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This region follows all of the same rules as [region]MHBs New Earth[/region]! Except for a few that I have added! 

1. Critism, please keep it Constructive and useful. If your going to say something is terrible, please keep it polite and explain how the writer can improve!

2. Listen... [b][i]to the taco man...[/i][/b] or don&#39;t die

3. (Whatever rules come up)
