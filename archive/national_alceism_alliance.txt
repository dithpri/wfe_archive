We are a proud united peoples sworn to the worship and praise of the great Moose, Who is the center of our religion. we all praise the great antler&#39;d one, and his three sons, Felina, Cano, And Avin, a Cat, Dog, and Bird respectively. we all came from these creatures and developed as the great Antler&#39;d one saw fit, and it is based off these beliefs and the great teachings of our one true Overlord that we have come to power and run our system of government. Our alliance is dedicated to the unquestioning loyalty to he who has used his mighty hooves to craft the earth we live on. A&#39;mook
