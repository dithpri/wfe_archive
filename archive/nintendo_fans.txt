Hi, we are a casual place where you can post anything Nintendo! We will not have an actual goverment or anything set up, although I could use help with admin if I appreciate you, and embassies can post anything on here, so I would join a region with embassies here and discuss while actually participating in governments there. Obviously, we will have rules about the RMB that if you break you can get banned for, depending on the severity, but they are easy rules to follow. It&#146;s basically just no language and no inappropriate behavior.
