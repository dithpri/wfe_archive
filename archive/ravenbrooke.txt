[b][i]Welcome to [region]Ravenbrooke[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This shady town at the foot of [region]Mount Greymane[/region]&#39;s eastern slope is under the thumb of [nation=short]Mercurio the Grinning Blade[/nation], a notorious crime lord of the Rat Clan. As sad as that may sound, Mercurio is a kindly lord in comparison to some others running gangs in these parts. Think what you may of his business practices, heroes, you&#39;ll need this rat on your side if you&#39;re going to claim the throne!

The [nation=short]King of Armello[/nation]&#39;s madness deepens and the Rot is twisting his mind even further into darkness. He has cast a terrible spell, calling down lightning strikes upon the immediate vicinity, burning down homes and shops alike. Whichever Clan scores the most points will break the spell, save the settlement and earn their vassalage!
