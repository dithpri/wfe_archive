Wolvdavia is a Region that lies in the north-east of the planet Earth. The difference compared to the other countries and regions of the earth is that Woldavia is that the region is surrounded by mana meaning anyone born inside is naturally given special powers. But don&#39;t take this region lightly as there in fact many creatures and not only humans living here. Some scary, some annoying and some that are too beautiful to be true. 

SO WELCOME TO THE REGION WERE MYTHICAL CREATURES AND ALSO GODS RESIDE IN. 

This region doesn&#39;t really focus that much on politics but if you want to discuss politics you are free too. Just discuss whatever you want.
