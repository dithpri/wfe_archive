The Artic Island of Jetowa is a small, artic island with multiple nations all packed tightly together. The Artic Island of Jetowa is somewhere above Russia and was given to the Jetowian government because no Russians wanted to live there. Since then nine new nation have joined of which 3 are colonies of Jetowa. Jetowa and its colonies own almost 50% of the island while the six other countries (Dogove, Monsle, Napco, Fortune 50, Buster111, and Die Grunen Baume) own the other half separately.
