Manreza (The Sacred Search) is the search and exploration of windows to the Divine. As the Good Prophet Menasar said, &quot;Whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are profound, whatsoever things bear aloft the soul on eagles&#39; wings - think on these things&quot;. Come here and seek the divine with us.
