Welcome, comrade, to the IWA! Whether your a social democrat or a hardline socialist, the principles of liberty and freedom are guaranteed to you, and to all.

Current administrative priorities:
-Create a forum
-Establish a regional government
-Establish a clearly defined constitution

The purpose behind this region and it&amp;#39;s founding ideals are simple:
-The promise of liberty to any and all nations
-To spread the good word of the people&amp;#39;s revolution across nationstates
-To protect the interests of freedom within the World Assembly

The biggest step is usually the first. So come on rally &amp;#39;round this brave and valiant cause with tradition pride and honor at it&amp;#39;s core!
