[b]WELCOME to FONDOR[/b]

[b]OUR HISTORY[/b]
Established first as a colony of the former Nova Britannian Empire in 2008 A.D. our region has survived invasions from many formidable empires. In our early years we fought the renegade generals of Riordonia, the Empire of Mordor, the Black Riders, and most recently the [region]Glorious Nations of Iwaku[/region]. At our pinnacle we were home to nearly one hundred nations. Commanded a mighty military coalition that conquered and controlled various inferior regions.

Today we are rebuilding what once was a region to be celebrated.
