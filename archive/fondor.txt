[b]WELCOME to FONDOR[/b]

[b]REGIONAL HISTORY[/b]
Established first as a colony of the former Nova Britannian Empire in 2008 A.D. this region has survived invasions from many formidable empires. In its early years it fought the renegade generals of Riordonia, the Empire of Mordor, and the Black Riders. It owed a debt of gratitude to the [region]Glorious Nations of Iwaku[/region] who protected our region from raiders in its time of weakness. The region now stands as a monument to a historical region of the past, resurrected by the Empress of [region]The Kawaii Empire[/region], [nation=short]Kawaii_Village[/nation].
