[b]WELCOME to FONDOR[/b]

[b]OUR HISTORY[/b]
Established first as a colony of the former Nova Britannian Empire in 2008 A.D. our region has survived invasions from many formidable empires. In our early years we fought the renegade generals of Riordonia, the Empire of Mordor, and the Black Riders. We owe a debt of gratitude to the [region]Glorious Nations of Iwaku[/region] who protected our region from raiders in our time of weakness.
