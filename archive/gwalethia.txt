[color=limegreen]Welcome one and all to the Free Realm of Gwalethia,

Here you shall find a great varying amount of peoples, species, faiths, and nations. A land of fantasy and magic, but not a land that everything can be solved with the wave of a hand. Here, nations who refuse to embrace magic are not always weaker than those who do, perhaps they are stronger? [/color]
