[b]After the pesky ice cream thieves stole [region]The Black Hawks[/region] stash, the Nest was dangerously low on their sugary treats! So a couple of sergeants decided to venture forth across NationStates in search for ice cream. This region was searched and, unfortunately, had no snacks at all. On the positive side, this region was redecorated with flower pots and a few bird feathers we left behind.
