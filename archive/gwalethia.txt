[color=#ff69b4]NPA Lieutenants [nation]9003[/nation] and [nation]Nimarya[/nation] heard rumors of an ancient and evil force lurking somewhere among the innocent regions of NationStates. Little did they know that they themselves would be failures and unable to amount to any successes in their attempts to free anything; for they were the true cause of the problems. This futility was matched only by their simplicity, ignorant in the knowledge that they had no hopes or ambitions in the world, and would spend their lives alone, afraid, and sad.
