What do you think we do? No, not a revolution, nor a toppling of &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;corruption&quot;. We simply work together to help keep indirect democracy alive and well, but we do it separately. Take over our land? That`s fine, we`ll work underground. We`ve been doing it for decades. Have a belief that infringes the rights of others? No problem, we`ll simply work around you. We are the descendants of the Roman / Persian prophet Marko Reticulum Lis, and act as such. But know this: As soon as you know of the New Island Confederacy of Earth, you cannot unknow it. So be aware.
