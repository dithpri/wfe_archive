Rules:
1. No swearing in the message board, swearing will result in a week long mute.
2. Bullying in the message board will result in a permanent ban.
3. Have fun, this is a game after all.
4. Keep it professional, do not use your real name.
5. Follow site etiquette and do not post stuff that is uncomfortable or insensitive to other players.
6. If you want to change where you are on the map it&#39;s perfectly fine to draw new borders, but do not make them take over an entire landmass or overlap with another country.
