The Medwedian Alliance is an alliance led by the Medwedian Democratic Federation.

It is mainly an alliance of conservative nations. You can be Socialist or Communist or Capitalist or anything as long as you are conservative and authoritarian - Libertarians are not accepted. Dictatorships are accepted as long as they are not too evil (I mean Nazis are disallowed, but Soviet Union or North Korea would be allowed)
