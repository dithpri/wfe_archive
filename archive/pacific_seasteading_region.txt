&amp;quot;The ocean is the new frontier.&amp;quot;

With all the land on Earth already claimed, artificially-made nations are springing up in the Pacific Ocean. These islands and archipelagos are completely unique and independent from any other nations on Earth. They are often the center for political and social experiments, tries at utopia, and anything else their leader/s want them to be. The Pacific Seasteading Region is essentially a roleplay between all the diverse nations. 

This idea is based on the ideas of the real life Seasteading Institute (check out their website:http://www.seasteading.org/).
