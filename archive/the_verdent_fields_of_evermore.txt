So here is my proposal: A region dedicated to new societal philosophies, to ideals not built upon the old foundations of humanity being the center of everything. I propose that like minded individuals come together and discuss how we can build new cultural foundations by which a new mindset for humanity can be fostered. One that won&amp;#39;t see people look around them and view things as property to be owned but properties of a vast and beautiful universe that we&amp;#39;re just one small yet incredible part of. This will be done in hope of a world where everyone can at least agree that no one has the right way to live, but that the right to live is still absolute.
(By the way, such inspiring words were themselves inspired by the works of Daniel Quinn)
