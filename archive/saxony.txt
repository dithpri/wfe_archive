This region has been settled by Scots. All ethnic Germans have been deported and are forbidden from returning. Additionally, German culture and language are officially outlawed under the People&amp;#39;s Constitution of Saxony.

In the interests of security and protecting Saxony&amp;#39;s pristine environment, the Scottish government of Saxony has introduced password protection.
