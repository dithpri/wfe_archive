Made for us noobs, who are still trying to figure this out. Fun, low-key group. No stuck-up people and no fighting. 
New and trying to get on our feet. Looking for players who aren&#39;t too serious. Role-players are always welcome. Advertising is permitted (please don&#39;t abuse). 

We promote free thinking, good vibes and individuality. 
We fight for our freedom and choices of will. 
We are looking for friendly faces. Playful and fun-loving. 
We are casual, snarky and a bit over the edge.
We have all banned cars.
