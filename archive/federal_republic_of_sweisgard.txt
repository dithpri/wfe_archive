The Federal Republic of Sweisgard originates from the formation of merchant and holy lands tied together through close ancestral roots of the Holy Sweis family.

The Federal Republic uses a partially democratic system, where only a small set of leaders in the Sweis bloodline (excluding bastards) vote for another Sweis family member to become the chief magistrate, who decides whether or not to pass national reforms and have the leading vote in such times.

The Federal Republic of Sweisgard prefer neutrality and to not expand their land unless provoked by another country with force. The Sweis people keep to themselves and have limited migration and emigration abilities within the Sweisgard law.
