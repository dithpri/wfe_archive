Under the Protection of the Eurasian Economic Community and her associate region of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the State of Israel hopes to establish peaceful and cooperative relationships with all the sovereign entities in the world. Being a nation which endured trials throughout the centuries, the State of Israel shall not condone any acts of discrimination, imperialism and hate. As such it is in the interests of Israel to harmonize the east and west, north and south, and seek a common consensus with our International Partners, brothers and sisters.
