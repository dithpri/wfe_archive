Derived from the Ancient Guangnese word &amp;#39;Baolinfa&amp;#39; meaning &amp;#39;home island&amp;#39;, this region is primarily characterized by a distinct sense of cultural diversity and separate nationalism, yet it&amp;#39;s people are somewhat similar in thought.  Originally a unified empire, this region is made up of one large island and a small grouping of surrounding islands, most of which are claimed by various nations and are therefore a point of regional tension.  The United Socialist States of Gongchangzhuyi Guang make up the majority of the region, including the Free Land of Mei Hai Gang, which is allowed a special level of autonomy from mainland Guang.
