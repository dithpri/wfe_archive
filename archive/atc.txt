[b]We, a great group of [u]wolves[/u], noticed your region had a really [u]big [/u]forest, but all of those poor trees were alone! Because of that, we&#39;ve decided to become lumberjacks and as such have thrown all of your trees down with [color=red]axes[/color] and [color=steelblue]chainsaws[/color]. Now, your [color=darkgreen]trees[/color] won&#39;t ever feel lonely again, as they&#39;ll hold our cups and axes until we see the next forest. You can claim your freshly made wolfwoodz plank here, on our [url=https://discord.gg/w485XJ9QPa]communications hub[/url] [hr][color=red]Lone Wolves United[/color] - We care about nature[/b]
