[b][color=purple]Welcome to the United States of CBHS![/color] 
[color=yellow]The Delegate will be given Executive power tomorrow afternoon. Please note that the WA Delegate is determined each day by who has the most endorsements- so if you are displeased with him, you are always welcome to stage a coup to overthrow him. Delegates are allowed to do whatever they please with their power, if you don&amp;#39;t like that (ban, kick, etc)- stage a coup. Thanks, Emperor Jake Horizo of Horizonia.[/color][/b]
