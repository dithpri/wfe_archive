[b][color=purple]Welcome to the United States of CBHS![/color][/b] 
[color=gold]The &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; elections have ended- but no one was &amp;quot;officially&amp;quot; chosen- so the position of WA Delegate will be given to whomever ends up with more votes. The brawl&amp;#39;s between [nation]The One Eyed men[/nation] and [nation]Alba Flora[/nation] who currently tied at 4 endorsements. One of the problems is that many of our citizens had to withdraw from the WA as a result of being accused of being &amp;quot;multies&amp;quot; (read in the site&amp;#39;s FAQ to find out what that is), as a result, many of the endorsements those nations gave were taken away. Hopefully this gets cleared up soon.[/color]
