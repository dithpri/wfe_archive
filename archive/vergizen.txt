[I]A small region, discovered and occupied by [nation]Northern European Federation[/nation] forces not long ago. It soon became home to our most trusted of allies. There has only ever been one takeover attempt when forces of DEN temporarily secured the region, but thanks to swift and decisive action on behalf of the NEF the problem was solved. An accepting region who is always willing to open it`s doors for those who wish to stay, [region]Vergizen[/region] can always be considered a home[/I]
