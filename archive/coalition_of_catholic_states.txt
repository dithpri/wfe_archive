[b]Greetings. We welcome you to the Coalition of Catholic States.[/b]

This region is founded in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. We however, do not exclude anyone from our discussions. We believe, as Catholics, that we shall treat our neighbors as we would like to be treated. 

We were re-founded on the 19th of April in the year 2015 with the help of the UDL.
