Welcome to the [b]Coalition of Catholic States[/b]! We are a region founded in Communion with the Roman Catholic Church.

We are a peaceful and friendly region, and if you have questions about Catholicism we will do our best to answer them.

We do have a map. If you&#39;d like to make a claim, please do so in the message board and if no one disagrees we&#39;ll add you on the map.
