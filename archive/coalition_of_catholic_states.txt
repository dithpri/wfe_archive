Greetings! This region is founded in communion with the [B][color=red]Roman Catholic Church[/color][/B]. However, everyone is welcome.

[B][color=purple]&quot;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.&quot; Romans 15:13[/color][/B]

We were re-founded on 19 April 2015 with the help of the UDL.
We beat a DEN raid on 29 January 2016.
We promptly solved a seize attempt on 12 July 2018.
