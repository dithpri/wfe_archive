Greetings. We welcome you to the Coalition of Catholic States.

This region is dedicated to those who are in communion with the Roman Catholic Church, though all are welcome.
Refounded on 4/19/15 with the help of the UDL.

Today we start fresh. We will soon have a new forum which will have an archive of the old one in it, we will have new elections for government soon, a new regional map, and we will return to our former glory.
