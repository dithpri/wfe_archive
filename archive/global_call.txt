[b]I know it sometimes takes you guys some time to detag regions, but really, isn&amp;#39;t 62 days kind of pushing it? Maybe just a little.

Normally we don&amp;#39;t do this, but [region]Europeia[/region] decided that it was high time we did your job for you and detagged this place. Of course, we had to leave our business card behind too, so you&amp;#39;d know who did your job for you. 

Well, toodles!

Thanks to our allies in [region]Kantrias[/region] and [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] for their help![/b]
