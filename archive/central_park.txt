[hr][b]Central Park[/b][hr][i]A carefully curated patch of order pretending to be wilderness.[/i]

Once a wild experiment in grass, trees, and optimism, Central Park is now a bustling commons where joggers, picnickers, policy wonks, and pigeons coexist under an uneasy truce. The region prides itself on green ideals, civil debate, and the firm belief that rules are best enforced politely, but firmly.

Nations here value community, moderation, and the sacred right to sit on a bench and judge everyone passing by.
