&#147;We&#146;re going to win. We&#146;re going to win so much. We&#146;re going to win at trade, we&#146;re going to win at the border. We&#146;re going to win so much, you&#146;re going to be so sick and tired of winning, you&#146;re going to come to me and go &#145;Please, please, we can&#146;t win anymore.&#146; You&#146;ve heard this one. You&#146;ll say &#145;Please, Mr. President, we beg you sir, we don&#146;t want to win anymore. It&#146;s too much. It&#146;s not fair to everybody else. And I&#146;m going to say &#145;I&#146;m sorry, but we&#146;re going to keep winning, winning, winning, We&#146;re going to make Skutt great again.&#148;
