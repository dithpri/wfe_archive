[b][color=darkblue]The Earth colonized the inner and outer planets. But the Solar System is still the limit and humanity is still not united. On earth, four powerful blocs are in a state of war while most of the colonies have declared their independence. The whole system is at the brink of desaster and a single incident may change our lives forever...

Take over one of the factions of Earth or one of the independent colonies in the solar system and lead your people through this difficult times in THE SOLAR COUNCIL![/b][/color]
