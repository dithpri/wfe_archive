Successful Nation States campaign for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to [b][color=green]LEAVE[/b][/color] the European Union. We represent the future of Europe and British people that wish for the UK [b]NEVER[/b] to rejoin the EU and other such disasterous political projects ever again. We stand as a symbol to the rest of the European people still wishing for their own emancipation and will do our best to inspire other Leave votes across the EU in the coming years.
