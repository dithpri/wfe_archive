[b]Introduction[/b]
This is Drackha, one of NationStates new regions. As [region]Brescia[/region] was collapsing, so was the nations inside of it. 5 nations ceased to exist during the chaos, and, surprisingly only 1 nation got banned! If you don&#39;t know what [region]Brescia[/region] was, it was my past region I founded, only made it 2 months, I kind of gave up on it after the regions destruction, by kicking everyone out. 
  But Drackha will be different, I am hoping this time my region will succeed. Hopefully it will because I have to lose all of my influence by founding this region, I will need to gain it all over again, need to send a heck of lot of recruitment telegrams again, this will be my nations restart.
