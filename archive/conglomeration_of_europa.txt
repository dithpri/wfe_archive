After the unification wars in the early 1930s, France gained much territory in Benelux, Iberia and Italy. This brought them to form the Plaga Magna, a union of Western Europe. Poland took great interest in these movements and followed suit while Germany and the U.K. were distracted, seizing most of the Balkans and Czechoslovakia. They then founded the country of Leshia, dedicated to bringing Poland back to the powerhouse it was in the middle ages. The two soon became allies and invaded the remaining European nations.
