The star Spica &#150; aka Alpha Virginis &#150; is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo the Maiden. From a distance of about 250 light-years, Spica appears to us on Earth as a lone bluish-white star in a quiet region of the sky. But Spica consists of two stars and maybe more. Both stars are larger and hotter than our sun. And they&#146;re separated by only 11 million miles (less than 18 million km), in contrast to Earth&#146;s distance from our sun of 93 million miles (150 million km). They orbit their common center of gravity in only four days.
