[b]Today, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] took a brisk hike through the mountains and forest paths of NationStates and came across a whole bunch of tags scattered on the ground. Weird! Not wanting any wild bears to mistake them for food, our worldly feathered friends have picked them all up and delicately applied them to this region. Remember, Refuge the Black Hawk says don&#39;t be a quitter - take care of your litter!
