[b][color=blue]Welcome to Ferelden Weary Traveler,
We are a weary nation, having only known peace for 15 years,[/color]
[color=red]We are rebuilding but rebuilding to slowly,
We have needs that need to be filled in our social structure,[/color]
[color=red]Needs like Knights, Banns, Arls, and Teryns.[/color]
[color=red]We would greatly like for you to settle here and
for you to help us rebuild and rule your area of appointment with a just and even hand,
From King Joseph Theirin.[/color]
