A pocket dimension that appeared on the former territory of Lusonnia,in the East Pacific.
It isn&#39;t clear if it&#39;s origin is of an artificial nature or not,but what is clear is Lusonnians took the opportunity to evacuate their entire population to the other side,and most of their former territory was ceded to neighboring countries in exchange for raw and processed materials,several types of seeds,and even livestock.
At present,on this &quot;side of the fence&quot;,their  territory is no more than 160-square kilometers,but it is heavily fortified and guarded by crack troops and elite commando detachments who rotate on a half-a-year basis.
