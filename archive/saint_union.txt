[b]Welcome to The Saint Union![/b]

The Saint Union was formed to protect itself from the harmful influence of extremist international organizations. It helps free peaceful countries unite to create a prosperous future. Our region will try to take into account the interests of everyone who joins us, and will also support if you need help in a difficult situation. During this difficult time, we must stick together!

We are a completely young region, so if you have ideas or suggestions, then feel free to write here on the forum, or contact the regional administration:
