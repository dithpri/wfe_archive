A coalition of rational dictatorships run for the common benefit. 

Our principles are to maximize personal freedoms while protecting animals, the environment and the people. Our Governments give jobs to all unemployed people rather than welfare. Businesses are free from high taxes but must abide by animal protection and environmental laws. Our people are free to do or say anything as long as it does not physically harm any human or animal. Our Citizens do not have political or voting rights, this prevents the tyranny of the majority.
