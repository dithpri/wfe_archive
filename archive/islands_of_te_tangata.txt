There are three islands. One is Te Tangata. The second is Riverbed, for its river slicing it in half. The third is named by many names, but is often called &#147;The Mines.&#148; This used to be part of Riverbed, but after the river came in for months, it got deep enough to require most to ride a boat through. It is a dangerous area and settlers can be found &#147;mining&#148; the earth there. It is unknown what their main goal of coming here is.
