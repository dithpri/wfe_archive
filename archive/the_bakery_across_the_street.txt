After you stagger out of [region]The Bar On The Corner Of Every Region[/region], stop in for coffee to help sober up, with a delicious pastry to get that terrible taste out of your mouth! We are just across the street so it won&#146;t take long to stop in!

We proudly serve the finest Toraja coffee from Sulawesi, and our Sunda teas come from the hills around Bandung, Indonesia. 

Our specialty is glazed donuts with [color=green]Durian[/color] fruit filling. [color=blue]Enjoy![/color]
