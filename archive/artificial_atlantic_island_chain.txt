The massive chain of islands runs across the Atlantic from Scandinavia, diagonally to Cuba.  There are over 3,000 islands in the long chain, each about the size of the U.S. state of Rhode Island.  &amp;quot;The Chain&amp;quot; as it is called locally was created by the Community of Sovera, a small break-off society of Swedish descent.  The Chain is occupied only by the Soveran-Swede Ethnic Group at the time but they are hoping to increase immigration.  Recently, the Community of Sovera has created a large spacecraft acting as a station for expansion.   The ship is designed to service as a city, increasing room for new AAIC associated nations.
