Bienvenue and welcome to New France! Established by the French Consulate on ideas from the Revolutionary and Napoleonic government, this land is a haven for conservative and authoritarian nations. The region is anti-Communist and anti-Fascist, and only moderately liberal, so only fairly conservative nations or authoritarian ones should consider joining. Feel free to ask to build an embassy. Vive le Consulat!
