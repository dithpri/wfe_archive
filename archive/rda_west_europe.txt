The RDA (Regional defensive alliance) of West Europe is a co-operative and defense pact between the nations of the west European sphere, built along the now-defunct lines of the previous Co-Prosperity union of Europe, the successor state to the EU. It is no longer a single administrative entity but formed with the ideals of an alliance and regional protective pact. The RDA shares open borders, economic markets and has its own parliament, but nations within it remain functionally independent and hold their own elections in addition to those held by the RDA&#39;s board of elected administrators (parliament).
