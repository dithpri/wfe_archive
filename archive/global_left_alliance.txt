[color=green]Othin spake:
44. &amp;quot;Much have I fared, | much have I found,
Much have I got of the gods:
What shall live of mankind | when at last there comes
The mighty winter to men?&amp;quot;

Vafthruthnir spake:
45. &amp;quot;In Hoddmimir&amp;#39;s wood | shall hide themselves
Lif and Lifthrasir then; The morning dews | for meat shall they have,
Such food shall men then find.&amp;quot;[/color]
