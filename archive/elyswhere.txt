A newly discovered continent with currently only 4 offical countries documented. The Kingdom of Hoshid ruler Empress Anasztaizia Duci ca Antalek is the current president of the Region.

Current Relations:
(Kingdom of Hoshid) and (The Kingdom of Da Monica) are currently closely allied.So closely allied that their two monarchs have each others phone numbers.However, because they are so close the two rulers are known to argue often over trival matters.Many witnesses swear that the Empress was yelling into the phone one evening arguing about cheese.

If anyone wants me to add to the Relations tell me.
