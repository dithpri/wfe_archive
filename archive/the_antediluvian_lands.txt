Chronicles and legends around the world abound with tales of a great flood that came forth, cleansing all the forests and mountains, wiping out all traces of whatever mighty civilisations reigned. No name exists for them, no records of what the people were like, none of their desires or fears known to us now.

This is the story of the lands, before the floods came. 
Armies will clash.
Heroes will be forged.
Cities will burn.
Valour and honour will be the watchwords of those who live here.
And death will be their shadow.
This...is the Antediluvian Lands.
