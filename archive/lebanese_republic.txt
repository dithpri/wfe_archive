Lebanon, officially the [b]Lebanese Republic[/b], is a country in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south. Lebanon&#39;s location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity.

Lebanon&#146;s economy follows a laissez-faire model. Most of the economy is dollarized, and the country has no restrictions on the movement of capital across its borders.&#151;Wikipedia[hr]
