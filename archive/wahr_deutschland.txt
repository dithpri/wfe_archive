Wahr Deutschland was originally founded after a civil war in which smaller states/nations succeeded from a country which was moving away from their beliefs and was plagued by an influx of refugees/immigrants who slowly began to take over the country and made traditional ethnic groups a minority. None of these new nations focused on a new set of principles and ideas except to restore traditions and values which once made their home nation great.
