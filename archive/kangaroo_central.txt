There&#146;s a lot of kangaroos, that&#146;s about it. JK!

(Real Entry)(Definitely Not Written By Kangaroos) This is Kangaroo Central, home to the largest kangaroo population in the world (NOT AUSTRALIA). Based on the concept of world domination (mostly), we are very competitive (we even have professional kangaroo boxers)(NOT THE UNDERWEAR), (however that&#146;s a good idea). Although, overall we are just a group of moronic kangaroos (HUMANS!) that want to have fun!

EVENTS:
- Kangaroo Egg Hunt; April 20th
