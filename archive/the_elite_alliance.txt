Thank you all for coming and joining us here today. We are pleased to be able to welcome those of you that have been with us for some time now as well as those of you who are new to our (group/community/association etc.). Today marks our (5th) (annual) group meeting and we are very proud to be able to host it today here at (location) with all of you. Just before we get started, I would like to express my gratitude to all of you who so generously helped us make this event come together smoothly,  we couldn&#39;t have done it without you!
