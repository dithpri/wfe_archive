We are a group of American First Conservatives.

Bill of rights for &quot;America First&quot;

Amendment 1: Free speech as far as the Nation-States Rules allow.

Amendment 2: Right to Trial by Jury. If I the founder think you a guilty of any offenses a poll will be hosted to determine your sentence however raiding or spamming is an instant ban you also have the right to know what you&#39;re being prosecuted for.

Come on America First is inevitable.
