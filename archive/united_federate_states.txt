JOIN [b][region=Votis et Koronia][/b] to complete the merge. UPDATE FROM THW FOUNDER. EVERY NATION MUST MOVE TO THE NEW REGION BY THE END OF THIS WEEK. OR FACE IMMINENT BANNING

All remaining nations are to send a telegram to [nation]Rapture Novice[/nation] so that I can get a clear number of who is still alive. I am going to stay in the region until either everyone dies off, or until everyone leaves. I guess if I am banned from here as well.
 
Desolving of embassys will comence once we have reached a population of three nations. I will not be accepting any new Embassys or new nations either. The password is to keep raiders out. I prefer to keep this region out of their....grasps.
