[color=red][i]&quot;I, a citizen of the Peoples Union of Socialist Republics, joining the ranks of the Workers&#39; and Peasants&#39; Red Army, do hereby take the oath of allegiance and do solemnly vow to be an honest, brave, disciplined and vigilant fighter, to guard strictly all military and State secrets, to obey implicitly all Army regulations and orders of my commanders, commissars and superiors. And if through evil intent I break this solemn oath, then let the stern punishment of the Soviet law, and the universal hatred and contempt of the working people, fall upon me.&quot;[/i][/color]
