Long ago, a temple was built on the planet by a female Sith Lord. It doubled as a place of worship, 
and a super-weapon powered by a giant Kyber crystal. Jedi Knights, having heard of the weapon,
advanced to the planet and attacked it. It malfunctioned and turned the combatants to stone, 
making them frozen in time for thousands of years.
