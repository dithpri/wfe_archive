This region is council that decides everything. Not the people. Being an officer you are a member of the council. You can run for being an officer and must gain the peoples trust. Then the people elect 4 people. I am the Head of house. The World Assembly Delegate is only to represent the region.

To run for office of being part of the Council contact and be approved by San Francisco Republic to run. 

The Election starts when the is a minimum of 10 nations and will start every 4 years.

[b]WARNING WA Delegate does not count as a officer. You will only be Repersenting this region. You are like our mascot.[/b]

Long Live the Republic.
