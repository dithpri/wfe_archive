Welcome to the Sira Inclusive Research Alliance
The aim of this region is to develop an online research community and academy, because research and science is pretty interesting!

Here, we strive to take decisions according to reason, without forgetting heart

Our nominated Main Administrator will coordinate the alliance,
And our elected Grand Communicator will make our voices heard!

Whoever you are, we greet you!
