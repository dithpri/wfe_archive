Welcome, one and all, to The Anti Democratic Regime of Solomoge! Solomoge, and all the nations within it, believe that democracy is the root of all evil and it needs to be abolished.
Other than the Anti-Democratic thing, we&#39;re pretty normal. We currently are lacking in nation-power, so, unless you are a democracy, feel free to join! Especially if you&#39;re in the WA. Once we get enough officers, we&#39;ll combine them all to create a High Court, and once we get enough nations we&#39;ll combine them all and make a Parliament. All of this will be with the glorious Founder and WA Delegate ruling as the Co-Emperors. So what are you waiting for? Come and join! Unless you&#39;re a democracy, of course.
