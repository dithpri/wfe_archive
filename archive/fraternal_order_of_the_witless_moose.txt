Welcome to the [b][region]Fraternal Order of the Witless Moose[/region][/b], a proud lodge of questionable wisdom, creaky traditions, and unshakeable fellowship. Here, the coffee is strong, the minutes are poorly kept, and every meeting somehow ends with a parade nobody authorized.

Pull up a chair beneath the mounted antlers, salute the portrait you don&#146;t recognize, and enjoy a region where good intentions vastly outnumber good ideas. Hats are encouraged, passwords are forgotten, and the lodge doors are always open&#151;provided someone can find the key.
