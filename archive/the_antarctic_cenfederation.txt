Founded in 2013 after the Miner Uprising.
After the discovery of massive oil and mineral deposits, various nations around the globe sent teams to exploit the resources of the barren continent. While banned by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, this was quickly ignored by most countries to the point that the treaty was repelled in 2010 with the United States, Canada, and Australia the only dissenting votes.

The Miner Uprising of 2012 resulted from harsh conditions placed on workers by mineral mining corperations. Chinese mining labor camp 403, located near Mount Terra Nova, contained over 3000 political prisoners when a prison riot occured that resulted in a takeover.
