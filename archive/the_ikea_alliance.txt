The Genghis Khan of regions. Our nation was first a cluttered mess of land. Uncivilized and savage were our civilians. Then, through the guiding hands of a found booklet, the people of Ikea were able to unite as one. Like a chair, we support our people. Like a table, we hold the food that feeds. Like a nightstand, we protect our civilians through the dark reaches of the night. Through poorly constructed furniture metaphors, we hold our values as true as the contents of a meatball.
