The Grand British Empire is open to all those with a traditional Monarch as head of state (meaning, they must be styled/titled as &quot;King,&quot; &quot;Queen,&quot; &quot;Emperor,&quot; or other traditional title). The head of this Region is styled as &quot;High King/Queen,&quot; and rules the Region as well as their respective nation. The High Monarch appoints ministers and counselors, and answers somewhat to a Constitution. (Think of it as how Skyrim is ruled but with additions.)
