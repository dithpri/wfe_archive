Palladium recognises the importance of communitarianism and multiculturalism, and how cultural diversity represents truly who we are - not a homogenous, single idea of being a society. New nations are welcome to explore economic development without destroying the ecology, as well as social freedom that honours how the individual is found in community, not as an isolated, selfish creature who wants and gets what they want at the expense of others.
