[b]Welcome to the United Nations of Americia![/b]

[b]General Information[/b]
We are a model UN simulator, so we are founder-less. The WA Delegate becomes the &amp;quot;Secretary General&amp;quot; until a new one is put in place. Every week, we will have a featured nation, as soon as we have at least two nations. On our offsite forum (coming soon), we will have a nomination thread for nation of the week. We will then have a poll, and that nation will become the Nation of the Week.
