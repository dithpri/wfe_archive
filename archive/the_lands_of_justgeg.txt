Justgeg is a giant mountain located in the middle of a humongous land mass that is remarkably stunning to look at. These lands are considered sacred by local tribes and at the time it was discovered it was said to be home to a legendary giant crab. This crab has yet to be discovered but the tribe elders say that they have seen it with their own eyes and that it protects the island from any other &#39;Giants&#39; that come over. However evidence of the existence of such creatures has yet to be found.
