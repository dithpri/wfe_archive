Akerley is a land known for it&#39;s large open fields. It&#39;s name comes from the Old English [b]Acker[/b] and [b]Leah[/b], meaning large field. While the populace tends to enjoy these picturesque views formed by these plains, it is suggested that they are not long for this world as the leaders of Akerley have a focus on Industrial and Economic advancement as opposed to Environmental preservation. 

Akerley was once an unknown region hidden from time and humanity alike, but has in recent times become a popular tourist attraction. That being said the general populace tends to like to  make cash without any large concern for morals.
