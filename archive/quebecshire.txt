After the puppet sweep of [nation=short+noflag]Puetavisa[/nation]/[nation=short+noflag]Affray[/nation], [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation] was foolishly entrusted with the protection of this region by the leadership of [region]Sanctum[/region]. Little did they know, that was [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=2591013]a terrible idea[/url]. This region is now held in conjunction with regions like [region]Magyar[/region] as a trophy against the hate and misdeeds of the [region]Sanctum[/region]/[region]The Wolf Clan[/region] posse - people that the empire helped put an end to once and for all.
