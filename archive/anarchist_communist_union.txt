The Anarchist-Communist Union is a leaderless region, promoting true workers rights. A land where workers make decisions together through direct democracy and no middlemen. Each trade has a union which is ran by those who work that trade, not any above them. We are protected by our defense forces, militias made up of volunteers. Our Foreign Brigades are made up and deployed by the will of workers trying to help fight for communism and anarchism abroad. 

Glory to the WORKER!
