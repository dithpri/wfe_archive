Welcome to Lyyt

[color=turquoise]In the year 2012, the world is levelled by a destructive nuclear war, that leaves Earth uninhabitable. 100 years latter the people, who&amp;#39;ve been in space since the war, have been allowed to go back to Earth. Leaders of new countries, free of previous political opinions of each other, are elected by an anomalous government like group. To this day, all leaders agree, to avoid another war, [b]we must tolerate all.[/b][/color]
