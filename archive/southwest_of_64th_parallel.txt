In the recent 28 days, rioting and a epidemic has resulted in a war against the Communist Regime of the North and the 64th Fighting Battalion. The 64th Fighting Battalion 2nd Construction Company set up a large camp 28 miles southwest of the 64th Parallel.  This camp will eventually become the capital of the new country. While the country is only the size of California, the boarder is large and heavily guarded to the north-northeast. The Parallel keeps the violent and infected people of the North out, from our fortified positions in the mountains we can see the border.
