A world of books and libraries, endless halls of knowledge and thinking, academia compiles all of our worldly scholarship into a mass of knowledge that radiates pure revelation.

Walk through a quite park or hike up one of the unending alleys in the great libraries. Trek through the wired landscapes of a huge server room or spend a misty afternoon on the steps of the great secular monastery of the mountains.

Enter the world of knowlege.
