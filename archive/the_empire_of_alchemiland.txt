Founded by Alchemiland to escape the boring rules and politics of other Empires. In The Empire of Alchemiland all nations can rule themselves based upon their own beliefs without interference from other nations. If you want to be good then be good, if you want to be bad then be bad or even if you want to be somewhere in between so be it. It&amp;#39;s up to you. The only condition is that no nations within the Empire can declare war against each other or argue with each others way of life. All nations must be willing to unite together if the Empire or any nation within the Empire is attacked by another Empire or Nation.
