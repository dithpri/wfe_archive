[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

This region was occupied by the [region]Aryan Taskforce[/region]. 

After Aryan Taskforce leader &amp;quot;German&amp;quot; renounced Nazism, Fatherland and the other conquered regions of the Taskforce became &amp;quot;Anti-Fascist and pro communist&amp;quot;, although it retained its embassy with the [region]The Greater German Reich[/region].

In the past this region was refounded and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of Anti-Fascism.
