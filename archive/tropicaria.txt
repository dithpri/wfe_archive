Tropicaria is a stretch of forest and coastline ruled with a fair and gentle fist by [nation]Whacoposgowro[/nation].

Recent political intrigue has prompted the region&amp;#39;s Ministry of Peace to be relocated to [nation]Mutually Assured Construction[/nation], giving the nation exceptional new powers and essentially making the country Tropicaria&amp;#39;s leader of Intra-regional trade and relations. It is unknown what new developments may result from this bestowal of power.

In another turn of events, involving alleged backroom deals and dubious ethics, [nation]Black Hand[/nation] has been named the Regional Peacekeeper, a new position of unknown power and influence. Time will tell what leverage the new title carries.
