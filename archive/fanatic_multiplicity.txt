Well straight to the point, this is a community for your stereotypical fangirl/fanboy
If you&#39;ve ever felt an extreme amount of &quot;feels&quot; due to a certain show, book, YouTuber, or music artist, here you can find a group of people with obsessions similar to your own. 

Some examples of fandoms  are:
Supernatural, Doctor Who, Psych, Sherlock, Ouran High School Host Club, etc.
Maze Runner, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Dork Diaries, etc.
Dan and Phil, MyNamesChai, Pointlessblog, ThatcherJoe, TylerOakley, NigaHiga, etc.
Panic! At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, Twenty One Pilots, etc.

Well, I hope you can find something to obsess with everyone about :)
