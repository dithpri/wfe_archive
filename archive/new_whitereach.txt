[b]New Whitereach[/b] was once the respected and temporary homeland for the original inhabitants of Whitereach after Whitereach was raided and refounded, and thus removed from their control. New Whitereach has been through a lot, from being the homeland of the inhabitants of Whitereach, to being a puppet storage region, to being a colony of [region]Romana[/region]. Once New Whitereach was reclaimed, it became a barren, desolate, empty region and now wallows in the darkest corners of NationStates and Whitereach&amp;#39;s history.

Please note that [region]Whitereach[/region] is our homeland, [region]The Whitereach Empire[/region] is our empire, and [region]Blackreach[/region] is our puppet storage region.
