After the terraformation of the moon, many countries wanted a part of it. A company called &#39;The Commerce Federation&#39; took control and only let a specific group of countries on to the now lush and beautiful moon. All of the countries are in turn owned and ruled by a single person, this person is the executive of the Commerce Federation and the ruler of all the countries on Ganymede.
