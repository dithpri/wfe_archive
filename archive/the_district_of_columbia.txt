This region was set up by [region]Nationalsozialistische Volksstaaten[/region] as part of its &amp;quot;National Socialist empire&amp;quot;. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].[hr]Welcome to the District of Columbia, aka Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States of America! Visit President [nation=short]Josiah Bartlet[/nation]&amp;#39;s administration at [region]Pennsylvania Avenue[/region], encourage the legislators in [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=house_of_congress]the Capitol[/url] to do some legislating, tour the gigantic Smithsonian museum network, pay your respects at nearby Arlington National Cemetery... there are so many neat things to do in D.C. Alternatively, you could just ride the subway around - that&amp;#39;s also pretty neat.
