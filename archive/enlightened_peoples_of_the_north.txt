We are the Enlightened Peoples of the North. A region dominated by radical nations, we defend our right to govern how we please, but if you oppress your citizens or deny them their basic human rights, we will ensure you will change your actions, or you will pay for it. The founder, Westermire, is a leftist state promising to ensure excellent human rights to their people. Her dictator, a fair man, promises to be fair to all his citizens. That spirit shall be the primary principle in day-to-day business of this renowned region.
