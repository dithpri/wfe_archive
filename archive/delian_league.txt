All members of the Delian League will never go to war with each other. They will never threaten to use nor will they use nuclear weaponry on each other. We will provide economic and militaristic aid for each other. The Delian League was created to join our many different beliefs, cultures and ideas together to form a society where we can be accepted for where we come from and what we believe in.
