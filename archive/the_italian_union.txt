All hail the Italian Union, most powerful Union in the world!

Originally called the Belgian Union, this later became the Italian Union after the death of the Belgian king, when the king of Italy took the open throne.

The king of Belgium recently returned from the dead, but does not yet own a new country. The name change, however, is permanent and the Italian King and Belgian King are now co-rulers.

The Union is a loose union of many countries, held together by a promise of co-operation and loyalty for the Kings.
