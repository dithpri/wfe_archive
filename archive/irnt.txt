[b]Why this?[/b]
NationStates is a game that has players from everywhere on the globe and some of them are kids, easier to be influenced. And there are some very bad players doing bad things and even destroying regional works based on certain ideologies such as Nazis and Commies or others.
[b]All forms of hate shall NOT be permitted in game.[/b]

Everyone who want to support it shall sign it there and hopefully promoting it. I hope that you&#39;re interested to support it and to oppose to &quot;ideological tyranny/hate&quot;.
The choice is yours.
