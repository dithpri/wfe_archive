[b]The Scilly Archipelago[/b]
[hr]Home to [nation=Artifact], the archipelago is massive in size. Holding 10 large islands and thousands of minor islands with a protective reef against the seas and humans, it&#39;s truly a sight to be seen. Rich in fertile lands, minerals, woods and oil deposits out at sea, it&#39;s a very lucrative area for all kinds of business. Completely self-relying, it has made [nation=Artifact] rich. The reef itself surrounds the entire archipelago with only three paths navigable by ship which are strongly defended and regulated.
