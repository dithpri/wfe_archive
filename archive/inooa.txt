Welcome to [region]Ioona[/region]

The former members of this region were forced to abandon this place due to a region-wide biological emergency. 
This region is now a safe zone ready for re-colonization, It is hoped that a regional government and shared economic zone be established in order to maintain regional unity. [b]Could any new nations in this region that are in the WA please endorse our regional representative [nation]Hanebeu[/nation][/b]
