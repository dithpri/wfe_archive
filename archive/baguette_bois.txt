The history of Islam concerns the political, economic, social, and cultural developments of the Islamic civilization. Despite concerns about the reliability of early sources, most historians believe that Islam originated in Mecca and Medina at the start of the 7th century. Muslims however believe that it did not start with Muhammad, but that it was the original faith of others whom they regard as Prophets, such as Jesus, David, Moses, Abraham, Noah and Adam.

In 610 CE, Muhammad began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations. Muhammad&#39;s message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca.
