[every &#39;psychotic/corrupt dictatorship&#39; and iron fist socialist country is welcome in the Red Line alliance]

&amp;#9773;The Marxist-leninist alliance welcomes every socialist republic governed from the absolute majority, the workers, in the aim to construct socialism in prevision of the communist era. Our region welcomes every popular republic that follows the teaching of Marx and Engels, inspired from the great achievements of Lenin, Stalin and Mao.
Every nation that doesn&#39;t work in the interestes of the proletariat, every nation that comes to any compromise with  capitalism and imperialism is not just despised from our alliance, but it&#39;s an enemy that we will fight with all our forces in the name of socialism and internationalism.&amp;#9773;
