Equalism is a political and economic system in which the rich pay higher taxes than the poor. This tax money goes from the government to the people, eliminating private business and giving all people equal opportunity.


The World Equalist Alliance hopes to bring this superior way of thinking to other nations.

For the Good of All of Us,
