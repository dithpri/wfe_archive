Hello! I&amp;#39;m Grand Prince Jacques D&amp;#39;Estevon, leader of the great states of what was France before the great French collapse. You must understand, to be a part of our confederation, your nation must exist within French territory (i.e. Brittany, Provence, Valois, Bourbon-your nation must be one of these). Also, you obviously must be a principality to be in our confederation.
