[b]Due to recent events in [region]Greater Temecula[/region], the Democratic Assembly will be temporarily locked down to protect the region from a possible takeover.[/b][hr]

This is for those who I invited who participated during the Great Trials of Democracy.
 
Welcome to the world of Terrarium, a world very different from ours. One where there lies many countries and many different cultures. There may be some issues, but that is solved by the DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLY (DA), the successor to the Council Against Fascism (CAF). 
This is a &#147;slightly&#148; TNO based region. If you want to join, send me a telegram and your map and I will delegate it. I will let you in if I Agree. 

There are several NPCs in here, but most of it is for lore.
