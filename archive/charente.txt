Primadonna girl, yeah,
All I ever wanted was the world,
I can&amp;#39;t help it, I need it all,
The primadonna life, the rise and fall,
You say that I&amp;#39;m kinda difficult,
But it&amp;#39;s always someone else&amp;#39;s fault,
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe,
You can count on me to misbehave.
