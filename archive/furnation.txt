&amp;quot;An archipelago of nations, where many citizens are animal-human crossbreeds (&amp;quot;furries&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;furs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;otherkin&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;scalies&amp;quot;, and many other names). Our region demonstrates strength through diversity, welcoming every species. We have been around since 2001 and were one of the very first furry regions

Yissing Scalies has been protecting the region for over 2,544 days (thats nearly seven years!) before the most recent invasion, and appreciates your continued support.
