Formed after rising hostilities and military standoffs and excessive political conflict in the region of The Political Union, this region was founded for a political alliance that&amp;#39;s ideals were put to the test in a massive military operation in which The Dominion of Cyborg Penguins used its military prowess to liberate and defend The Colony of Konghzi as a sovereign nation. After the added support of The Armed Republic of the Airborne Icehawks in a standing alliance, it became clear a formal alliance should be made. It was in this era that the three nations dawned the lighting-bolt banner and became known as the United Blitzkrieg Communion. This is the region in which that legacy still lives.
