 Sorry, I will not be accepting any new embassies
 Too many regions thinking that they mean more then they really do[/color][hr][hr][color=teal][b]Uzbekistan[/b] is a landlocked country in Central Asia. 
Before 1991, it was part of the Soviet Union.[/color][hr][hr]Currently playing a game that requires this region to have only two embassies.
All unsolicited embassies must be aborted.
