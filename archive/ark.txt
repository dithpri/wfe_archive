Please allow me to introduce myself: I&amp;#39;m a man of will and taste. I&amp;#39;ve been around for a long, long year; stole many a man&amp;#39;s soul and faith, and I was around when Jesus Christ had his moment of doubt and pain. Made damn sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate.

Pleased to meet you. Hope you guess my name. But what&amp;#39;s puzzling you is the nature of my game.

Hello, and welcome to Ark. We&amp;#39;re real casual and fun people-- well, person, really. Our interests are music, debating the more fundamental questions in life and condemning Mondays. And no, we don&amp;#39;t have a regional government. [i]Par contre, on parle le Fran&ccedil;ais![/i]
