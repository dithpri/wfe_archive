The dark side of the Force, also known as the Bogan, was an aspect of the Force. Individuals who used the dark side drew their power from more intense, raw and darker emotions such as fear, anger, hatred, passion, and aggression. The Sith perhaps the most well known practitioners of the dark side, and were the mortal enemies of the Jedi Order, who utilized the light side of the Force. There were others, such as the Inquisitorius and the Knights of Ren who, though not Sith, could draw upon the power of the dark side.
