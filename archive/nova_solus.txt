A science fiction setting in a distant future controlled by warring  post-human, human, and alien factions and powerful mage circles flaunting understanding of the higher mysteries and control of the esoteric sciences. 

It is the the 121st century and the stars have long since been colonized by humanity and their fellow sentient races and several vast empires centered around Earth and other similar worlds. New factions now exist radiating out from vast power blocs like the Sol Commonwealth and the Empire while independent systems and planets strive independently for greatness and power.
