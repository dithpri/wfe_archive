Declaration of the Based Nation Region

Based Nation is a region founded on the conviction that the strength of nations lies in their sovereignty, freedom, and courage to uphold their own principles in an unstable world. Created as a space for the coexistence of states with diverse ideologies and natures, it seeks to unite determined nations that value firmness in the face of external pressures.

Its purpose is to form an international community where loyalty, authority, and vision for the future prevail over indecision. Each nation is free to shape its destiny according to the principles of strength and honor.
