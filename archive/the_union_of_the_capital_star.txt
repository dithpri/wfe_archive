The Union of the Capital Star, sometimes called The Triple-Point Star, is a diplomatic and geographical region comprising of 3 nations: Hayfielda, Mineropalis and Enforcia. It was founded by Davuod III of Hayfielda. It is located very far north, on an archipelago known as the Noobian Isles. All three nations originate from New Noobia, a kingdom created by the Noobian Tribes after migrating north.
