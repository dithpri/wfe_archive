[color=blue]Hello![/color]
Welcome to Bachlavda! Here we are a nation with only a few rules. Our rules consist of no cursing, as there could be children playing, and no invasions. The last rule is to just have fun! 
My name is The Federal Republic of Craset and I&#39;m the leader of Bachlavda, a region where you can just hang out and role play if you want! 
Our nation is mostly a nation of peace, unless something serious happens but if you would like to help us learn how to battle if you are a veteran we would greatly appreciate it. If you don&#146;t want to help then feel free to just hangout. 
We are a growing region and we love that you have chosen to be part of our nation.
Yours Truly,
The Federal Republic of Craset
