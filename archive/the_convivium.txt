A conglomerate of nations with opposing views who find consensus in working together. While doomed to failure, this theoretically could possibly end with a stronger alliance for all nations involved maybe.  

The requirements of such nation are to always oppose each others politics in every possible arena. Voice concerns about them, and find the common ground in those directly opposing views. To build a better tomorrow, and lead us into greater financial, political, and social workings as a group.
