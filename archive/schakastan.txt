Schakastan is a beautiful, wonderful place full of learning, art, sports, and cranky old people. You may recognize us Schakastanians by the Scandinavian crosses we bear on our flags. We call ourselves the Rebels, for we rebel against the idea that old people can&amp;#39;t be cool too. And against the idea that smoking is harmful; in fact it acts as a mummifying agent! Join us in our march towards victory.

Go Rebels.
