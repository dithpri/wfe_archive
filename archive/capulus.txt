Greetings. If you know where you are, good job on finding your way.
If you don&#146;t know where you are:

[b]Capulus[/b] is a fleshed out, lore heavy nation roleplay server based on discord. We&#146;re primarily a group of friends messing around with our silly little countries. In short, this region is probably not intended for you, but if you&#146;re interested in joining you may send a telegram to [nation]Patria Sainterre[/nation].

Your safety is not guaranteed.
