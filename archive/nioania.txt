A brave and courageous region whose members will fight against other nations together, uniting the wholly community of the Nio. All of our members recite the book of Nio which has been put together by his and her highness Se&ntilde;or and Se&ntilde;ora Nio, 15 years in the future. All members must know the Nio Chant. 

&#39;Who can say where the nio goes, follow the preachings of Se&ntilde;or Nio as he shows&#39;

Members of Nioania must be good standing and active in the region. The land of Nio or NioLand are other names for Nioania, as well as Nyaniacatania which is our siamese twin. 

All members must follow Nioanity, our belief system, and should be seen occasionally praying to the god of Nio.
