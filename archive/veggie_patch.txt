This region isn&#39;t even really a region. It&#39;s just a huge patch of vegetables, but by huge, I mean...this is a serious amount of vegetables--millions of square kilometers. Any nation may join this honorable region, as long as their environment is reasonable, since it would truly be a shame if our precious crops were to die.

Our region, however, isn&#39;t about veggies all the time (if you believe it!), as we also are pretty serious when it comes to civil rights--if your nation is a dictatorship, we don&#39;t suggest joining us. We&#39;re generally liberal, too.

Anyways. Feel free to join.
