Illyricum is a Roman province stretching from the Drin river to Istria in the west and to the Sava river in the north. The region has considerable strategic and economic importance. It possesses many important commercial ports along its coastline. Illyricum is also the starting point of the Via Egnatia, the great Roman road that runs from Dyrrachium on the Adriatic, to Byzantium in the east. Aditionally, Illyricum is a valuable source of military personnel. The region&amp;#39;s native peoples have won renown for their military prowess- several notable Roman emperors came from the region, including Aurelian, Claudius II, Constantine I and Diocletian, as well as the Byzantine emperors Anastasius I and Justinian I.
