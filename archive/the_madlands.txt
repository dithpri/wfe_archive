We apologize for the embassies. Our region was raided, again, but on account of our absentee founder I am taking executive action to enact a password and govern this region my damn self.

I will endeavor to rebuild all our previous embassies, but our records may have been lost over the past week or so. If you have any desire to reenact your embassy with the madlands, you may need to telegram us.*
