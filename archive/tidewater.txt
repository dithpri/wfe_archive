Tidewater is now 200 days old!


[b]Important message[/b]

Recently a user of Discord and this site, formerly named Moluccas, has been visiting different servers, spreading misinformation that Tidewater is a raider region. He has also been raiding many of those servers, and has sucesfully raided [region] ten thousand islands[/region] and [region]Greater Dienstad[/region].

If your region has been raided and links were posted to this region (or anything suggesting he is from tidewater) please aknowlage this user us banned and we do not condone his actions, ban him and report him. However he will likely keep making accounts for his discord raids.

Please spread this information, and remain prepared.
