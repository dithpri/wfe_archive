The Secret Society of Nations is an exclusive gathering of nations. You must have an invite to join, and must conform to the policies of the society. Our goal is to create a network of nations throughout the globe, and support each other in times of need. These are our rules.

1) If there is a decree approved by the leader of the Secret Society, all member states will be required to follow the decree.
2) If you notice any suspicious behavior of a member state, you must report it.
3) Individual diplomatic relationships are strictly prohibited. All international relations must be uniform throughout the Society.
