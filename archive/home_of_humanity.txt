This is a roleplay region. The objective is to try and make the world.. colonized. A meteor wiped out most of humanity, so we&#146;re starting from around.. uh.. maybe the middle ages. (The tech, not the year.) You are also able to make custom countries. No country will be in existent except Seterland which will start in Japan. The map will be a world map with each country being colored, though it will be green at first due to no countries existing except Seterland. You can apply for a country in the disc.
