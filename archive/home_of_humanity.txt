[region]Home of Humanity[/region] is a roleplay region where the Earth has been struck by a meteor around the size of Michigan. Only medieval tech survived. A few things like a few phones are still present. However they are Nokia phones so that&#146;s no use really. A new country named Seterland rose after the big collision, it takes the place of Hokkaido. Seterland tried to revive a few countries and every country which will apply for roleplay is considered &#147;a child of seter&#148; (metaphorically obv), although a few aren&#146;t known as those.

[i]Please[/i] be patient as I make the discord. You can also roleplay here, no big deal. This will be official roleplay of [region]Home of Humanity[/region]
