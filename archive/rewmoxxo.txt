Let&#39;s keep it simple and get straight to the point:

Rewmoxxo is an anarchy.

Rewmoxxo is against the World Assembly, as it imposes too much control on nations. That being said, Rewmoxxo allows executive WA Delegates to keep disorder and freedom, especially since anyone can take these roles at any time.

Anyone is welcome, we&#39;re all here to play virtual government and have a good time.
