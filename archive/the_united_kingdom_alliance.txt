 Long ago, so the Storyteller claimed, the evil God Torak sought dominion and drove men and Gods to war. But Belgarath the Sorcerer led men to reclaim the Orb that protected men of the West. So long as it lay at [nation=short]star isles[/nation] and a descendent of riva iron Grip sat upon the throne of [nation=short]star isles[/nation] and defended the orb, the prophecy went, men would be safe.
