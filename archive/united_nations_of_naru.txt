Welcome to the UNN, a safe, Democratic, compassionate region. The UNN represents all the nations of the planet Naru. Linuxville founded the UNN after migrating to Naru from Earth, which was too crowded and small for Linuxville. We started a new nation based on civil rights and political freedom. New nations are welcomed with open arms and are encouraged to take part in discussions and debates. If you are just visiting, we hope you enjoy your time in the UNN.
