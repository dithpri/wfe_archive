We are a nice, kind region, all united under one simple thing: the Father, God, the son, our savior, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Our Father, who art in Heaven, haloed the by name. Thy Kingdom come, thy will de done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily Bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thy as the Kingdom, and the power, and the Glory, forever and ever. Amen.
