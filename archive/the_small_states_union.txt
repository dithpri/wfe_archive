[color=green][b]Welcome to The Small States Union[/b][/color]

It would be much appreciated if you would take a look at the full Small States Union factbook, located at: http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=499360 If you would like to join The Small States Union, please contact either the General or the Lieutenant General.

[u]Side Note:[/u]
The rank of WA Delegate is open to those who are voted for, although it does not contain executive power. The WA Delegate positioning within the EODE itself is lower than that of the Lieutenant General and the General. Any attempt to ban or eject the Lieutenant General will end in an either week-long or permanent removal of privileges.
