Hi
This is a resurrection of the former region known as &#39;The Small States Union&#39;, or SSU for short. We are somewhat democratic, as the WA spot is always open. However, they cannot do anything without the [nation=noflag+short]Legio Logistica[/nation]&#39;s permission. They, in turn, need approval from the crown.

Do what you want (as long as it&#39;s not invading, treason, or being a bigot) and have fun! :D

All Legio have blocked telegrams apart from the [nation=short+noflag]Legio Diplomatia[/nation]. Please contact it for communications.
