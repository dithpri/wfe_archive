The Morgajfor Clossur region is an exceedingly small, multi-national union of mid-sized island countries in the Great Lakes of the United States. Comprised largely of developing nations with alarmingly large carbon footprints, Morgajfor Clossur member states share common cultural similarities and legal systems and are united for purposes of trade and justice matters, but vary individually in term of their language, self-governance, and internal infrastructure.
