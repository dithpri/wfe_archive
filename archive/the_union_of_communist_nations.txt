[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by!

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

As the knight [nation=short]Christopher Bishop[/nation] and his newly acquired squire [nation=short]Isidor C Stark[/nation] rode a long ways to reach the red dragon, but a terrible pink creature was following them. The terrible dragon, [nation=short]MagentaFairy[/nation], was chasing after the squire due to his previous transgressions.[/b]
