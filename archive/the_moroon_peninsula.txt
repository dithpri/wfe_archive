The Moroon Peninsula is a large piece of land controlled by the three nations of Old Moroon, Moroon And New Moroon.
The ruling party of the peninsula is the MCP (Morooon Communist Party)


The Empire of Old Moroon was discovered 200 years ago by explorer named James Moroon, who named it Moroon.
The Empire of Moroon would grow and extend quickly, taking the entire Moroon Peninsula.
50 years ago a civil war broke out, which shattered the peninsula into 3 nations:
Old Moroon, the empire which shattered in the first place, managing to secure some land.
Moroon, which was the first to rebel, controlling most of the peninsula.
And New Moroon, a rapidly growing nation, which calls itself a &quot;communist utopia&quot;
