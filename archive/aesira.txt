An alternate universe named Aesira. Nations are spread out throughout a galaxy, which is based in reality. Multiple non-player nations are running their nations and alliances, which you can interact with on a level similar to D&amp;D or other role playing games, only on a civ-wide level. Choose from many of the life-seeded species or create your own.

We recommend you to start slow and establish your nation within the lore by showing its history and how it came to meet the other nations within the galaxy. There are many banned technologies and traits you can find on the wiki, so please look over those before deciding to stay.
