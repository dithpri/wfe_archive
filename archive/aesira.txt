Welcome to [b]Aesira[/b], an interstellar NS region with future or past tech. There are non-player civilizations that are major and minor powers, these will mostly mind their own business or attack each-other and are used as filler, fodder for player factions, or event based stuff.
[b]We are currently building the region but feel free to drop by the Discord server and chat about the region.[/b]
