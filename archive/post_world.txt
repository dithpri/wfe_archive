The Society is the dominant human government in the Solar System. It has existed for at least 700 years, or 14 generations. Its denizens are separated into different castes and vocations, and called Colors. It is the most efficient and perfect government ever made by man. There are approximately 18 billion humans throughout the Solar System.

Revvin&#39; up your engine
Listen to her howlin&#39; roar
Metal under tension
Beggin&#39; you to touch and go
Headin&#39; into twilight
Spreadin&#39; out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin&#39; off the track
And shovin&#39; into overdrive
