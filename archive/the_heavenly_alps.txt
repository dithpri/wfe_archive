A region where the nations are surrounded by mountains, rivers, glaciers and fields of flowers.
Those who cross the border suddenly feel the urge to write poetry, and carve wood. 
Socialism and spirituality is what keeps us together. We sing songs about how our socialist forefathers strolled through the woods. Some even say they have ascended to heaven. 
But to stay in The Heavenly Alps; we need power too. Our people need protection. We will always show power to those who try to invade. 

This region is for anyone who feels the need of a region with beautiful nature and a bit of authoritarian socialism just for the sake of shaking things up a bit.
Anyone is welcome, but try to stay within the ideas of the region.
