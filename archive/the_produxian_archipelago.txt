A uranium rich group of 500 islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, located north of Fiji but south of Hawaii. The islands are too small to be on Satellite but somehow manage to make their way onto hand-drawn maps in the style of a one-eyed cartographer. Nations in this region are &quot;independent&quot; governments, all answering to the capital of Holy Produxia, which is located on the center island, which is coincidentally the largest and uranium richest. A coincidence indeed.
