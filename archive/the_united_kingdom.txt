The United Kingdom: 2006-2013

This region is open to new nations, but please be aware that its government was shut down on October 8th, 2013. The region&amp;#39;s history can be traced back to 2006, and it was at one point the largest British-themed alliance in all of NationStates. However, all good things must come to an end. For any enquiries, please contact the founder.
