[color=mediumblue][b][i]Commonwealth of Free Regions[/i]

The sole successor of The Free Bloc, as designated by the Second Senate of The Free Bloc. Serves to keep a forum for former-TFB regions and to allow for the safe division of all TFB items. 


ATTENTION:

The Free Bloc is an illegitimate remake and controlled by a hostile force to the original TFB. The individual in control has committed many offenses grave to what was TFB&#39;s and now is CFR&#39;s values. Do NOT join them.[/b][/color]
