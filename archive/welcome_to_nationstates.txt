Hello there newcomer and welcome to NationStates. We are a region founded on 9/15/2022 for the purpose of training newcomers of NationStates how to better their Nation and be a more efficient member for their next region. This region was originally designed to help newcomers and send them on their way, this region was not designed to have a big population or to be powerful. This region will teach newcomers things like WA, military gameplay, officer positions, how to found regions and things like how to make their nation look and be better.
