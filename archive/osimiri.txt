[b]Osimiri[/b] is a consortium of nations from within the same universe or entirely different ones that desire mutual independence and peace. We respect the autonomy of nations and will not interfere in their affairs or conflicts. Our only requirement is that nations within Osimiri communicate with one another respectfully and do their best to resolve any hostilities.

We encourage our residents to endorse the Protectorate of [nation]Osimiri[/nation], the perpetual administrator of this region. Please vote for proposals in the World Assembly that lessens the regulation of nations and or &quot;legislative bloat&quot;, if the proposal does the opposite of that, vote against it.
