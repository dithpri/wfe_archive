A very mountainous region with Large Valleys scattered between where fresh water gathers amidst stone pastures and lava flows from the large central Volcano called Mt Varlusia.

We are very Militaristic, Technological, Authoritarian and Industrial.
We care not for Religion, Free Will or morals, if it furthers Varlus and by extension Gurlon then it is approved.

Come fortify my Primarchs and together we shall conquer and rule.
