&quot;The Red Flame Still Burns&quot;

&#147;The Union may have fallen, but socialism endures wherever one heart still beats for the People.&#148;
- Marshal Viktor A. Rovkin, Founding Father of Rovska, 1992

Overview

The Red Banner (TRB) is an international socialist coalition dedicated to preserving and advancing the cause of the working class through unity, strength, and revolutionary discipline.

Founded by the People&#146;s Republic of Rovska, the Red Banner serves as the ideological and strategic successor to the fallen Soviet Union, not a return to the past, but a reformation of socialist order for the modern age.

Our mission is simple yet eternal: to safeguard socialism, crush exploitation, and raise the Red Banner above every horizon.
