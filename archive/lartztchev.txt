 &amp;#9876;&amp;#65039; Welcome to Lartztchev &amp;#127963;&amp;#65039;

The Economic and Military Union of Exiled Nations. &amp;#127757;

We are one force &amp;#128170; &#151; raising our flag in defense of the autonomy &amp;#128330;&amp;#65039;, freedom &amp;#128293;, and sovereignty of every nation that finds refuge here.

Against the corrupt nations and systems that seek to silence our voice,
Lartztchev stands tall. &amp;#9878;&amp;#65039;
