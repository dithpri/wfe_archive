Welcome to the region of [b][color=lightgreen]Umdrehung![/color][/b] This region was founded by Westphalians unhappy with the Emperor&amp;#39;s insistance on leaving us to sort things out by ourselves, and interrupting and changing everything when we&amp;#39;ve gotten going. We will not simply keep accepting this. The region is active and growing, and is welcome to anyone who is seeking a growing region to be part of. We are a very tolerant people, and we stand opposed to any sort of tyranny or oppression. The meaning of Umdrehung in German is REVOLUTION.
