Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction. It seems every few years something extremely unthought of becomes part of our everyday routine. This region is no exception. Party to just about any and all countries, an odd, and frankly only status quo exists between them seeking non-intervention above all else in hopes of preventing the delicate and artificial balance of the region from becoming pandora&#39;s box in the midst of a time war. 

Only between them that is, meaning this discordant group of all stars and stripes can be quite the contradictory handful for diplomats of neighboring regions. Apologies in advance...
