We have no endorsement cap, meaning that you(users) are free to vote your favorite nation into an administrative position. This also means that you have the right to change them when you deem necessary. This will not be mandated by us, but will only be supervised; to make sure that there are no artificial(or ill-intended) endorsements involved.  [/color]
