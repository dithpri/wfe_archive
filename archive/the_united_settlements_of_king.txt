Any Nation is welcome to join the USK. The USK is known for their lax regulations on government inside the settlements, as such people can find themselves arrested simply by moving into another country. Tax rates are mandated by the settlements themselves and have become extremely varied over the years. Any nation inside the USK is free to conduct buisness as they wish, regardless of how poorly they exercise this right.
