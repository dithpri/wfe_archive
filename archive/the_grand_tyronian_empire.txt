Welcome to The Grand Tyronian Empire. This is a region of diverse nations united under one Emperor. Though all nations have their freedoms they all come under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Cabinet. We have a universal currency, The Imperial Credit, and a regional religion The Cult of Tyrone but some nations have chosen to have their own religions.   

This region is governed by, The Imperial Household, The Dominion of Fukistrania, New Zenragogzoohnson, and The Holy Nation of Dyrvakia.   

Long Live Tyrone
