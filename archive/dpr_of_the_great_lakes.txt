Welcome to the Democratic People&#39;s Republics of the Great Lakes, where the lives of everyone is perfect, now that the Yoopers have seceded from the State of Michigan. Here everyone is respectful to the Supreme Leader, Dominic Jacobetti. Any nation can come here and enjoy our fresh and unsalted lakes, and to respect the people and leader of the Upper Peninsula.
