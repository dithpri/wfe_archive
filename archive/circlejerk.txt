I would like to inform everyone that while normally I do not infringe upon your rights to rule. It is now regional law that Tuesdays, or whatever your local equivalent, shall now be referred to as &amp;quot;Tear gas Tuesdays&amp;quot; where all citizens are invited to hurl canisters of that lovely substance at each other.

 Your delegate,
The High Prophet of Dragon Aerie
