CircleJerk is a moderately small but dedicated coalition of nations whom have allied together for Economic, Social and Safety reasons in late 2013. The nations in this coalition are of varied backgrounds and governing styles but we all work in tandem For The Greater Good. Our delegates are elected in fair and open elections, but due to our many governmental types the heading of our region is often changed when the metaphorical baton is passed, but we will always work together no matter the direction we&amp;#39;re going. We put aside our differences because we realize that we can all work together towards a common goal, and in our unity we can surmount any situation posed to us.

Believe in our destiny.
