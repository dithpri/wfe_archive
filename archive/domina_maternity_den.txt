This region was created on a tropical island as a reproduction facility of Women Empire.

[color=green]In the beginning it was a sperm mill where the most healthy slaves were forced to procreate, combined with a building reserved for WOMEN who were willingly pregnant.[/color]

Latter structures combined the features of an advanced hospital, luxury clinic and luxury hotel.

During pregnancy, from the very first day to nine months after birth (a total of 18 months), all Women Empire citizens are granted free State support with all material comforts provided.

As time went on, due to requests of those pregnant (especially post-pregnancy WOMEN) more structures were added for entertainment, relaxation and education.
