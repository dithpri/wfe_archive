Bound by the [b]Treaty of Faro de la Paz of 2037[/b], members of the Alliance of Chaos promise financial and military aid to each other. Political spectrums vary, but the nations realize that politics shouldn&#39;t bring people together, [i]people bring people together[/i]. Leaders of member states are close friends and always enjoy a good match CS:GO. Leaders come from many different nationalities.

[nation]Peacefounders[/nation] is also tied to the treaty, but due to their &quot;democratic policies&quot;, their people chose to reside in [color=blue]Conch Kingdom[/color].

(We are not puppets, we are IRL friends. Peacefounders is one of them but can&#39;t join us).

[color=red][b]We don&#39;t build embassies with random regions. You must have a connection to at least one of our members.[/b][/color]

Please don&#39;t ask about Mia. That&#39;s private.
