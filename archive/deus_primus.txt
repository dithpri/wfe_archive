We believe in the Bible over all of life
and that Salvation is: In Christ alone,
by Grace alone, through Faith alone.

The region of Deus Primus was established to protect the Christian Faith. Nations that have settled in this region have had to sign a document of faith known as the documentum fidei. Any who can not accept or sign the document have been barred.
