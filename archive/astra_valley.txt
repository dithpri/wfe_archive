Astra Valley is a prominent geographical feature located in the southern region of the Atra River Basin. Similar in structure and ecology to the Zambezi River Valley, the Astra Valley is characterized by a wide, expansive floodplain surrounded by elevated plateaus. The valley is defined by the Astra River, which meanders through it for approximately 1,500 kilometers before emptying into the Eastern Sea. The terrain of the valley varies from steep gorges to wide, fertile plains, with significant biodiversity supported by its seasonal flood cycles.
