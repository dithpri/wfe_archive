
This region was set up and &quot;conquered&quot; by the &quot;superior&quot; forces of [region]Das Dritte Reich[/region]/[region]Reich[/region], which at the time was affiliated with the [region]National Socialist League[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b].

The gulags have been evacuated and political/religious prisoners set free. They will now stand as memorials for the victims of political oppression.
