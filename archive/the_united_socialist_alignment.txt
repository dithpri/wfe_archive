Democratic socialism is a political ideology that advocates political democracy alongside social ownership of the means of production, often with an emphasis on democratic management of enterprises within a socialist economic system. The term &quot;democratic socialism&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;socialism&quot;; the adjective &quot;democratic&quot; is often added to distinguish it from the Marxist&#150;Leninist brand of socialism, which is widely viewed as being non-democratic.
