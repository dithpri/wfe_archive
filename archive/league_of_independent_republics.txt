The League of Independent Republics is dedicated to idea that republics represented before the advent of democracy, mercantile trading nations. It is with this idea in mind, that the LIR will strive to trade with all nations and lead all to a new age of trade and commerce. Hopefully, with time, patience, and the help of willing participants in the region, we can achieve our goal, and establish good relations with all regions and nations.
