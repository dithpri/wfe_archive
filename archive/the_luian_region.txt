The Luian Region is an area that spans roughly the size the size of the United States. It is dominated politically, economically, and militarily by the Principality of Luia. While there are other sovereign states within the region, most, if not all, will tend to lean on Luia Proper for some sort of financial support or military protection.

Nations within the region meet annually within the Principality&amp;#39;s capital city. The meeting is known as the LRC, or the Luian Regional Congress, whose leadership resides primarily within the principality itself. The congress itself has no authority over its members, and is meant more as a forum for discussion and cooperation. It is headed by the Principality of Luia.
