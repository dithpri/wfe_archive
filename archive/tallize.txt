[color=aqua]Welcome to Tallize![/color]
Founded sometime in 2019 that we forgot the date of, Tallize is a nation currently serving as the resting place of [nation]New Doggonia[/nation] and some other nations.
Tallize briefly was turned into nothing but an advertisement for the pathetic weeaboos over at [region]Lily[/region] that we despise so much we could write an entire essay about it, but alas we cannot do that as we lack the motivation for it.

Tallize is currently closed to new members to prevent raiders from joining and humiliating everyone by turning the region into an advertising space again.
We may change this if the region gets revived, [i]but to be honest that&#39;s very unlikely so don&#39;t bother getting your hopes up.[/i]
