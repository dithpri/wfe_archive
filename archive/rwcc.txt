[b]Isaiah 40:31 (KJV)[/b]

But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.


I pray that we all know that God wants us all to walk strong, I pray we know He wants to help us with His strength, and I pray that we know that we can call upon that strength in times of trouble. 

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Amen
