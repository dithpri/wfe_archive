[b]Joshua 24:15 (KJV)[/b]

And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

I pray that all of us have decided this day Whom we shall serve. 

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Amen
