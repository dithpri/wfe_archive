[b]Romans 12:12 (KJV)[/b]

Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer



I pray that we all have that hope, I pray we have that patience no matter how rough the storm may be, and I pray that we all continue to call upon you in prayer. 

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Amen
