&quot;My Government would like to pay tribute to General Motors Holden. Holden has been an essential part of Australia&#39;s industry and it is very sad to see such a great manufacturer go. 
As we farewell the local manufacturing of the car that captured so many peoples hearts, we remember the many great designs they produced. 
From the [i]People&#39;s Car[/i] of the [b]48-215[/b] dubbed the [i]FX[/i] to the last home made car, the 
[b][i]VF II Holden Commodore[/i][/b]. We thank Holden for the many special moments they have provided for all.&quot;
