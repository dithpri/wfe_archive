In ancient eons, Euskaltzlan was an insular tri-national Empire. Mentality, civil rights and political freedom concepts evolved over history, rendering the Imperial Institution obsolete.
Nowadays, the region is a smooth commonwealth of three nations: Federation of Xavalya, Community of Verzylda and Allied States of Eskerry.
The people in these three countries speak highly, over 95% inteligeble variations of proto-basque.
