[b][color=Green]Hey! This region&#39;s WA Delegate has Executive powers! That&#39;s pretty cool!

Here in [region]West Faldum[/region],[/color][color=avacado] Anyone can change the government by gaining the majority of WA Endorsements[/color][color=green]! It&#39;s similar to a founderless region, but with an active founder that will prevent against raids! Things may get hectic here, but that&#39;s all apart of the fun![/b][/color]
