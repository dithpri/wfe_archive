The back story basically is that, World War one, was won by Germany and its allies, because a few rebellions in allied areas were successful like the Easter Rising, where the country basically wins and gains independence but of course other things happens. Serbia was defeated by the Central Powers &amp;amp; The Ottomans took the Middle East and most of Africa, and helping the Central Powers defeat Britain, and other Allied Powers, after Russia is done with their communist stuff they rejoin the war and liberate most of Europe and Western Turkey, along with America, the cold war never happens because they became great friends, and Europe wasn&amp;#39;t very happy that they had to be liberated, but they accepted it and then countries start coming up.
