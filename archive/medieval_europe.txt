Medieval Europe is a region devoted to the realistic goings on of a Medieval / Low Fantasy setting. Any aspiring kingdoms, monarchies, peasant communes are free to settle within its decentralised terrain. This is not a collective empire, but rather a setting for internal roleplay and conflict. It&#39;s a vicious, barren land out there, and you&#39;ll have to form your own allegiances along the way if you wish to keep your land claim.
