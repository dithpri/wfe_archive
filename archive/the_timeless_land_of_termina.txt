Though Termina does not have a known creation story, the legends of its ancient protectors provide most of its primordial history. Long ago, the people of Termina had not yet migrated to the four cardinal directions, and were watched over by the Giants who had created the world. One day, the Giants announced to the people that they would go to the north, south, east, and west and guard the people as they slept. If the people were in dire need, the Giants would awaken and answer their cries for help. However, the Skull Kid, a little imp who was a friend of the Giants, was saddened by this news, and caused mischief in his anger. The Giants rebuked the Skull Kid and he left the world of Termina for the heavens.
