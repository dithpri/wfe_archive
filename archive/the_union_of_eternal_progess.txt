Governed by[nation]Buena Suerte[/nation],[color=green][nation]Namkeki[/nation][/color] and [nation]Sigurdsson23[/nation] the Union of Eternal Progress (or UEP) is a region of unity and progression.

Join our ranks if you believe in these ideals and wish to share our goal, joining our progressive, eternal march.
