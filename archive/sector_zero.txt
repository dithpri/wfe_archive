Built upon and expanded using the land of the former United States of America, Sector Zero-One was given its designation following the end of the War for Unity as well as serving for the official meeting for the Declaration of a New World Order, part of the World Reformation Project. This is by far the most guarded and well-defended sector of the faction; those only carrying technological and commercial development to be a close second. Sector Zero One is the heart of Outcast Haven, whereas the other sectors serve as the blood supply to keep the wheels of freedom turning.
