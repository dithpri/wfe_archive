The great powers of Adonai is all about the economy. We focus on our economies. Nations are free to choose any path their country may take concerning politics, civil rights, and human rights, as long as it improves their economy. Members must sustain a &amp;quot;Good&amp;quot; Economy, to be attain and retain membership. However, members are given three weeks to recover from an economic downfall, before their membership is repealed.
