The Theocracy of the Blessed Father holds supreme control over this holy land and the nations contained within. Other lands, however, that the Blessed Father sees fit might have the authority to reign alongside the Theocracy.

Only the most holy of nations shall be provided with entry to our holy land.

Glory be to the Blessed Father who provides us with Strength, Hope, Faith, and Courage through his Blessed Eye. Amen.
