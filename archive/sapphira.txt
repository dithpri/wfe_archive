-Welcome to the Region of [color=#0040FF]Sapphira[/color]!

-The Region of Sapphira has been ridden with minor prejudices  and a few tensions. All of which have not reached the main nation within the region, which is New Nassrau. With the communist nation of Rustlandia on the rise, peace is threatened. Other nations, like Gregorianna, continue to fall ever so much into darkness, the Republic of Zhou rises from imperialism, so will the technologically advanced utopia of New Nassrau react in time?
