Together we can create a world that loves its DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS more than anything else. Happiness comes from a free society and free society is necessary for economic development. We don&#39;t believe in the purity of any ideology, THE PEOPLE should be given every right to think for themselves. Criticism of the authorities are always welcome. Our goal is to create BEST WRITERS,  BEST SCIENTISTS, BEST ECONOMISTS, BEST ENGINEERS, BEST DOCTORS etc. We are against every kind of discrimination against the social or economical or educationally backward societies or group of people. In the eyes of Law everyone is equal. Law can be discriminatory FOR EDUCATIONALLY OR SOCIALLY OR ECONOMICALLY BACKWARD PEOPLE NOT AGAINST THEM.
