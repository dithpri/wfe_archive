[colour=blue]The American Nazi Party (ANP) is a far-right American political party founded by George Lincoln Rockwell with its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Rockwell founded the organization as the World Union of Free Enterprise National Socialists (WUFENS), but renamed it the American Nazi Party in 1960. Since the late 1960s, a number of small groups have used the name &quot;American Nazi Party&quot; with most being independent from each other and disbanding before the 21st century. The party is based largely upon the ideals and policies of Adolf Hitler&#39;s Nazi Party in Germany during the Nazi era, and embraced its uniforms and iconography. (Wikipedia)
