Civil Conflict. War. Triumph. So was the case when humanity rose up following the second Great Depression. After the flames died, a new world was upon them. New Nations had risen and others had fallen.

The region of Ad Futurum is built upon the commitment to the guarantee of freedom, justice, and equality. All nations are free and welcome here.
