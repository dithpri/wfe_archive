This is meant to be a staging ground for the fight against the hypocritical horse sh&amp;t known as ANTIFA

I have seen so many regions, fascist, just have a German name, or those that just say one wrong thing invaded and destroyed by them all in the name of &quot;progress&quot;

I want that to end. I believe that everyone, even if their opinions are different from yours, should be allowed to speak and not suppressed by these fascists in democracy&#39;s close.

They have basically taken democracy and now parade around in its skin
