In 3313, the Galactic Empire fell to infighting. The remnant, a mere 400 systems, maintains order and law over its population through the Galactic Wanderers, an elite military and police force with a history reaching back several thousand years. The current Emperor is seated on Christom, a human world. Nicknamed &amp;quot;The Broken Empire&amp;quot; by both it&amp;#39;s own population and it&amp;#39;s enemies, it is still the largest and strongest of the Galactic Empire&amp;#39;s successors.

Will you lead your world to greatness and attempt to gain control of the empire? Will you be one of the Wanderers? Or will you forge your own destiny amongst the stars?
