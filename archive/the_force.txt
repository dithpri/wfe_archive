The Force is an energy field that connects everything in the universe, created by life, and therefore, resided in all lifeforms.

It was especially powerful in a select group of individuals who were born with a high concentration of midi-chlorians&#151;microscopic, sentient lifeforms that shared a symbiotic relationship with the Force&#151;in their blood. These people were deemed Force-sensitive, and were capable of consciously sensing the Force. With this conscious sense of the Force came the ability to harness it, accessing various Force powers.

The Force is the basis of various religious organizations such as the Guardians of the Whills, and most notably the Jedi Order and the Sith Order.
