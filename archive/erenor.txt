Erenor is a large, fantastical world full of elves, firran, humans, or whatever else you desire to include later on. Technology cannot progress beyond swordsfighting because gunpoweder and explosive materials will never be able to provide power to machines in Erenor, but magic makes up for this lack of technology in many ways, including the ability to open portals to any city with carved stones which is the basis of many settlements.
