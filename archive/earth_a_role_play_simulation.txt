Welcome you ever wondered if you made all the decisions or even had a role to play. Well I have made  this region for this reason. Earth: A Role Play Simulation is something I thought of a while back, a cooperative Role Play where everyone plays as a early civilization like Sumer, Egypt, and others. If you want to join PM me.

So at the moment we need people to play as the nations, and others to play as later when more nations are founded, it&amp;#39;s ok to play as more than one just up to 3 all must be from the same culture group like the Sumerians. They were city-states so we will need to have more players to play as the city-states
