[b]Bolshevik[/b], (Russian: &#147;One of the Majority&#148;), plural Bolsheviks, or Bolsheviki, member of a wing of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers&#146; Party, which, led by Lenin, seized control of the government in Russia (October 1917) and became the dominant political power. The group originated at the party&#146;s second congress (1903) when Lenin&#146;s followers, insisting that party membership be restricted to professional revolutionaries, won a temporary majority on the party&#146;s central committee and on the editorial board of its newspaper Iskra. They assumed the name Bolsheviks and dubbed their opponents the Mensheviks (&#147;Those of the Minority&#148;).&#151;Britannica.com[hr]
