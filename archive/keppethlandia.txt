The history of Keppethland began with the birth of two dragons. The older one, who bore the name Raging, grew up to be the more aggressive of the two. She would breathe fire without restraint, melting surrounding land forms here and there. The younger one, Dreamer, behaves in temperance. She would follow Raging wherever she goes but refrains from the destructive ways the older dragon is accustomed to.

One day, while circumnavigating the lower latitude, Raging decided to defrost a particular island, inadvertently making habitation possible.Woken from her slumber, Whitest, the spirit dwelling in the island, saw the destruction of her icy sanctum and waged war with the fire-breathing monster.
