We, [region]The Great Asian Empire[/region], tower over all and shall conquer all!

This region was raided by large armies from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]The North Pacific[/region], supported by elements from [region]The East Pacific[/region] on May 17th, 2020. An attempt by Defenders to liberate it failed on the 24th. On June 1st, elements of the [region]Interregional Alliance Army[/region] 1st Division, led by Colonel [nation]South Cordia[/nation], began the process of liberation. The original WFE has been restored, but we were not able to find the flag. Former locals have been telegrammed to see if they want to rejoin their old region, but if they do not respond, this region will be either used for [region]Interregional Alliance Army[/region] purposes.
