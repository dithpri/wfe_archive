Welcome back to the Sandail region, a newly redounded governed star system which is located near the center of the Milky Galaxy. This system is approximately 14,000 LYs away from Earth. So this means that there are still uninhabited planets out in the Region of space. Right now I&amp;#39;m working on trying to Terraform my Dry and Barren (Who&amp;#39;s ozone and magnetic field are still very weak) Planet back to the way it was over 350 years ago, before the Nano swarms ravaged the planets. 

So the current year and month right now for our Planet is Cabdaspan, 318 AC (321 years After Collapse in 1997 CE).
