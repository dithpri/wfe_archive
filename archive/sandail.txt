Welcome back to the Sandail region, a newly re-founded governed star system which is located near the center of the Milky Galaxy. This system is approximately 14,000 LYs away from Earth. I&amp;#39;m accepting any and all FT/PMT nations, which are willing to support our Federalist cause for uniting the entire galaxy under one roof. 

So the current year and month right now for our System is Cabdaspan, 318 AC (321 years After Collapse in 1997 CE).
