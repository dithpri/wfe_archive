[b]The Old World[/b], I wrote up a neat ol&#39; WFE and then NS ate it. I&#39;m not writing another one anytime soon, the important parts were this region has a [b]pop cap of ~600 million people[/b], and the Unorganized Territories are a loose confederation on the brink of total collapse at any second. Any future map [b]claims will be at the expense of the Unorganized Territories[/b]. The map took five minutes in MS Paint. I will not make an effort to make it look any nicer because it really does not matter.
