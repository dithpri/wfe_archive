As you enter the palace of the almighty Pharaoh of Ancient Kemet, you are greeted by clouds of incense and hookah smoke. Slaves and servents bow as you step closer to the god throne of Horus; and see sitting upon the throne is Pharaoh. Priest pray and chant offering blessings and auspicious signs of good fortune. 

Lord of the two lands, Pharaoh
