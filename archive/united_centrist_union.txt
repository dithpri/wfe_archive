Centrism is the &quot;common sense&quot; for nations world wide. we work together to solve the issues and put political ideologies aside for the good of our people, we do not do what is popular we do what is right. We work together no matter our differences because we know that if we are patient enough we can find an answer that makes everyone happy. We will all fight to preserve peace at any cost, even if it means dying for it.
