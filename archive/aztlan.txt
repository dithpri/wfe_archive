[i]This is the land of your Borderless Future, a pancultural, polyracial, transethnic, omnilingual New World, 
a perpetually evolving, organically interconnected, self-transformational fusion of kaleidoscopic multi-hybrid 
communities. A Trans-Global Unicontinent, if you will. Where there are no Borders and there is no Center.[/i][/b]

[color=red][u]FREE SPEECH ZONE:[/u][/color][color=green] [i]Poems, quotes, articles, op-eds, satire, koans, rants, diatribes, surreal gibberish, thundering ultimatums, 
bitter denunciations, declarations of eternal love and solemn vows of merciless vengeance are all welcome on the RM Board.[/i][/color]
