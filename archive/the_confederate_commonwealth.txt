Thank you for viewing The Confederate Commonwealth. On behalf of each and every nation within our hallowed region I welcome you. Here we are founded upon the right to rule as you wish. If you desire to be supreme dictator, the president, the sultan, the Pope, or you just want to have anarchy you can do that. We don&amp;#39;t believe in telling anyone what to do. We do however believe in strength through unity. Our region follows the beliefs of The Confederate States of America and realizes that through effort you can achieve whatever you want. We provide support and advice for anyone that seeks it out. Do not hesitate to join our region all we ask is that you have a good personality and the ability to have fun.
