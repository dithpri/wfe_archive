Welcome to our hallowed region, [i][b]The Confederate Commonwealth[/b][/i]!Here in TCC we&amp;#39;ll offer you all the help or advice you&amp;#39;d ever want. If you think you won&amp;#39;t matter here I can assure you that&amp;#39;s not the case at all. We&amp;#39;re big enough that there&amp;#39;s diversity, but small enough that you don&amp;#39;t just become a statistic, so go ahead and move in! We only have one rule here: try to be active and socialize!
