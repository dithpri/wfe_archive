On the 26th day of June in the 2013th year of our lord The Confederate Commonwealth was established. It was on the banks of a small creek while the fog was clearing that two nations signed an agreement of peace, brotherhood, and friendship that is The Confederate Commonwealth. TCC is now a freely open region for all nations that advocate free-rule, state&amp;#39;s rights, and the right to rule how you wish.
