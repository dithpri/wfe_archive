The [b]Rhine[/b]  is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graub&uuml;nden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the German Rhineland and the Netherlands and eventually empties into the North Sea.

The largest city on the Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the [b][region]Danube[/region][/b]).

The Rhine and the Danube formed most of the northern inland frontier of the Roman Empire. Since those days, the Rhine has been a vital and navigable waterway carrying trade and goods deep inland. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
