We, the various Rovinist states from around the world, have decided to come together and form a region and community under [region]THE GREAT HURDLES OF THE ROVINIST STATES[/region] to bring Rovinism back to its rightful status in the world. We will live our lives for Rovin, to Rovin, and because of Rovin. [u][b]Everything we do is all for Rovin.[/b][/u] We will dedicate our lives to doing what our [b]DEAREST LEADER[/b] could not do - make Rovinism and Rovination a world power.
We remember our [b]DEAREST LEADER&#39;S[/b] legendary reign and legacy that will forever be remembered in the hearts and minds of millions of Rovinists around the world.
We remember our [b]DEAREST LEADER[/b].
We remember [i]Rovin.[/i]
