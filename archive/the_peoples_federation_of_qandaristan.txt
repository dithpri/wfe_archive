[b][color=#571B7E]As the sun peaked over the horizon, [region]Peoples Federation of Qandaristan[/region] and it&amp;#39;s allies ventured forward and liberated the old motherland from [region]The Association of Imperialism[/region]. A truce was later on signed and the troops from PFQ and it&amp;#39;s allies are now only stationed for the reason of defending it from raids from other people.[/color]

[color=Orange]All oppressors that arrive will recieve nothing but the pain of death! We fear nobody and we&amp;#39;re nobody&amp;#39;s toy! We serve nobody but ourselves. And with pride, we raise the flag of PFQ along with it&amp;#39;s allies and AoI&amp;#39;s flag aswell, to show that this conflict has been ended.[/color]
