Attempting to truly learn their own way and manage their own affairs, the Floating Continent of Kendretha was established on October 17th 2016 as an independent and partially isolationist region. Citizens may leave safely at their own will, and expect to be informed of the outer world with both media and proof. Occasionally, however, the population of the continent mysteriously vanishes for days only to be seen much later with recollection of a much more boring alternate reality and otherwise in a nearly identical state as to when they disappeared. ((In other words, I want to test stuff a bit on my own. I&#39;m not looking for an echo chamber, but I don&#39;t want to always deal with others&#39; theories... and yes I have a busy life.))
