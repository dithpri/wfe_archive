
Yearly, Termina has a festival called the Carnival of Time. People come from all over Termina to pray for a good harvest in the year to come, as well as celebrate the harmony between nature and time.
it has become custom over the years for everyone to come wearing a mask that they have made themselves. The main attraction of the carnival is the Clock Tower, which only opens its doors to the roof on the eve of the carnival. The people of Termina wait anxiously for midnight, as the Clock Tower&#39;s entrance will open.
There are four corners of Termina, these including Woodfall Swamp, The Great Bay Ocean, Snowhead Mountains, and Ikana Canyon.
