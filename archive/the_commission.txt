The Commission is the governing body of the American Mafia. Formed in 1931, the Commission replaced the &amp;quot;Boss of all Bosses&amp;quot; title with a ruling committee consisting of the New York Five Families bosses and the boss of the Chicago Outfit. The last known Commission meeting held with all the bosses was in November 1985.
