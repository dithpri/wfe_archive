When I was a boy, they called me kid Lacan. Then in school, the teachers called me teen Camus. Now, no one calls me anything.

I never realized that growing up and becoming a man meant growing up and becoming a white man of privilege and taste but just look at me I&#39;m not free though I&#39;ve had every opportunity and for this fact I&#39;ll say I&#39;m sorry. This song is for my ex-wife. Because she knows how hard it is to hold someone who&#39;s got his hands wrapped tight around the prison bars. Still, no complaints, it&#39;s the 5th of July, post-freedom. post restraint. A new life, a new craze, a new sound, all the rage. --&amp;gt; This is serious business. So if I ask you to sing along, just remember: It&#39;s only a business decision.
