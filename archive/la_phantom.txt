Welcome to &#147;La phantom&#148; where D&amp;D/roleplay is mandatory in every post. please remind your citizens to stay inside thar houses from 16:30-17:00 because our region moves at least 100,000 miles every day at that time so our enemies can&#146;t pinpoint our location thx. Please enjoy and let the magic flow through you (side affects may include but not limited to turning invisible shooting fire out of your hands and getting the flu) on that happy note flu vaccines are mandatory simply post that your citizens have received them and you can stay hope you enjoy your stay!
