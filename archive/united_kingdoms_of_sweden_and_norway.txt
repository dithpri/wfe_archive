[b]What if[/b] the Union between Sweden and Norway did not fracture in 1905?
The [b]United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway[/b], simply known as the Northern United Kingdoms (NUK) was formed in 1905 when Gustaf V staged a coup in Norway to hold onto his power in Scandinavia. Initially, the personal union would have been dissolved, but it was recreated into a similar government and administration like Great Britain. While the regions were ethnically separate, the Kingdoms were United in strong leadership. The Northern United Kingdoms eventually joined the Great War on Germany&#39;s side in 1915 and fought until its breakup in 1919.
