Transturkistan is a cultural region that connects Asia with Europe. It is in the south of Russia. The area of Transturkistan has been conquered many times by many cultural and political powers during history. The most recent one has been the Soviet Union, which converted Teranaistan in one of its republics, calling it the SSR of Teranaistan. The Otoman Empire had great influence over the region before the USSR, and the region has been populated by turks, iranians and orthodox catholics as well, making the population of the region a mix of christians and muslims.
