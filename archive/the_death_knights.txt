[b]This region is inspired from the &amp;quot;Death Knights&amp;quot;; a fierce and extremely skilled group of fighters who strike fear into the hearts of many! 
Our purpose is to provide an active regional community and also to participate in raids to destroy helpless regions as well as defenders. 

We are an ally to any Raider, an enemy to any Defender. Fear our wrath, it is not too late to surrender![/b]
