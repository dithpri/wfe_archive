[b]This region is inspired from the &amp;quot;Death Knights&amp;quot;; a fierce and extremely skilled group of fighters who strike fear into the hearts of many! 
Our purpose is to provide a professional atmosphere and also to participate in raids to destroy helpless regions as well as defenders. 

We are an ally of any Raider, an enemy of any Defender. Fear our wrath, it is not too late to surrender![/b]
