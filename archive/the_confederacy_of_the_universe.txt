Welcome, nations of the universe, to the Confederacy of the Universe!

The goal of this region is to create diplomatic relations between nations with territory in space. Without connections between space-based nations, the universe would become lawless. The universe needs a central authority, and this region intends to be that authority.

This region has no government except for the Founder and Delegate. There is also a map of the galaxy, on which member nations can chart territory. The message board is open both to discussions on government matters and space news.

I hope all new member nations enjoy their stay here.
