[B]Let it be known that it was in this region, on the major update of the 7th of June, 2014, that the might of [region]Sicarius[/region] clashed with the feeble leaders of [region]The Eternal Knights[/region] for the first time in history, and the cravens [nation=short]nephmir[/nation] and [nation=short]noblephnx[/nation] were banished to [region]The Rejected Realms[/region], humiliated and defeated. And that fact will stay in the history books, [i]eternally[/i].
