Welcome to Sparks of Life! A laid back and chill region. We play the game when we have time and always look to help others! Stay positive, give feedback, and assist everyone! Oh by the way, here is some basic info!

-Higher ranks are needed! For applications of higher ranks, telegram me what position you would like. Tell me why you want that position, details about your country, and about how long you have played this game. 
-Make dictions! We would love to read and support them!
-Stay involved 

That&#146;s really all I have for right now! Hopefully I can get a higher rank that could help me make this better!
