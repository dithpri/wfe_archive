The great lands of yore, where dragons... uh.. no.

Basically there are some kinda eh people that live here? They&#39;re pretty bad ngl. Looks good though, got some mountains and some trees and some water... actually that&#39;s about it.

So yeah basically everything here is kinda.. mediocre, except the name which took like 20 mins to come up with.
