The Land of Lunatea will grow great again!

Once a place of Harmony where peoples were able to move throughout the regions Lunatea has fallen over the centuries into discord and isolation,  Kingdoms closing their doors, or in some cases a warping of the land making contact impossible.

Mira-Mira will pave the way, we will begin to reunite the Empire and lift the Veil from Lunatea!
