The Raven Constitute is formed, as a direct response the the capitalist Theocracy&amp;#39;s of the Imperial Accord, and Chevalier&amp;#39;s Confederacy. This regime of nations is to protect the ideals of socialism, Communism, Absolute monarchies, and in many cases certain fascist principles and values. To ensure the protection, the Raven Constitute must keep high communication and military authority. The armed forces of The Raven Constitute  are ready for deployment at the blow of a whistle, and are ready to aid in any form of manner.
