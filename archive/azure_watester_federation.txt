[list][color=#2F4F4F]
[*] Government free since 9th August 2020

[*] RP Year: 2036

[*] Vaktaria finds itself victorious over Japan. More so it finds itself the sole dominator over the Pacific, much to the annoyance of the Vaktarian senate which maneuvers against the Grand Marshal.

[*] The Castelian Federation becomes the latest nation to declare war on Britannia, much to the disapproval of Salcanceacy. Will Britannia stand alone for much longer or will they call upon their allies?
