Langkasuka was an ancient Hindu-Buddhist kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula.[1][2] Langkasuka flourished from the 200s to the 1500s as the oldest kingdom in the Malay Peninsula, believed to have been established by descendants of Ashoka the Great.[3] The name is Sanskrit in origin; it is thought to be a combination of langkha for &quot;resplendent land&quot; [4]-sukkha for &quot;bliss&quot;.[5] The kingdom, along with Old Kedah, is among the earliest kingdoms founded on the Malay Peninsula. The exact location of the kingdom is of some debate, but archaeological discoveries at Yarang near Pattani, Thailand suggest a probable location. The kingdom is proposed to have been established in the 1st century, perhaps between 80 and 100 AD.[6]
