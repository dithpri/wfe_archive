[b][u]The Anarchic Alliance is the alliance of rouge nations, ones who broke free from former leaders and wish to escape the oppression of higher powers.[/b][/u]

[b]Strike fear upon your enemies[/b], and tear them to shreds. Terror can be your greatest ally, or your worst enemy.

Democracy and Capitalism are allowed, but are frowned upon. (Democracy can be changed, just wait for the ability to become an Autocracy)

We are [b]anti-WA, GA, and SC.[/b] Any legislation trying to be passed will be voted against, unless they are repeals. Please join the World Assembly to do this.

No rules except for the acknowledgement of your allegiance towards The Anarchic Alliance, and that you will help your allies in their time of need, regardless of what that may be.
