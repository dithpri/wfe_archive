After years of being abandoned... The leader of The Stormgazers has reclaimed his old home. Now that he is back, the entire world shall once again fear the storm. Everyone... Shall fear what we do as this returning region. We will re-teach fear... We will show what it means to have... Fear
Remember... This is a sacred place... FOR THE STORM!!!
