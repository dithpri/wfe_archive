The Order has existed for longer than many know, operating in the shadows unbeknownst to the world at large. The Orders primary mission carry&#146;s a single purpose- to spread the Great Truth. In summation, the Great Truth holds that tyrannical, totalitarian, oligarchic regional governments deserve to fall. The doctrine dictates that they [b]must[/b] fall in order for the world to experience true greatness. 
As such, the Order is a warning to the tyrants and oppressors of the world- that their region is not safe, and that the Truth of collective rule will come about and usher in an age of collective prosperity.
