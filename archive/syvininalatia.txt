The madmen.
The survivors.
The redeemers.
The saviors.
The cryers.

Welcome to Syvininalatia. The Dark Woods. We survived a war that destroyed Scotland&amp;#39;s society, but not its environment. We stand here and live on the environment. 

We welcome mercenaries in the Scottish geographic region. Take your mantle of leadership and join us along with the mercenaries that come.

The founder, [nation]Wynnciatili[/nation], stands as the center pillar of this new society. Dictators welcome.
