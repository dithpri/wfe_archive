There are three types of biodiversity.
Genetic diversity - range of genetic material present in a gene pool. ex - Gros Michel bananas, seals
Species diversity - the number of species (richness) vs relative proportions (evenness)
Habitat diversity - range of habitats per unit area

They are all comparative but can help identify important/vulnerable areas.

Higher biodiversity is at lower stages of succession, rarely the climax community.
