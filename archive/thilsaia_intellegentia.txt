A genie will give a man three wishes if he solve the genie&amp;#39;s riddle. The man has to tell the genie the ages of three magic carpets in descending order. The genie tells the man that the numbers multiply out to be 36, but the man doesn&amp;#39;t know. The genie then tells him that the ages add up to be the number on the genie&amp;#39;s chest (the man can see this number), but the man still doesn&amp;#39;t know. The genie then tells him that the eldest magic carpet is red, and the man knows the ages. What are the ages? Input your answer as such in the password box: If your answer was 1, 1, and 1, write it as 111. If the ages were 1, 2, and 1, write it as 121, and so on. Happy puzzling!
