[B]Welcome to [u][region]STARCOM[/region][/u]!!!!!!! This region is a strict alliance of embassy regions that are unified. To be a member, construct an embassy with us and send a puppet over to this region from the region that you are representing . [color=red]Failure to do so will result closure of embassy. NOTE: If we send you an embassy request and you don&#39;t want to be a member just contact by telegram [nation=short]STARCOM Commander[/nation] or [nation=short]Greater Omega Wolf[/nation] or simply reject the request.
