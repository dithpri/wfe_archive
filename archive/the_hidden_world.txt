A dimension only accessible through a select few portals, The Hidden World is a land beyond the reach of most men. It&amp;#39;s a land populated by magical creatures, with the only humans being the ones who have managed to slip in. The occasional breach in a portal is the reason for its human population, and it&amp;#39;s the reason for the mythical creature sightings of Earth.
