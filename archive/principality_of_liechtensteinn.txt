The name [nation]Lieechtenstein[/nation] comes from the fusion of the words liechten (variant form of the term lichten, &quot;clear&quot; in German) and stein (&quot;stone&quot; in German), therefore literally meaning, in the local language, &quot;clear stone&quot;. Its association with the principality is due to the fact that the [nation]Lieechtenstein[/nation] family bought and united the counties of Schellenberg and Vaduz, giving rise to the current territory of the country.
