[b] Welcome to GUAN! [/b] We&#39;re a group of nations on both the left and the right, and the middle! We welcome you to read the dispatches and such and get comfortable!

[b] We are what makes the left great, and we are what makes the right great. We balance the faults out with the good, and allow the righteous to shine through [/b]
