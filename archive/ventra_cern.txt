Vague Rules:
-All non-military actions go through Information Dispersal in the form of direct telegrams. Posting every action taken by your nation is a good way to lose the element of surprise.
-All military actions (including intelligence work) go through Primus Logica through direct telegrams. He will decide their outcome.
-No GodModding. While we acknowledge that everyone wants victory, don&#39;t make yourself overpowered, we will call you on it if it happens, but just be aware of it.
-Use Factbooks (Please for the love of the Great Spout use Factbooks). They make your country more interesting, and easier to work with from a GM standpoint.
-Have Fun! We&#39;re all friends here (I hope).
