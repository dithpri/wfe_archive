We seek to build a civilization that situates itself upon the 3 following qualities: social egalitarianism, democratic emancipation, economic harmony and or coexistence with the Earth, and governmental transparency. An internationally consolidated effort that seeks to bring about the materialization of all four aspirations may seem to represent a utopian pipedream, but we intend to apply a pragmatic approach to the undertaking of this effort. Initially, every living and breathing human being has a place and a say in our civilization. We would like to welcome all newcomers into our ranks; however, we ask that only serious parties join us in the World Unilateral Humanitarian Republic.
