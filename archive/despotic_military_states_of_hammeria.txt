&amp;quot;We are the future of upright Military Dictatorships. We aren&amp;#39;t here to make ourselves heroes, but to live among society like every other Nation. However, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we are friendly. If anybody among any nation would like a war we will fight them and we appreciate their supports for our War Economies. We are Dogs of War, Men of Hate. And don&amp;#39;t you forget it.&amp;quot;
