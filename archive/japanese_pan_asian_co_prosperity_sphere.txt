This region, an imitation of the WWII-era [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere]Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere[/url], was confiscated by the [region]Regional Defense Committee[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b].

Nominally, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere ([i]Dai-to-a Kyoeiken[/i] in Japanese) was an international organization that promoted East Asian unity. In reality, it was intended to help subjugate Japan&amp;#39;s allies and puppets under Japanese supremacy.
