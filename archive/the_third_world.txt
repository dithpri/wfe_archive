[region]The Third World[/region]

[b]History[/b] 
The world has ended twice now. Once by fire. Once by flood. Fortunetly some humans have survived and have come together to form Nations and government. Now we wait for the next ending. Now we try to survive The Third World.

Telegram me to get on the Map. Include a part of the world you are interested in and I will give you a random country size ranging from 1 (About the size of San Marino) - 10 (About the size of Russia). When we amass at least 10 Nations I will work together with the Nations to create a Constitution and worldwide government. We encourage RP here. Also if anyone is interested, I&amp;#39;m looking for someone to create an offsite forum to keep us all connected and Better RP.
