Aether World was isolated dimension &amp;quot;constructed&amp;quot; by some mages (or shamans) in times before the oldest scripts would inform (every reports of this strange experiment was destructed). In some special cases this universe can &amp;quot;resonate&amp;quot; with the well known world and contact for a little period. One case of this connection is meeting the inhabitants of Mezoamerica before the flourishing of Mayas civilization or the mysterious vanishing in Bermuda Triangle and terrible case of Mary Celeste ship.
