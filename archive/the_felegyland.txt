The Felegylands were built upon the ash of many nations. Fire, brimstone, and thunder decimated the land until only a few people were left. There are no laws in the Felegyland, except one. The natives call it &quot;Supply and Demand.&quot; All the other nations lacked the right capital and entrepreneurship but, damn it hurts to be this hip.
