[b][color=red]Welcome to Asia Pacific[/color][/b], a laid back region for nations with an Asian and/or Pacific Island theme. 

We invite you to kick back and enjoy a cocktail by the beach at one of the many [b][color=blue]tropical paradises[/color][/b] dotting our region, take a hike through one of our hundreds of [b][color=green]luscious rainforests[/color][/b], sit and meditate in an [b][color=orange]ancient temple[/color][/b], or sip some bubble tea at a trendy Asian cafe in one of our [b][color=purple]bustling metropolises[/color][/b]. 

Asia Pacific is open to peaceful nations of all political persuasions and government styles, and hope you enjoy your stay in one of the most diverse and prosperous regions Under Heaven.
