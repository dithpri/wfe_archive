[i][color=666666]Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The name &amp;quot;Nairobi&amp;quot; comes from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nyrobi, which translates to &amp;quot;cold water&amp;quot;. The phrase is also the Maasai name of the Nairobi river, which in turn lent its name to the city. 

Founded by the British in 1899 as a simple rail depot on the railway linking Mombasa to Uganda, the town quickly grew to become the capital of British East Africa in 1907, and eventually the capital of the newly independent Kenyan republic in 1963. During Kenya&amp;#39;s colonial period, the city became a centre for the colony&amp;#39;s coffee, tea and sisal industry.[/i] &#151;Wikipedia.org
