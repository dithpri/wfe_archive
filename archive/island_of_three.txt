The Island of Three is a region that consists of three islands the size and shape of Australia&amp;#39;s Tasmania, spaced just a mile apart from each other in a triangle formation, the tip of the island pointing outward.

Each island has a huge, dense jungle with trees reaching a kilometre high leading multi-level ecosystems, meaning you&amp;#39;d see completely different species at the ground floor as you&amp;#39;d see at the canopy. In the centre of the three islands is a rich coral teeming with hundreds of thousands of separate species. The Island of Three is one of the most bio-diverse places in the world.

Each island and all other smaller islands surrounding it are owned by the Empire of Demtona and King Arkright.
