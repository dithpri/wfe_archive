Okay, Communists. I&#39;ve sat through your &#39;talks&#39; and your &#39;theories&#39; and I&#39;ve read all of Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and Mack Reynolds . I know probably more about your own ideology than you do. I&#39;ve done all of this simply to prove a point. Fascism is EXACTLY the same thing as Communism. Fascism = Communism, Communism = Fascism. You get that yet? I&#39;ll run you through it again in case you missed it (Shocking that my logic would go right over your heads, I know.) Fascism is exactly the same thing as Communism.
