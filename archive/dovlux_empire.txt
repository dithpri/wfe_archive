In the Dovlux Empire, we strive to make every citizen&#39;s life as brilliant as possible. Our two key nations - Douvniss &amp; Wilux - are both attain stable centrist to left wing governments. The Dovlux Empire&#39;s nations are as close to a modern utopia as you can imagine. As a collaborative empire our political priorities are Education, Healthcare, Welfare, Public Services &amp; Defense. This does sometimes result in high taxation, but citizens agree that it is worth the cost. We have no interest in war, but we are strong believers in justice, so will do our best to defend our people and territory. We are for the people, have nothing to do with racism or sexism and are proud supporters of the LGBT community.
