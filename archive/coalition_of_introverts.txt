The founder is One Awkward Man, and has no idea what joining other regions would entail in terms of required and/or expected engagement and activity. As such, this region was founded for like-minded people: those who are really only here because they think running a country is interesting but find the region-based roleplay system scary. We do absolutely nothing here, so only join if all you plan to do is manage your nation.
