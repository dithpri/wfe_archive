[b]Water Island[/b] was acquired by the USA in 1917 from Denmark but continued to be owned by a corporation until it formed part of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1966. The island is of volcanic origin and lies to the south of Saint Thomas in the Charlotte Amalie harbor.

At 491.5 acres in size, Water Island is the smallest of the main U.S. Virgin Islands. A number of homes on Water Island are available to accommodate visitors. The main attractions are beaches, including Honeymoon Beach, plantation ruins, Fort Segarra, an underground fort partially constructed by the U.S. during World War II, and scuba diving site Supermarket Reef, in Limestone Bay. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
