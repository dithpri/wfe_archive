We are the glorious collection of countries is Southern Africa, we are very right wing much like the regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa in the 1970&#39;s, we are run by oligarchs of rich white minorities much like our predecessors, but we do this in the name of wellbeing for our citizens (no we don&#39;t we do it because we&#39;re afraid the native Africans will hurt us) (ps they won&#39;t we don&#39;t give them food so don&#39;t be scared of them) hope you give us a try!
