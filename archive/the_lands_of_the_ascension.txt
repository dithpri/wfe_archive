Lands at the very edge of the world, founded by Christian pilgrims fleeing from atheism and cultural Marxism at the turn of the third millennium. Initially discovered and settled by Millenaria, a diocese of the Anglican Church in Exile seeking to rule according to God&amp;#39;s Holy decree in whatever way possible. All brother and sister Protestant nations welcome. Atheists, Papists, Hindoos and Mohametans need not apply.
