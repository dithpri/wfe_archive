A long time ago in the faraway northern lands there was a great nation called the Empire of Janeribo, a land torn apart by years of civil war. The Empire was ruled by three lords, but one day the lord of Vigebo decleared war against the two two lords of Janerico. The war divided the Empire into three countries: The Kingdom Of Janerico, The Republic of JanErikCo and The Armed Republic Of Vigebo.
