Originally vicious Vikings the Jutes, inspired by their ancestral hero Beowulf, sailed south and conquered a huge empire from Denmark to New Zealand extending from the northernmost North Atlantic to the southernmost Pacific Nations.  The empire gained and lost down the centuries but the ancient capital at Canterbury remained...as did their motto &#39;The night of the Long Knives is ours&#39;.
Actually they also have an oddly tolerant attitude too...irreligious or Paganistic, OK with minorities and gentle with those that fall before their military might.
