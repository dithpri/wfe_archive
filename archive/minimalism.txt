[b]Founded on 5 May, 2022. [/b]

This regions purpose is to serve as a community for those who adhere to or are interested in Minimalism or Extreme Minimalism. 

The Founder is currently in the process of creating a regional map for RP purposes. 

Minimalism (the region) has been envisioned with having an egalitarian &amp; democratic nature. Once we manage to grow to a group of 5 or so people we will begin the formulation of a regional government. 

[i]Being a member of the WA is not a requirement to join this region, but is preferential. Should one decide to use a secondary or puppet nation to join us, they must share with the group who their primary nation is.[/i]
