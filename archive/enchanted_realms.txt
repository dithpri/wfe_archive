This is the story of two celestial birds, the heavenly swan, Cygnus, and the vulture that carries Orpheus&#39; lyre in its beak, the same lyre which could tame wild animals.
With these birds&#39; ability to fly between earth and sky, they bridge worlds - the mundane practical world and the virtual world of dreams, desires, and wholeness.
The swan, it was said, flew so high it was thought to reach the realm of the immortal gods, while the vulture carried the souls of the dead to heaven for eventual rebirth.
