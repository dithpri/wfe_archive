The Royal territory is the region founded in the Old Kingdom and started with the nation of Albion. The territory was meant to be ruled under the royal absolute monarchy. All who decide to rebel will be split from the region. And if any of these uprisings become a revolution, a war will begin and the country will be battled(challenged). All must remain loyal to the royal family to be given any sort of Military rank. All political ranks are forbidden as politics throw off absolute rule.
