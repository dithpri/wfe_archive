As collection of port cities, the region was notorious for its gaudy displays of wealth and loose morals, with the privateer crews spending their treasure in the many taverns, gambling houses and brothels which catered for the sailors. The Elisian Ports effectively became a pirate republic, and they continued to use the city as their main base during the 17th century. Pirates from around the world congregated near the central waters of Maeyaghana, coming from waters as far away as Madagascar. This region became notorious in folklore as &#39;the wickedest place on Earth&#39;
