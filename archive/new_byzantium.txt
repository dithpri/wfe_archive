[b]Founded in late 2017, New Byzantium wishes to break free of the status quo of NS and create a new standard for regions. We seek not only the betterment of ourselves but the conquest of the world.

You will find many opportunities here whether it be Raiding and Defending, Regional Politics and Role Play if you can think it, chances are we have it.
