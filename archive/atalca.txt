Welcome to Atalca! Home to the countries of Torang, Eviatra, Zalund, and Decepticon Empire, among others. This region is fairly small, and lies far to the south, mostly away from other, more populous regions. While all the leaders here may be friends and allies, each one runs a wildly different government, from corrupt dictators, to friendly socialists. One and all are welcome here, even if the RMB tends to be a bit quiet.
