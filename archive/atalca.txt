A vast continent, covering a huge area of land. Home to the countries of Torang, Eviatra, and Sithisilithia among others. The continent sits mostly by itself in a huge ocean, and is difficult to reach by sea due to the great current that lies to the south. The continent is extremely bland, so much so that many people have criticized extremely truthful accounts of it, saying that they were to bland. The reason the continent is so bland is because most of the countries that make it up have very little idea what an environment is, and so are continually messing it up. Many of the countries that make up Atalca are ruled over by evil dictators, who enjoy suppressing the masses, bombing other countries, and basket weaving.
