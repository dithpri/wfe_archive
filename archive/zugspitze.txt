[color=333333]The Zugspitze, at 9,718 ft above sea level, is the highest peak of the Wetterstein Mountains as well as the highest mountain in Germany. It lies south of the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and the border between Germany and Austria runs over its western summit. South of the mountain is the Zugspitzplatt, a high karst plateau with numerous caves. On the flanks of the Zugspitze are three glaciers, including the two largest in Germany: the Northern Schneeferner with an area of 30.7 hectares and the H&ouml;llentalferner with an area of 24.7 hectares. The third is the Southern Schneeferner which covers 8.4 hectares.[/color] &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
