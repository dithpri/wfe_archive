[b][i]Welcome to [region]Grimwatch Peak[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This mountain is said to be cursed, drenched from an evil that plagued the land in a time long since forgotten by most. Unfortunately, it has not been forgotten by all. Sargon has come here to perform a dark ritual.

This ritual will resurrect the slain King but he will only return as a creature of darkness once again! His corrupt rule cannot be allowed to return to Armello! Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points will stop Sargon!
