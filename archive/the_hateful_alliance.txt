The Hateful Alliance hates nations that have good civil rights and political freedoms. What we really look for in a nation is at most below average civil rights and a maximum of average political freedoms. Though we do not enforce this strictly, we do hope all nations in the region strive to achieve this easily accomplished goal.

&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t walk in front of me; I may shoot you. Don&amp;#39;t walk behind me; I may suspect treachery and shoot you. Just walk as far away from me as possible; you smell funny.&amp;quot; - Emperor Buttcheeks III of Enemy Island
