Welcome and behold the wonderful Kingdom of Glory!

All new nations welcomed, provided they (mostly) behave and treat other nations with respect.

We have no forums, nor plans to gain forums. This is a grassroots, true-to-the game region.

Other than that, enjoy the nation! Feel free to discuss and interact in whatever manner you wish. And as always, your nation is your own!
