We are back after a month of inactivity. We had recently taken a break, a little too long, may we add, but we&#39;re back for a while. No socialists or members of [b]THE BLACK HAWKS[/b] allowed here. Martial Law is in effect until we get our region put back together. [b]Any suspected Socialists, Black Hawks, or members of any other terrorist region shall be banjected PDQ![/b]
