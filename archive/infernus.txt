Infernus is a glorious, fiery hellhole situated on several fault lines, and the entire region is littered with active volcanoes. Life is constantly interrupted by frequent volcanic activity, and the citizens living in this region live brutal lives, but their resolute nature and resilience enables them to thrive in an otherwise inhospitable region. Most people wear permanent breathing masks to prevent themselves from inhaling ash and other trace gases.
