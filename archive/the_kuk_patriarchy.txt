&quot;The Capitalism is back. You think Communism will win? Think again!&quot;
-The Pflug, Bratola Suru

A period of hibernation had spurred foreign states of the communist bloc to invade this region and establish a false rule under communism.
However, the ever vigilant watcher [nation]Stilts Island[/nation] resisted their rule, and called for the reawakening of the dormant member states.

Order is restored. 
Communism shall not set foot on our soils once more!
