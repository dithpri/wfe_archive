The CSA is a confederation of Capitalist states and economy-based dictators, founded and led by current president East Ares. The elected WA Delegate is the United Conservative Provinces, so endorse him. We also have a Futbol league in the works, working name Alirus Football Association (AFA). 

Glory to wealth, prosperity to all who embrace it. Alirus shall rule, and none shall rule Alirus. So says the CSA.
