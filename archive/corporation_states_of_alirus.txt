The CSA is a capitalist region that is under the leadership as of writing by East Ares. It chooses its leader based on GDP, so its leadership often fluctuates. It values military strength, defensive strength, traditional religion, and wealth. We do not endorse violently liberal governments, or any that value environment/ inclusiveness etc. above money. Hail CSA. Strength through Wealth, Victory through Strength.
