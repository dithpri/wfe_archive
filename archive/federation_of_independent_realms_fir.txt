The Federation of Independent Realms aims to aggregate the largest possible number of monarchical states, where the Security, Education, Health and Defense are the priorities. 
Each State has its own sovereign and their own government. 
All states are equal in terms of rights and duties. The Head of the Federation is busy every 3 years by one of the Heads of State of member countries in alphabetical order.
