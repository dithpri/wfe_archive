The Federation of Independent Realms aims to aggregate the largest possible number of absolutist monarchical states, where the Security, Education, Health and Defense are the priorities. Each State has its own absolutist sovereign. All states are equal in terms of rights and duties. The Head of the Federation is occupied every 6 months by one of the Princes of each realm in alphabetical order.
