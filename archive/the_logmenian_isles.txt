The Logmenian Isles were initially founded by immigrants of wars in other countries. When Logmenia began to get larger, a small group of political extremists, calling themselves the Healthy Nazis, founded their own country west of the mainland of Logmenia. Now political disputes have made the neighbouring countries seem more distant than ever.
