Born out of the Cerberus Party of the /pol/ Parliament, this region is for nations dedicated to uplifting humanity by any means.

In order to survive humanity must reach for the stars, as well as preserve the planet that spawned our species.

While Nationstates is a purely fun pursuit, I encourage (but don&amp;#39;t require) region members to do whatever they are able to encourage political and private efforts to colonize other worlds and extend the reach of humanity.
