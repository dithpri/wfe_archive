[color=green][b]Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out the flag of war
&#39;Twas better to die &#39;neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania&#39;s huns with theirlong-range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew[/color][/b]
