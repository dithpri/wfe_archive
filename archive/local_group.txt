[i]&quot;The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way.&quot;[/i] ~ Wikipedia

Welcome to the Local Group region! We accept everyone, except raiders.
Our views: economic freedom and egalitarianism (equality of all people). We are against abortion, euthanasia etc.
Of course, this is only our worldview. Our main goal is to have fun. So, if you don&#39;t share our views, you can join us anyway, but you cannot be WA Delegate.

For foreign affairs, you can contact WA Delegate, Foreign Minister or Founder (not only him).
