The year is 1456. The new world has been discovered and powers scramble to carve out their own swath of this coveted land. But this isn&#39;t the story you&#39;ve heard thousands of times from a history textbook, oh no... New nations will climb to power as they vie for control of this brave, new world. Alliances will be formed, as well as broken. Will you be a foreign conqueror? Or a fierce tribal confederation fighting to preserve you&#39;re freedom and way of life? Can you survive Novae Terrae?
