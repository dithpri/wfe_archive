the dominion of slarithar is a loose alliance of the people of slarithar, cwalu, the tribals of the green waste and the now independent cwalu slaritharian trading outpost. led by slarithar as rightful high king of the greenwastes. our native nations seem to all have a national animal that is a form of megafauna and leaders with unusually long lifespans. at one time the three founding nations were at war but through time they have found peace with each other. whether through trade or peaceful discussion. all four leaders have pledged freindship and loyalty to the dominion of slarithar and its high king the mortal snake. we ask that you join and help expand our great empire. &quot;safe under his mercy&quot;
