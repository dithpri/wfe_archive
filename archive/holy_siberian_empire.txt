[color=yellow][b][i]We are a region dedicated to the Orthodox variation of Christianity, and we dedicate ourselves to following the Lord&#39;s teachings. The Holy Siberian Empire upholds traditional values and ideologies that are rooted deep into our souls, the souls created by god himself. We shall follow the teachings of the Father, The Son, And The Holy Spirit. In a time of the world where others are losing faith, we shall rise, and teach and spread the word and love of gods embrace![/i][/b][/color]
