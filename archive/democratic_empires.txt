Our Empires are weak! Let us unify!

We need to know where your empire is. I will give you the map: [url=http://imgur.com/a/tjhmK]Map[/url]

Rules:
- No wars
- If you want to annex a country, annex a small country. You cannot annex countries some countries.
- If a country departs this region, the surrounding countries(s) should take over portions of the country that just left.

Have fun in this new region!
