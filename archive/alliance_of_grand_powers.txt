[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Captured: 11.01.18[/I]

[color=red]This region was owned by a variety of Nazi regions over the years, including [region]The Greater German Reich[/region], [region]The Peoples States[/region], [region]National Socialist League[/region], [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region] and [region]Third Rome[/region].

It has now been captured by the mighty Anti-Fascist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
