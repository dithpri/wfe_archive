Lyro II is a lonesome lush planet orbiting a yellow-white class F star named Lyro with only one other planet orbiting the star being Lyro I, a rocky irradiated planet too close to the local star to safely approach without extensive radiation and heat protection. It is home to a multitude of nations and countries, a majority being primarily Human poppulated but others contain other species as their primary populace. Lyro II has had a very turbulent diplomatic history, disputes over ownership and legality having struck multiple wars.
