The Dragon&#39;s Spine is a free and independent region in the south. The land controlled by The Dragon&#39;s Spine is a wide expanse of territory shaped like a dragon if you are looking at a dragon that is stretched out in a flying position from the top view. The dragon&#39;s body is facing north. From the back of the head to the tip of the tail, a mountain range runs thinly down the middle of the region. Most of the cities are located on the wings, but Valdaria Lydar is settled at the center of the head.

In The Dragon&#39;s Spine everyone is allowed to rule how they want, join and leave at free will, and believe in whoever they want to believe in. However, we will not tolerate violence.
