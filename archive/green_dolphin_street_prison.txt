[i]Even though there should be one meal per person, the number of meals does not match the number of prisoners. Lunch boxes will be conveniently sold out when it&#39;s someone&#39;s turn to get one. Using the phones requires a reservation or prisoners will have to buy the spot. It usually takes a month or more of waiting to use the phones. The prison has a shop that sells branded items like Rolex watches and Louis Vuitton bags.[/i]
