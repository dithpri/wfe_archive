The Galactic Community is an extranational authority in Universe AF863W2342 in the Milky Way Galaxy, also known as A&amp;#269;za &amp;#321;od by the Forerunners and Nch&#39;loth by the Elder Gods. The spiral galaxy is currently in its 37th civilizational cycle and several interstellar states have sprung up. Interdimensional communication is in the workings but the community prefers to self-isolate.
