We are a region that supports strength above all else. Whether that is economic strength, militaristic strength, or soft power we welcome it all. We only have 2 rules and they are the following;

1. No Coups allowed. This means that you cannot try to take control of this region by any means besides the W.A endorsement method. If we get wind of you trying to get around this rule you will be banned.

2. Anyone is welcome. That means no matter what you have done in the past as long as you have strength you will be welcomed. We accept Condemned, we accept exiles, we accept traitors. We accept EVERYONE. Unless you killed a flying hippo.
