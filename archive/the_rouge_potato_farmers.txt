We are the last remaining group of the great potato farming tribes. Our ancient tradition of farming potatoes with human blood has been outlawed in most regions of the world. We have gone from farming with the blood of enemies and prisoners to a &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot; way in which blood is donated by our willing citizens.
