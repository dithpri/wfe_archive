They said, &amp;quot;Let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto Heaven. 
Let us make us a [i]shem[/i], lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth.&amp;quot;

The Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.

The Lord said, &amp;quot;Behold, the people are one and they have all one language, and this they begin to do. 
Now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&amp;#39;s speech.&amp;quot;

So the Lord scattered them abroad from there upon the face of the entire Earth, and they stopped building the city.

Therefore, its name is called [i]Babel[/i] because the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth.
