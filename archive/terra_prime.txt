Welcome to Terra Prime, a form of sanctuary created by [nation=long]Sovereign California[/nation].
Terra Prime is one of many Earths in the Fractal Earth region of Fractal Sol. Despite the region&#39;s name, this region would be something like Earth-977.

Terra Prime is the successor to [region]Earth Prime[/region] (July 31, 2003 &#150; September 4, 2025), may it rest in peace.
