[b]&quot;Rheinmetall Nummer Eins&quot;[/b]

[b]History[/b]

In 1945 Rheinmetall created a portal that&#39;d let the F&uuml;hrer escape from the lost war, but he denies, rather some people, government officials, and officers volunteered. After the Allied Forces found the portal, the portal was already shut down and blown up.
After a year in 1946, the people agreed upon a treaty that would start independent countries in their own realm.
Thus, in 1947, the start of a new region and era has appeared.

Era: 1947 (Cold War).
Headquarters: Saarbr&uuml;cken, Saarland.
