This is a democratic socialist region that welcomes socialists, democratic communists, left-wing anarchists, environmentalists and civil libertarians. We are risen from the ruins of the now founderless [region]Democratic Socialist Alliance[/region]! We extend a hand of friendship and solidarity to all comrade regions.

All dictatorial, totalitarian, racist, and imperialist nations are not welcome here, and will be permanently banned from the region. Nations with civil rights or political freedoms ranked less than &quot;some&quot; are prohibited.
