The U.S., Canada, and Mexico have all fallen in a great cataclysmic event. It began in 2023. We started in the year 2070, and every day that passes out of the game is one year in-game. This resulted in many states, and provinces having to fend for themselves, and pick up the pieces. Many states have already fallen to either foreign powers, civil powers, or just outright unrest.
