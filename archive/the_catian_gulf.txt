[b]The Catian Gulf Economic Cooperation Zone (CGEZ)[/b]

Created in the interest of advancing trade between the region&#39;s nations, the CGEZ requires member states to strike down tariffs on all other member states. In addition, a member state is not advised to join the World Assembly; international law is both bureaucratic and out of touch with many of the individuals it attempts to govern.

The top priority of the CGEZ is the drafting and passage of the Catian Gulf Free Trade Agreement; which seeks to advance economic cooperation between all member states.
