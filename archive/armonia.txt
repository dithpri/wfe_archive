Armonia is a region that consists of 7 small islands on the southwestern border of Australia, which haven&#39;t been discovered over the course of human history. (except by us) It hospitalizes a harsh, unforgiving, hot, climate. Where the summer sun always blazes on your back. Several infamous tyrants and dictators have escaped to these islands and made it their own personal resort, bulldozing rainforests that these islands nurture. These tyrants have left a stain on the history of Armonia, and it&#39;s our job to rebuild the islands.
