The continents of Especia &amp; Meridon lay across from each other, with the Verdean archipelago to the south of Capisaria. Home to two international organisations, the Union of Meridon, and the Organization of Especian States. The two continents are home to such wide differences of nations, from a highly developed nation of socialists, roaming nomads with a mountain city, or a nation with world-renowned toilets.
