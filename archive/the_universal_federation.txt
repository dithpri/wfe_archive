[b]Welcome to the Universal Federation, a small but growing alliance of nations trying to find its path in the world. Our philosophy is to promote unity and discussion across all political lines. At the same time, we do have standards as we wish to create a positive environment for all. As such, please avoid our region if you or your nation espouses hatred/discrimination/supremacy based on race, religion, gender, sexuality, nationality, or ethnicity unless your nation is intended as a parody/mockery of such things. Thank you and happy gaming.
