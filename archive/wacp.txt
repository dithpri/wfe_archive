[B]Welcome to the World Assembly Conservative Party.[/b]

[B]All conservatives are welcome to join![/b]
Please review [url=www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=492561]the WACP rules[/url]

[B]Our[/b] objective is to unite conservatives and furthering  conservative ideals in the World Assembly.

[B]Remember[/b] each endorsement our WAD gets gives them an extra vote in the World Assembly;
So therefore please help make our party a major player in the WA and endorse our WAD!

Conservatives believe in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, 
traditional values and a strong national defense. The role of the WA should be to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. 
Conservative policies emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems.
