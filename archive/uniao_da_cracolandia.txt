[b][region]The North Pacific[/region] Army, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]The East Pacific[/region] Sovereign Army, [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy, [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region], [region]Balder[/region] Jomsvikings, and [region]Social Technocratic Union[/region] are all wasting away again in this region.
