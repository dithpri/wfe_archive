[color=orange]Considered to be the most holy destination for pilgrims in the [b]entirety of Poland[/b], the Jasna Gora monastery was founded by Pauline Monks from Hungary. Besides being the final resting place for many hundreds of treasures brought as tribute from great kings and dukes of Poland, such as emblazoned sabres and elaborately decorated Hetmans&amp;#39; bulawas (symbols of authority), it is also home to the most easily recognized and holiest religious artifact in Poland, [b]the Black Madonna of Czestochowa[/b]. The portrait is credited with several miracles including a victory over Swedish forces which had attempted to take the fortress during a time known in Poland as the Deluge.

All pilgrims are welcome![/color]
