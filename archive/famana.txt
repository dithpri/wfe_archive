Famana is an earth analog one of two naturally habitable planets to humanoids in the Milky Way, the other being Earth itself. It is the main setting of The Sunset Mapping&#39;s History of Famana. Initially, Pextum&#39;s deduced Famana was the second planet from their sun, yet in the finale, Emastala claims for their system to have 9 planets, so Famana&#39;s position is likely inaccurate.
