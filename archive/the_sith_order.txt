The Sith Order was founded in order to attempt to revive the Community that once was The Galactic Order, a failed initiative after an extremely explosive ending to a once thriving community.

The community members of The Sith Order shall always remember the good times within this region and The Galactic Order. May the next fool who founds a Star Wars region be more successful than we ever could be.
