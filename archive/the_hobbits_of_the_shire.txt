&amp;quot;Welcome to the Shire, a land of peace, prosperity, good food, good cheer, and good folk! One of the last beacons of innocence and peace in the turmoil and war that engulfs Middle Earth. It is a quiet country, where the simple hobbits live their lives in near secrecy from the world. Much of the land is devoted to farming and agriculture, especially the growth of pipe-weed and mushrooms, both curious local favorites of the hobbits. It is divided into the four regions: Northfarthing, Southfarthing, Eastfarthing, and Westfarthing.&amp;quot;
