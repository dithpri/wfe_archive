The Modern-Era World is a region with an alternate timeline. The world is based on the actual Earth, but with other borders. Every serious RPer can join this region, after sending an application. It is a serious RP, which means that nations should respect eachother. One day in real life is one week in the RP. To represent other countries with no real user, the Community of Represented Nations will be used.
You can find the rules, map and application down below.
