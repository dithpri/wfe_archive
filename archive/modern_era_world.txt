[region]Modern Era World[/region] is a region with an alternate timeline. The world is based on the actual Earth, but with other borders. Every serious RPer can join this region, after sending an application. It is a serious RP, which means that nations should respect each-other. The Community of Represented nations represents all AI-countries.
