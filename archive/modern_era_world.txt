[B]I&#39;m sorry that this had to happen, but the region is dead. The co-founder left, and I will also stop participating on NS once and for all.

If you want to keep the RP ongoing, you can discuss with the other members of this region to create a new region that follows the story. You can copy and paste all my content in my dispatches. 
It was a pleasure to have participated in it. Thank you for your understanding.[/B]
