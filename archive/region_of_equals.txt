fter [nation]Venice and Lombardy[/nation] abdicated, and I took power, I was both surprised that I would have such power, and confused why they chose me. Whatever the reason is, I was mostly grateful to have a brand new region with so many people and to get them so quickly! We went from 6 non-WA members and 1 WA member to 18 non-WA members and 3 WA members in a few hours! Our population, or whatever you want to call it, tripled in that much time! As governor, I will be focusing on establishing embassies with other regions and writing factbooks about my country and my region. Thank you so much for being a member of the [region]Region of Equals[/region].
