The World of Westeros is a RP region based on the popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire, or perhaps better known to some as the TV show Game of Thrones. Roleplay is conducted in our offsite forums found [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/World_of_Westeros/index/]here[/url]. On our forum you can choose a character - either a canon one who has not yet been taken, or a non-canon one that you have invented yourself - and roleplay with the other members of the region all over Westeros and beyond. Come join us, and prepare yourself for a great time!
