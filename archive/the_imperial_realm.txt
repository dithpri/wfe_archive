We are a region that prides ourselves on our military might. We oppress enemy opposition with swift action and military precision. Our military is unmatched in technology and discipline. Mess with us and we will burn you to the ground! Our cities are built underground so good luck with whatever air raids you foolishly attempt, not to mention the uber amount of anti aircraft guns we maintain.
