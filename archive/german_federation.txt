[b][u]     Guten T&auml;g![/u][/b]
  Hallo und willkommen to the [b] [color=red]German Federation[/color][/b]. We are sort of the successor state to the HRE, and as such we elect our Kaiser, even if they hold no real power. We are allies of [b][region]The Kaiserreich[/region][/b]. Note that if you want to run for Kaiser, you must have a monarchy in play, whether said monarch is a figurehead or rules directly. If you don&#39;t have a monarch though, you can still vote for the Kaiser and all. Also note that puppet states are welcome. We also have an army, the [b][region]German Federation Army[/region][/b], so... join please maybe thanks yeah. Long live the [color=red][b]German Federation[/b][/color]!
