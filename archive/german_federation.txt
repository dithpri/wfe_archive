  Hello and welcome to the page of the [b]German Federation[/b]! We (will if anyone joins) have a Kaiser, but they are elected and more of a figurehead. Think Holy Roman Empire. Uh... I&#39;m lonely. Please join. [b]Oh![/b] We are a part of the [b]Military Alliance Coalition[/b]. Or I, the German City State of Hersfeld, am at least.
