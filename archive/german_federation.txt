[b][u]     Guten T&auml;g![/u][/b]
  Hallo und willkommen to the [b] [color=red]German Federation[/color][/b]. We are esentially the successor state to the HRE, and as such we elect our Kaiser, even if they hold no real power. Note that if you want to run for Kaiser, you must have a monarchy in play, whether said monarch is a figurehead or rules directly. If you don&#39;t have a monarch though, you can still vote for the Kaiser and all. Also note that puppet states are welcome, and we are allies of [b][region]The Kaiserreich[/region][/b]. Long live the [color=red][b]German Federation[/b][/color]!
