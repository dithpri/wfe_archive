[b][u]     Guten T&auml;g![/u][/b]
  Hallo und willkommen to the [b] [color=red]German Federation[/color][/b]. We are esentially the successor state to the Holy Roman Empire, and as such we elect our [b]Kaiser[/b], even if they hold no real power. Note that if you want to run for [b]Kaiser[/b], you must have a monarchy in play, whether send monarch is a figurehead or rules directly. If you don&#39;t have a monarch though, you can still vote for the [b]Kaiser[/b] and all. Long live the [color=red][b]German Federation[/b][/color]!
