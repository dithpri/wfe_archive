-We are a loose federation of German nations. On January 14, 2018 we united into [region]The Second Kingdom of Germany[/region], but we became a federation again on the 28th.
*The Roleplay Date is [b]2118[/b]

*The [b]Deutsches Heer[/b] needed [b]YOU[/b]! But no one joined so we have no army. Read the factbook below.

*We have a discord, and the link is [url=https://discord.gg/Wp2TaqK][color=Prussianblue]here[/color][/url]

*Each member has a delegate in Berlin, and there certain things are voted on. (My way of explaining polls)

*We elect our Kaiser/Kaiserin, much like the HRE, even if they are a figurehead. The current Kaiser is [nation]Western Drusselstein[/nation]

*Our Constitution is [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=962581]here[/url]. All nations in the Federation must abide by it
