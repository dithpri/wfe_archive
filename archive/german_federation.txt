*The [b]Deutsches Heer[/b] needs [b]YOU[/b]! Join today! You can join, even if you aren&#39;t in the region, but you will be in a foreign corps. Read the factbook below for more information

*We have a discord, and the link is [url=https://discord.gg/Wp2TaqK][color=Prussianblue]here[/color][/url]

*Each member has a delegate in Berlin, and there certain things are voted on. (My way of explaining polls)
