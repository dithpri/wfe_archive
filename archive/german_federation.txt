  Hallo und willkommen to the [b]German Federation.[/b] We are esentially the successor state to the Holy Roman Empire, and as such we elect our Kaiser, even if they hold no real power. Note that if you want to run for Kaiser, you must have a monarchyin play, whether send monarch is a figurehead or rules directly. If you don&#39;t have a monarch though, you can still vote for the Kaiser and all. Long live the Federation!
