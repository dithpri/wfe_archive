The United African Diaspora is a region consisting of nations of primarily African-descended populations. This region is dedicated to protecting the rights, liberties, and freedoms of all African diasporic peoples. Any African nation may join, both in the homeland or abroad. We promote education on Diasporic issues and history, and attempt to combat racism on a global scale.
