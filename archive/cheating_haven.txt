As [region]The Black Hawks[/region] started to get ready to fly, a heavy storm rolled in. Nevertheless, they flew through the storm, withstanding the rain, lightning, wind, and cold, and came out only mildly drenched. You can join us [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]here[/url].
The mildly drenched hawks:
CPL [nation]Woryand[/nation]
