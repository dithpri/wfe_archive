This medium sized island chain name means &amp;quot;Islands of Greatness&amp;quot; in the native tongues. Although historically occupied by scattered shogunates and kingdoms, they have come to the light of modern civilization as of late.

They are made of 7 main islands; Mero, Hizino, Chezi, Chi&amp;#39;Ari, Shuno, Alacamaki, and Orichi, with hundreds of small islands between them.
