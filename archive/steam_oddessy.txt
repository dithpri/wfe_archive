A steampunk, Roleplay region that is dedicated to the steampunk genre and is all about Roleplay.  Be prepared for frequent conversations (once our population grows), Roleplay, magic, and a general hatred of cheese.

The solar system in here is set up where there is an earth like planet, and the neighboring terrestrial planets are similar to Venus and Mars.  The known universe has a breathable atmosphere...so airships can (with the right amount of thrust) become starships.  For entry, message the founder, or the WA Delegate.
