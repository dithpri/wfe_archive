The Gadsdens are a chain of independent nations that prefer to govern themselves without interference from the outside world or other nations. We have both new and veteran players, so you&#146;ll fit in wether your a rookie or experienced player. 

[b]Why the name Gadsden, does it mean anything?[/b] 

Gadsden is a reference to the &#147;Don&#146;t Tread On Me&#148; flag. We chose this name because we wanted a region that allowed all ideologies and allowed us to do anything and everything we wish.  

[b]Why should I join Gadsden Islands?[/b]

There is no obligation to do anything (help out, endorse other nations, etc.) unless you want to. If you enjoy freedom and want little Gadsen islands is for you! Join if you&#146;d like... or not; It&#146;s your choice!
