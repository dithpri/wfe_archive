Welcome to the The Gadsden Islands. The Gadsdens are a chain of independent nations that prefer to govern themselves without interference from the outside world or other nations. 

[b]Why the name Gadsden, does it mean anything?[/b] 

Gadsden is a reference to the &#147;Don&#146;t Treat On Me&#148; flag. We chose this name because we wanted a region that allowed all ideologies and allowed us to do anything and everything we wish.
