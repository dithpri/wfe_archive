[b][color=red]Up against the wall, MF! This is a stick up by [region]The Internationale[/region] in the name of Anti-Fascism and Anti-Nazism![/color]

[region]Lusitania[/region] was a Fascist region that was friends with and had embassies with the Nazi region so-called &amp;#39;[region]The Greater German Reich[/region]&amp;#39;!

[color=red][region]Lusitania[/region] has been confiscated from the hate-mongers and is now an anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi region![/b][/color]

To our Comrade who waves the [b]V[/b] for Vendetta flag: May our Anti-Fascist [b]V[/b]endetta forever be successful. :)[/color]

To our Comrades who liberated [b][region]Zaria[/region][/b] from Nazi scum: [i]Viva la revolution! La Lucha Continua! Hasta la Victoria, Siempre![/i] :)
