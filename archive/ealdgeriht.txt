[b]What is the meaning of liberty? This is something our sailors have been considering much over the last week since [nation]Le Libertia[/nation] stormed ahead of our recruitment competition to take the lead. Today, the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy garnered hits in Le Libertie&#39;s name. For when you&#39;re fighting for someone, and fighting for our Republic, there is no greater feeling than victory for someone that sets an example to live by. Thank you Le Libertie, for your ongoing service to our region, and for the example you set for others &#150; we managed to fight off defender forces and claim this region today!
