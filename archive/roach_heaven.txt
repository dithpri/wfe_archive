[b][i]Here, cockroaches are mutants! Humans are disallowed from entering this region. The environment here is extremely intolerable, stagnating, rife with diarrhea and gross, and completely devoid of sanitation. The entire region is festering with disease and is infested with termites, centipedes, flies, mosquitoes, and of course, us, mutant cockroaches![/I][/b]
