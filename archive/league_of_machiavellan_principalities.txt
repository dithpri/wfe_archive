The League of Machiavellan Principalities is a collection of states that shun the idealist approach taken by many other states and political figures. By learning from the mistakes and triumphs of the past aswell as being honest about our human behaviour we lead our states to glory in the present but with a careful eye on the future. Here leaders must be willing to benefit themselves but also remembering to protect the people of your state as without them you are nothing. Their happiness and well being is your strength. This is therefore ultimately a league for any state as long as a mentality of Realism is maintained by their leader.
