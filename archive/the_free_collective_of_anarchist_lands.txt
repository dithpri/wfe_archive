A collection of Anarchist territories who pursue and promote complete freedom and respect of natural rights of each individual. Criminals are not punished but educated and reformed, not by any government, but by their fellow citizens, and citizens are free to do as they please, as long as it violates not the sovereignty of any other individual.
