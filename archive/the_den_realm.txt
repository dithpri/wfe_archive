The [I]Matriarchal Den-Realm[/I] of [nation]Tuesday Coyote[/nation] is a conjured, autonomous celestial realm within the multiverse notable for it&#39;s egalitarian, queer feminist and eco-socialist culture. This Den-Realm was conjured through the magic and infinite merit of Her Majesty the Divine Matriarch [nation]Tuesday Coyote[/nation] which serves as a personal retreat where Her Majesty and the land have become One. Those &quot;uninitiated&quot; may only temporarily visit the Den-Realm astrally through intense meditative absorption and trance.
