The Den Realm is a conjured, autonomous celestial realm within the multiverse notable for it&#39;s egalitarian, queer feminist and eco-socialist culture.

The Den Realm is known to be seemingly infinite, with endless mountain ranges, valleys, rainforests, farmland, swamps, deserts, lakes, rivers, oceans, islands of gold and silver, and emerald cities. Despite it&#39;s seemingly infinite size, however, one can travel across the entire realm within a single day. The Den Realm is also known to be the home of many different beings from across the multiverse including gods, demigods, demons, ogres, fae, gnomes, people, animals, insects, flora, fungi, spirits, and many other beings from infinite other realms.
