[i][color=Purple]You look and the mirror and what do you see? Altino staring back at you. You try to look away, but you cannot escape the hold of her eyes. You stand still, but Altino moves.[/color]

[color=gray]Alti&#39;s the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Flash of a needle, spinning of thread
When you wake, you find stitches for a mouth instead[/color]

[color=Purple]Altino reaches into your heart. Altino changes your very soul. You cannot be without Altino. You become one with Altino. You are Altino.[/color][/i]
