&#147;[i]Second most powerful of the Hyborian kingdoms, it lies east of Aquilonia, south of the Border Kingdom, west of Brythunia, and north of Corinthia and Ophir. The Border Range lies between Aquilonia and Nemedia. Most of the passes into Aquilonia were in the northwest; two southern passes existed, one was a well-defended gap in the range that the Road of Kings ran through, the other was the difficult Pass of Oteron, which Conan once used. At the south end of the range lies the Tybor Gap, a large river valley that connects the kingdoms of Aquilonia, Nemedia, and Ophir. The rugged, impenetrable range of the Karpash Mountains lay on the southern border with Ophir.[/i]&#148; &#151; [url=https://hyboria.xoth.net/gazetteer/nemedia.htm][color=cd0101]Xoth.net[/color][/url][hr][b]Nemedia is a constituency of the [color=cd0101]Hyborean Community[/color].[/b]
