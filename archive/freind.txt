We know that&amp;#39;s the incorrect way of spelling friend. 

A region who&amp;#39;s name was derived from a pokemon quiz to determine what our region should be named after.

Instead, we were inspired by the ignoramus who wrote the quiz and repeatedly spelled &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; wrong. 

So welcome to the lovely region of Friend.
