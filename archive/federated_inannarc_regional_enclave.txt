&quot;FIRE&quot; is the region wherein Arc uses a closed regional system to experiment. Each nation&#39;s leader is treated as if they are their own sapience or AI. This results in distinctive cultures in spite of all being run by the same player. Yes, some are awful; they are intended to explore bad leadership, raising, in turn, further questions about similar government models in reality. Some are seemingly good governments while others walk very fine lines. NS stats matter here after the nation is a month old.

The only nation wherein the leader is actually Arc is Inannarc. Here is a nation ruled entirely by Arc&#39;s beliefs to see their outcome and question their validity.
