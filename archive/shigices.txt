[b]Welcome to Shigices![/b]

Shigices is a vast, sparsely populated polar region located in the far northwest of [b][region]Glacial Empire[/region][/b]. The region encompasses five major river valleys separated by inhospitable mountain ranges and coastal tundra.

A prolonged period of foreign occupation of the region finally came to an end as the new Anti-Colonialist Provisional Government of Shigices came to power. The ACPGS works closely together with the regional government of Glacial Empire in an effort to rebuild a functioning democracy in Shigices. Come join us!
