This place was gonna be the True Army&#39;s first raid, but we were late to the update, so we waited until the next one to take [region]United Kingdoms[/region] instead.

I decided to refound this place as a tribute to this forgotten failiure and what not to do in the future.

If you want to help us not fail, join [region]True Land[/region] today!

(I probably spelled this region&#39;s name wrong, but who cares.)
