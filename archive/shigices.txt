Welcome to Shigices!

Shigices is a vast, sparsely populated polar region located in the far northwest of [region]Glacial Empire[/region]. The region encompasses five major river valleys separated by inhospitable mountain ranges and coastal tundra.

After long suffering under foreign occupation, Shigices was finally liberated with assistance from the central government of Glacial Empire. Eventually, Shigices was established as a semi-autonomous entity within the Empire.

The current administration strives to rebuild a functioning democracy in Shigices. Come join us!
