[b]&#147;Man make History, but not at the time he wishes.&#148;[/b]
- Karl Marx

But for the sake of argument, what if we [i][b]could[/b][/i]?

Welcome to The Prime-world, a region based on an Alternate Universe (herein called &#39;Homeworld&#39;) based on the same name. The time is now Jan 2019, and the roster of powers has been reset. Carve your claim and prove your mettle, or else suffer the aggression of the great powers as they remake the world in their image.
