Kadia use to be a sprawling territory known for it&#39;s beauty, it&#39;s resources, it&#39;s many empires, and the glorious monuments constructed by the ancient people of the land. Now Kadia is nothing more than a waste land, void of most resources required to sustain the most basic of ecosystems, filled instead with rubble from the fallen empires. Only two Nation remains, Damurikadia, and Western Kadia, nations that would have suffered the same fate as the rest if it hadn&#39;t been for the nearly impassable mountain range secluding them from the horrors done to their fellow brothers. Damurikadia wants to ensure that such catastrophes never befall the great lands of Kadia again, by any means necessary.
