Trundsa is a region founded under the Empire of Makial with the purpose of protecting nations with a constitutional monarchy or other democratic governments from more dictatorial ideologies, especially communism and National Socialism. All member nations must have at least one democratically elected office to be accepted into the region.

Offices may be added into the region from time to time. Most of these will be democratically elected positions. While the founder holds the power to throw out the results of an election and order a new one, they cannot appoint their own officials to these offices.
