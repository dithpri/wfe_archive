Since the Great War, the beleaguered people of the United States have striven to rebuild the great world-spanning nation lost to civil war. Now, there are many different factions in the area, all with their own philosophies. Many of them are city-states formed from the companies and trade unions of old. Others are independent communities new to post-apocalyptia.
