Gain approval and you are welcome to join!  Feel free to ask for admittance.  You will have to undergo strenuous physical challenges, killer mental exercises, and tickle torture by penguins.  If you survive that, along with the 12-hour interview ...you will be happily admitted.  Of course, if you receive an invitation, you can skip the whole process...except the penguin thing, of course.
