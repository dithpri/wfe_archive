Hello and Welcome! This region is based on the principles of Democracy and Progressivism. The two regional officers are elected on a tri-weekly basis via polls, and the structure of the government can be changed by popular request. All immigration will be handled through [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=280097]this forum thread[/url] for the purpose of submitting applications. This is because we aim for quality of members over quantity. The region&amp;#39;s stance in the World Assembly will also be determined via poll for every piece of legislation.
