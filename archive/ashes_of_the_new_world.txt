[region]Ashes of the New World[/region]
The old world collapsed. From the ashes, we rise.

A post-collapse world where new powers emerge.
The UnitedRepublicOfNations leads as a rising titan&#151;loyal to liberty, armed with forgotten strength.
Old alliances are gone. New ones rise:
&#150; Continental Pact
&#150; Pacific Bloc
&#150; Iron Accord
&#150; Southern Syndicates

War, diplomacy, and survival define this world.
Your nation. Your future. Your fight.
