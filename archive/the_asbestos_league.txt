Asbestos Man, Asbestos Man
Does whatever Asbestos can
Resists a fire, any size
Beat the Human Torch, that guy
Look out
Here comes Asbestos Man.

Is he dying?
Listen bud,
He&#39;s got cancer in his lungs
Can he give you mesothelioma?
You may be entitled to financial compensation
Hey there
There goes Asbestos Man

In the walls of your house
Built in 1968
Cancer to even a mouse
What the children all ate

Asbestos Man, Asbestos Man
Nasty neighborhood Asbestos Man
Fire and flames
He ignores
But he&#39;s poisoned whenever he snores

To him, life is coming to an end
The Asbestos League will rise again
Trolling, you&#39;ll find Asbestos Man
