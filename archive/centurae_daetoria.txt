The island of Centurae Daetoria was once colonized by a deserted legion from the Roman Empire. Unlike the rest of Earth, the Cendaetorians did not progress in terms of technology, instead, they perfected their Roman culture and equipment, forming the Cendaetorian Empire, which was very similar to the European Romans. Their Empire existed from 112 until 1632, when a combined, modern European force crushed the old fashioned Cendaetorians. Ever since, it is populated by many Europeans from all countries, seeking their luck here. These days, the island is split between several factions, fighting each other for supreme power. Will the factions ever put aside their differences and make room for a new Cendaetorian Empire?
