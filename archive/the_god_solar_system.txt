The &amp;#39;God&amp;#39; Solar System is a solar system consisting of seven planets. From inside to outside, the planets are as follows: Herms, Marquois, The Ground (only planet known to be inhabited by sentient species), Hayds, Zarkus, Crunks, and Phosphorus.
Most of the planets and moons seem to have some very basic life. This life appears to originate from the Ground due to some debris from a collision fairly recently, and there is no evidence of any other. 
The &amp;#39;God&amp;#39; Solar System is a [b]closed region located within a certain set reality[/b], unless invaded.
