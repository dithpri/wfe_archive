[color=red][b][i]Hear why its sung here, oppositioner.. 
Oh I will never be saved, 
Because I live with Satan! 
One wish today, 
That you&#39;ll all pray for 
Three who will make it here late. 
Pray now and you&#39;ll see, 
The &#39;Lord&#39; turned me on, 
But, oh, I was the shaggy fool.. 
Clothed in agony, 
Lost at a height. 
There&#39;s no escaping it, 
Nor his woes.. 
So here&#39;s to my Sweet Satan. 
Whose little path 
Would make me sad, 
Whose power is satan. 
He&#39;ll give those with him 666. 
And there was an evil toolshed, 
were he made us suffer sad-ly 

Ohohohoh... 
&quot;Family won&#39;t get loose, 
They&#39;re offered me.&quot; 
Always soothes the worker. 
Always will be as we know now 
&quot;I see ruins,&quot; said he, 
&quot;the world they offered me? 
Who wished the Lord&#39;s fall?&quot; 
If we lose feather, 
Say you&#39;ll save me!
