[b]Welcome to Superheroes of Peace[/b]
Endorse our current delegate [nation]eminemily[/nation]. 
The Defender&amp;#39;s Creed
We accept and understand that human predators exist. Criminal or terrorist, they take advantage of our civilized society to prey upon the weak. They represent evil and must be confronted and defeated.
We believe that self-defense is a moral imperative, and that illegitimate force and illegal violence must be met with righteous indignation and superior violence.
We proudly proclaim that We run with a like-minded pack. .
We will win, or die trying.
We swear this creed before God, family and all fellow citizens.
