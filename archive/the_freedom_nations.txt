The Allied Nations are a group of nations who have similar interests in politics and have decided to have an alliance. One of the most important parts of our region is that everyone in our nations have freedom to do what they want to do. Of course there are laws, but we have liberties. For example, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, fair elections, women have equal rights to men, LGBTQ+ individuals have the same rights as everyone else, etc. We strive to have a better nation.
