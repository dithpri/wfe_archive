The Region of Freedom Nations is expiring soon!

Current News: Everything that [region]The Freedom Nations[/region] planned is being delayed until December 31 to honor [nation]Polar Empire[/nation], our founder, who fell out of activity following their leader&#146;s unexpected  permanent ban from their nation. Please, don&#146;t take this as an opportunity to attack TFN.

Update: The Freedom Realm will be created on February 1, and everyone will have to move there. Make sure you agree to the embassy requests there as I will also be allowing roleplaying there, but any trolling, masculinity, racism, or spamming will be banned there.

[nation]Freedom Nations[/nation], future TFNR founder.
