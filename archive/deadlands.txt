 500 kilometres from Equestria. Deadlands. No one remembers this continent, as it is full of dark magic. The last state, is a state of humans, tall beings who are not covered with wool and walk on two legs, unlike the ponies, who have their own religion called &#147;Orthodox Christianity&#148;. The latter ponies, too, have adopted Christianity and survive with humans.  In spite of all the adversities, this state continues to live, though each time it becomes more and more difficult to survive among the undead. Perhaps... You will change the situation? Good luck to you.
