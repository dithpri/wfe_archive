Deadlands. 

No one remembers this continent, as it is full of dark magic. The last state, is a state of humans, tall beings who are not covered with wool and walk on two legs, unlike the equine, who have their own religion called &#147;Orthodox Christianity&#148;. The latter equine, too, have adopted Christianity and survive with humans.  In spite of all the adversities, this state continues to live, though each time it becomes more and more difficult to survive among the undead. Perhaps... You will change the situation? Good luck to you. Hard Cheese to Ben
