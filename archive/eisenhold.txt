Eisenhold was a region in freefall, with members departing to [region]Aysling[/region], but was accepted into the Arefu empire, with [nation]Dermeon[/nation] at its head and [nation]Hereticide[/nation] as its mentor. The coup that put Arefu in power will only last a couple days or even less, and soon Eisenhold will be back to normal.
