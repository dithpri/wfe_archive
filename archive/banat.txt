This region consists of hard working, easy going, peace-loving people. Often very drunk, but not problematic (maybe some). Blues and rock&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;roll is in their blood. World famous rock band Muzma orchestra is from here. National drinks are beer and rakija (for which it is famous). National food is ham. People have some trust in their government and, since government controls most of the issues, avanguard is quite strong. It is mostly agricultural region with some fascinating landscapes, historic monuments and landmarks which boost tourism.
