This region is a relic of a bygone era, one of the hardly spoken of [b]Vorigarians[/b]. They gathered and congregated here, once 33 strong at their peak, only to slump into irrelevancy once the Vorigarians got tired of NationStates.  Several things have been tried to revive the region, but they have all failed. Thus, its sole representative, [nation]Yenikader[/nation] (also known as LegitSi elsewhere) now stands by and watches to make sure this region doesn&#39;t go the way of its predecessors.
