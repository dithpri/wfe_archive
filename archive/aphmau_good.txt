[color=#f041be]Hello, yes, it is me, [nation]Asariele[/nation] of the main nation [nation]Socialist Lop[/nation]. As you can see, your region was tag raided. However, I simply come to remind you that [region]Aphmau[/region] can still be freed, but only after paying the ransom of ten 100 Market Value Legendary cards. Better get to farming, [i]lovelies~![/i][/color]
