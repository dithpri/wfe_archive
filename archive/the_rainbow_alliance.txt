This region is an alliance of peaceful, freedom-loving nations committed to human rights, and in particular to providing full equality for LGBT citizens, who constitute a significant percentage of the population in member nations.  The Alliance has a common policy of granting automatic refugee status and economic support to LGBT citizens fleeing homophobic regimes.

We also throw fabulous parties.  Nude beaches are permitted in most member countries, if not actually required by law, and sexual health for all ages is a government priority.

Membership in the region is subject to approval, but the Grand Council of the Rainbow will gladly consider applications from friendly, like-minded nations who ratify the Rainbow Treaty.
