We were out, prowling for some region to hit, when the sudden urge to stop by PetLand struck [nation=short]MagentaFairy[/nation]. She wouldn&amp;#39;t stop yelling, and everyone in the car was getting really annoyed. Finally, I say to her, &amp;quot;Look, PetLand uses kitten mills, and you don&amp;#39;t want to support that. Instead, we&amp;#39;ll go steal some.&amp;quot;

So that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing.
