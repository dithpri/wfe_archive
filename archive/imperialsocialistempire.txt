We are nations united under one flag, one goal, one vision. We shall spread our dreams, and beliefs across the world, we shall be open to those  who wish to make their home in our land. We shall become one. We don&#39;t accept defeat, and we never will, only we the people have the will, and the power, to forge our own destinies. The question is are you in?
