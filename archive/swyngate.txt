Are you looking for a good, kind place to relate to others? Do you wish to avoid swearing, violence and the always dreaded &quot;tough guys who think it&#39;s their job to make everyone feel miserable&quot;? Well, you&#39;ve found the place!

Swyngate is a collection of diverse nations, each with different names and ideas, but all with one in mind...a peaceful world where everyone lives in harmony! Swyngate has only a couple rules: a) No violence or swearing and b) Always keep an open mind! Anyone who does not follow these rules will be forced out, so please listen to them. 

Have a great day and keep on smiling!
