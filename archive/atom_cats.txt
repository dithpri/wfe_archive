Metal legs. Metal arms. Metal heart.
 Tool of war. Tool of peace. Tool of art?
 I get into my suit and I strut through the wastes.
 No fear. Untouchable!
 The flames on my suit burning. Rising. Glowing. 
 The flames are hot, but I am cool.
 I walk. I run. I ride.
 My hands are strong. I am a man.
 No. More than a man!
 Because man, I have a metal heart.
 Thank you.
