This small region is governed by the Republic of Sarvuwarjaya. The region is small, passive and reserved so it is created only to be a safe haven for those whom are shy, nervous or dislikes arguing. It is designed to be a temporary home stay for countries who do not have a region yet and are still deciding where to find a permanent region.
