In the Golden Sands of Dorothy, the sand is always golden and the sky is always purple, kind of like the grapes in the ever so perfect vino orchards. Although idyllic it is an open space with very few friends. 
The lonesome Dorothy, on golden shores. 
lots of love from the sky and the clouds combined.
