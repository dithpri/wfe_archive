This region glorifies the [b]Dacians[/b] - the fairest of the Thracians. They were all devout to their Gods. They were renowned in the Ancient world for being skilled medics, hunters and warriors. They held dense astronomical knowledge from very early times.

They faced the Persians, the Greeks, the Macedonians, some other invaders and finally the Romans in fierce battles.

They deserve recognition for being so awesome, we are here to show it.
