A series of Islands to the east of the Oskepp peninsula, an area completely occupied by Oskeppi citizens. Any nation in this region must submit directly to the Oskeppi leadership&amp;#39;s whims and desires. Completely atheist, totalitarian and with closed external borders, anyone inside has the guaranteed protection of Oskepp PR, as long as they follow orders from Oskeppi central government.
