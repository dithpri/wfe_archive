A great and powerful region of magic warriors, fighting hand-in-hand with the leaping sea-serpents for many millennia, Neshga was founded by Masterkrakois, a famed war-chief of the Denkash tribe of the Tautical islands. Its currency is the Victes, and the animal Sloth. Its way of protection is magic.
