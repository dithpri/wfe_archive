Welcome to Thistlewade. It&#146;s a quiet place&#151;full of slow-moving water, soft winds through the rushes, and evenings that arrive in a hush. Folks here live close to the land. They grow herbs, tell stories over tea, and leave little offerings near the lantern posts, just in case the old tales are true.

Not everything&#146;s simple, though. Sometimes the fog doesn&#146;t lift till midday, and some paths seem to shift when you&#39;re not looking. But that&#146;s just Thistlewade being itself&#151;mysterious in a calm sort of way.

There&#146;s room here for the peaceful, the curious, and the ones who don&#146;t quite fit anywhere else. Whether you come with quiet footsteps or a wild idea, there&#146;s a spot for you by the firelight.

Thanks for taking time to read this. &amp;#127806;
