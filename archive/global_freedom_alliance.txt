[i]&amp;quot;Down with the [color=mahogany]dictators[/color]!&amp;quot;[/i]

[color=grey]Some may call us [/color][color=teal]left-wing[/color][color=grey] extremists. Some may call us [/color][color=red]violent[/color][color=grey] protestants. But we really are the symbol of freedom, and our goal is to [B]eliminate fascism[/B] within regions that are being punished severely by [B]dictators [/B]or [B]supreme authoritarian governments[/B]. We do not oppose the idea of an [/color][color=purple]&amp;quot;absolute monarchy&amp;quot;[/color][color=grey] if the monarch rules with a fair hand. We only oppose these ideologies when nations have essential rights taken away from them (ex. free speech, etc). Regions that [u]claim[/u] they are a democracy, but in reality are [B]fascist[/B], will face almost the worst of our wrath. Regions that are [B]neo-nazi[/B] and/or uphold the values of [B]racist fascism[/B] will face even worse punishment.[/color]
