[b]NEW REGION: JOIN NOW![/b]
Everything is still heavily WIP. Become part of our worldbuilding!

The Adhal Sea is a region established on Oct. 20th, 2018. Our focus is on fantasy tech, collaborative worldbuilding, and heavy roleplay. All sorts of nations and players are welcome, we don&#39;t discriminate.

Current goals and plans: Worldbuilding is still a WIP. We have two active members and a third one coming to NS soon. We also have an embassy with [region]The Crimson Union[/region], go check them out.

We have two maps of the Adhal Sea, the continent of Adhal, and the surrounding area: A [url=https://imgur.com/4BuR8vn]geographic map[/url] and a [url=https://imgur.com/EffG3xE]political map[/url].
