[color=#402327][i]&quot;Circa 1524, this was the day - the day we attempted to uncover this mysterious world. Amidst the violent seas, we ventured far and wide. It was no easy task; it was a gamble. Unlike the latter, there was no gold or treasures, nothing. Who would be so lunatic as to do such a thing though? I don&#39;t know; maybe we are lunatics ourselves. But if there is one thing that kept us going, it was glory. The Wolfgods of this land shout deep within our veins, providing us with the wisdom and strength to circumnavigate and map this vast world once and for all! And at last! Behold, my fellow Wolfists! THE WORLD OF WOLFTERRA.&quot;[/i]
