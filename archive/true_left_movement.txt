[color=#aa0000][i][b]The True Left[/b][/i][/color]

Our purpose is to present the theory of the True Left, and to recruit, train and organize those who show commitment and ability to put the theory into practice.

We seek like-minded idealists who can bring valuable skills, relevant connections, useful resources, and - above all &#150; [i]high-quality thinking[/i] to our movement. [b]We welcome cooperation with other regions and movements, provided our respective aims are not in conflict.[/b]

We operate with a sense of urgency in anticipation of an extremely troubled near future, and aim to do everything  we can to help the world emerge a better place at the end of it.
