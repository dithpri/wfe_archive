In the West-Mid Pacific you will find a small and close knit group of peace loving and honest nations who wish only to grow and have fewer wars, saving human lives as much as possible, we support the New Lunar Republic and follow the teachings of the Sufferer/Signless and his disciple. We see a world where all people live helping each other, forming laws that make all equal in the eyes of the governing body. The only requirements for you to enter are a hunger for peace, an oath to Luna, and a pure equality (which includes government, religeous, and civil equality).
