[region]The Peace Corps[/region] is a peaceful and indifferent region who takes mlitary technology and finds peaceful uses for them. From shooting for stress to tanks as sports, we have decided that there is nothing we want more than a world peace. All that is needed to join us is a want for peace, equality in all respects, and an oath to Luna. We support both the Solar empire and the Lunar republic but prefer the night to the day.
