[b]Disclaimer:[/b]
This region and its founding nation is used to aid in a worldbuilding project of mine. You may request embassies with this region, but I&#39;m not interested in having any discussions. [nation]Raiwen[/nation] is the only account I manage on NationStates, any similarities with others is purely coincidental and not intentional. [i]Raiwen[/i] is derived from the nation&#39;s fictional royal family, of which I created with the assistance of a language construction tool. Any groups, individuals, users, or other entities named the same elsewhere is coincidental&#151;I do not represent them nor they me. This nation is not meant to be a reflection of my personal views.

To put it plainly, this nation is a work of [i]fiction[/i].
