The region of Korasha is one that is old and fabled, and is the stuff of wild east films in Arganorh today. Much of the continent is still wild, with unknown beasts and treasures waiting about. However, one can still find massive amounts of culture, and advanced civilizations... depending on where one chooses to look... and if you&#146;re willing to expand your horizons in this mystical land. We are a member of a treaty with Arganorh.
