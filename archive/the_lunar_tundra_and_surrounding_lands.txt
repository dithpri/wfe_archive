[color=blue]THE WAR RECAP[/color]

The Frathopian army has the advantage over the Buttzian army. Frathopia has effectively utilized their Air Force and EMP to disable the Buttzian super soldier and begin an assault on their encampment. The battle progressed with both sides gaining advantage at one point or another. Both nations exhausted their resources in attempted super weapon strikes. Both armies are combating their own routing forces and fires as much as they are each other. An armistice was called, with possible peace talks following.
