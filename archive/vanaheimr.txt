In Norse mythology, Vanaheimr (Old Norse &amp;quot;home of the Vanir&amp;quot;) is one of the Nine Worlds and home of the Vanir, a group of gods associated with fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future. Vanaheimr is attested in the Poetic Edda; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda and (in euhemerized form) Heimskringla; both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Vanaheimr is described as the location where the Van god Nj&ouml;r&eth;r was raised. In Norse cosmology, Vanaheimr is considered one of the Nine Worlds.
