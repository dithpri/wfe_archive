[color=teal]Oh, and if other people come here posting &amp;quot;this is a message from the legitimate government&amp;quot; or something along the lines of Mediterrania seceding from Mazeria, ignore them. They&amp;#39;re lying. They are not the legitimate government - they are invaders. So don&amp;#39;t endorse any of them.[/color][/b]
