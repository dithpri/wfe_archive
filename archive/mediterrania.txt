Emperor of Mediterrania: [nation=short]King Frederick I[/nation] (Royal Chief: [nation=short]01C[/nation])
Doge of Mediterrania: [nation=short]The Jolly Swagman[/nation]
Founded: June 13, 2013

The sovereign region, once its community has been built up, will have a regional government, with total control over its own internal affairs and external affairs. The Consitution of Mediterrania will be replaced to better reflect the needs and wants of the people of Mediterrania. Until then, the current constitution shall be operating in virtually its current form, but all of its links to Mazeria save for the mention of the Emperor of Mediterrania shall be severed.
