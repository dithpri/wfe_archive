[b]Surprise! Your Region has just been raided by [region]The Black Hawks[/region]! Don&#39;t you like surprises? We like loud ones like that Firework that explodes a little too early. So your region has been raided, and maybe decked out full of hidden surprises. Your ceiling fan may fall unexpectedly, or you may one day find a dynamite stick in your toilet giving a whole new meaning to explosive diarrhoea. We won&#39;t confirm any of these of course because where is the fun in that?[/b]
