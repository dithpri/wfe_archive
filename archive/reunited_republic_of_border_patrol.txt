The twice Reunited Republic of Border Patrol is a group of nations remembering the good days of the cold war border patrol officers. Detaining terrorists, confiscating passports, and shooting people who attempt to assault the wall were part of our daily lives as West Grestin border patrol officers. Now, we rule nations. All it takes is a few denied diplomats right? Anyway, Glory to Astrotska. Papers, please.
