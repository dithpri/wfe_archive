[B][color=darkred]Welcome to [region]Anti Revisionist Left[/region]! We welcome Marxists, Stalinists, Maoists, Hoxhaists, and other comrades! In most other leftist regions, you will find social democrats and Trotskyites who believe bourgeoisie anti-Communist propaganda. You won&#39;t find them here.[/color][/b]

Many regions promote fascism, libertarianism, liberalism, conservatism, social democracy, and revisionist leftism. We promote anti-revisionist leftism. But we are demonized by many as supporters of so-called genocidal tyrants. What about the tyrannical regimes of Suharto, Pinochet, Efra&iacute;n R&iacute;os Montt, Park Chung-hee, Chiang Kai-shek, and Francisco Franco? They don&#39;t seem to get as much criticism as Stalin and Mao.
