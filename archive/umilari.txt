Liredus was alone in the baron world. However neighbours from other continents moved in. Liredus decided to call together all the nations into a neutral meeting place. A field. Later all the nations helped to build the Umilari meeting house. And so it grew in power and soon became the backbone of the world&amp;#39;s economy.
