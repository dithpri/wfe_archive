Anticapitalist Alliance&amp;#39;s little sister.
We are an open region, inviting all who share a vision of a world whose resources are managed to accommodate people before profit, with all that that entails. We reject the pursuit of wealth in favour of that of happiness. We welcome discussion, debate, and friendly banter.
