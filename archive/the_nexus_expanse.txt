The Nexus Expanse is a rapidly growing region of an admittedly unknown Galaxy, this region centred around the large solar system and exoplanet both termed &#39;Nexus,&#39; hence the regional namesake. The Planet Nexus is home to the United Front of Espea, whom control regional government from both Nexus and the many planets under Espean control. The region of space is lush with non-sentient and sentient life, of both an Animal, Plant, and Fungus variety, with many nations of both the space faring and planet-dwelling type existing in relative peace within the Nexus Expanse, with the United Front of Espea attempting to maintain this peace and prosperity.
