A group for the canon countries of the [url=http://shadelings.jcink.net/]Shadelings[/url] roleplaying group to do whatever it is they do. Members and their countries are also welcome to join! Feel free to do some &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; roleplaying in the discussion boards to help flesh out what your ooc country is like, and be entertained by the countries yelling at each other from afar.

If you would be interested in piloting a canon country, please just let Pony know. Lor would be happy to have other people work as the countries&amp;#39; decision-makers. Lor is fine with having full control of Tatu and Zann, but lor could use some help with the others for sure.
