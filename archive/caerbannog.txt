This great realm of Caerbannog is rife with danger and only the bravest of knights are able to survive it.  The two greatest threats are eternal and embodied in the form of the Killer Rabbit of the Cave of Caerbannog and the Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrggghhh!  Citizens are warned to stay very clear of such calamities.  Should one find themselves confronted by such monsters, ensure you have available a Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.
