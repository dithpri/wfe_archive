The AVMC is an outlaw motorcycle club that is entirely fictional and serves the prospect of simulating a fugitive group within the NationStates metaverse. Instead of focusing on maps and territory-based gameplay, we manage a criminal-like administration where every individual is respected and offered a large variety of ranks which can be obtained by displaying huge loyalty to the club as well as meeting certain criteria. Currently, there are no requirements to join and everyone, new or old is allowed.
