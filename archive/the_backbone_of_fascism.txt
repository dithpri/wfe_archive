Ah, welcome fascists and alike!

Me, McDonald Trump, is welcoming you to the cause!
So basically, this region is only for the fascists and maybe even national-socialists. We aim at boasting our military and taking over other lands opposing fascism.

There are a number of terms to be met with if wanting to join the region, as in:
1. Prioritizing military and economy.
2. Fascism, dictatorships and sometimes Empires are welcome.
3. No communism, only capitalism.
4. You must be ready to wage war against people we don&#39;t like.
5. No excessive racism, no Hitler wannabes. Please.
6. Only back down when you can&#39;t handle the struggles of endless warfare and genocide.

Yeah, TL;DR we are terrible people.
