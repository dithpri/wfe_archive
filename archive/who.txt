 Since our creation, we have played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox. Our current priorities include communicable diseases, mostly HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika, Malaria and Tuberculosis. We also combat non-communicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health development, aging, nutrition, food security and healthy eating, occupational health, substance abuse, driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking. Currently we are working to find a cure for Zombification, which we predict will re surface on October 31st of this year.[/b]
