I tried my best to understand the game mechanics and create as many Inoffensive Centrist Democracies as possible. Instead I ended up with representants of every single one of the 27 (28) government types, because the game would never do what I thought it would do. Please help!

Apart from that, it&#39;s part of my bucket list to max out all the random stats! There is nothing more satisfying than logging in your nation and seeing that it&#39;s in the top 1% of some all but well-defined value. That you basically get there because you&#39;ve simply played the game for quite a while doesn&#39;t detract from the fun in the slightest!
