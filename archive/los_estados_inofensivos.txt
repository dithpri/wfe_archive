I tried my best to understand the game mechanics and create as many Inoffensive Centrist Democracies as possible. Instead I ended up with representants of every single one of the 27 government types, because the game would never do what I thought it would do. Please help!

Apart from that, it&#39;s part of my bucket list to max out as many random statistics in this game as possible. There is nothing more satisfying than logging in your nation and seeing that it&#39;s in the top 1% of some random stat. That you basically because get there you&#39;ve simply played the game for quite a while doesn&#39;t detract from the fun in the slightest!
