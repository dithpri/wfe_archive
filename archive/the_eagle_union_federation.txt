- The Founder&amp;#39;s Award
[i]*The Founder&amp;#39;s Award is a prestigious award presented by our founder. Our founder will rarely present this    award due to how prestigious it is. This award will be given to those who are hardworking, skilled, and great representatives of our region. Whenever our founder feels like someone deserves this award he will send a region wide telegram acknowledging the nation. Work hard to get this award.[/i]
