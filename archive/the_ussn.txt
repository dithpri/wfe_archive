Hello and Welcome to the [b]Union of Secure and Sovereign Nations[/b] or [b][region]The USSN[/region][/b]!
[hr][b][u]Our History:[/b][/u]
[b][region]The USSN[/region][/b] is a prestigious region with a long history. We were the original members of the [b][region]Irish Ironworks[/region][/b] which was approximately founded and operated in 2016 by [b][nation=long]Archix[/nation][/b]. Taken over and pushed out by raiders, we moved and founded [b][region]Propaneland[/region][/b] to be our next home around 2017. After being raided again, [b][nation=long]Terracracy[/nation][/b] founded [b][region]The USSN[/region][/b] to be our final home.
[hr][b][u]Our Mission:[/b][/u]
[b][region]The USSN[/region][/b] is an isolationist region meant to provide the refugees of the [b][region]Irish Ironworks[/region][/b] and [b][region]Propaneland[/region][/b] with a secure and permanent home. We also respect the sovereign power of each NS regardless of classification. Eventually we may open back up to the world!
