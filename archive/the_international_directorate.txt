Here, we practice the art of raiding, however with a benevolent intention. We see it as our duty to [b]revive[/b] dead and dying regions of the NS Globe, by first [b]stabilizing[/b] the region through quick and decisive force(where necessary), then [b]reinvigorating[/b] the natives and lastly facilitating its regrowth. To the nations of the world and the defenders of this realm-we come in peace.
