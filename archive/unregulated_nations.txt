The Unregulated Nations region puts lots of value in freedom, therefore each nation is a nation unto itself and will not be required to abide by any set of regional rule.
Each nation is 100% free to run itself as it pleases, whether that nation be anarchic, communist, conservative, liberal, etc. 
No other nation, including the founder of the region, can at any time tell you how to run your nation or tell you what you can and cannot to regarding activity in your nation.
Citizenship is not required.
Please enjoy your unregulated stay.
