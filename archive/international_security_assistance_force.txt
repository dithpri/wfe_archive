Hello! And Welcome to NS

You may(or may not) be getting some messages telling you to join their Region.

Don&amp;#39;t.

It may seem like a good idea, but its not, most of those Regions are big, with established leadership and won&amp;#39;t even listen to what you need or want. And most of the time, they are so big, they can&amp;#39;t protect you.

Join the ISAF, we&amp;#39;re built around the qualities of Honor, Duty, and Justice. We will help make your nations big, and keep you safe while you do it.

We have an open door policy, so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter who you are, we will accept you. No forums completely confidental.


Hope to see you in ISAF

Secretary General Zhuds123
