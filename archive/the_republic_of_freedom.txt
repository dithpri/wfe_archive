i stand here today as a free man, i stand here as no man that does not run from a fight, i stand here as a man who will fight till he draws his last breath, i stand here as a man, a man of peace, war and hope i stand here for those people who search for light in the cave i will guild the way and i say for those who are against me i say if you are not with me you are against me and this is for everyone if you fight with me then we may overrule all so join me now
