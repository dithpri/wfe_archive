[b]Welcome to the IWN![/b]
Founded on September 12, 2023.

Anyone and anything&#146;s welcome as long as they roleplay fairly, respect all nations and regions, there&#146;s no godmodding, and abide to all rules. Speaking of which, [b]please read the rules[/b]!

Hanging out, roleplaying, debating, and even arguing is allowed here as long as it isn&#146;t out of hand.
Introduce yourself, and have fun!
It&#39;s optional, but you could sign up and help shape our forum! This forum is NOT for roleplaying, the RMB is much more active.
