An area of space open to colonization efforts, the Dominion of Swordfell is a sovereign entity only in name. As a frontier on the edge of civilized interstellar territory, what it eventually becomes will be shaped by those who take advantage of the opportunity to extract new resources from the unblemished region and organize their own societies.

Only two rules here:

1. No trolling or harassment of any kind. I will have the final say in all matters regarding this rule.
2. This is meant to be a roleplay region. Non-roleplay talk is fine, but region politics and conflicts should be roleplayed out through your country&#39;s actions.
