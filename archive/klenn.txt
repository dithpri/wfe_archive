[u][b]Welcome to Klenn![/b][/u]

After a disastrous conflict between Arstotzka and Kolechia caused by terrorist attacks in the city of Grestin - conflict that saw even Obristan and the United Federation intervene - the continent of Klenn as we knew it has radically changed. The Arstotzkan government has fallen to a civil war from which a new socialist faction has arisen, stronger than before, and has seized large part of the Kolechia which in turn wasn&#39;t able to overcome its internal fights in time.
