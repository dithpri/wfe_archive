[color=scarlet][i]&quot;Azhukali was once a region of ostentatious hilarity and memories. An archipelago, its islands were home to nations such as Jenrak, Love Dog, Rethan and Sailsia - among many others.&quot;[/i][/color] - [nation=noflag]MadJack[/nation]

[i]In the modern era, Azhukali was revived by a figure of international disdain, who soon thereafter earned himself &quot;delete on sight&quot; status. Founderless, the region was seized by those whom that figure had threatened, and their allies. At the conclusion of the subsequent operation, Azhukali was refounded again, and memorialized into its present state.[/i]
