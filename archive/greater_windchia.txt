Derp derpity derp and i are considering abandoning greater windchia and making a new region. embassy regions, if we do, we will request a embassy, so be on the lookout! IMPORTANT!!!: Also, if we do decide to abandon Greater Windchia and create a new region, all of our many embassies ([region]Gypsy Lands[/region], [region]The Illuminati[/region], [region]Brasil[/region], [region]Westphalia[/region], Etc.) will be required to sign the RED FOX TREATY. See my dispatches for that.
