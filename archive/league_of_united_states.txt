[color=red]The League of United States (The LUS) is a region dedicated to giving a home to a community of MT roleplayers, diehard regional politicians, people looking for a chill community, and overall just people looking for a cool place to live.[/color]

[color=999900]The RP in this region is preferably MT and in the RMB, though Discord RP is also an option. There are several political positions for nations to run for and frequent contests and regional events![/color]
