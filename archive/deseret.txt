Deseret is a theocratic haven for religious nations that have adopted the teachings of some of history&#39;s greatest spiritual leaders.  Membership is open to all, though the region&#39;s executive authority is currently moving towards theocratic socialism.  Deseret believes in religious freedom, as all religions are merely expressions of the true faith of Diahmanism; so long as religion is a focal, unifying feature of a nation, they are welcome in Deseret.
