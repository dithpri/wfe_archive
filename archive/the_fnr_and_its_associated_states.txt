The Federation of Nordenivac Republics and its Associated States, independent or otherwise. These member states are located across multiple star systems, as protectorates or independent members.

The Achein Project is underway, with an semi-independent Republic being founded on Achein. Achein will be granted a JCoS, the first colony to be given one. The result will remain unseen for awhile, but if necessary, it will be assimilated into a Protectorate of Fargtera.

NOTE: Elysia-Oregna and Achein are not yet implemented into canon, as current RPs would negate the existence of the protectorate and the republic. However, it will be implemented after the Diplomatic RPs.
