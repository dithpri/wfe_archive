Welcome to the great region of [b][u][color=FFA200]Dracton Reach[/color][/b][/u]! We are a roleplaying region, but participating is not manditory. We would like you to be a World Assembly member but it is not required. You are allowed to have a max of 2 nations in the region having anymore is frowned upon. (United Purgatory will try to keep the map up to date)

We will be establishing the [b][u][color=FFA200]Dracton Reach Congress[/color][/b][/u] (name ideas welcome) which will establish rules and guidelines for the region. We will also be establishing Technology guidelines and how it will be used when nations go to war. Following these rules is [color=red][b][u]MANDATORY[/color][/b][/u] when rules are broken you will be put up for judgement by the current WA Delegate and the Founder United Purgatory.
