A roleplay region for beginners. A good place to learn how to play the game. Just ask me (Janlaand) any questions. It may look like I&#39;m new, but this is just me wanting a fresh start. I got bored of my old nation (Pushra).

RULES
1. Be a decent human being. You&#39;re not babies so I assume you know what that means.
2. Don&#39;t use this server as a base for raiding. If you don&#39;t know what that means, don&#39;t worry about it.

I am working on a war system. No idea when it will be finished but it is coming.
