[b]Our history is one of Revolution and bloodshed. For that to achieve freedom, a man&#39;s hardship and toil is required. And for we have provided hardship and toil, and finally achieved Freedom. We have successfully seceded from the region of Soviet Democracy, a at-the-time crumbling and immoral state, run by profiteers and corruptors. Together, here, under the fair rule of [nation]British Soviets[/nation], we have managed to gather our pieces and rebuild our home. If you also want to join us, feel free. Comrades who help the cause will be rewarded. Traitors will be killed.[/b]
