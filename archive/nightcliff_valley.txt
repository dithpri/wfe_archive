Nightcliff is open to countries that regard openness and acceptance as a primary rule for their people.

Nightcliff was founded on October 31, 2013. We are a young region but will grow and hopefully help shape the world to make it a peace loving, people loving, free society for all.

We will be working on setting up a forum and will be looking for Knights, sorcerers, dragons and others to help shape and protect our little region.
