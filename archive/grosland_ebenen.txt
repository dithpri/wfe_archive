[color=#C40234]This region is now under the joint control of the Frontierist Republic of [region]Community[/region] and the Crowned Republic of [region]Carcassonne[/region], with assistance from [region]Lone Wolves United[/region]. There are many characteristics of the wasteland, but the characteristic which outweighs all others is endorsement of fascism. No region whose delegate so proudly displays the flag and map of Nazi Germany should be permitted to self-govern. On these grounds, [region]Grosland Ebenen[/region] will now be administered jointly until further notice.[/color]

[color=#C40234]Those moving to this region are expected to endorse [nation]Braza Socialism[/nation].[/color]
