Welcome to Pan Pacific, a user-created region aspiring to rival the preeminent and eternal Pacific regions. Anyone is welcome to enter (even raiders, though they might find their capacity to disrupt largely truncated). Join as we lay the foundation for a region which will soon become a leading power in the Nation States community.

Any WA nation who joins is required to endorse the Emissary, currently [nation]Vestaran[/nation]. Failure to do so in a timely manner will result in ejection.
