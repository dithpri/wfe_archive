[B]Welcome to the [color=red]Red Pill Crusaders[/color].[/B]

[B]The Red Pill Crusaders are against fascism, authoritarian socialism and communism. While we are anti-fascist, we do not agree with the actions of Antifa (the ones on the streets in real life who are attacking elderly couples and children; not the good fellows on NS who are doing nothing wrong). 
The ones in real life are using fascist tactics by silencing whoever they do not agree with and using violence to get their way.[/B][hr]
The Red Pill Crusaders condemns the violence that took place at the US Capitol.
