The SIS is a loose coalition of - as it&#39;s name suggests - independent states who share a common world vision. A nation need not be of a particular political persuasion to join, so long as they do not willingly attempt to subjugate the populace of other member nations.

So please, consider joining the Squadron Of Independent States. You will be welcome. You will FEEL welcome.

Also make sure to endorse Lentos for WA delegate!
