Sentora is the second and largest continent in the land of Monster Girl Quest. It is divided into five regions which surround major human settlements: the southern Natalia region based around Port Natalia, the western Safina region which surrounds Sabasa Castle, the eastern region dominated by Grand Noah, and the northern Gold region which is based around Grangold and Gold Port. The fifth region is the far-eastern Yamatai, which is connected to the same landmass but is quite disconnected from the rest of the continent otherwise, generally being considered as part of the Noah region.
