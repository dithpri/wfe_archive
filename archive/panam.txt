Welcome to [region]Panam[/region], nation!

[region]Panam[/region] is a casual, role-play-based region where you can vote in the Panami international legislative body (which is yet to have name but can be named in the future!), engage in diplomatic relations with other countries, declare war, start feuds, and begin new ages.

We hope you enjoy your stay in our wonderful community. 

Please endorse First Magistrate [nation]Varnash[/nation], Second Magistrate [nation]Xoshya[/nation], and Secretary [nation]The kingdom of Zelandia[/nation].


If you wish to be placed on the map and join the roleplay, please fill out this form:
