[b][i] Welcome to The Free Dawn Assembly. [/i][/b]

Our region is open to anyone besides democracies and corporations. If you are a democracy and you were accepted, you will be forced to convert. (Democratic Socialists are also considered democratic by us.)Read our rules, legislation and follow Executive orders. No cooperation will result in your immediate expulsion.

Nationalists are allowed as long as they have not aggresively attacked any regions. Nationalists that have done that are considered fascists. We accept you, but you will have no authority here. At the first sign of aggression towards a foreign region who&#39;s stance is neutral or friendly you will be immediately removed.

Thank you for reading the TFDA welcome entry. Glorivous axa TFDA!
