[b]WELCOME TO THE IRON LEAGUE![/b]

To those who seek [b][color=blue]Greatness[/color][/b], and to those who seek [b][color=blue]Progress[/color][/b] - We welcome you with open arms.
We are a region that prefer [b][color=blue]Unity[/color][/b], [b][color=blue]Tolerance[/color][/b], [b][color=blue]Order[/color][/b] and [b][color=purple]Power[/color][/b] alike, those who despise selfish [b][color=red]monopolies[/color][/b] and other destructive [b][color=red]profit organizations[/color][/b] that block the way of [b][color=blue]human progress[/color][/b], and those who look forward to a [b][color=blue]mutual alliance[/color][/b].
We are a [b][color=purple]Free[/color][/b] region, which means that we are free to [b][color=purple]Raid[/color][/b] whether others like it or not,
although one&amp;#39;s actions on behalf of the region [b]DO NOT[/b] speak for all.

[b]The Rule:[/b]
Change your currency to &amp;quot;[b]universal currency[/b]&amp;quot;, or add &amp;quot;[b]and universal currency[/b]&amp;quot; to your currency. That is all we ask.
