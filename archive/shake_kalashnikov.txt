Shake Kalashnikov was founded in early 2016, quickly met its downfall later that year when people forgot they belonged to the region (mass amnesia is a common conspiracy), and was refounded in August 2017 by one of its original countries, Snackdad, when every child simultaneously said, &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; and every adult responded, &quot;Hi, Hungry, I&#39;m a citizen of a country that used to belong to the region of Shake Kalashnikov.&quot; It was far from the citizens best of jokes, but everyone agrees it was one of their best memories. Perhaps because in that moment they regained many of their memories.
