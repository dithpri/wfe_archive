[color=0B5345]We&#39;re a new region with a lot to offer! Come for the chill community, stay for the memes![/color]

Ostaria is a region that is not united and its made up of self-governing nations who have the ability to go to war with each other or start alliances. This explains why there are contradicting tags. For example there will be both communist and anti-communist nations within the region.

[b]We currently offer:[/b]
Self Governance
Ability to form internal alliances and declare wars
Overall fun
More to come

Region was re-created due to me forgetting to log into my account. Embassies will need to be reconstructed.
