[b]Welcome to [color=#6495ED]Magnalucia[/color][/b]

Two continents rise from a wide and distant horizon, set in a far-flung ocean like mysterious gems in a crown. Countries and cultures come and go like the tide, their remnants forming this dynamic region. From civilized metropolises to sparse wastes, kings to communists, and democracies to dictatorships, Magnalucia is a world unto itself. Where does your nation stand?
