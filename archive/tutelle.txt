Tutelle is an enigmatic and storied continent, long shrouded in myth and legend, recently rediscovered and fully re-established by the pioneering settlers of Lusintania. Though its lands are ancient &#151; scattered with ruined citadels, moss-draped temples, and timeworn monuments &#151; its geopolitical existence is brand new. The region now stands as a beacon of renewed civilization, where modern Lusintanian governance meets the mysticism of forgotten epochs.

Tutelle is an RP-oriented, lore-rich region focused on collaborative storytelling, diplomacy, and cultural development, grounded in the traditions of ancient aesthetics and postmodern rebirth.
