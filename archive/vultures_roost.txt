[b]Vulture&#39;s Roost was old and abandoned, too high amongst the mountain peaks to be more than a mysterious spot on a few ancient maps. The earliest structures had been built by the [i]First Men[/i]. Now nominally inside the realm of the Prince of Dorne, the storms still came up the northern slopes of the Red Mountains from the Stormlands, crested the peaks like a lioness leaping down upon her prey, then smashed into the old fortifications like a battering ram, perpetually discouraging the posting of any permanent garrison. An ancient hidden pass from Vulture&#39;s Roost led into [i]The Reach[/i], but remained undetected by the patrols from [i]Nightsong[/i].[/b]
