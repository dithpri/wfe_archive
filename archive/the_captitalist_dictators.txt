[color=red][b]Communism cannot work even in theory. For a short time Communism seems effective. Soon enough, however, there are no rich people to take from and no poor people to give to. Everyone has the same amount of money.[/b][/color] 
[color=green][b]Capitalism does the opposite. True, it does create rich people, and poor people fall to the bottom. The rich people have more money to spend and enrich the economy. That is not a bad thing at all. The poor people then begin to rise and the economy grows. They may still seem poor, but that is a relative view point. They seem poor to the middle-class and rich people. The only thing the rest of the world sees is a strong economy.[/b][/color]
