We, founders of this region formed this for those nations that were destroyed by hostiles and are rebuilding their great nation. We do not care to invade but we do care if we are invaded. We do not give any patience and mercy to those who try to overthrow us. If any invaders try to occupy our lands, we will defeat them harshly, massacre their troops and destroy all relations excluding at war with any of them.
