Welcome to the Great Rumettian Archipelago. 

Despite the name, there is no such thing as a Rumettian.

Currently, the only present nations are the rather small Empire of Iizuna, a secluded autocracy known for its suppression of peoples for the sake of cultural preservation, and the Commonwealth of Lode, a fledgling nation formed from survivors of supposed ethnic cleansing within the aforementioned empire, intent on avoiding the same tyrannical rule.
