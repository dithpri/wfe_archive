The Scarpathian Union (SU) is a supranational and intergovernmental union of states in Scarpathia. It was established in 1992 by the Treaty on Scarpathian Union (The Unioville Treaty). Since then new accessions have raised its number of member states, and competences have expanded. The SU is the current stage of a continuing open-ended process of Scarpathian integration. 

The Scarpathian Union is home to Scarpathiavision, a Scarpathian spin on the hugely popular Eurovision, Scarpathian Olympics and a variety of others.
