[u][b]Welcome to Novum Saeculum!!![/b][/u]

This region is a completely isolated RP in which nations interact completely with the others within the region. 
You are extremely encouraged to participate, as the more people involved allows for more fun and better RP.
It is suggested that you message Batavorom, the Founder, about what your location on the world map below. 
Please don&#39;t send map messages without detail, otherwise it&#39;ll be quite hard to meet your needs. 
Most RP should occur within the region&#39;s forum or forums attached below on world events. 
You are once again encouraged to add even the smallest posts to the RP forums to help make Novum Saeculum way more fun!
