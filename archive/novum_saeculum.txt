[b]Welcome to Novum Saeculum!!![/b]
[hr]This region is a completely isolated RP in which nations interact completely with the others within the region. You are extremely encouraged to participate, as the more people involved allows for more fun and better RP. It is suggested that you message [b][nation]Batavorom[/nation][/b], the Founder, about your location on the world map below. Please don&#39;t send map messages without detail, otherwise it&#39;ll be quite hard to meet your needs. Most RP should occur within the region&#39;s forum or forums attached below on world events.[hr][b]Current Date: January 1900 (1 IRL week = 1 RP month)[/b] | [url=https://i.imgur.com/jn48dNI.png]World Map[/url] | World News[hr][b]RP Forums :[/b] | [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=479266&amp;p=36587032#p36587032]Diplomacy Forum[/url] | [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=479271]Military/Wartime Forum[/url] | [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=479274]Economic/Trade Forum[/url]
