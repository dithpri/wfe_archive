Xanestria is a parallel dimension in which the inhabitants living on it are multiculturally integrated albeit sharing similar problems of a post-modern society. Scientific communities, magical academies, religious tolerance of most faiths, the rise of AI, and the majority of species on the planet coexist in harmony thanks to many radical reforms. Set in the 2030s, only a handful of developing countries has fully embraced the future whilst the rest still struggle amid an increasingly warming world.

Update: Didn&#39;t we Xanestrians tell you what proper integration is to you, do you? Take our friendly advice: if you value your military forces, stay away from here. Don&#39;t let XATO come after you. Anyways, our border protocol is [color=green]open access to all.[/color]
