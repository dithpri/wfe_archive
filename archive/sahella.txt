The Sahellian region boasts diverse landscapes, from lush oases and expansive savannas to arid deserts. Towering trees create a dense jungle canopy while winding rivers support abundant wildlife. Beyond the jungle, vast savannas stretch under the open sky, leading to sun-scorched deserts with rolling dunes. Life thrives in this varied region, adapted to each unique environment. From the jungle&#39;s calls to the desert&#39;s silence, Sahellian, or Sahella colloquially, offers a captivating glimpse into Earth&#39;s biodiversity.
