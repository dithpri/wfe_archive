Built upon the violent battles of its past. After overthrowing a brutal, region-wide theocracy which caused widespread famine and poverty, this region is now among the most adored regions in its corner of the galaxy. The people of Aestreochaeus are gratified. They live great lives and hold no worries of starvation or poverty. 
Although there are many religions, the people of Aestreochaeus are quite spiritual, and they have an abundance of celebrations and many special ceremonies.
Aestreochaeus is a communist union of four planet-nations, The Darkmage, Labyrinthian, Runovxyr, and the founding head of the region, Hjevarsk. There are quite a few opposing groups against the current leadership and this has been the case for a long time.
