After a major lack of leadership was displayed in other regions a few like minded individuals decided to break out on their own. This region will be managed properly and promises will be kept. We welcome nations of all backgrounds and political affiliations. Each nation in this region donates a VERY small portion of their GDP to a regional delegation that is tasked with funding the space program in an effort to explore space and reach new frontiers. We thank you for your interest and continued service in helping us achieve a region of Utopian Leadership.
