With a long and deep history, dating back 3,000+ years, the region of Karo is one of the most developed locations on the planet. Originally having only it&#39;s southern coasts inhabited by the Ancient Karevieans, people have spread north into Sicyona, established new states such as Reviglia, and warred between each other.
The region is home to over 2.5 billion people of many nationalities, and is also the beginning of the Karo Mythos, which has the same depth and history that the region itself does.

Kareviea
Federated States of Siconya
