With a long and deep history, dating back 3,000+ years, the region of Karo is one of the most developed locations on the planet. Originally having only it&#39;s southern coasts inhabited by the Ancient Karevieans, people have spread north into Sicyona, established new states such as Reviglia, and warred between each other.
