[color=purple][b][i]The Dark Vanquishers visited a plethora of regions and vanquished them tonight. Two teams were used in the effort. Imperator Vulturret was caught behind the scenes singing about the raid. (Parody of &quot;Glorious&quot; by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis)[/i][/color]

I feel glorious, glorious
Suppressed those RMBs
I was born for this, born for this
It&#39;s who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the GCR breaks
And now I see the trigger updating
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious
