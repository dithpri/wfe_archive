[b][u]A region of nations dedicated to democracy as a human right, with the free market as a basis for its economics[/u][/b]

The nations in our region vary from the highly interventionist left-leaning to the economically liberal right-leaning, but we support our ideals in the way that fits our own nation the most. We are open to most any region that upholds our ideals on political and civil freedoms and is dedicated to their people in the same way our nations are.
Nations who abuse their powers to tread on the rights of their citizens will be banned from creating relations with our organisation! The high office holders uphold the right to rule on this matter accordingly.
