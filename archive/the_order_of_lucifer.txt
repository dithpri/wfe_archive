The Order of Lucifer aims to bring the Light to you, by force, or by diplomacy. We are a democratic region, hailing from the lost City of Atlantis. We will bring you the Immutable Truths: 
[i]Service to Man is the Highest Calling.
The Will of the World is Truth.
Unity of the World is Perfection[/i]
