Welcome to the Lauingan Alliance. It&#39;s a beautiful place. Where ostriches roam free and cross country runners outnumber the common folk who prefer to competitively read in bed. The Lauingan Alliance welcomes all who wish live peacefully under our glorious Emperor Lauinger and adhere to the Emperors &quot;List of Grievances&quot;. The Lauingan Alliance is what rose from the ashes of the oppressive and totalitarian Cao Dynasty led by Emperor Cao and his loyal servant Cooper (now known as Cooper the Commoner), after a one day rebellion and a rather weak fight from the Cao Dynasty the Lauingan Empire rose and later created a regional alliance.
