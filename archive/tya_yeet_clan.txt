[region]YEET CLAN[/region] was a shoddy raider region that raided using illegal means. TYA and her allies killed their region, but the trophy was taken seconds before TYA could grab it, due to internet lag. This region stands as a marker for TYA and her allies&#146; achievement. 

Special thanks to the troops and mercs that helped!
