Located by Lord Raleigh Faust in the 1300&amp;#39;s, South Thanatos is located in the Indian Ocean. It&amp;#39;s geographical features make it hard to reach with the Chardon Mountains covering the northern border and currents stubbornly forcing ships to either sail away or to crash onto the reefs.  Currently there is only one nation that Thanatos is comprised of, but there is plenty of room for more.  The occupants are peace-keepers with a dictatorship who believe that if you don&amp;#39;t like the policies well you can just move somewhere else.
