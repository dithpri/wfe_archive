A holy corporate empire of young opportunists. We are proud of our army of religious zealot pirates. We get rid of the old and unproductive to make room for those that reject socialist welfare and individual opinion. Our robust economy is powered by basket weaving, pizza delivery, lemonade stands, and weed. 
Only the strong survive here. Fear the Aardvark !
