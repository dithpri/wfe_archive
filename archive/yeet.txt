This region promotes yeet in every sense of the word

[spoiler]Black hawks Have only got one ball
The other, is in the Condemnation hall
Other raiders, those foolish invaders
Cut it off when those birdbrains were small
They threw it over world assembly
It landed in the deep blue sea
The fishes, got out their dishes
And had scallops and bollocks and tea[/spoiler]
