[region]The Yeet Army[/region] saw a knockoff and decided to pay it a visit.

Raid brought to you by the YAA members of:
[region]True Land[/region]
[region]Lardyland[/region]
[region]Empires ReUnited[/region]

We saw they didn&#146;t have any embassies, so we decided to [region]Yeet[/region] them a few.

Pay your respects for this dying region by typing &#147;F&#148; into the RMB.
Or [region]Yeet[/region] them like we did.

*Insert more [region]Yeet[/region] jokes here*
