[color=green][b]Welcome to the first annual Solid Kingdom Ejection Contest![/b][/color]

[color=d09c00][i]
&amp;#10047; Create a brand new nation; [b]no used puppets![/b]
&amp;#10047; Don&#39;t answer any issues
&amp;#10047; Each day, the nation placed last in the World Census will be eliminated
&amp;#10047; Whoever is left becomes the winner!
&amp;#10047; If [b]RikuTron IV[/b] is placed last, then there are no ejections for that day! ^u^
&amp;#10047; Keep an eye out for RMB minigames throught the contest![/i][/color]

[color=green][b]On a side note...[/b][i]
&amp;#10047; After the contest, a big week-long post-contest party will be held! It will be full of Minigames and RP and Dank Memes (and likely lots of spamming :P)!
&amp;#10047; If you are ejected, feel free to move your puppet to [region]Solid Puppet Warehouse[/region] until the big post-contest party![/i]

[b]Have fun! ^u^[/b][/color]
