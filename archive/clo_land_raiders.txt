[b]A late updating region refounded by [region]The Black Hawks[/region][/b]

Former owner claimed to be a raider and tried to join TBH but got banned. They then founded this region, claimed to have been trained by TBH, and moved the founder out. (They possibly didn&#39;t check the update time or even know how raiding works.) Later, the other nation in it moved out too and TBH refounded it.
