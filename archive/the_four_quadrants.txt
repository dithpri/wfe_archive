This region is yet another project of mine aimed at providing a dynamic world that interacts with NationStates as a whole. In here, there will be everything from pre-warp civilizations, to the humans, to the odd humpback whale, to the rarely used post ascension civilization, or beings, known as the Q. Not limited to canon factions or races, we will also likely be including non-Star Trek species and even entire Mirror Universes/Alternate Realities.
