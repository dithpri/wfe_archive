[b][color=#FF0040]Welcome to the International Socialists[/color], a region dedicated in memory to the International Socialist alliance. This region came to be after the original International Socialist Alliance was laid to waste by Black Hawk raiders. Due to this attack, the ISA was destroyed and lost most of its membership. As a result, the Imperium is founding a new alliance for the international socialists. We will serve as the interim government until this region has stability and is ready for democratic elections of officers and WA representatives.[/b]
