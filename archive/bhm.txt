Honoring or singling out one race for any reason for a month, day, or event for any sort of recognition (positive or negative) is racist. Instead of [region]Black History Month[/region], [region]White Lives Matter[/region], or [region]Black Lives Matter[/region], how about [region]All Lives Matter[/region] and how about we do away with any month intended to exclude other races and focus on one?
