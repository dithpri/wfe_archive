The Peir (Pee-r), one of the four continents and &quot;Iso-Territories&quot; located on Rasphodia. Being the third smallest in terms of land mass and claimed ocean, right behind Easel and ahead of Beryyl Isles, The Peir is home to 8 beloved nations (listed in order from largest land mass to smallest): Antaria, Vlazan, Vailetopia, Korduroy, U.A.Q.T, Dilanistan, Graen, and Microva. The Peir is aptly named due to it largely consisting of massive islands and its incredible compound naval strength between Antaria, Vlazan, Vailetopia, and Korduroy.
