Hello and welcome to the LGBTQ Safe Space, a haven for all who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, &quot;Q+&quot; or passionate straight ally. 

Our aim is to provide a safe platform for the enthusiastic, energetic discussion of all kinds of Q issues. 

Hopefully, in time, the LGBTQ Safe Space will become a major voice in all NationStates debates.
