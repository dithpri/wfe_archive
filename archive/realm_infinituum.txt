[color=blue][u]Infinite Cosmos[/u][/color]
Realm Infinituum is an infinite multiverse. It is composed of many life forms and civilizations. There are an infinite number of celestial structures which are endlessly distributed throughout the cosmos. Magic and metaphysics play a role in certain universes which are filled with supernatural phenomenon. There are gods as well which roam the cosmos, both divine and organic. There are other things to know ,but you must discover them on journey into infinity. 
This is a conglamorate of my ideas, concepts, and imaginations. It is also headquarters of the [color=red]GEOFICTIONAL WORKS SOCIETY[/color], an RP/Worldbuilding guild! 
This is a Roleplay-based/worldbuilding-based existence.
