[color=blue][u]Infinite Cosmos[/u][/color]
The Multiversal infinituum is an infinite realm of universes and timelines. It is indestructible and infinite in all things. All concepts ever concieved or can be conceived, lie within this Infinituum. You may experience an infinite number of sets of physical law and observe and infinite number of unique celestial structures. Intelligent life forms fill the infinituum, with civilizations of many kinds. Infinity awaits.
This is a conglamorate of my ideas, concepts, and imaginations. It is also headquarters of the [color=red]GEOFICTIONAL WORKS SOCIETY[/color], an RP/Worldbuilding guild! 
This is a Roleplay-based/worldbuilding-based existence.
