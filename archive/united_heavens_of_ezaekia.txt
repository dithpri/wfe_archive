The United Heavens of Ezaekia ( U.H.E ), was formed when Krishna Ghji took over all the islands that surrounded Ezaekia&amp;#39;s territory. Once the region was announced, Krishna Ghji and his advisors help set the government and the governmental laws that are now established. Citizens of the U.H. have the freedom to do whatever as long as they abide by Jehovah&amp;#39;s commandments and the passed legislated laws of Krishna Ghji. The United Heavens is an Ezaekian region located in Central America just underneath Panama.
