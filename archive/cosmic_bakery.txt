Just a place for the galactic bakers to work and be creative.

Who are they? Just bakers who travel the stars and bake all kinds of things, delivering them to planets who need it. Their bakeries churn out tons of goods each passing minute, distributing them to the many shops they have or selling them to other local bakeries.


(Really just a region for myself.)
