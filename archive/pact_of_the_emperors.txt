We stand for what is right. We do things for moral reasons, pass laws, strike down laws for moral reasons. We wage wars on poverty, not poor people. We sacrifice, we care about our neighbor. We put our money where our mouths are, and we never beat our chest. We build great big things, make ungodly technological advances. We cultivate the worlds greatest artists and the worlds greatest economies. We reach for the stars. Act like men. We aspire to intelligence, we don&amp;#39;t belittle it, it doesn&amp;#39;t make us feel inferior. We dont identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election and we dont scare easily. We are able to do all these things and be all these things because we stand together. As a single entity.
