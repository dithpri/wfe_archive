   Unio Populis, or &amp;quot;Union of the People&amp;quot;, is a centralized conglomerate of authoritarian, socialist, Juche, and totalitarian nations, focused on constant expansion and acquirement of power. It was founded in 2015 by the Federation of Amero-Pacifica, a totalitarian dictatorship with 5,000,000 people.
   The structure of government in Unio Populis is based on the collective oligarchy of Amero-Pacifica and two elected states. These states are elected every month. This oligarchy makes all decisions, but these decisions can be repealed by a 75% vote among the region&amp;#39;s members.
   Unio Populis mainly consists of nations in the Americas (usually the Pacific coast) and Europe.
