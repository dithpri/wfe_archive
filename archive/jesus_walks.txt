Yo, we at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves
God show me the way because the Devil&#39;s tryna break me down
(Jesus walks with me, with me, with me, with me, with me)
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless - might snatch ya necklace
And next these - might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these - who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it&#39;s kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
