[b]Please disregard any &quot;scandals&quot; you may hear about us. We&#39;re perfect boys and only want to do good. I (Andrew) and nobody else in the region has ever committed war crimes so stop trying to bring us in for an international hearing. Thanks.[/b]

Everyone who has embassies with us or is a part of this region is part of the GGMA.
