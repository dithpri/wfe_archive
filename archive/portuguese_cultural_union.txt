The Portuguese Empire (Portuguese: Imp&eacute;rio Portugu&ecirc;s), also known as the Portuguese Overseas (Ultramar Portugu&ecirc;s) or the Portuguese Colonial Empire (Imp&eacute;rio Colonial Portugu&ecirc;s), was one of the largest and longest-lived empires in world history and the first colonial empire of the Renaissance. It existed for almost six centuries from the capture of Ceuta in 1415 to the handover of Portuguese Macau to China in 1999.
