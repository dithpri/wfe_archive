The Circularlum Galaxy is full of hundreds, if not thousands, of different sentient races, governments, and empires&#151;ranging from an AI dictatorship led by droids, to a race of aggressive anthropomorphic cats led by an occult-practicing monarch, to a race of candy-colored talking ponies led by anarcho-syndicalists, to planets which resemble American suburbia in its entirety. Enjoy.
