[i]&#147;Through me you pass into the city of woe:	
Through me you pass into eternal pain:	
Through me among the people lost for aye.	
Justice the founder of my fabric moved:	
To rear me was the task of Power divine,	
Supremest Wisdom, and primeval Love.
Before me things create were none, save things	
Eternal, and eternal I endure.	
All hope abandon, ye who enter here.&#148;[/i]
