The Askaarian Mandate is a conglomerate of Nations/Corporations which exist in a parallel New Eden, an empty galaxy open for endless expansion. By some freak accident of technology and meta-science, a corporation of Capsuleers were transported to this alternate galaxy devoid of sentient life. After years of hardship a planet was successfully terraformed and colonized, here is where the Capsuleers put down roots and began to rebuild the human race.
