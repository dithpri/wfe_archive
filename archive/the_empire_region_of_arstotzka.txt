And now, for a poem!

Upon a dark update three Hawks
Met a group of Wardens three.
Two big scary Corporals,
And a little chick Hawk wee.

The Wardens jumped to stop the raid,
But found they were too late!
They left to fight another day,
And left Arstotzka to its fate.

And our two corporal Hawks went out
With their trainee to play.
To prove for all the world to know
Black&#39;s [i]much[/i] cooler than grey!
