[b][color=gray]We are the home of Deep Ecology on NationStates.[/b][/color]

[color=lightgreen][b]Deep Ecology is the belief that all organisms are equal, and we intend to spread this belief across NS and discuss the implications that this fact brings on how society should be structured.[/color][/b]

[color=gray][b]Because our ideology is pretty niche, we accept any alliance with any region that is not Far Right.[/b][/color]

[color=lightgreen][b]Anybody who joins gets a party position.[/b][/color]

[color=gold][b]We are a proud member of the TZC![/b][/color]

[color=gray][b]As we would be considered a Far Left region by most, if this region is too radical for you then you can feel free to join our more moderate allies over at [region]Green Legion[/region][/color][/b]
