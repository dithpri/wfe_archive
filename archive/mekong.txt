The Mekong is a trans-boundary river in Southeast Asia. It is the world&amp;#39;s 12th-longest river[2] and the 7th-longest in Asia. Its estimated length is 2,703&nbsp;mi, and it drains an area of 307,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi, discharging 110&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi of water annually.
The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in this river have made navigation difficult. The river is a major trading route linking China&#146;s southwestern province of Yunnan to Laos, Burma and Thailand to the south, an important trade route between western China and Southeast Asia.
