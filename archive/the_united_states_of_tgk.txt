[b][color=#B0171F]The brave Sekhmet Legion of [region]Osiris[/region] (along with their friends from [region]Ijaka[/region]) set out this Daylight Savings Eve in search of what daylight they were actually saving.[/color]

[color=#BF8000]Was it the bright sun that broke every morning? Was it radiation that loves to mess with electronics (including, I&#39;m sure, raiders&#39; computers)? Was it the Harry Styles song from his hit album [i]Harry&#39;s House[/i]?[/color]

[color=red]The Legionnaires may not have found the answer by the end of the night, but they did leave a trail of destruction in their wake![/color]
