This is a puppet storage region owned by [region]True Land[/region].
Of cource, it&#39;s protected by the True Army
So far, it&#39;s kinda just [nation]Chesist[/nation]&#39;s personal playground, if you want to move a puppet here, cool.
Fun fact: [region]Davidia[/region] was going to be the origonal name of [nation]Chesist[/nation], but it was already taken.
Seriously tho, if you are not a puppet, join [region]True Land[/region].
We need people... [i]desperately[/i]
I mean, I hear [region]Lardyland[/region] complaining about having 6 WA members, but we only have 6 members, only 2 of them being in the WA.
(Sorry [region]Lardyland[/region])
So, yeah, do things not bad.
Aaaaaaand greetings&#39;nt.

Oh, and our poll region is [region]Bad Grammar[/region], there&#39;s probably a poll there rn

Ok, [i]now[/i] greetings&#39;nt.
