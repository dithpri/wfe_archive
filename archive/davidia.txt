This region has been requested by [nation]syria-kebabistan[/nation] to be saved. As it took a while to process this request, we have come to find a dead region.

Update: [nation]Free Market Socialist Republics[/nation] seems to be the owner, and must discuss a refound schedule somewhere where raiders cannot spike the region

[color=red]all bans lifted, natives may return, or discuss a secure schedule for a refound.[/color]
Please direct all queries to [nation]Mercenary CEO[/nation]
