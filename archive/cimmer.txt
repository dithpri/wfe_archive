The Cimmerians were an ancient Indo-European people that were first mentioned between 420 and 414 BC in Assyrian records, and defeated the king of Urartu, King Rusa I. In the 660s BC, the nomads began to conquer territories from Assyria and attacked Greek cities in Lydia. Soon, attacks were made on Assyria but boohoo for the Cimmerians, their leader King Dugdammi had died. End script.
