The Mri&#39;verse is a collection of thirteen pocket universes created with the sole purpose of defending the core of Mri Space and permitting it to project power across the multiverse against the threat of the Darkness. Since the end of the major threat that the Darkness brought, the Mri&#39;verse has maintained several gateways which connect the Rift Space around these pocket universes to various locations within the multiverse.
