a strong region of flipping dragons                  

 Eternally postured,
Receeding into the caves of Mount Athanaton
Stands the Dragon of the Cloak
Holding a flickering remnant of time in his whithering talons.

The creature&#39;s form brought forth by the candle&#39;s dancing light.
Glazed eyes, of a marble&#39;s cold stare, is the extent of his sight.
Rippled scales of crimson sand layer his age-beaten face.
A thick, red, wool-hooded robe undulates along a steady limping pace.
