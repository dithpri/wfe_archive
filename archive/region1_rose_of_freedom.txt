This region gives freedom to all. But if any Nation decides to put our Empire in war against our rivals that Nation will have consenquences coming to it and they will never be a part of The Phantom Quartz Empire ever again depending on how bad the Nation put our Empire in danger. Other than that all Nations are welcome to join in our region, but again if ANYthing can cause our Empire to go into war with other Nation they will be punished on how bad the damage is. Unless it&#39;s a good reason than that&#39;s okay but if it&#39;s to put ourselves in danger that&#39;s an different story.
