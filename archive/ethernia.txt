[color=pride]Welcome to Ethernia [/color]
We&#39;re a region which pride&#39;s itself on being a safe space for people. A place where everyone can have fun (as long as they don&#39;t upset others or break the rules). 

In Ethernia we strive to create a community which is like a family - everyone taking care of each other. Furthermore, we strive to ensure that everyone here is given a fair and equal voice (within reason), ensuring that everyone can have a say.
