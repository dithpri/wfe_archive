Welcome to the place where all are accepted and welcome for how they are, a place where we won&#39;t discriminate (as long as you don&#39;t break the rules), and a place of fun. Ethernia is a place in which many voices become one powerful beacon; we&#39;re dedicated to making our strong like a family. However: [b]Any xenophobia, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, mysoginisy, discrimination or anything else that can reasonably be considered offensive will result in a permanent and instant ban, without appeal.[/b]
