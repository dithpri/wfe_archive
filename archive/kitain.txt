[color=green]Welcome to Kitain![/color]
[hr]
[color=red]We had a dream of freedom,
This dream was born from a distaste for a broken regime,
We are now free,
We stand together to create a new home,
The ideals of friendship and unity are with us,
For this is our last home, 
Our last chance at paradise[/color]
