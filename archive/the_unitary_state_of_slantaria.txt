[b]&amp;#129413;&amp;#9876;&amp;#65039;This region has been struck by the Airborne Division of The Black Hawks&amp;#9876;&amp;#65039; &amp;#129413;

We took special notice of the region&#39;s Governor having &quot;Fascist&quot; in its name, so we decided to rectify this issue by refounding the region as soon as it became available, permanently ensuring that it can&#39;t be brought into fascist hands again.
