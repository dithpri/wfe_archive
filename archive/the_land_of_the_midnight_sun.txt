North.

Anyway, we&amp;#39;re the region located within the Arctic Circle, except the name &amp;quot;Arctic Circle&amp;quot; was already taken. We&amp;#39;re famous for our fat, bearded old men who sneak into children&amp;#39;s houses every year and leave them presents, and for our headless Tommy gunners.

If you want to join the region, please follow the steps provided below in the &amp;quot;Immigration Protocol for the Land of the Midnight Sun in Respect to Naturalization&amp;quot; dispatch and notify the Empire of Salami via telegram. Thank you.
