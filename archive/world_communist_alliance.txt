[I]Liberated: 03.11.18[/I]

[color=red]Liberated from Fascist supporters in [region]The Augusto Pinochet Vengeance Force[/region], by the mighty Anti-Nazi/Fascist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region], it shall be protected as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

This liberation is not based on the regions Communist ideology, rather it&#39;s focus is to deny a platform against the invaders whom openly support the hateful ideologies of Nazism and Fascism.[/color]
