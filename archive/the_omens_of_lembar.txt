[color=27CC31]We are the region where there is no limit. Supernatural and divine beings, Type 0 Civilisations, Wizards, Biopunk, South Korea in 2014, Dystopian Worlds or just a vast void; whatever [B]YOU[/B] can think of has a place in the vast plane of Lembar. Be ready for anything, because the world as you know it might not be the same when the sun next comes up... or doesn&#39;t...[/color]
