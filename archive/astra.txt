Astra is a Fantasy/Pokemon based region. The region is divided based on style of RP (Sylven League for Pokemon and Astra for Fantasy). The region centers around a good, just government style, mainly anti-technological. Religion is a highly supported part of the region. We support a war-free environment (No guarantees in the fantasy area though) and will welcome most nations (Just not the joke ones or extremely dictatorship ones). The government is centered around the champion and king/queen.
