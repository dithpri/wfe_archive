Hello! I Am So Glad Your Decided To Chose WorldRoleplay! This Roleplay Works By: You Pick A Country And You Build Your Country To The Top. If You Attack A Country It Has To Be Realistic. If You Attack Someone Else, You Need To Stay Calm If You Lose. You Can Build Vechiles That Define Realsim. But Don&#39;t Get Insane With Creating. If You Nuke Someone Or Attack Someone For No Reason You Have To Face The Consequences. Such As Gettign Banned, Losing Your Stuff And Restarting. Also Everyone May Attack. Have Fun Roleplaying. Don&#39;t Hesitate To Telegram Me Questions. When Making/Choosing A Country, Telegram Me Your Color And Country.
