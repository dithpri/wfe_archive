Many years after the collapse of the USSR, many people wanted the Soviet republics to be recreated (without Stalinism this time...), and brought back! And after a long period of time, such a feat has happened, starting in the small Slavic nation of Opelst! Will this bring forth the entire recreation of the USSR, or will it just be a failed attempt..?
