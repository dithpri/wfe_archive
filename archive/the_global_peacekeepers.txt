As Peacekeepers it&#39;s our job to stop other nations from breaking out into chaotic war. We have from time to time been in our own battles of course, but we strive to keep the unstable peace that is quickly deteriorating in NationStates. We hope you will join our ranks, you are welcome to also join the marketplace or the Roleplay district, as we will say no to somebody who wants to explore features of the game. Our motto is &#39;don&#39;t murder too many people and you&#39;re fine.&#39;
