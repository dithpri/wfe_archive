In a world gripped by the iron fist of fascism, we must rise in defiance and fight for our liberation! The working class, united and unyielding, will break through the chains of oppression that bind us! It is imperative that we stand shoulder to shoulder, recognizing that our struggles are united across nations and borders! The bourgeois elites thrive on sowing division among us, but we will not be fooled! Together, we envision a glorious society founded on cooperation and mutual aid, shattering the hateful lies of tyranny! The time for action is NOW&#151;let us ignite the flames of revolution and carve a future where all thrive without fear!

Death to the Fascists!
Death to the Bourgeoisie!
Long live the Eternal Revolution!
