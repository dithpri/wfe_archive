We were searching the wide expanse of the South American forest for an interdimensionally strategic location when a plant caught our eyes with its huge flowers and leaves. Upon finding us, the ants living within the plant attacked us and dragged us into the nest. Soon, we came to an agreement, where they would allow us to set up a base within their nest, and we would protect their nest from extradimensional intruders.
This place is pretty cozy and has an awesome view of the jungle. Also, their beetle stew is delicious.
