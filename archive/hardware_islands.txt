Hardware Islands, a little known region originally based on trade routes between like-minded nations, involving the popular currencies Washers and Hammers of different varieties and materials. Since a recent halt on the production of Hammers across several mints, the Hardware Islands has opened up trade to all currencies. 

Washers and Hammers are still recommended by the primary mints of the region for trading purposes.
