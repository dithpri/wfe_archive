The place to buy and store puppets. If you are interested, please TG [nation]Tea party separation of america[/nation]
Why buy puppets you ask? Well, there basically free. You just tell me why you need them in the TG. 
&amp;quot;But you can create them yourself.&amp;quot; Why waste time doing that when we will do it for you! 
&amp;quot;Why do i need puppets?&amp;quot; For those that have played NS for awhile you know. For the rest of you, you can use them to raid, defend, steal elections/polls and have a personal army!
Your welcome to store puppets here, but ask the nation above first in the TG.
(Note, puppets work better with NS++)
