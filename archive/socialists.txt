[i]Re-acquired: 10.08.24[/i]

[color=red]This region has been historically protected by various Antifascist organizations. 

In 2014 (25.08.14) the responsibility of protection was transferred from [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] to [region]The MT Army[/region].

In 2022, it was gifted to [nation]Proletaire[/nation] of [region]The Red Fleet[/region] to run a new community.

In 2024 (10.08.24), [nation]Proletaire[/nation], deciding to retire from NationStates, closed the region and entrusted its protection once again to [region]The MT Army[/region].[/color]

[color=blue][b]NOTE: Members of the former community are encouraged to MOVE TO [region]THE INTERNATIONALE[/region].

If your looking for a new challenge and have the motivation to revive civilian [region]Mariner Trench[/region], please telegram [nation]Vippertooth33[/nation] with a plan.[/color][/b]
