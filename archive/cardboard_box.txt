[i][b]Fun Fact:[/b] the world&#39;s largest nuts have recently been found near Fiji, on the Bofad Islands. The islands were discovered in late 2019, but due to COVID, the discovery wasn&#39;t really noticed until 2023. The Bofadese natives of this island have been eating these nuts for thousands of years before Indonesian explorers found the island. Since 2023, tourists have been flocking to the island to get a taste of this rare delicacy. So, if you wanna see something out of this world, try Bofadese Nuts.[/i]
