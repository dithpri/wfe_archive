Welcome to Ephrata!
We hope that you enjoy it here. It may look like nothing really right now. But one day it will. If you need help or need to ask a question please contact [nation]Nicemonte[/nation], or [nation]East Embia Albils[/nation], but they might not be on, so please contact [nation]Overname[/nation] if so.
~As you see, only a few will be here, due to the fact that we are new to Nationstate. You might be wondering, why join this small place? I thought about, why people should join too. So it is just freedom actually, you can do rp anytime you want, partake in poles, embassy, war, raids! It is fun that you need.~

Please endorse our WA delegate!
Currently, [nation]East Embia Albils[/nation]

Ephrata Forces (EF) has a Factbook, check it out! 

Well, please enjoy our region, Ephrata!
