Long live Castrix![/color]

[color=red]This Region is still unfinished and I do need to work on it, but is set to be on the terms of Roleplay with a concept I have not seen before. All Nations in the region, are not nations, but citys in a larger nation which is the region. This is what Castrix is, and is the main purpose of it.[/color]

City-Naming Scheme:
Citys of the Castrix are roughly the Name of the actual nations that is in this region, so Peoples Republic of Hueralu ---&amp;gt; City of Hueralu. and Nation of Valiza ---&amp;gt; City of Vazila. Generally certain situations you may have to slightly modify from this original city naming scheme such as in the case of having numbers in your nation&#39;s name.
