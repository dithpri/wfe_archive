Long live Castrix!


Incase your wondering how this works, every nation here is considered a city under the (Constitutional) Kingdom of Castrix. 
Citys of the Castrix are roughly the Name of the actual nations that is in this region, so Peoples Republic of Hueralu ---&amp;gt; City of Hueralu. and Nation of Valiza ---&amp;gt; City of Vazila. Generally certain situations you may have to slightly modify from this original city naming scheme such as in the case of having numbers in your nation&#39;s name.
