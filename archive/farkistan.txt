[b]Welcome to [region=Farkistan].[/b]  If we like you.

Live, love, learn to ignore the trolls.  Or don&amp;#39;t.  Your stress levels are your own problem.

Orenia undid the damage wrought by the recent so-called &amp;#39;takeover&amp;#39;.  Our embassies are intact once again.

For the moment, there&amp;#39;s a password on entry into our region.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

We might be small, and we&amp;#39;re definitely lazy, but [b]no one[/b] gets to roll into our region and paint it with their idiocy. 

We have our own, thank you.
