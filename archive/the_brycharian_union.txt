Situated on the continent of Idris and Headquartered in the City of Alicante (Alacant in Basque),  Jatorri Eskualdea (Region of Origin), The Basque Kingdom of Jon Kortajarena, this ancient Union of once just 3 Nations has stood the test of time and endured multiple attempts at their existence. Once The Brycharian Empire, the Empire disunited to form The Brycharian Union, a coalition of 3,5,7,10 and now 12 Republics and Kingdoms, that though no longer one country, remain united in ideals, history and thought.

We do, however, remember the fallen Kingdom of Shadowspyre, which fell during the Age of Idris.
