We were once part of the Democratic states of mars, but after getting overthrown, we and a few of our supporters, have moved to a new spot in mars, and formed the Confederate states of mars.  We strive for greatness, and are trying to become a greater region then the Democratic states of mars.  Our three virtues are, integrity, democracy, and equality.
