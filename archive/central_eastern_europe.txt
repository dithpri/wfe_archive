[b]Welcome to CENTRAL EASTERN EUROPE.[/b]

A Christian region with a rich history and wide European diversity. 
No matter what the time will bring we will always be loyal and respectful to our region.

[i] &quot;The society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.&quot; [/i]
