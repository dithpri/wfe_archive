Citizens of the Agarthan Union,

I did not rush to wield our power. I asked for peace and the surrender of hostilities. When those pleas failed, we acted&#151;within law and honor&#151;to defend our people.

We showed restraint, but hope is not a strategy. When delay meant death, we acted&#151;not for vengeance, but out of duty.

It hurt, and we remember the cost. We remember small acts that kept us human, and above all, Arnstein&#151;our steady hand, whose calm leadership allowed us to endure.

We do not celebrate what we were forced to do. We mourn loss, protect the living, and honor the law. Our duty remains: defend the Union with courage, care, and integrity.
