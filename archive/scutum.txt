The Society for the Cessation of Unprovoked Trespasses, Usurpations, and Movements (SCUTUM) is a new alliance formed with the intent to provide a place for those who do not wish their region to come under attack by various raiding or defending forces. In other words, we are a non-aligned movement and enforce that non-alignment through twin policies of mutual defense and armed neutrality.
