Welcome to AW. 

AW, it&amp;#39;s a region where everybody can go and settle. The region isn&amp;#39;t totally complete and if anybody want to help us to built the Region, he or she will be Welcome. 

The first helps nations can have good power in the region.

If you are french, you can speak and write french, with me or other nations. But all english nations are welcome. 

Now, we have a Temporary Government Council which will remain in place until elections. Currently, the Pologermany (Pologermain) have all power, but anyone arrive will have a place in the 1st TGC.
