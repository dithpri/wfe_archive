Your eyes now behold [b]Another World[/b], an Otherworld loosely linked to the broader multiverse by the odd interdimensional portal here and there. Here technology and magic co-exist, mythology and theology are empirical sciences and nuclear physicists rub shoulders with high mages. The setting itself is huge: a Jupiter-sized terrestrial planet, with an inbuilt magic that renders its gravity a comfortably familiar 1 G. With potentially thousands of continents, and millions of islands, spread throughout its gargantuan ocean there&#39;s plenty of space to go around, so welcome one and all! Feel free to make yourself at home, or just pass through.
