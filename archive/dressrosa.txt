Regional Government and Delegate elections will take place once we reach the [u]25 nations goal[/u].

We&amp;#39;re anti-[i]World Assembly[/i], however, we strongly support the [i]General Assembly[/i] and the [i]Security Council[/i] convictions. Therefore, we invite you to join the World Assembly as well as endorse the elected delegate (do not  surpass the Delegate&amp;#39;s number of endorssements unless you won the elections, [b]YOU WILL BE BANNED[/b]).

We invite you to role-play on the NSG forum while we develop the outside forum.
