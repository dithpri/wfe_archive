[b]Tornado Alley[/b] is a colloquial term for the area of the United States where tornadoes are most frequent. It is largely a media-driven term although tornado climatologists distinguish peaks in activity in certain areas and storm chasers have long recognized the Great Plains tornado belt.

Although the official boundaries of Tornado Alley are not clearly defined, its core extends from northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, into Nebraska. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
