The UAS is a union of states, working in cooperation for the general betterment of each state, and of the region as a whole. We are roleplayers, and have nations of every ideology imaginable. We welcome both WA members and non members with equal enthusiasm. We have elections for Prime Minister every two months, we have political parties (and welcome you to form one of your own, if you like), and we have IC and OOC forums for you to chat about the game, the region, or whatever strikes you.
