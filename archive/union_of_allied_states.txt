The UAS is a union of states, working in cooperation for the general betterment of each state, and of the region as a whole. We are roleplayers, and have nations of every ideology imaginable. We welcome both WA members and non members with equal enthusiasm. As we are a new region, the first several nations to join will be able to take on leadership roles in the region, if they wish, or they are welcome to sit back and watch, if that&amp;#39;s more their style. Our forums are building and growing, even as you read this, so come on by [url=http://z13.invisionfree.com/Allied_States/index.php?act=idx]the forums[/url] and give us a yell, or feel free to post here in the regional message board.
