The Danish West Indies (Danish: Dansk Vestindien) or Danish Antilles was a Danish colony in the Caribbean, consisting of the islands of Saint Thomas with 32 square miles (83&nbsp;km2); Saint John with 19 square miles (49&nbsp;km2); and Saint Croix with 84 square miles (220&nbsp;km2). The Danish West India Guinea Company annexed the uninhabited island of Saint Thomas in 1672 and St. John in 1675. In 1733, Saint Croix was purchased from the French West India Company. When the Company went bankrupt in 1755, the King of Denmark-Norway assumed direct control of the three islands. The Danish West Indies was occupied by Britain in 1801&#150;1802 and 1807&#150;1815, during the Napoleonic Wars.
