[color=crimson][u][b].:\|Goodbye UCR\|/:.[/u]


[i]The UCR, a region saturated in petty incivility and immaturity, lived a pathetic existence. The UCR, now in flames of ruin and regret, sits. Lifeless. As a motionless, ancient ruin. The UCR, now but a lost memory in the sea of the changing tides, The UCR believed it could. That it could  build, spread, or advance, but it could not. For the UCR is weak and forgotten. Dead, and now rotting. The UCR only reminded in the end that each of us, our humanity,  slowly decays with age and disease, living out an existence, just as the UCR did. 

You see, the UCR isn&amp;#39;t so different.[/I]
