Born form the ashes of the disastrous Public Chat on the school app known as Teams. A small group of friends have come together out of boredom to create a new long lasting chat known as &#147;The Soupy Chat.&#148; Though, long lasting was a bit of an understatement since our own school would eventually take away the chat feature on the app entirely. Since then, the legacy of the Soupy Chat has lived on through various websites such as Discord and Nation States and we hope to grow it even further someday.

Theres only one rule here in this region: Don&#146;t rat us out to our teachers!
