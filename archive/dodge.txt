[b][color=#1A5276]Dodge[/color][/b] is a region known for it&#39;s rustic landscape and constant baffling phenomena. It&#39;s been said that you can mistake d&aelig;mons for angels in Dodge and vice-versa. There&#39;s a vast network of caverns underneath from where the locals have reported &quot;alien-like screeching&quot; at exactly three in the morning on every second Tuesday. There&#39;s also been sightings of a hyena army building up recently near our eastern border for whatever reason... 

With all this happening around us, we&#39;ve learned to just carry on with our lives. This is all just extra. This is Dodge.
