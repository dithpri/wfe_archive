[Chorus: Offset]
Raindrop (Drip), drop-top (Drop-top)
Smokin&#39; on cookie in the hotbox (Cookie)
******&#39; on your *****, she a thot, thot (Thot)
Cookin&#39; up dope in the crockpot (Pot)
We came from nothin&#39; to somethin&#39;, ***** (Hey)
I don&#39;t trust nobody, grip the trigger (Nobody)
Call up the gang and they come and get ya (Gang)
Cry me a river, give you a tissue (Hey)
My ***** is bad and bougie (Bad)
Cookin&#39; up dope with a Uzi (Blaow)
