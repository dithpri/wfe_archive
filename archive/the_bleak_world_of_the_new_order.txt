The Bleak World of the New Order is a roleplay region that explores an alternate history world where Nazi Germany won World War II. Based on the Hearts of Iron IV mod, The New Order: Last Days of Europe, this region seeks to explore the world in a much more creative way, outside of the HOI IV gameplay mechanics.
