[b][u]Welcome to the Colonis Spatium Universe![/b][/u]

The Colonis Spatium Universe (Colonis - latin for Colony and Spatium - latin for space; Space Colonies) is the universe name given for one of the many universes in the Multiverse. Though some histories in this universe have stayed the same, there are some minor and major differences from the Prime/ Real World Universe (Universe 1). The biggest differences this universe has to other universes are the ability of space travel and the ability to terraform planets.
