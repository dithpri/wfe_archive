[color=#123488][b] CONGRATS ON BEING FEATURED!!! Sorry to inform you that you are also prime real estate to be raided. That&#146;s why we, assassins from [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], decided that this here spot would be great to party on. Unfortunately, we are kinda rambunctious and may or may not have accidentally made all this mess for you guys to clean up. I&#146;m sure someone will be around soon to assist in clean up. In the meantime, PARTY ON!!!
