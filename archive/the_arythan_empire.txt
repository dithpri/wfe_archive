[color=red][b]&quot;We live our lives in short explosion, to which death takes in minor corrosion. 
We stand in silent admiration, of the world that we call our nation. 
We fight, live, work and toil, to ensure our dominance without a spoil. 
Tonight, we dine, laugh, drink and dance, by which none of these are planned by chance. 
Hear our cries like a vast choir, and tremble beneath our mighty Empire.&quot;[/b][/color]
