Mercury has begun to shrug off its most brutal extremes. Tiny pockets of breathable air hover in sheltered valleys and reinforced domes, tinted with faint greens where hardy plants and engineered microbes persist. The sun still scorches, but reflective shields and magnetic fields temper its fury, letting surface explorers step outside for brief stretches. Communities cluster in shallow caverns and semi-open settlements, connected by skybridges and transport tunnels. Life here is fragile but tangible.
