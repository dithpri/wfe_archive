Originally founded in 2010, the region flourished, growing to over 250+ nations with old style manual recruitment. A thriving democracy with political parties and varied interests took shape. Other regions became allies or foes, and an active interest in inter-regional relations formed. After a while, the region became stagnant, old methods of recruiting failed due to automation and thereby much greater competition. It ultimately staggered under its own weight and impatience of key regional members - and imploded. A few refugees of the original region are still around on NS today.
