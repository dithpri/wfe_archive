BRIEF HISTORY

The founder of the Baghel (or Vaghela) clan is identified as Anoka, nephew of the King Kumarpal Solanki of Gujarat (r 1143-1174). He obtained a grant of the village of Vaghela, the tiger&#39;s lair, from whence the clan takes its name. Subsequently the Vaghelas extended their power over the whole of Gujarat, but came under increasing pressure from the invading Muslims. In 1297 Sultan Ala ud-din Khilji invaded with a huge army, destroyed the capital at Anhilwara and expelled the Waghel ruler. Some authorities seek to identify the son and successor of this last ruler, Karan Dev, with the first ruler of Bandhogarh, but this does not seem to be correct.
