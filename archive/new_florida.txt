Ram Trucks says it&#39;s really simple -- people count on you and you count on your truck. The automaker says it built its 2500 truck to have the best-in-class gas towing and the 3500 to have best-in-class fifth-wheel towing and best resale value. Ram Trucks is offering special pricing on the 2018 Ram 2500 Tradesman Crew Cab or the 2018 Ram 3500 Tradesman Crew Cab
