The region full of fertile steppes and plateaus. Occasionally, there will be a flying potato, called [color=brown]Spudus Metellus[/color], imitating a plane. This potato will drop its spuds to grow more of itself. Rarely, they can be spotted on the ground rolling.

[color=blue]The regional flag is going to change soon. If you want to recommend a flag that represents The Central Steppes, feel free to notify one of the officers.[/color]

[color=red]The reason why we don&#39;t allow Black Hawks here is that I don&#39;t want this region to become a base for them and a friend&#39;s region was shortly captured by one.[/color]
