This is where the line of Arthur Eld were born. It is known as the Land of Milk and Honey and is the seat of The Affiliation where the gunslingers reside. It was one of Mid-World&amp;#39;s most fertile areas and showed the first signs of recovery after the Great Cataclysm. It only took a few generations for threaded stock to breed true and crops to grow once more, which is the reason Arthur Eld chose this spot for his capital. People say that all roads lead to Gilead.
