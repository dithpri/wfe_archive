This region, once a small defender community against fascists, was later occupied by the Anti Authoritarian Alliance. Unfortunately their dedication to commemorating the actions of this group fell as short as their actions defending socialism, so now [region]North Korea[/region] and the [region]Korean Peoples Army[/region] will give due commemoration to these defenders in the fight against fascism.
