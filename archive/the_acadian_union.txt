[b]Bienvenue &agrave; l&#39;Union acadienne![/b][HR]This is a region of happiness and freedom. We have a Parliament-style government, and minister openings are available. We have one major rule here: Respect everyone, and you shall be treated with the greatest care and respect. Note: We do not go along with Nation States Statistics... We also mostly do role plays and discussions on our Regional Discord! [b]DISCORD IS REQUIRED TO BE APART OF THE REGION![/b] To make a map claim please message the founder.
