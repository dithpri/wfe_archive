Welcome to [b]1950[/b].
It&#39;s been over 30 years since Germany and the Central Powers marched victorious through Europe, and ever since the continent and most of the world have been at peace.
However, times are changing, and the beginning of a new era is on the horizon. How will each nation fair off in the second half of the 20th century? Take control of one, or create an alternate history, and participate in nationbuilding and geopolitics.
Only you can decide their story and fate...
