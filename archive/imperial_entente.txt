Welcome to [b]1950[/b].
It&#39;s been over 30 years since Germany and the Central Powers marched victorious through Europe, defeating the combined powers of the Entente. Now, in the second half of the 20th century, we see a potential second weltkreig on the horizon. World War was narrowly evaded many times during the Great Depression, but this is different. We see superpowers rising, the Soviets in the east, the German Empire in Europe. How will this world fair out? Join us and decide it&#39;s fate.
