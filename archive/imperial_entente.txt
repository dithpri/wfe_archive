Welcome to the 1950s.

Over 30 years ago, Germany and the Central Powers marched victorious through Europe. Their power remained unchallenged, until the Berlin Stock Market Crash in 1929, which resulted in significant economical and political change in Europe, including the rise of Soviet Russia. In the 30s, the two superpowers fought against each other in the Second Weltkreig, signing a white peace that resulted in the Cold War. Can you help decide this world&#39;s fate?
