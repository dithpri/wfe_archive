[b][i]The world as we knew it came to an end over 150 years ago, and the ruins of that world now rise again. This is Britannia&#39;s tale in the apocalypse.[/i][/b]
This RP takes place 175 years since the nuclear war in 1983 that nearly destroyed humanity as a whole. New peoples, nations and wars now come to the long fractured British Isles. Take your place within this post apocalyptic roleplay.
