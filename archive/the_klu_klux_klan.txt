The Ku Klux Klan (KKK), or simply the Klan, is the name of three distinct movements in the United States that have advocated extremist reactionary currents such as white supremacy, white nationalism, anti-immigration, and, especially in later iterations, Nordicism, anti-Catholicism, and antisemitism. Historically the KKK used terrorism, both physical assault and murder, against groups or individuals whom they opposed. All three movements have called for the &quot;purification&quot; of American society, and all are considered right-wing extremist organizations.
