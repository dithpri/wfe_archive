-Preamble-
Our region brings together nations who value at most space exploration and scientific advancement and thus - the technocratic political system.
Despite we came into existence for bringing together especially Semitic/Middle Eastern nations of Stars&amp;#39; Exploration Age, everyone who praises our dreams and goals is welcomed.


Interstellar Techno Semitic Union can also be called the Union or ITSU.

The sole official language of the Union is English (for practical reasons).

The official political system of the Union and its members is technocracy (including variations such as social-techocracy, technocratic monarchy, technocratic republic, scientocracy).


Because of ideological views and aims we remain in close ties with The Galactic Imperium
