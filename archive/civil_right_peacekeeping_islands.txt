The C.R.P.I is a peaceful region. It loves civil rights and may other rights. We refuse to use bombs and keep peace, but if we are attacked we have the right to attack. Also, if you go by me (Nedun) I might allow you to use bombs. 
The three laws:
1: You have to keep peace
2: Must have at least good civil rights 
3: You have to listen to the leader
