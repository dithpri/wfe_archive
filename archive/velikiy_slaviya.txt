[color=blue][b][i]Velikiy Slaviya is a Pan-Slavic region, whose community dates back to the earliest Pan-Slavic regions on NationStates. We have endured much since then, including betrayal and invasions, but it is no surprise that we have endured. We are Slavs, we live hard lives and always have, and neither traitors nor invaders will take our freedom. We will not be slaves.[/i][/b][/color]

[color=red][b][i]Velikiy Slaviya embraces the concepts of Free Speech, Free Thought, and Free Association. Your beliefs are your own and you will not be persecuted for them here. Only Nazis are unwelcome here, for their ideology is inherently anti-Slavic.[/i][/b][/color]
