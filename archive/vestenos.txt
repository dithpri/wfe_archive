The continent of Vestenos stretches a vast distance from the polar north to the desert lands of the Budanese Lords.

The Nine Kingdoms are a collection of former Kingdoms which covered most of the land of Vestenos. The Kingdoms were united near three hundred years ago in a bloody war which dragged out over three decades. Now, the Kingdoms work together under a single ruler - King Coniall Dochaan II. What were once the Nine Kingdoms have now been assembled into 9 Lordships, each ruled by a Lord who takes an oath of fealty to the King. The Lordships are free to govern themselves, so long as laws active in the Lordship do not contradict the King&amp;#39;s Laws.
