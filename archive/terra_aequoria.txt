[b]Today&#39;s date (Aequorian calendar)[/b]: [i]November 21, 6315[/i] [spoiler=Why 6315???]The Aequorian calendar diverges from the Gregorian calendar that most of the world uses. This is to justify the lore of the countries located inside of [region]Terra Aequoria[/region]. Why 6315? Instead of year 0 being set to the birth of Christ, year 0 is set to the beginning of civilization on Aequoria.[/spoiler]
