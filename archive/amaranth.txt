Wow! Another raid! That&#146;s two! 
One by [region]Joint Task Force[/region] and another by [region]The Black Hawks[/region]! Honestly guys, I&#146;m honored. I have recently been founding a ton of regions with old puppets from when I was cosmo, but this the only one that&#146;s been raided! Toodles!
