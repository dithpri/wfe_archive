A small, but hopefully expanding, region where you can pursue political ambitions, make stories and histories, and talk about your shared love of many different topics! Or, simply walk into one of our lovely coffee shops and sample a bite of our world-famous chocolate. 

Hey, y&#39;all, we hope to have some roleplay going on soon, but until then, please enjoy Amaranth, and telegram [nation]Carravere[/nation] if you need/want anything. For now, though, we just need to build up citizens so that we can build up our government and get some real stuff going on! 

[nation]Carravere[/nation] and [nation]Aeriance[/nation] are currently in the process of drafting our Constitution. If you want to have any input, please telegram [nation]Carravere[/nation], and hopefully soon we&#39;ll have something set up to discuss that easier.
