have you ever felt like you are being watched? Its because you are. High above in the realm of the sky The Watchtower of Silence stays. a small region in comparison to most, it&amp;#39;s people caring and knowledgeable, it&amp;#39;s landscape cold but plentiful. A place to live if you wish to meditate and reach enlightenment. The Soundless priests observe the current affairs in the world below, never interfering.
