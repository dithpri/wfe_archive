Founded on August 13, 2024, the A1BB is a place that is only open once per year on August 13 as a region to celebrate the NationStates anniversary of [nation]Simonia[/nation].

On days that are not August 13, this is Simonia&#146;s emergency bunker region and safe haven. In here, every day is a calm day and the climate is suitable for venting.

Embassies are allowed, but nobody will be able to join this region until August 13&#133;unless you bribe Simonia with cards and ask for entry.
