Welcome to the ASR, a bastion of free thought, democracy, and public ownership of the means of production.

Membership is subject to analysis by ASR officials at a moment&#39;s notice. After all, an assembly of socialist nations can&#39;t have a capitalist in our region.

Endorsement of the governor and WA Delegate are highly encouraged, but not required.
