Xin is a region that is split into two different camps, one of order and peace and the other is chaos and war.

Shen is the camp of Chaos and War, a desert wasteland where oases are scarce and agriculture is nearly impossible.  It is mostly industrial, and it is highly militarized.  Nations that are currently included here is [nation]M Sha n[/nation], [nation]Val Taire[/nation], and [nation]Grey Rock[/nation].

Lan is the camp of Order and Peace, a realm of water with islands sporadically placed.  Agriculture thrives here, as does industry, but there is not much of either, since oceans take up most of the realm.  There are currently no nations here yet.
