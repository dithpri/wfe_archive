Persim is a newly-discovered earthlike exoplanet that is the endemic home of the delicious and medicinally useful Persim Berry. The planet is slightly cooler and wetter than Earth, and its surface is about 60% water. Its axial tilt is only 5 degrees, meaning seasons are much less pronounced. The planet shares its system with Arelyk, a cold but somewhat habitable ocean world, Tash, a massive hydrogen-helium gas giant, and Kuaktat, a molten world that whips around the system&#39;s tiny sun every few hours.

Persim&#39;s unique environment has drawn a small colonization fever between startup nations, communes and corporations vying to take advantage of the planet&#39;s untapped natural resources.
