Starwars Roleplay Region is a Starwars Prequels Roleplay where people may choose to be characters which were a part of the Prequels Starwars series created by George Lucas -- as long as they aren&#39;t already taken, or dead (so no Qui Gon Jinn) -- or create their own characters, as there were over 10,000 Jedi -- as long as they don&#39;t contradict other characters. You can change how characters&#39; lives go as long as they do not fundamentally screw up anything. 

This Roleplay starts during the beginning of the Clone Wars, so pretty much immediately following episode II of the movies.
