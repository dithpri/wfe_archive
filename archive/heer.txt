This region was used as a base of operation by [region]the Greater German Reich[/region], although it seldom saw action. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

Soldiers of the Heer (German Army) will be &amp;quot;re-educated&amp;quot; - by which we mean, they will tour the liberated labor and death camps. Any who abandon Nazism will be allowed to join the forces of FJA. Certain others have been detained for possible crimes against humanity. The military equipment is being either donated to museums or added to FJA stocks.

[region]Heer[/region] will now fly the flag of the pre-war paramilitary force and resistance group [b][color=blue]Reichsbanner[/color] Schwarz-[color=red]Rot[/color]-[color=gold]Gold[/color][/b].
