TUEC. Built upon the wisdom, intelligence and intense labour of its past, this union is now among the safest Regions in its corner of the world.
Their clean water, infrastructure and literacy are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately they lack a little in fuel production and food production.

TUEC is a parliamentary union. There are a lot of opposing groups against the current leadership, but this is a fairly recent development.
However, the current greatest threat to the nation is the lack of members, but the current leadership is doing everything it can to solve this issue.
