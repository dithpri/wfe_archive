Hello! This is an English speaking region that will replicate a slightly more democratic form of the Medieval to 1700s Kingdom of France! Everything is a work in process, but feel free to move in and help out.

The regional forums are under construction. They can be found [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/The_French_Kingdom/index/]here.[/url]
