[b]Welcome to [region]Rmoefeller[/region].

This region is home to a former community that tried to use the World Assembly&#39;s Security Council to attempt to condemn the region of [region]Kami no Chickara[/region], the once home of the Divine Forces; which operated out of the [region]KNC Military Outpost[/region].[hr]

The community must have died as Rmoefeller now belongs to the [i]Warriors&#39; of [/i][region]Solitude[/region], the [i]military-wing[/i] of the region of [region]Audax[/region].
