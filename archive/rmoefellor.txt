[Region]The Black Hawks[/region] found that a tragedy had occurred tonight. [I]They had run out of chips and queso for the birthday party![/i] When news of this spread throughout the nest, a team of [color=blue]heroic hawks[/color] were assembled to raid the kitchens of countless regions in search of the snack. [hr][b]Funny enough, all of their efforts were in vain as [region]Rmeofellor[/region] doesn&#39;t have any chips, nor do we have queso. As always, thanks for the flag.[/b]
