NationStates region for the South Beloit Junior High Enrichment Group. All nation varieties are welcome, so run your nation how you choose but, be aware, your classmates will be able to see what you are doing. 

In this simulation, as you are building your nations, I want you to consider the complexities of building and running a nation. As you will see, there is no one easy way of running things and your priorities may make life difficult for your citizens. When making choices on issues, read each issue carefully and consider what potential consequences may arise from your choices.
