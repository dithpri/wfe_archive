Welcome to Aegys Prime, the most lawless terrestrial body in this part of the galaxy. Mad geniuses, crazed chemists, rogue corporations, mercenaries, outcasts and rebels. 

Traveller, seek your Utopian dream here. 

Aegys Prime is an idea I have for a world built from scratch by the players who inhabit it. This is definitely meant for those who are willing to roleplay. Im looking for a partner who can be an active part in the founding of this region.
