The Foundation is an anti-Liberal action group which focuses on fighting Liberal (with a big L) efforts.

We welcome all people on the political spectrum (except Liberals of course), with the inclusion of anti-Liberal communists and socialists as well as the centrists, conservatives, and rightists in general.

Our region is mostly autocratic, in that in order to maintain unity against the Liberal cause, a strong central authority is needed (aka Greater Bastion). However, the Foundation does have regular elections for people who wish to join the Foundation ranks.

Please, join our region, and you can help fight the Liberal cause, one step at a time!
