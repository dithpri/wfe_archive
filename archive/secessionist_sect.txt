The Sucessionist Sect. Was origionaly created to rebell against the Organization of Democracies, but the attemp failed as the Black Riders invaded them before us, then we figured out that our morals were wrong and started working on a last resort weapon, the Mushroom bomb, but luckely the Org. Dem. was able to recover without our help. Now we stand as a fallback region in case of another emergancy. If you are in the Org. Dem ask your WA Delegate. for the password to enter (the password will change after every disaster).
