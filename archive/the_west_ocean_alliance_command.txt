Founded after being openly humiliated by the Selyrian Empire at the Battle of Will&#39;s Point, the WOAC now serves as the semi-permanent governing organization of the WOA&#39;s combined armies. The WOAC is a purely optional defensive organization, and membership is not required to continue existence in the West Ocean. Governing the WOAC is a committee made up of delegates from each member nation&#39;s top generals. They determine the WOAC&#39;s military goals and policy during wars.
