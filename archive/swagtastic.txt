We take everyone, and all types of people. No haters aloud, though. We especially like you if you love and or like the  One Direction or Hunger Games series/movie.Also if you are fond of Olympians Michael Phelps and Tom Daley. If not, it&amp;#39;s okay, we still like you. Even if you were banned from another region, or you are a new person; we accept all people. It&amp;#39;s a fun safe, flexible region. We go with the flow, but bullying is unacceptable. We love to know what your thinking about, so feel free to post things on the region board. Plus we will NEVER ban you. Well, go on, don&amp;#39;t be shy, join Swagtastic already!!!
