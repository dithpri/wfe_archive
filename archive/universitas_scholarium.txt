The simplest point of this region is that it supports free thought. Nation&amp;#39;s who wish to have a true debate on discover, difference, progression, limited control, and actual support are welcome. 

Having said all that there are certain discussions that are not allowed in the forums. Debates always have constructive criticism, but insults, name-calling, or any other conversation designed to hurt another group is not allowed. As my nation&amp;#39;s motto says, &amp;quot;knowledge leads to success.&amp;quot; This region is hear to foster and inspire conversation among different groups to create something better than we currently have. 

If any of this resonates with you then we are fortunate to have you.
