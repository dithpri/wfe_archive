(Frequently referred to as SxkA)

Vastly wilderness, this is not just a region - It&amp;#39;s a planet. The few nations that dwell there speak Photonic - a language originating from Latin but over centuries morphed into its own language. Latin-speaking people will not understand Photonic. The planet is mostly of forest, with immense treelike arches, covered in photosynthetic, hairlike filaments that hide its bark and the tough wood within. Many creatures feed from these and smaller plants, and some animals on those. The bear was brought to SxkA in the early colonization and have spread freely, fitting into the ecosystem of the forests of SxkA
