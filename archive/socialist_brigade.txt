The Socialist Brigade was founded in 2015 by the Grand Duchy of Canade.

It is a group of Socialist states. Each state has equal representation in the Grand Assembly, the legislative body of the Socialist Brigade. Each member state must abide by the legislation it passes.

Member states have access to the Brigade&#39;s bank, providing monetary funds to struggling nations.
