Bcog, a religion of self-confidence, power, and survival. God gave everyone 8 tails, Man committed 8 sins, so God took away 8 tails, but Monkey gave up 7 tails to Man. Man committed 8 more sins, lost his tails and lost his fur. But the eight-tailed monkey was different-smarter. Man still committed his 16 sins, through time, but this monkey didn&#39;t help man at all. This monkey was called Bgoc, and lives to this day.
