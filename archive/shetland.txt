[b]Shetland[/b], also called the [b]Shetland Islands[/b], is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom.

The local way of life reflects the Scottish and Norse heritage of the isles, including the Up Helly Aa fire festival, and a strong musical tradition, especially the traditional fiddle style. The islands have produced a variety of writers of prose and poetry, often in the distinct Shetland dialect of Scots. There are numerous areas set aside to protect the local fauna and flora, including a number of important sea bird nesting sites.

The islands&#39; motto, [i]Me&eth; l&ouml;gum skal land byggja[/i], meaning &quot;By law shall land be built&quot;, is taken from the Danish 1241 Basic Law, [i]Codex Holmiensis[/i].
