It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Integrated Society of Equals. Our policy is simple: All nations are created equal and given the following privileges:

- All nations may vote.
- No nation shall be unfairly ejected from the Society.
- Gameplay is encouraged
- Everyone is granted to solely establish fantasy within their nation. One nation might include centaurs within their populace; another nation might not.

Thank you for joining The Integrated Society of Equals!
Sincerely, Dircya T. Rubino
