On Saturday June 5th, at 4:09 PM EST, Ronald Wilson Reagan went to join Nixon as Satan&amp;#39;s footstool in Hell. 

The &#147;grandfatherly&#148; Reagan obscenely celebrated in the American media was no grandfather to children in Nicaragua, where more than 50,000 people were killed in his terrorist &#147;Contra War&#148; against that nation&#146;s democratically elected government. And he was no grandfather to Mayan children in Guatemala, where more than 400 villages were wiped out and as many as 200,000 people killed in a Reagan-supported soft war. Then there were El Salvador and Apartheid South Africa&#151;murderous regimes supported by the Gipper.
