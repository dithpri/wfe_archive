The Black Sea is home to many nations fighting over the remnants of multiple collapsed empires. In the remnants, new nations arise, with states such as Kalishnikistan embracing totalitarian socialism, Eleutherica embracing full-hearted welfare liberalism, Pilsudskia rallying around military dictatorship, and Abramistan embracing a unique blend of liberal fiscal and social ideals with massive military spending, becoming known as the &quot;Arsenal of Black Sea Democracy&quot; by the international press. Can the Black Sea return to prominence? Or is it forever to be an unstable region of various warring states, a chess board in the fight of liberty versus tyranny, capitalism versus communism, and pacifism versus militarism?
