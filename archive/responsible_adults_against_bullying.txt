If you are a victim of bullying, listen to this inspirational song.

Stay strong.

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
And all those things I didn&#39;t say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I&#39;m alright song
My power&#39;s turned on
Starting right now I&#39;ll be strong
I&#39;ll play my fight song
And I don&#39;t really care if nobody else believes
&#39;Cause I&#39;ve still got a lot of fight left in me
