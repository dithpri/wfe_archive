A region of dictatorships that may or may not try to conceal themselves as democratic.
The regions name is based on a quote of a former German chancellor (not Merkel) who called Putin a &quot;lupenreiner Demokrat&quot; (flawless democrat) after which the term now has become a meme to describe dictatorships.

--- About the non-English tag ---
As the name and the above explanation suggest, this region was created by a non native English but German person. That means that I as this regions governor have no problem with people using other languages as English but also will not force anyone to use another language than English.
