A region of dictatorships that may or may not try to conceal themselves as democratic.
The regions name is based on a quote of a former German chancellor (not Merkel) who called Putin a &quot;lupenreiner Demokrat&quot; (flawless democrat) after which the term now has become a meme to describe dictatorships.
