[color=green][b]Claimed by the [/color][color=lightgreen]UDL Minor Operations Executive 2013a/b4 Board 4[/color][color=green]!  Huzzah![/b]

[b]Also helping were:[/b]
- The Black Squirrels!  Hurrah!  Back to their usual - no, get off that tree, stop it, stop it!
- The FRA.  Or members of the FRA.  There was an FRA flag somewhere.
- UDL Minor Operations Executive 2013a/b4 Board 3, who aren&amp;#39;t anywhere near as good as UDL Minor Operations Executive 2013a/b4 Board 4.[/color]

[b]Our Regional Demands:[/b]
1) Cake.  And cake that isn&amp;#39;t a damn lie.  Damn cake liars.
2) Christmas more often, but with less expense.  Free Christmas, essentially.
3) Cats.  The more cats you offer, the happier we&amp;#39;ll be, and the less likely to casually glare angrily at you.  But not eject you or anything.  Because that would be cruel.
