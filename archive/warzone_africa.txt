Financially well off individuals who love to hit balls while riding horses and wearing black should try polo. It is the
ultimate sport because you get to be close to horses and swing mallets and smash things.
Continuous galloping requires new horses to be used every quarter, which is why this sport is reserved for the wealthy. 
Kings and other upper class positions regularly play this sport as it is one of the few they can deign to play. 

The sport is known for its exhilarating play but so few people ever do try it. This may be
because horses are dumb and silly animals and few people would ever try to ride one or it could be because 
regular folk can&#146;t afford to play this sport
