[b][color=blue]Warzone Africa is now under the occupation of the RRA as ordered by the supreme Generalissimo, [nation=short]Frattastan II[/nation]![/color]

We had planned to take the region yesterday but Fratt had been distracted and left his troops to wonder what could have been until the The North Pacific gave us the opportunity to reclaim his honour. We thank them for the chance and wish them better luck next time!
 
The Rejected Realms would like to thank [region]Wintreath[/region], [region]The UDL[/region],[region] Global Right Alliance[/region], [region]the FRA[/region], [region]Jethnea[/region], [region]Nasicournia[/region], [region]Lazarus[/region], [region]San Francisco Bay Area[/region], [region]00000 A World Power[/region] and [region]Mordor[/region] for their assistance. This victory would not have been possible without every single one of you.
