Welcome to Warzone Africa. Take a seat on the beach, enjoy the breeze, and take in the sound of fighter jets dogfighting above.

This region is a protectorate of [region]Elparia[/region].

Thanks to [region]The Pacific[/region]&#39;s Legio Pacifica, [region]The North Pacific[/region]&#39;s North Pacific Army, [region]The East Pacific[/region]&#39;s Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army, and [nation]Benevolent Thomas[/nation] for their help in WZ Africa&#39;s liberation.

Fascism isn&#39;t our cup of tea.

Before asking for alliances/embassies, please read the WFE (this is ironic) and the RMB and be cognizant of your region&#39;s past, especially in relation to WZ Africa.
