[b]Warzone Africa is under the temporary control of the [region]Wintreath[/region] Hvitt Riddaral[/b]

On this day, the calvary of the Hvitt Riddaral charged into the region, for the purposes of training and organizing our forces. Our forces swept through the region, successfully completing the tasks ahead of them so they can be more proficient in future battles. Our forces are now merely passing through on the way to other battlefields, as is often the case in warzones. No harm to the region or its true natives is intended.
