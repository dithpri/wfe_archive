[b]Tonight,  the [u]Sekhmet Legion[/u] along with their friends in [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and waste decided to go out and discuss the most important of matters, such as why W is the best letter, random weeb stuff, and why pings are the absolute worst. [/color]

[color=#804040]They were so united in their thoughts on these topics that they began to go out raiding any region they could find that disagreed with them, which brought them to your region.
