The Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army has seized [region] Warzone Africa[/region]! Warzone Africa has been a gracious host of EPSA over the years and EPSA thought it was time for us to reunite with our favorite Warzone. The following soldiers appeared tonight:

[nation=short]Tano[/nation]
[nation=short]Xoriet[/nation]
[nation=short]Severisen[/nation]
[nation=short]Alterran Republic[/nation]
[nation=short]The Fourth Imperium[/nation]
[nation=short]Tim-Opolis[/nation]
[nation=short]Hobbesistan[/nation]
[nation=short]Bachtendekuppen[/nation]

[b]With allies like [region]The East Pacific[/region], who needs enemies?[/b]

Special thanks to the Spiritus Defense Force for their invaluable help.

All complaints are to be sent to General [nation=short]Xoriet[/nation] (or Lt. [nation=short]Tano[/nation] if you&amp;#39;re feeling particuarily masochist)
