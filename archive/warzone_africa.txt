[color=#00BFFF]And now a poem for your reading pleasure.

Sprawling savannah where man first sprung to his feet,
Shrugging off the sheer, cumbersome weight of the world,
Mother of the ample bosom where we nursed for eons
Until we gained the strength to crawl yawning into the swirl of continents.[/color]
