[b]The [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=967591]Joint Task Force[/url] of the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=967588]Augustin Alliance[/url] has elected to stop by your region for refreshments and a taste of the local cuisine. Though the Locusts and Grubs were a bit unusual, we gave them a try and they weren&#39;t half bad. Good source of protein, or so I&#39;m told; as you can see, the JTF is practical in both it&#39;s organization and it&#39;s tastes in food.[/b]
