[color=green]~~[b]Welcome to Warzone Africa[/b]~~[/color]

[color=green][i]Everyone is welcome to stop by and enjoy our rolling plains, our diamonds and metals, and to stop by to our war-torn towns and cities and remember the lives lost trying to defend this region, that has seen far to many invasions, far too many defenders making this region a jump point or military or even people desperate enough to make this beautiful region nothing but a billboard pointing to their own region. After what the people of Warzone Africa and all the other Warzones have been through, I believe that all residents of the Warzones should be left in peace forevermore.[/i]
