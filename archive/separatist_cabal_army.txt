You are a maggot. We are a giant. You are nothing, the lowest of creatures, not worthy to lick the heel of our boots. We are six disciplined regiments. We have been at war with the oppressive Republic of Arbiture for as long as we can remember and we wish to see its demise within weeks. 

Do not anger us.

Separatists Shall Rule!
