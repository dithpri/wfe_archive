If you have a nation that loves mayhem, arms, and possibly renting your armies out to the highest bidder we&amp;#39;re just the right place for you. We do love a good run in the General Assembly, although Breidr Breidsson tends to avoid bickering in the chambers. Renamis and Kalh Hallensbane, however, are more likely to show up to debate resolutions assuming time allows. Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to come around, we&amp;#39;d love to have another partner in crime.

Blood Bowl is alive and well in Reichtum! Check out the dispatch below to get information, and a breakdown of our teams. We&amp;#39;d love to have you!
