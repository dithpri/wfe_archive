Reichtum region in full support of militaristic armament, and economic prosperity. It is nothing but a ragtag coalition, thrown together to provide basic support for somewhat like-minded nations in the interest of defense and World Assembly voice. 

Delegate support for proposals is decided by a discussion held between member nations, and when requested by one or more nations can be decided via a public vote. For entry, please simply join. We are more than willing to welcome just about anybody.
