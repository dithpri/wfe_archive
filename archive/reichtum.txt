[b]Leading Nation:[/b] [color=red]The Empire of Hallensbane[/color]
[b]World Assembly Delegate:[/b] [color=blue]The Kingdom of Feigrland[/color]

Reichtum region in full support of militaristic armament, and economic prosperity. It is nothing but a ragtag coalition, thrown together to provide basic support for somewhat like-minded nations in the interest of defense and World Assembly voice. 

Reichtum places few restrictions on its member nations, content to let them handle their own national affairs.

Delegate support for proposals is decided by a discussion held between member nations, and when requested by one or more nations can be decided via a public vote.

For entry, please send a telegram to The Empire of Hallensbane. Their leader Renamis Hallensbane will be willing to process your request.
