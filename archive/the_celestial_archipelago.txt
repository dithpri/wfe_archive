The Celestial Archipelago is a remote and mystical geographical region with a rich and enchanting backstory. Legend has it that eons ago, this archipelago was not part of the physical world but existed in a parallel realm, suspended between the earthly and celestial planes. It was said to be the dwelling place of divine beings, ancient spirits, and mythical creatures, with a unique connection to the heavens.

The archipelago is made up of a cluster of small islands, each with its own distinctive features and magical properties. The skies above are often painted with vivid colors and the shimmering dance of the Northern Lights within the founding nation: The Northern Glacial Borderlands.
