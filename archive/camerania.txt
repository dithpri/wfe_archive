So, this is the end. After over 2 years of the good and the bad, the wars and the peace.

But now, for better or for worse, the region is dead. There is no life left. And there will be no coming back this time.

Unless...

You can do it, couldn&#39;t you? Could you be the one to bring Camerania back to glory? There is only one way to find out. Telegram me if you think that perhaps you could do it. I warn you, it will not be an easy job, but is it possible? It definitely is.

But until then, I will be waiting here, alone. I will keep my faithful position, and guard Camerania, keeping alive what memories still dwell.
