So, this is the end. After over 2 years of the good and the bad, the wars and the peace.

But now, for better or for worse, the region is dead. There is no life here. There is no hope hope here.

Camerania now stands as a reminder, as a monument, of all those regions that were once bursting with life, but are now cold and dead.

For every region born, countless others die. Yet I might still hold out hope that one day, Camerania might again have life.

But until then, I will be waiting here, alone. I will keep my faithful position, and guard Camerania, keeping alive what memories still dwell.
