[b][color=#ff0000]Attention![/color][/b]
Please [b]endorse[/b] the delegate, [nation=short]Kazmr[/nation] for the safety of the region and to ensure a democratic future for Lazarus.

Please also [b]endorse[/b] [nation=short]Courlany[/nation], [nation=short]Funkadelia[/nation], and [nation=short]Harmoneia[/nation] all longtime natives of Lazarus.

Additionally, [b]un[/b]endorse [nation=short]The Sweet Leaf[/nation].

The occupation of our home by forces from the New Pacific Order is now over, but many of their troops still remain. Any nation seen flying the [url=http://i.imgur.com/5MpRwSs.png]flag of the defeated occupiers[/url] should also be unendorsed.

To further help with the war effort and for the transition to democracy, please register on the [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/NSLazarus/index/]Lazarene Forum[/url].

We have begun discussions on a new democratic constitution for our region, but we can only reach that point with your help!
