Welcome to Lazarus, proud home of the [b][color=#ce1226]People&amp;#39;s Republic of Lazarus[/color][/b]!


We think that a powerful and vigorous movement is impossible without differences &#151; &amp;quot;true conformity&amp;quot; is possible only in a cemetery. We were once held to conform by the toxic status quo, but through the gains of the revolution our movement has led us out of the cemetery.


Please endorse Regent [b][nation=short]Stujenske[/nation][/b] and Vanguard [b][nation=short]Kazmr[/nation][/b] to help protect Lazarus from invaders and to increase our home region&amp;#39;s power in the World Assembly.
