Umrem ZaVse has a new flag due to the old flag discouraging new nations aswell as poorly representing our region. The new flag for the region is as seen. It supostto represent the little details of our region the chain represents the dictatorship (that the majority of the nation&#39;s in this region up hold), the grain within the chain circal represents the piece our nation&#39;s up hold between each other, the sun set represents the influence we have over our land, and finely the thing that looks like a black smudge is actually the continent that all of our nation&#39;s are located on (so its a made up continent). That is Umrem ZaVse&#39;s new flag.
