[b][color=#BF0000]WE ARE MANY BUT WE HAVE THE VOICE OF ONE
WE ARE LEGION
WE ARE COMING FOR YOU[/color][/b]

[b]We are a region based on S.M. Stirling&amp;#39;s depiction of his fictional state of &amp;quot;The Domination of the Draka&amp;quot; in the novels [i]Marching Through Georgia[/i], [i]Under the Yoke[/i], [i]The Stone Dogs[/i], and [i]Drakon[/i]; and the short story collection [i]Drakas![/i] We do not hold affiliation with Fascists or Nazis. We regard ALL OTHER sapient beings regardless of ethnicity or race as equally beneath us, and pursue a goal of total enslavement. The Nazis exterminated those which they found inferior. The Draka, on the other hand, are horrified by genocide... because we find it to be a horrifying waste of precious labor.[/b]
