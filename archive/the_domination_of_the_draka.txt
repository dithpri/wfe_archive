[b][color=#000080]Service to the State! 
Glory to the Race![/color]

[color=#BF0000]Others have conquered and ruled; we alone conquer for conquest&amp;#39;s sake, and dominate for no other purpose than Domination itself; the name we half-consciously chose for our state is no accident. We, and we alone, have spoken aloud the Great Secret: that the root function of all human society is the production and reproduction of power - and that power is the ability to compel others to do your will, against theirs. It is end, not means. The purpose of power is power. - Elvira Naldorssen[/color]
