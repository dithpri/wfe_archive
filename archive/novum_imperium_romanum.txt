Beyond the infinite reaches of the Omniverse lies a celestial realm, home to a true Omnipotent being and God-Empress of the realm. From her throne Caelistianya rules over her celestial domain with a iron fist in velvet gloves. As an omni-dimensional being, she exists simultaneously in all Verses as their local Supreme Being or Divine Spirit, under a wide variety of names, traits and appearances. All in union with a signal goal, extending the scope and power of her transcendent Empire across the Omniverse.
