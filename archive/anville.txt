[b][color=darkblue]According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that [CPL][nation]Inven[/nation] or [GEN][nation]9003[/nation]should be able to fly. Their wings are too small to get their fat little body off the ground. [CPL][nation]Inven[/nation] and [GEN][nation]9003[/nation], of course, fly anyway because they don&#39;t care what humans think is impossible.
