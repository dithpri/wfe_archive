New Mantasia is a region located in a geographically diverse area across the ocean from the former Mantasian Empire. Colonists settled here in order to escape the harsh and oppressive rule of the Mantasian Emperor, Edmund VII. After a bloody war of independence, the Stephanic Empire became the first independent nation in New Mantasia in 1666. Since then, New Mantasia has become a welcoming and friendly place that has diverged from the traditionally authoritarian and uninviting nature of the former Mantasian Empire.
