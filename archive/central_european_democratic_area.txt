The Central European Democratic Area is located at the heart of Europe. It is platform for the development of PEACE seeking, CAPITALIST and most importantly INCLUSIVE countries. 
This Region is directly linked to the EU as a domain from which negotiations are held. We need support from military experts as well as economic masters to grow and develop the region on a global scale, whilst respecting the needs of all peoples and cultures.
We therefore invite you to join the CEDA and help us create a powerful region!
