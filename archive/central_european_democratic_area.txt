The Central European Democratic Area is located at the heart of Europe. It is platform for the development of PEACE seeking, CAPITALIST and most importantly INCLUSIVE countries. 
We want to create a region which mirrors the real life EU whilst also creating a fun and amiable place to talk and discuss any and all topics. We need support from military experts as well as economic masters to grow and develop the region on a global scale, whilst respecting the needs of all peoples and cultures.
We therefore invite you to join the CEDA and help us create a powerful region!
