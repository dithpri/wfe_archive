A place for Pagans to meet and hang out.  Open to any and everyone, who are interested or already practicing.  Yet it is against my beliefs to set up a recruiting page, since it isn&amp;#39;t right to force religion onto someone.  And the possibility of karma dropping by for a little payback.  Active nations only, this is a hobby of mine, so I attend NS daily.

And lastly, no fighting or bickering, if I catch anyone trying to force someone to &amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; I will eject and ban you from this region.  Other than that, enjoy your stay.  Blessed be!
