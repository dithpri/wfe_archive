&amp;quot;Things look different now, without the Prophets&amp;#39; lies clouding my vision. I would like to see our own world, to know that it is safe.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Fear not, for we have made it so.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;By your word, Arbiter.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Take us home.&amp;quot;
&#151; Rtas &amp;#39;Vadum and Thel &amp;#39;Vadam.

Welcome to Sanghelios!
