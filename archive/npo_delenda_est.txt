[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]This region was previously an ancient trophy of [region]the Pacific[/region] and the NPO. It was dossiered since 2021. On 4/7/25, the state finally outlasted the holder of many NPO regions including this one, and they were all captured in one fell swoop. 

This region no longer stands as a testament to the failure of NPO Delenda Est, [i]but to the unrelenting persistence of the state - [b]no matter who the opposition is.[/b][/i][/color]
