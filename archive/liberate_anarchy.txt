Peoples of the World:

&quot;Every word that comes from a raider&#39;s mouth is a lie...&quot;

Calling upon all nations and regions [b]respecting peace, freedom, and self-determination[/b] to assist in defending [region]Anarchy[/region] -- a founderless region committed to those same great principles -- from raider incursion and occupation.

Regions willing to stand with [region]Anarchy[/region] in the defense of self-governance are invited to establish an embassy here in [region]Liberate Anarchy[/region]. Nations also heeding this call are invited to store WA Members here, in preparation for the next defense of liberty.

With an embassy network dedicated to mutual aid and defense, self-determination for [region]Anarchy[/region] and allies alike can be assured. 

Will [b][i]you[/i][/b] answer the call?
