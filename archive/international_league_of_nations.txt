Welcome to the [color=FADA0000]INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE OF NATIONS[/color]

The ILN is an international organization, dedicated to the defense and preservation of all member nations. Our guiding principle is the governance of peace and harmony; allowing those, by will or force, who aspire to invade any nation, a unified barrier to block their path. Any enemy, be they foreign or domestic, shall not endure. We stand united, in the defense of all nations.
