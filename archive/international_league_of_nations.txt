Welcome to the [color=FADA0000]INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE OF NATIONS[/color]

The ILN is an international organization, dedicated to the defense and preservation of all member nations. Our guiding principle is the governance of peace and harmony; allowing those, by will or force, who aspire to invade any nation, a unified barrier to block their path. Any enemy, be they foreign or domestic, shall not endure. We stand united, in the defense of all nations.

Those who seek peace, harmony &amp; balance... 
Those who seek honor in being the loyal opposition...
Those who seek to escape the fear of oppression...
Those who seek for their voice to no longer be silenced...
Those who seek the security and strength in numbers...

... all who seek such ideals need not seek further.
