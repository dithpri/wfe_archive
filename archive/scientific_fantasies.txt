 This is a region where all shall be free. Mentally.Physically. Politically. Economically. etc. The only limitation here is ones&#39; imagination and ones&#39; ability to justify. Yes, breed Jack&#39;s magical peas, if you can work out which genotype will make that  phenotype possible. Yes, create the philosopher&#39;s stone, so long as you can work out the theories behind a safe fusion reactor to make gold. Be free, but be rational.
