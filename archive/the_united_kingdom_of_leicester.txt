The UK is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy operating under the Westminster system, otherwise known as a &quot;democratic parliamentary monarchy&quot;. It is a centralised, unitary state wherein the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign. Parliament is made up of the elected House of Commons, the appointed House of Lords and the Crown (as personified by the monarch). The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses, but royal assent is required for a bill to become an act of parliament (that is, statute law).
