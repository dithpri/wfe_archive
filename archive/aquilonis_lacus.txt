The region of Aquilonis Lacus was formed after the splitting of Bellum Malleum. The founding members of the old Northern Alliance moved here to seek asylum from the lesser nations of the region, who the NA beat in a brutal war. 

If you wish to be a part of the region you must telegram one of the founders to request your entrance:
