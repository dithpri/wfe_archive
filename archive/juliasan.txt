[color=#ff3636]Hello!![/color] - [url=https://discord.gg/G4f9sgnwqC]Discord[/url]
This is Juliasan, ah - err, aspiring server! Formed on September 3rd, I hope to create a calming, kind, small and Democratic community! I hope to organize a government via Direct Democracy, with maybe some RP and hanging out! It&#39;s going to be a great time, and my first (serious) attempt to create a community.

Wish me luck!

As of this moment, we don&#39;t have a executive WA delegate, to prevent raiding, But if you could, Endorsing me until the community grows, where we could hold a election for WA delegate, would be much appreciated.
