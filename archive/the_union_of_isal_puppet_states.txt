[b][u][color=red]Welcome to the Home of the ISAL![/b][/u][/color]

We are a small, new region used as a gathering point and community hub for the [color=blue]International Socialist Alliance League[/color] or the ISAL for short. The alliance initially began as a group in [region]10000 Islands[/region], but very quickly but became a region. 

This is a community of socialist-esque states. We accept anyone from quasi-socialist to communist to downright fascist. To enter, simply ping [nation]Eastbrook-Charlotte[/nation] or [nation]State Saleswing 1a[/nation], our two chairmen, a telegram before joining! We are always open for new members!

[i][color=green]Be sure to join soon! In a month we add a password![/i][/color]
