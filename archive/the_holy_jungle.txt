Sorry, guys. ([nation=short]Antiochus_Denral[/nation], [nation=short]Jakker[/nation], [nation=short]Moneyness[/nation], [nation=short]Hired Contractor_IV[/nation], [nation=short]Serboro[/nation], [nation=short]Astravars[/nation], and [nation=short]Mordvinland[/nation])

Just because [nation=NationHelper] and [nation=Monkeyss] CTEd, does [b][u]NOT[/b][/u] mean I don&#39;t play NS. NationHelper was NEVER my main, and neither was this nation. Its impressive that it went for twenty days unnoticed, though. 

Good luck raiding, and godspeed.
