[b]WELCOME TO THE TROUT ESSEMBLY[/b]


[b]GENERAL TROUT KNOWLEDGE[/b]
The Trout Essembly is a loose coalition of nations generally dedicated to preventing the outbreak of genocidal wars and the rise of nations who might disrupt the status quo. Founded by Aviary following the great Aviaryian-Weavenian war, Weaven and Aviary were long-standing powers up until their nations&#39; deceasing.
Yaklanavia has since become the Essembly&#39;s premier power, due to the delegate crises.

[b][color=skyblue]Why &quot;Trout&quot; was chosen is mostly up to interpretation, but it may have something to do with the fish&#39;s abundance in local waterways.[/color]
