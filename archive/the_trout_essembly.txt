The Trout Essembly is a loose coalition of nations generally dedicated to preventing the outbreak of genocidal wars and the rise of nations who might disrupt the status quo. Founded by the Dictatorship of Aviary, the Hyper Space Combine of Weaven has since come to dominate the Essembly, though the rising powers of Drenth islands and Pravakia have caused somewhat of a cold war within its ranks. Despite this, peace prevails, and the status quo remains.

Why &quot;Trout&quot; was chosen is mostly up to interpretation, but it may have something to do with the fish&#39;s abundance in local waterways.
