[hr][color=01010e]Butterflies many fly away, sea of clouds, they bob like sove waves
Drops of sweat splash about, far far away they wander to play[/color]
[color=e69500]Each gust of wind becomes a wave, to each of their sides a tree
As if the world is their they cause mischief before going up to the blue sky
Metallic skies how they depress, the leaves and leaves, they tangle up in the wind
The rice of the paddies raise their heads, among themselves shoving[/color]
[color=b70401]and falling inky clouds gather by the heard, wind become tyrannic
Drops of rain fall, thunder and lightning are cast
