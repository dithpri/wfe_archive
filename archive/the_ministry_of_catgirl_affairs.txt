The Ministry of Catgirl Affairs operates as an international organization, ensuring the welfare of catgirls on a global scale. The International Office has primary responsibility for policy formulation and budget allocation within major program areas, while the National Offices have primary responsibility for implementation of these policies and management of field operations within their respective nations. This organizational structure allows us to address issues effectively on an international level, as well as work effectively with a variety of partners, including national governments, international agencies, and nongovernmental organizations.
