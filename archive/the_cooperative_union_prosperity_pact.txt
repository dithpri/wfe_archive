[b][u]The Cooperative Union Prosperity Pact[/u][/b]

The Cooperative Union Prosperity Pact was created during the fall of November as a method to strengthen international diplomacy and to facilitate comradery, defense, and common interests of other like-minded states. As the official Pact has no official political orientation, many different types of states are welcome to partake within the Pact towards our common goal: To aid in the destruction of fascism.
