[b]Welcome to The Cooperative Union Prosperity Pact.
[/b]
We follow the revolutionary ideals of Red Thought, created during the third cultural revolution within East Chirea, and set forth the principles to our comrades abroad.

We remain neutral in all WA affairs and are open to diplomacy. We do not oppose nor endorse other ideologies. We strive for peace and prosperity.

We stand guard under the Red Banner of Freedom against the winds of western encroachment, serving comrades who cannot serve themselves.

[u]&quot;We must have faith in the masses and we must have faith in the Party. These are two cardinal principles. If we doubt these principles, we shall accomplish nothing.&quot;
