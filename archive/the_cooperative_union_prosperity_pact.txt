[b]Welcome to The Cooperative Union Prosperity Pact.
[/b]
Instituted during the third cultural revolution within East Chirea, this pact aims to improve diplomatic relations, trade agreements, and comradeship!

Defend against the wolves of western aggression, treasonous monarchies, treasonous fascists, and treasonous imperialism!

We stand guard under the Red Banner of Freedom against the winds of western encroachment, serving comrades who cannot serve themselves.

[u]&quot;We must have faith in the masses and we must have faith in the Party. These are two cardinal principles. If we doubt these principles, we shall accomplish nothing.&quot;
