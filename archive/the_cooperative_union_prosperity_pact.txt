[b]Welcome to The Cooperative Union Prosperity Pact.
[/b]
We, the six founders, set forth the standards of the rising ideals of Red Thought, created during the third cultural revolution within East Chirea, and set forth the principles to our comrades abroad.

Death to those who endorse bourgeois decadence, imperialism, monarchies, and fascists! Long live the working class and the Party!

We stand guard under the Red Banner of Freedom against the winds of western aggression, serving those who cannot serve themselves.

[u]&quot;We must have faith in the masses and we must have faith in the Party. These are two cardinal principles. If we doubt these principles, we shall accomplish nothing.&quot;
