We, the... erm, [i][*checks notes*][/i], &#39;[i]viscously[/i] mocked&#39;, [b][i]&#39;stinkypoo&#39;[/i][/b] raiders from [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] have come to enlighten you of the joys of raiding. Our first decree as the legal representatives of the World Assembly in this humble region is to immediately and absolutely outlaw all instances of [i]&#39;poopyposting&#39;[/i]. Any [i]&#39;jokeypoo&#39;[/i]s are hereby forbidden under pain of permanent ejection. Thank you.

As newly-promoted Honourable Wolves, you&#39;re welcome to express your gratitude in our [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]chat[/url]! If you would not like to do so, please state so on the Regional Message Board. This helps us keep track of how we are regarded. After all, the only negative reviews we&#39;ve ever had were from nations from the Rejected Realms.[hr]
