[color=#00BFFF]The United Islands of the Atlantic, or UIA, is a chill/chat/location role playing region. Meaning, there&#39;s not a plot or nation requirements. If you plan on coming here, I implore you to please practice common sense, good grammar, and follow the rules. So if you&#39;re not the best at RP, I&#39;d recommend you don&#39;t come here. We don&#39;t want you, as harsh as that sounds. Otherwise, join feel free to [url=]jump right in[/url]. 

We have a weekly theme starting on Mondays, ending Thursdays.[/color]
