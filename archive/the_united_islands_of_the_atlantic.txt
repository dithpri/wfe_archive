Wanna watch the world crumble? Crumble the last cookie in front of a fat kid at a fat kid camp. Crumble it into a fire. That way, you can watch that fat kids&#39; world crumble, [i][b]and[/b][/i] burn. It&#39;s a two for one!

So, what can &quot;UIA&quot; offer you? No idea. Maybe an RPing experience? Maybe helpful tips, pointers, and info? Maybe an alliance? Raiding? Defending? TACO MONDAYS?!? 

Neigh, RP. And tips. And maybe Taco Mondays. Taco Mondays make Mondays better. 

A &quot;continuation&quot; (kinda) of the National Hangout thread, UIA has been turned into an RP region. Puppets are welcome. 

UIA is a &quot;chill&quot; type RP region, so just jump in. There&#39;s no plot or story.
