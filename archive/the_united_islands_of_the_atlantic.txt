Wanna watch the world burn? Make a scale model of the earth then you pyro. 

So, what can &quot;UIA&quot; offer you? No idea. Maybe an RPing experience? Maybe helpful tips, pointers, and info? Maybe an alliance? Raiding? Defending? TACO MONDAYS?!?

Neigh, RP. And tips. And maybe Taco Mondays. 

A &quot;continuation&quot; of the National Hangout thread, UIA has been turned into an RP region. Puppets are welcome. 

There will be no password. 

Rules and such are in [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=645215]this[/url] Dispatch. [b]Read them before posting.[/b]
