Wanna watch the world burn? Make a scale model of the earth then you pyro. 

So, what can &quot;UIA&quot; offer you? No idea. Maybe an RPing experience? Maybe helpful tips, pointers, and info? Maybe an alliance? Raiding? Defending? TACO MONDAYS?!?

Neigh, RP. And tips. And maybe Taco Mondays. 

A &quot;continuation&quot; of the National Hangout thread, UIA has been turned into an RP region. Puppets are welcome. 

Ask [nation]UIJ[/nation] for the password. I will change it every Wednesday. (Starting June 8th, 2016)
