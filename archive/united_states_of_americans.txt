Message from the Founder:

&quot;I encourage all current Americans to assist the United States in welcoming our visiting international guests. Help them see the beauty and wonder in your hometown, your state capital or your favorite American attraction. Consider pitching in to spruce up the public lands and waterways in your area or be a &#147;voluntourist&#148; and lead nature hikes or birding quests. You can also visit a museum or historic house. Get out a map and see what you can experience for yourself within a day&#146;s drive of your house!

Enjoy all that America has to offer. Celebrate our nation&#146;s great places, great spaces, and great faces. Discover this land like never before.&quot;[hr]
