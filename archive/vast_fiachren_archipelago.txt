The Vast Fiachren Archipelago is an expansive island chain adjacent to the South Pacific region.  The founding nation, Fiachton, spans the entirety of the third largest island in the region.  The nations found in the Fiachren Archipelago tend to be highly armed, conservative nations that welcome immigrants from other nations, as well as hopeful nation founders with open arms so long as they at least loosely align with the ideals of Fiachton.
