[Color=orange]Halloweentown[/color] is a simple region, with a simple purpose: to provide shelter to our [color=green]zombie[/color] comrades during the annual [color=red][b]ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE[/color][/b]. Come here to plan assaults, launch said assaults, get re-infected, and just hang out!

And it should go without saying that Cure or Kill nations will either be banned or infected. Possibly both, in a flexible order. You have been warned.

[I]This Region is the Property of [nation]Lavan Tiri[/nation]. All trespassers will be bitten. Repeatedly.[/i]
