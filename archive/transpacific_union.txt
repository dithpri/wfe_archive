This flourishing region is located throughout the pacific ocean. Any nations can apply to join the Transpacific Union, but are recommended to be Liberal nations, although not required. Please endorse The Dissant Machine Empire, your WA delegate, so that they can continue to practically run this region.

[b]Law[/b]
We will make laws through an official forum our founder, Cyconia, will soon create. Nations get 1 vote for every 100 million people they have, and they start with 1 default vote. Laws can be presented by nations with at least 200 million residents. The laws must be reasonable, and be officially made and concur with already passed laws (Unless you are trying to repeal a law). Voting lasts 4 days. 

Government details will soon be up
