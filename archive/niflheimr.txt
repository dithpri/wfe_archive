Niflheimr is a small collection of frozen and half frozen islands located in the north of the world. Inhabited by Norse settlers who escaped the spread of Christianity in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, Niflheimr is in the unusual position of valuing both personal freedoms and religious unity.
