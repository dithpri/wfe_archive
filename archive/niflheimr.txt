In Norse cosmology, Niflheim or Niflheimr is a location which sometimes overlaps with the notions of Niflhel and Hel. Niflheim was primarily a realm of primordial ice and cold, with the frozen rivers of &Eacute;liv&aacute;gar and the well of Hvergelmir, from which come all the rivers. According to Gylfaginning, Niflheim was the second of the two primordial realms to emanate out of Ginnungagap, the other one being Muspelheim, the realm of fire. Between these two realms of cold and heat, creation began when its waters mixed with the heat of Muspelheim to form a &quot;creating steam&quot;. Later, it became the abode of Hel, a goddess daughter of Loki, and the afterlife for her subjects, those who did not die a heroic or notable death.
