The year is 3040 and the Inner Sphere is divided into numerous governments. Political tensions are always high and warfare breaks out regulalrly. Immense Jumpships carrying Dropships transport armies to their destinations. Aerospace fighters provide escort and planetary bombardments. Tanks and Longtoms protect cities. But one unit among all these are the true Battlemasters. The ones that every world wants...no needs. The Battlemech. Mechwarrior pilots are the heroes...and the villains. This is Battletech and you...are the one every world needs.
