An alliance formed between many unlikely nations, Deathwatch occasionally wars upon itself, when there is a need for such things, but will band together to crush any outside threat.

The nations of Deathwatch banded together originally to try and understand each others&#39; methods of government better. When that didn&#39;t work out, they stayed together for mutual safety purposes. This alliance will tolerate no threats towards any of its member nations and will launch preemptive strikes, if necessary.
