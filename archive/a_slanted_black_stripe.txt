[b]This is not the real A Slanted Black Stripe.[/b]

In the later months of 2008, [region]The East Pacific[/region] was occupied by the Empire for a staggering four months. It was during this period that a relatively unknown person named A Slanted Black Stripe rose to the Delegacy and liberated the region from shackles of tyranny. Since then, [region]The East Pacific[/region] has thrived as one of the most vibrant feeders. Although the original nation cease to exist, we honor a memorial behind this liberator.

This memorial is not associated nor affiliated with [region]The East Pacific[/region].
