 Our Union was formed after the Great War, when we declared our borders separate from those of traditional New Dixie.  North New Dixieans are a strong people, who live with in strong borders. Our military might is unmatched. We allow a range of governments. We come from Southern roots, our forefathers died to protect this land, it is our duty to guard it with our lives. The UFNND stands for law and order, strong borders, and a strong national identity. We stand up for Christian values and we are militant when we need to be. Our main territory is North New Dixie, but our military is mainly funded through our mining operations in the Mountain Region of the FNND. We do not allow radical leftist ideology, nor atheism, nor homosexuality.
