[b]Congratulations!!![/b]

[color=630077][i]You have been invaded by the lovely and only slightly evil rogues from [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] and [region]The Black Hawks[/region]! This makes you (by default!) honorary wolves. Short of joining Lone Wolves United, this is the highest status you will ever achieve! That, naturally, requires a party. You can come celebrate this promotion with us in our [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]chat[/url]![/i][/color]
