The reformed Holy Order Alliance, to which religion shall not be the determining factor.
Those who join our Confederacy will receive: 

1. Occasional memes
2. Support of Calum
3. Voice in regional policy

These are just the beginnings of what we can develop as an alliance, to which I look forward to future debate/discussion.
