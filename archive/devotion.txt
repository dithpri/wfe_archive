People generally fall into two categories; the living, and the dead. Unfortunately my associate here is going to force you out of the former for a brief ten to fifteen excruciating minutes whence I will put you into the latter. This is however, assuming you are uncooperative which I most definitely hope you are. So please, don&#39;t tell me what I want to know, I would much rather ask your corpse.
