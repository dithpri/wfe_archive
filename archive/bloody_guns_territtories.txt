A strange place. These lands are of all climates and  peoples. The Nations here don&amp;#39;t care about what the rest of what the world thinks as the world is constantly invaded by the Territories. In these lands....drums beat, armies march, and children become weapons of War. In these lands...invaders die for naught as these lands are actually banned together as one, even if they don&amp;#39;t show it. In these lands....a defense force comprised of contributions from all the militaries defend this place to its dying breath. Even the Legion of the Dead (made up of glory blazers and &amp;quot;one last&amp;quot; fighters) charge recklessly casting fear into all. These are the Territories, fiercely independent, isolationists (except the Shinobi), and finally Warriors.
