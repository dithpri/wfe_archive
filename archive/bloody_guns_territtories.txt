The Territories have always been a dark and dangerous place. Tales of this rather Savage Land and its inhabitants only add to it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;colorful&amp;quot; charm and mysteries. In this place, drums beat, war is raged, and only those who live here survive. Here is where entire Empires have fallen in failed conquest. Here independent and always warlike nations thrive through survival and extreme militarization. This is the Heart of Warriors and True Survivors. Outsiders Beware&amp;amp;#128128;
