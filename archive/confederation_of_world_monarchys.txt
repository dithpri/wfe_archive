During the 21st centaury, a pandemic broke out. The nations of the world did what they could to contain it, but every time it slowed, it came back stronger than before. Eventually, there was so much damage and chaos that nations began to collapse, and eventually the world order fell apart. Decades of anarchy left the world in ruins. Eventually the virus died out, but the damage was done. Now, the new nations of the world will shape the boundaries, and the future.
