All alien Aliens have strangely perished. No one is sure on what happened, all that is known is it definitely happened. Seems that a large portion pf the region gave this occurance no special mind. We have yet to see how other countires will react. 

Repeat: All unknown aliens are irrevocably dead. Some care; some don&amp;#39;t. What will happen next

(if this goes well, I may reverse these events and have it written off as non canon, but for now pretend it is)
