A time of still change has echoed through the lands, where doubt and confusion pervades the world at large. Many are disillusioned by the petty war wrought upon the land by mortal hands, and uneasy alliances in shambles.

The people are at unrest  with many dreaming of a simpler time, and others dreading that it may already be too late. Masses yell for change and revolt like the deafening screams of a locomotion, while even louder tears flow by as they are caught in the tracks.

This is the Era of Silence, where an unspoken word means a thousand, where the quiet reverberates with unmatched intensity, for this is how the world ends; Not with a bang, but with a whisper.
