[b]House of Jagielon[/b][hr]

The House of Jagielon was formed in 1327 when Boguslaw I took the throne of the Duchy of Welsborg, the Principality of Upper Abot and the Kingdom of Yokenshire. After several centures of royal marriages, the House of Jagielon got to rule a wider area. Finally, Welsborg, Upper Abot and Yokenshire united to form the Jagielonian Confederation with the rest of the territories ruled by Jagielonians becoming vassals of the Confederation (1806 A.D).
