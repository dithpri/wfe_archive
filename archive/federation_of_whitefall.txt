A once proud and expansive empire that collapsed resulting from cultural and religious tensions between imperial provinces.  The empire is still nominally preserved due to some last-minute legislation creating the &#39;Federation of Whitefall&#39;. Each province has become independent, each one becoming host to varying forms of government, and federal elections are a gateway into the more prestigious realm of federal politics, despite the increasing irrelevance of the original empire.
