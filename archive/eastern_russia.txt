russia fell into a 2nd civil war which pitted the western side of russia with the eastern side of russia. after the war the eastern side of russia prospered, while the western side fell into a post apocolyptic wasteland. a group of vandals called the remorhez who seem to be an authority in the wasteland of western russia. the eastern side on the otherhand turned to a new country that was forged from the ruble of the once great nation of russia.this new eastern country is called petranovia. petranovia is an economic paradise, unlike its western counter part. the remhorez are known as a somewhat terrorist organization, as the taliban are to the U.S.A. eastern russia will hopefully regain the former power of the old country of russia.
