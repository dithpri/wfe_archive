[b]Welcome to the OLLCA,[/b]
[b]The OLLCA a region that houses and is run by students. Its community is very open minded and diverse.
the OLLCA is well known for its subpar and overpriced Cafeteria food that is always a hit or miss with the students.
it was founded by a tall bell and a handsome arch that made Mr. Archbell a tall handsome boi that showed the nations that were formed in his region the ways of success, until one day he suddenly disappeared without a trace leaving his loving nations to pick up where he left off and work together to make a better place whilst other nations became anarchist

Please enjoy your stay and remember to wear your uniform!![/b]
