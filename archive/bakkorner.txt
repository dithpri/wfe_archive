Welcome to Bakkorner. This region is a democratic one, meaning that most regional policy must be voted in by a majority in a poll. Every week, at least one regional policy will be voted on. Any nation is welcome (unless they are a raider), but please do not insult anybody&amp;#39;s religious belief.  This region was founded by [Nation]Fosfjapias[/Nation], Randocimity, and [Nation]Panthera Corpus Nix[/Nation]. [nation]Bakkorner Preserver[/nation] is a computer program which was created last Halloween to keep the region alive while we fled to a vaccinated one.
