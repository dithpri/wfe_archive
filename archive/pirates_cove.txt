[b]Ahoy Ye Mates! Share a bottle &#39;o rum all &#39;round, yo ho and shiver me timbers![/b]

Aye, ye have reached the finish line of Stage One of The Equilism Great Race 2016.  Congratulations Racers!  A round of Spiced Crimson Rum for all. *taps keg*

[color=red][i]The final scores of Stage One will be tallied after major update, and as you begin Stage Two.  It&#39;s a bit different from here on.  A simple three region elimination race.  But the process is all the same. Except after your next region, only the top ten racers will continue to the second region, and only the top five to the final region.[/i][/color]

Aye mateys, the Stage One winners awards, and the regional trophy are on the line here in [region]Pirates Cove[/region].
