The Unified Countries Democratic Assembly is a Democratic Assembly of which cares for equal voting power, The WA Delegate has the same amount of power as any other resident here. The Unified Countries Democratic Assembly is a parody of the IRL international voting entity of which forced the one god, Max Barry, to remove the Bureaucracy That Shall Not Be Named (but sounded a lot like &#145;United Stations&#146; (I read the lore, NS has lore)), BUT NEITHER SUPPORT NOR IS ENDORSED BY THE BUREAUCRACY THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED. All are allowed to vote, except puppets of you nation here, as we are like the WA, but a separate entity. If this disappears and is reformed, keep in mind that the reformed one is a falsey*.

Falsey = fake.
