Nobody actually knows where exactly Somewhere Else Entirely is. There are no maps of it and GPS and the like stops working in it. For this reason, only a nation as dysfunctional as the Earldom of South Ballygowan could discover it.

Somewhere Else Entirely has no rhyme or reason to the distribution of its biomes. They just start and end for no reason, like in Minecraft where things like the water cycle don&#146;t exist.

Somewhere Else Entirely has no political agenda, because the Earl of South Ballygowan is confident nobody else will ever find their way to it.
