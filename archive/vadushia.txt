Hey! We are the Mighty Region of Varushia! To the SE We got the Kanto and Johto Regions, and to the SW We have Hoenn, Novae Island, Orre and The Land of Ooo. So here&amp;#39;s how it works. The Countries in the NW are Kingdoms, Countries in the East (Not including Kanto and Slavistan) and NE are Communist, Countries to the West are Republics, and Countries in the South are Other Nations. Ooo is a Kingdom, but is in the South Portion of the region, so it breaks the Rules of Placements.
Nations: Hungaria-Bohemia (Kingdom)
