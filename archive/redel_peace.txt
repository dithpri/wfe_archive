[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] heard a steaming whistle from some regions and decided to check it out. As it turns out, the sound brought them to an abandoned tea kettle full of boiling water. Luckily, the Hawks always have tea leaves on them so they were able to brew their own tea with the water while tossing the remains at some regions.
