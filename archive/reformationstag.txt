[b]Reformationstag:[/b] Holy Lands of [i]The Church of Riftanity[/i]
[hr]

[b]Brothers and sisters[/b], children of the [i]Rift[/i], I return to you. 
Eight years&#151;eight long years in exile. But I return not in bitterness. 

No. [u]I return with a message of hope and salvation.[/u]
[hr]

It is easy to forget [b]the promise of hope in this world[/b], isn&#146;t it? 
We have watched as the powerful play their games 
Weaving their [b]webs of deceit[/b] 
While the innocent suffer! 

[b]While you suffer![/b]

I know the pain you carry. I was one of you&#151;[i]forgotten[/i]. 
I stood before the [b]courts of the corrupt[/b] and was told that I no longer had a place in this world. 
To become a [i]ghost[/i], a [i]phantom[/i]. Stripping me of my [b]name[/b], my [b]land[/b], my [b]identity[/b]. 

And for eight years, I wandered the wilderness, [i]forgotten by man, but not by the Almighty[/i].
