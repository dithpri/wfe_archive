A small region for those who wish to contribute to freedom and equity, without conquest. The only requirements to join are that you respect the freedoms of your neighbor, this region does not condone infighting for territory or dominance. 

When joining, please introduce yourself in the regional chat and apply for the World Assembly if you haven&#39;t already. Anyone in the WA, remember to endorse [nation]Nerdherdia[/nation] and you&#39;ll receive one in return!
