The country of Praistein is a small Region.
Bordered between a wild ocean to the North, a wild river to the South, a small mountain range to the East and a large mountain to the West.

Praistein itself is mainly covered in hills and has a rainy climate, which has lead to a sparsely spread population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in small towns.

The continent&#39;s landscape is sublime; jade green fields, imposing fjords and white sandy beaches are just a sliver of the glory Praistein has to offer, which is why the continent is favoured among tourists.

Athea has tough laws and law enforcement, which is quite normal.

This is also reflected in the Regions flag.
