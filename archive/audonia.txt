Audonia is a rich area of natural beauty and weather, and values human rights above the petty demands of government. Despite this, the current state of the economy remains strong. Since I want this to become an RP region, people will have the rights to hold positions in the regional government (The Audonian Coalition) depending on endorsements (surely speaking, we have a cap of 65).

Chancellor: N/A
Chief of Exchequer: N/A
