Many moons ago this was the site of a rebellion against [region]Global Alliance[/region]. It was led by [nation]Skako[/nation] who was unhappy about the governance of the GA. Eventually both sides were able to conclude negotiations over the matter and reconciled. 

This region stands as monument to those times and how they became peacefully resolved.
Despite claims of [region]The Commonwealth of Crowns[/region] on this region it will remain a free and open monument for all.
