Siberia (/sa&amp;#618;&amp;#712;b&amp;#618;&amp;#601;ri&amp;#601;/ seye-BEER-ee-&amp;#601;; Russian: &amp;#1057;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1073;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1100;, tr. Sibir&#39;, IPA: [s&amp;#690;&amp;#618;&amp;#712;b&amp;#690;ir&amp;#690;] (listen)) is an extensive geographical region, constituting all of North Asia, from the Ural Mountains in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east.[2] It has been a part of Russia since the latter half of the 16th century, after the Russians conquered lands east of the Ural Mountains. Siberia is vast and sparsely populated, covering an area of over 13.1 million square kilometres (5,100,000 sq mi), but home to merely one-fifth of Russia&#39;s population. Novosibirsk and Omsk are the largest cities in the region.
