Novus Orbis - New World

Nearly 20 years after the war the world is alive again.

In the year 2020 the global thermonuclear war started and lasted only an hour.
World was decimated but bombs didn&#39;t hit Europe and Russia.
Now in 2040 new nations prosper.

European Federation created out of EU.
Slav Republic made out of Slavic nations that survived.
Scandinavia which is a combination of old norse countries

These are 3 main players in the known world.

Life is hard. It&#39;s not easy. But it&#39;s the only way to survive.
Atomic winter is at it&#39;s peak and tension is raising.
Who will survive ?
