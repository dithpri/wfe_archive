The parties of this convention hereby,

Acknowledge the Democratic Republic of Deadlock as the founding state of Chord. Fraser and all his heirs are to be regarded as founding father and supreme overlord - and are to be addressed as such.

Acknowledge Chord as as breeding ground for people from all sides of the spectrum (&amp;#937;). 

Affirm that rules of customary international TP law will continue to govern questions not regulated by the provisions of the present Chord Convention (CC).

All nations under Chord are to hold the utmost respect for the principles of tolerance, diversity, liberty and sick jukes.
