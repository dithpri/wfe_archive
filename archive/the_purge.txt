[color=red]The &amp;quot;New Founding Fathers of America&amp;quot; [/color]

[color=black]Which took over following an economic collapse and instituted totalitarian rule, has established one night a year -called &amp;quot;the Purge&amp;quot; [/color]

[color=red]In which all crime is legal and all police, fire and medical emergency services remain unavailable for 12 hours, from 7 pm till 7 am the next day.[/color]

[color=black]The purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy.[/color]

[color=red]Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, in reality, it is used as a method of artificial population control, as the people living in poor areas are usually the main targets.[/color]


[color=orange]&amp;quot;Blessed be the New Founding Fathers for letting us Purge and cleanse our souls, Blessed be America, a nation reborn.&amp;quot;[/color]
