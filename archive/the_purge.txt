Oh noes! The Purge has attracted the moderators&#39; attention! 

Chelsea Football Club Fans has been warned for putting up inappropriate content for the flag/WFE, and on top of that, was discovered to be operating multiple WA nations, which is clearly against the site rules. So they&#39;ve been kicked out of the WA!

Also, the WFE/flag have been cleared, too.
