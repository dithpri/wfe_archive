Tetsu Ryouiki or &quot;The Iron Realms&quot; is a large isolated island chain in the middle of nowhere, most likely the remains of an ancient continent that has sank. Tetsu Ryouiki is host to many unique cultures and abundant natural resources, mostly polluted from the corporations from the developed nations on the islands.
