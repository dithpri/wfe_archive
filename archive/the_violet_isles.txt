The Violet Isles are a northern group of islands where the religion of Flemingoviaism is more prominent than anywhere else in Osiris, due to the close proximity to The North Pacific. These isles were dedicated to the service of Detective Figs, first Empress of Osiris. 

Formerly a territory of [b][region]Osiris[/region][/b] under the Fraternal Order, this region has since been incorporated as a subsidiary of the [b][region]Trade Federation[/region][/b].
