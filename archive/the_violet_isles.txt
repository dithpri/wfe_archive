[i]Territory of the Fraternal Order of Osiris[/i]

The Violet Isles are a northern group of Islands and are an overseas dominion from Osiris, where the religion of Flemingoviaism is more prominent than anywhere else in [B][region]Osiris[/region][/B], due to the close proximity to [B][region]The North Pacific[/region][/b].

These isles are dedicated to the service of Detective Figs, first Empress of Osiris following the end of the Kemetic-Era, October-December 2013 whose reign began to show Osiris that there was light after the darkness of Empire controlled Osiris. For that, the Violet Isles, have been dedicated to her service and memory by the first of the democratically elected Fraternal Pharaohs, [nation=short]The Imperial Crown[/nation].
