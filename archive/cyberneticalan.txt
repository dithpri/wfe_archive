A nation that is mostly if not entirely devoted to the development and betterment of technology. The technology is used in their various ways but, is mostly made just for power, strength, intelligence and sheer want alone. The region mostly abhores religion as an &quot;outdated piece of tech worth of throwing away.&quot;. The nation itself sees anything man-made as tech. No matter what.

The government actions within it&#39;s own country is none of the concern of the leading country of the nation of Cyberneticalan and is mostly seen through the lead&#39;s fingers. If not already being replaced. But, in the nation it is encouraged to use all to purpose of technology. May it lead to slavery or kidnapping of civilians. All productivity is seen above all else.
