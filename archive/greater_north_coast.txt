Once known as the Dominion of the Godhead, this assortment of nations was renamed after a long, brutal and violent overthrow of the Kingdom of Gritsoil. Gritsoil had dominated the other coastal nations for centuries before, enforcing a religious theocracy.
All this ended when the vassal nations of the Dominion rebelled against there masters. The Rebellion was led by two ideologically opposite, but equally desperate states: The Soviet Protectorate of Hakkenheim and the Kingdom of Kribermyakerds.
The war lasted twenty long and bloody years and ended with a &#39;&#39;permanent truce&#39;&#39;. The Faith of the Godhead is still practiced freely, with human sacrifice confined to Gritsoil&#39;s borders.
