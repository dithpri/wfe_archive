No
I have Opened the RMB to Allow for those who wish Discussing there Oppositions and such talk if they wish. Just to spite Neo Confederates who are Innately for the &quot;White Power&quot; Theme.

But yes you may write whatever aslong as it isn&#39;t spam or advertisement (opening embassy  talk is fine). And it must be on topic. It can be a little a way but the Subject is to Condemn The KKK . 
(Must be compliant to Game Rules )

Have fun
