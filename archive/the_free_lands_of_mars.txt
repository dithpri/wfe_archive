Welcome to the Free Lands of Mars! This region is brand-new, which means that you&#39;ll be able to help shape its community. Soon, we&#39;ll hold elections for governmental positions, including Head of State, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Science. You can rest assured that I&#39;ll set those elections up in the most interesting possible way.
The basis of this region is that Mars has been terraformed and is being colonized. If you are interested in getting on the map, follow [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=cerebrus/detail=factbook/id=main]this[/url] link.
