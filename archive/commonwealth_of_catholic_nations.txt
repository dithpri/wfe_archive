[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[i]O God of the spirits of all flesh, 
we praise and magnify thy holy name 
for all thy servants who have finished their course 
in thy faith and fear, 
for the Blessed Virgin Mary, 
for the holy Patriarchs, 
Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs, 
and for all other thy righteous servants, 
known to us or unknown; 
and we beseech thee that, 
encouraged by their examples, 
and strengthened by their fellowship, 
we also may be found meet 
to be partakers of the inheritance 
of the saints in light 
through the merits of thy Son 
Jesus Christ our Lord. 

Amen.[/i][/color]
