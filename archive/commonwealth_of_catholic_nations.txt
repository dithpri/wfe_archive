[b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

Hallelujah! Christ is risen! Hallelujah!

[i]&quot;Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.&quot;[/i] (I. Corinthians 5:7-8).
