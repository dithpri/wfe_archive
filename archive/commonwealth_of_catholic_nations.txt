[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[i]Almighty God,
the fountain of all wisdom,
who knowest our necessities before we ask,
and our ignorance in asking;
We beseech thee to have compassion upon our infirmities;
and those things, which for our unworthiness we dare not,
and for our blindness we cannot ask,
vouchsafe to give us,
for the worthiness of thy Son
Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.[/i][/color]
