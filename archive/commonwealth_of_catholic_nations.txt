[b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[i]&quot;O my Lord, when I think in how many ways Thou hast suffered, and that Thou did&#39;st in nowise deserve it, I do not know what to say for myself, nor of what I am thinking when I shrink from suffering, nor where I am when I excuse myself. Thou knowest, Thou my God, that if there be aught of goodness in me, it has been given by no other hands than Thine.&quot;[/i] (St. Teresa of Jesus, [i]The way of perfection[/i], chapter XVI).
