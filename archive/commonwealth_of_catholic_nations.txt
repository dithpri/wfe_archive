[i]I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, 

That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said: 

&quot;Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.&quot;

After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, 

&quot;This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.&quot;[/i]
