[b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[color=darkblue][i]O God, merciful Father, that despisest not the sighing of a contrite heart, nor the desire of such as be sorrowful: 

Mercifully assist our prayers that we make before thee in all our troubles and adversities, whensoever they oppress us; 

and graciously hear us, that those evils, which the craft and subtilty of the devil or man worketh against us, be brought to nought; 

and by the providence of thy goodness they may be dispersed; 

that we thy servants, being hurt by no persecutions, may evermore give thanks unto thee in thy holy Church; 

through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.[/i][/color]
