[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[i]Almighty and merciful God, of whose only gift it cometh that thy faithful people do unto thee true and laudable service; Grant, we beseech thee, that we may so faithfully serve thee in this life, that we fail not finally to attain thy heavenly promises; through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord. 

Amen.[/i][/color]
