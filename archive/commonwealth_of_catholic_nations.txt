[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[i]O GOD the King of saints, 
we praise and magnify thy holy Name for all thy servants 
who have finished their course in thy faith and fear, 
for the Blessed Virgin Mary, 
for the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs, 
and for all other thy righteous servants; 
and we beseech thee that, 
encouraged by their example, 
strengthened by their fellowship, 
and aided by their prayers, 
we may attain unto everlasting life; 
through the merits of thy Son 
Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Amen.[/i][/color]
