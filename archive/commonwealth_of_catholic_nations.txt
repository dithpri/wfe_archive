[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[i]Almighty God, unto whom all
hearts be open, all desires
known, and from whom no secrets
are hid: cleanse the thoughts of our
hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy
Spirit, that we may perfectly love
thee, and worthily magnify thy holy
Name. Through Christ our Lord.
Amen.[/i][/color]
