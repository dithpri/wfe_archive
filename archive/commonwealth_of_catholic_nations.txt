Prayer for the 3rd Sunday after Trinity:
[i]O Lord, 
we beseech thee mercifully to hear us; 
and grant that we, 
to whom thou hast given an hearty desire to pray, 
may by thy mighty aid be defended and comforted 
in all dangers and adversities; 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Amen.[/i][/color]
