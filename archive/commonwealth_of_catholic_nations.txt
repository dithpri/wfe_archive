[b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Catholic Nations.[/b]

[color=darkblue][i]O God, 
who makest us glad with the yearly remembrance 
of the birth of thy only son, Jesus Christ: 
Grant that as we joyfully receive him for our redeemer, 
so we may with sure confidence behold him, 
when he shall come to be our judge; 
who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, 
one God, world without end.

Amen.[/i][/color]
