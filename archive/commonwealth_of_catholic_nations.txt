Blessed octave of Corpus Christi!
[i]O Lord, who in a wonderful sacrament hast left us a memorial of thy passion; Grant us so to reverence the holy mysteries of thy Body and Blood, that we may ever know within ourselves the fruits of thy redemption; who livest and reignest with the Father in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God world without end. Amen.[/i]
