[i]&quot;Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.&quot;

And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying:

&quot;Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.&quot;[/i]
