This region is for those who just want to be left alone. It is characterised by political freedom and generally not getting in each other&amp;#39;s way. It&amp;#39;s a basically infinite archipelago so basically just come along, pick an island and get on with it.

Citizens flock here from all over the world because they want to get away from politics and corruption, so make some room for them, and please don&amp;#39;t be a dictatorship or in any way corrupt. It gives us a bad name. Other than that, Capitalism is fine, Socialism is fine, Communism is fine, Libertarianism is wonderful.
