This was never a place of democracy - it&#39;s Congress and President ran only minor details. It&#39;s real government, which the People thought they controlled, was its own shadow. It&#39;s most influential figures disguised their actions in plain sight. What democracy establishes an agency to destroy dissent, or revokes the civil liberties of its citizens? They argued it was for security, yet Commuria had an active founder.
