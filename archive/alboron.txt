This expansive region, larger than mainland Europe, stretches across a diverse array of biomes shaped by vast latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. To the north, boreal forests cloak the land in dense coniferous canopies, giving way to sweeping tundras and icy fjords along the subarctic coastlines. Further south, temperate deciduous forests and alpine valleys dominate, punctuated by massive mountain ranges with snow-capped peaks and glacier-fed rivers carving through the landscape. Inland, vast plains support rich grasslands and meandering rivers. The southern reaches bask in a warm, Mediterranean-like climate, hosting dry shrublands, rocky coastlines, and inland wetlands teeming with migratory birds.
