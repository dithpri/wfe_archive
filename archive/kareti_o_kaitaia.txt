&quot;Situated in the very Far North of New Zealand; 
we are a Democratic Region. More than 70 per 
cent of our people are Maori, of whom a significant 
proportion whakapapa to the local Muriwhenua iwi 
of Ngati Kuri, Te Aupouri, Ngai Takoto, 
Te Rarawa and Ngati Kahu. 
Inter-generational connections of whanau, hapu 
and iwi to the Region, as well as strong links to the 
community&#146;s Dalmatian and European heritage remain key 
features of the Region&quot;.
