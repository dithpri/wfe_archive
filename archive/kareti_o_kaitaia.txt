&quot;Situated in the very Far North of New Zealand, we are a democracy of a region. More than 70 per cent of its people are Maori, of whom a significant proportion whakapapa to the local Muriwhenua iwi of Ngati Kuri, Te Aupouri, Ngai Takoto, Te Rarawa and Ngati Kahu. Inter-generational connections of whanau, hapu and iwi to the college, as well as strong links to the community&#146;s Dalmatian and European heritage remain key features of the region&quot;.
