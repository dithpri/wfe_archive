Praise be! The Dragon Throne is empty, and we hold the Amulet of Kings. Praise be to your brothers and sisters. Great shall be their reward in Paradise! Hear now the words of Lord Dagon: &#147;When I walk the earth again, the faithful among you shall receive your reward: to be set above all other mortals forever. As for the rest&#133;the weak shall be winnowed; the timid shall be cast down; the mighty shall tremble at my feet and pray for pardon.&#148;Your reward, brothers and sisters: the time of cleansing draws nigh. I go now to Paradise. I shall return with Lord Dagon at the coming of the Dawn!
