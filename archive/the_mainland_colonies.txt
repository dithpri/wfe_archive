The Mainland is a fairly new region founded in a fictional earth. New nationstates interact with one another as well as several preexisting &quot;npc&quot; states that maintain their own dominions in the region. Members can participate in the region&#39;s politics and discussions, gaining land, autonomy, and power within the region, or they can choose to remain neutral and manage their own state without involvement in the greater region. The Mainland Colonies are also open to nationstates of any walk of life, and are placed on the map according to their ideologies and political foundations.
