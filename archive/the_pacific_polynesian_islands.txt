A little west of Hawaii, there lies huge islands (Oahu times three) lying across the ocean. Known for its huge beaches and eccentric Marine life, the Pacific Islands were originally found by Polynesian tribes during the 1900&#39;s. When they were pushed out by the US, they moved here. They became home to Communism, Capitalism, Tyranny, and Kingdoms. These Islands saw many different people, including the Italians, Polynesian, Samoan, Japanese, and Chinese.
