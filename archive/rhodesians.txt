Not long ago, we stood alone and strong.
Africa or Home - Where we belong
No fear in our eyes, or doubt in our heart.
Forever ready - in history - to take our part.

We knew without doubt what was wrong and right.
For our beliefs, our lives, we&#39;d stand and fight.
With mates at our side we fought and survived,
Never once forgetting those who&#39;d died.
