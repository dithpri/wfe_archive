[b]From one mythical land to another, the Royal Albion Legion of [region]Albion[/region] have occupied the lands of Middle Earth and the King of Albion now sits on the Throne in the Citadel of Minas Tirith.

From Lindon in the West, through to Rh&ucirc;n in the East, Albion now reigns as overlords. All the Orcs of Isengard and all the elves of Lothl&oacute;rien could not keep out our valiant Knights!
