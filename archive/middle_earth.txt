We&amp;#39;re the VAW. A raiding company from Ainur that operates separate from the Ainurian Armed Forces. What we lack in numbers and experience we make up for in raiding consistently. I&amp;#39;m Emrys Mercer. The founder is Charlie Mercer-Sheen, and a on and off raider for us is Acheron Mercer-Scott. His husband Acrotis Mercer-Scott filled in for him during this raid because he&amp;#39;s awesome like that. And because Ainur is cool enough to have gay marriages.

Lastly, I wanna thank The Generically Named Nation of Bobs raider puppet. For the endorsement near the end whoever you are.

&amp;#39;Fendas. Take it or don&amp;#39;t. We got a new trophy for our wall. VAW all the way, baby.

Felicity Ann Mercer, I dedicate this to you.
