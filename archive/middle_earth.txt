[i]This past Sunday, Europeia; the second largest UCR in the game, turned nine years old. Throughout our nine years of existence we have faced trials and tribulations where we have grown over internal strife, political scandals, and many other domestic and foreign incidents that threatened our existence. Each and every year Europeia prevailed: just like it will prevail for another nine years. [/i]
