[Color=blue][b]Welcome to the region of the Russian Federation of Politics![/color]

[color=red] The region is trying to become more active. Also, we like to debate. You are entitled to your opinion as everybody is entitled to their opinion. We accept different opinions. We do not eject you because of your opinions, but the opinions have to be within reason. The opinions cannot be outrageous. We are a Russian nation with many influences such as America.

[color=blue][b]As 9/11 is near, take a moment to  remember the victims of the terrorist attack. Many families mourned. We must never be afraid of these cowards. Good always wins. GO U.S.A.!!![/color][/b]
