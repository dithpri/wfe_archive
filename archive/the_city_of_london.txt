London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
London calling, now don&#39;t look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain&#39;t got no swing
&#39;Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin&#39; thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
&#39;Cause London is drowning, and I, I live by the river
