North Atlantic Union of Countries is a thriving culture of countries in the middle of nowhere. All are allied with each other and enjoy defeating opposing armies. The countries are very adept at battle and are fiercely loyal to all. The furthest north states are the twin islands of Luxore and Lukor. The furthest south is the Republic of Matthew Kelly and the Provincial Isles. The Holy Empire of Bupadest and Torrent River are Eastern bound, while Nile River controls the west. If countries wish to join simply ask.
