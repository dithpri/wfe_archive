The Rook Islands were once considered a tropical paradise. Even though the isles are filled with lush jungles, rolling savannahs, thick swamps, and steep mountains, years of neglect and violence have forced the isles to fall into a state of turmoil... permanently. The once peaceful chain of islands belonged to the thriving tribes (primarily the Rakyat) that once inhabited the entirety of the isles.

After years of fighting, violence and death to many innocent civilians, the islands finally broke into their own governments under their own inderpendant rule.
