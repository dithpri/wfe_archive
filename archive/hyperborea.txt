Imaging an individual free of constituent attachment is not looking at a free being, but it is imaging a being with no depth nor personality. On the contrary, immersion in a group is the first condition to realizing self-fulfillment. When we shall become aware that our individuality is truly realized through groups called the Family, the Church, the Nation and the State, then and only then shall we realize the great significance and the deep import of the Fascist philosophy of life.
