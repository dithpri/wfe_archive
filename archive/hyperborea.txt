Hyperborea is a continent located where the Arctic Ocean once was. The continent&#39;s climate is similar to that of Anarcticas and the continent is 98% covered in glaciers. Only a few hardy Flora and Fauna call Hyperborea home. Hyperborea was discovered by the Norse in the height of the Viking age and was breifly under control by the Kingdom of Norway before the colony was abandoned due to the freezing cold, scarcity of resources and attacks from the native Inuit population. With the advancement of technology, Hyperborea is now again up for grabs. All are welcome in Hyperborea except Centrists.
