REVOLT AGAINST THE MODERN WORLD 

REVOLUTION AGAINST THE CAPITALISTS AND MARXISTS

THE MODERN WORLD IS NOT THE NATURAL END OF A GREAT HUMAN  CIVILIZATION, BUT THE BIRTH OF AN INHUMANE CIVILIZATION THAT COULD NEVER HAVE COME INTO BEING WITHOUT A VAST, AN IMMENSE, A UNIVERSAL STERILIZATION OF LIFE&#146;S HIGHEST VALUES

WHAT MAKES MAN GREAT, IS THAT HE IS A BRIDGE, NOT AN END
