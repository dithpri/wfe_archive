[b]The [region]Lycan[/region] race originated here in [region]Hyperborea[/region] which is still an ice covered and fractured land

In the mists of time [region]Hyperborea[/region] was once blessed with an eternal spring, the land producing two crops of grain per year, and most of the countryside was wild and covered with beautiful forests. The capital contained a circular temple dedicated to God where sacrifices were made in his honor and hymns were joined by the sweet song of circling swans. Centuries after the great cold, several bands of Ancient [region]Lycans[/region] journeyed with Apollo and Artemis in human form to the isle of Delos and traded with the Greeks. 

A few remained to guide the Greek peoples while the rest went to seek out other tribes, later returning to [region]Lycanis[/region][/b]
