The air here is salty and warm. There are plenty of palm trees here, as the peninsula is in the center of the tropical regions. Dotted along the coasts and on several small outlying islands are lighthouses, relics of a colonial period over a century ago. Many a sail can be seen gracing the aquamarine waters.
