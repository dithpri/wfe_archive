[B]This region will be closing in 72 hours from this moment (12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time). All residing nations are ordered to leave this region by the aforementioned time. Nations are also suggested to relocate to our ally, the [region]Unitarian Union[/region]. We will become citizens of that region. In 3 days, all nations still in this region will be banjected by the WA Delegate, [nation=short+noflag]Olivee[/nation].[/B]

A note from Olivee: Well, I sure had fun here. I think that it was more active than the Regional Alliance, and had a better government than the pseudo-monarchy that Sugarfootland set up. I quite enjoyed myself here, and I hope to see you all in the [region]Unitarian Union[/region].
