[region]The Black Hawks[/region] wanted a good raid. Good raids are defined by the number of [color=aqua]plushies[/color] we can export to regions.

A very specific type of plushie known as the [color=red]FUMO[/color] makes for the best sort of raiding. 

Fumos are useful in all sorts of situations, from [color=green]helping you withdraw your money at the bank[/color], to [color=red]helping you burn down your house.[/color]

We thus decided to visit your region to export FUMOs.

If you like Fumos, [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]Come join us![/url]
