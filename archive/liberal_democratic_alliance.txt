[b]Motto:[/b] [i]Freedom Everlasting[/i]

The Liberal Democratic Alliance is a new region founded on the principles of liberalism and democracy. For a society to progress, it must be able to adapt and change. Authoritarian ideologies such as [b]fascism[/b] and [color=red][b]communism[/b][/color] are idealistic and hold on to the ideal of a utopia. If human nature is flawed, then how can we expect to establish a society that is perfect? The result of both of these ideologies, in practice, is violence and tyranny.  If you agree with me, then go ahead and click join. No one is discriminated here. We are all human and only wish for what&#39;s best for humanity.
