Delta Force is firmly against the World Assembly, as it is an attack on both regional and national sovereignty. We endorse Christianity and believe in sticking to the Bible as written. We also endorse having a strong, modern military for the purposes of defense and conquering lands controlled by the evil and the heathen.
