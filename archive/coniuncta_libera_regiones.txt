&amp;quot;Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities, and the smallest minority on earth is the individual.&amp;quot; &#151; Ayn Rand

&amp;quot;Concentrated power is not rendered harmless by the good intentions of those who create it.&amp;quot; &#151; Milton Friedman
