[i]Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
&#147;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&#148; I said, &#147;art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore&#151;
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night&#146;s Plutonian shore!&#148;
Quoth the Raven....[/i]
