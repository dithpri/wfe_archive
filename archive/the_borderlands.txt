[b]Overview[/b]:
The &amp;quot;Borderlands&amp;quot; are a collection of small countries that fall just outside of neighboring politcal boundaries. The area is rather desolate, and rough terrain prohibits access to all but the most determined travellers. Natural resources include oil, iron ore, and aluminum, essential items to Sevvanian war efforts.

The most notable country in this region is Sevvania, a relatively small backwater country located deep within the heart of the Borderlands. The country is rather militaristic, taking great pride in their Air Force.
