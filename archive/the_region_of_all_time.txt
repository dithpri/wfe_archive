Primary card farm region of [nation]The Western European Commonwealth[/nation], themed around nothing in particular other than various random things I&#39;ll think of.

If, for some reason, you wish to join this region, feel free to do so. But don&#39;t expect much activity.

Want a card I just so happen to have acquired? Shoot over a telegram and I&#39;ll probably give/sell it to you.

Featured on the 24[sup]th[/sup] of September 2025. Thanks for everything!
