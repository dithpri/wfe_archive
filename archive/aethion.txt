Region Chat Rules:

1.  Region Chat is considered to be the equivalent of the World Council floor, Aethion&#39;s equivalent of the United Nations; speak accordingly!

2.  Please keep the region chat as appropriate as possible!  (No ERP or the like!)

3.  Do not take it personally if a nation&#39;s delegate attacks your nation in RP!

4.  Discuss affairs not concerning the whole council elsewhere, such as a forum thread.

5.  Have fun!
