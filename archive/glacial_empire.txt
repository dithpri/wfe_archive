[color=#4682B4]In times past, the thriving and powerful Glacial Empire asserted its influence throughout the polar regions of Nationstates and beyond. Those days are gone. 

Present-day Glacial Empire contains a small number of nations, scattered across the barren Plains of Eternal Winter&#153; and separated by uninhabitable mountain ranges. Led by [nation]Ljosavatn[/nation], a former member of the last imperial government, they are determined to restore the realm to its former glory.[/color]

[color=#191970]The Empire shall rise again![/color]
