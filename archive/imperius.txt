Hey, do you like country roleplays? Do you want to join a roleplay region that actually roleplays and doesn&#39;t just talk about them and where people can&#39;t god mode or meta? If so, Imperius (IPS) is the region for you. Imperius is a roleplay region where you can create and manage your own nation. 

If you want to join please message [nation]Kalathu[/nation], you can find the application format [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=kalathu/detail=factbook/id=670865]here[/url].

The standard timezone in this region is Greenwich time (GMT+1).
