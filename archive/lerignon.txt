[region]The Kingdom of Great Britain[/region] is helping NYX.
[nation]Queen Nyx[/nation] is the QUEEN OF LERIGNON.
King Sacul NO LONGER EXISTS and has NO DESIRE TO EXIST.
[nation]Lerignon[/nation] is used, at least, NO LONGER FOR LERIGNON, but for a DIFFERENT REGION.

So defenders that think they&#39;re helping, linking to MY off-site roleplay forums that are DEAD are:
1) fueling my anger (nyx)
2) being hypocrites
3) RAIDING A REGION FROM ITS ORIGINAL OWNER[/b][/color]
