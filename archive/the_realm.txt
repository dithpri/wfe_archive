[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Transferred control: 22.02.23[/I]

This region was the main region, but one of many networks belonging to the now-banned Neo-Nazi known variously as Aryan Shield Command, Lone Wolf, etc. 

It was seized in August 2014 by [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_red_fleet][b][color=red]The Red Fleet[/color][/b][/url] and was protected by the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=freedom_and_justice_alliance][b][color=darkgreen]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/color][/b][/url] for over eight years. 

It is now being protected by [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_mt_army][b][color=green]The MT Army[/color][/b][/url] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].
