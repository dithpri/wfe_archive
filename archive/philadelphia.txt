[b]The City of Brotherly Love.[/b]

[color=blue]Philadelphia was founded on October 27, 1682 by William Penn, who planned a city along the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. The city grew rapidly, and by the 1750s Philadelphia was the largest city and busiest port in the original 13 American colonies.  During the American Revolution, Philadelphia played an instrumental role as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States, who signed the nation&amp;#39;s Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 and the Constitution on September 17, 1787.
