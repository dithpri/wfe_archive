To be in this region, you must have at least 3 or more first place finishes at the time when Anarchy Acres was around instead of Lazy Links. You must battle my nation/empire, Afron Legion, and defeat me, or come close, and I will determine whether or not you are worthy to join this region, in the north. Thank you.
