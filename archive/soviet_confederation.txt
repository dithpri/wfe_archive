This region was probably founded in 2007 by Neo Ozia. Around a year thereafter, a large fraction of its population left for the Dominion, precipitating the collapse of the region. Although fragmented, the community survived in its successor regions: the Dominion, the Intergalactic Dominion, and the Ascendancy. The Soviet Confederation&#39;s founder, Neo Ozia, would find fame as the patriarch of the Romefeller dynasty.
