In our region, we uphold a right-leaning, libertarian ethos that prioritizes individual liberty and limited government. While we support the World Assembly, our focus is to ensure that its legislation respects our freedoms and sovereignty. We engage critically, advocating for policies that empower us to maintain our way of life without unnecessary interference. Our mission is clear: to preserve and promote the values of freedom that define us both locally and globally.
