In the AMS, we think states were established to help people, rather than to control them. We promote democracy, freedom of the individual and free trade. We believe in liberalism, but not to the extremes since some (but not much) control is needed to avoid total chaos.
We are a new region founded by the New Lands Republic and we have a lot to do to improve. Member states can feel free to suggest changes.
And finally, the founder of New Lands Republic is a casual player who does not expect over-active member states. So, new countries, this is a great region for you.
