[i]The Vex System is a large network of control nodes, computer facilities, shipyards, ground-to-orbital defense stations, and communication arrays across the surface and depths of an unidentified dwarf planet in the outer reaches of Sol&#39;s Oort Cloud. The system was created by an unknown entity referred only as &quot;Rykil.&quot; Human civilization has only just started to construct sufficient orbital infrastructure for a spacefaring civilization, and they are wholly unknowing of the Vex System&#39;s existence.[/i]
