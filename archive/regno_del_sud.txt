The Kingdom of the South (Italian: Regno del Sud) is the term used in Italian historiography to identify that part of southern Italy controlled by the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) in the latter part of World War II, and ruled by AMGOT in cooperation with the government of the Kingdom of Italy (initially with Pietro Badoglio and later Ivanoe Bonomi as prime ministers), as opposed to German-occupied northern and central Italy, where the Italian Social Republic had been established.
