Welcome to Fantastica, a region inspired by the imaginative world of the same name from the Neverending Story (novel).

Whether you&#39;re here casually or wanting to dive into the roleplaying or other facets of the region, we welcome all types of people so long as you follow the rules set out by the High King himself (as appointed by the Childlike Empress).

So make yourself at home, be sure to read read our constitution to get a feel for what the region is about, and definitely stop by our Discord to check things out.

Happy adventuring!
