Here be Dragons, lads.  Well, not really.  But the Edge is where you can be whoever you want. No one will tell you you can&amp;#39;t rule a certain way, and [i]almost[/i] everything is tolerated (see note below).  All that&amp;#39;s left for you to do is rule your Nation, and participate in any Regional and/or World politics.


[b]WA DELAGATES/ENDORSEMENTS:[/b] If you wish to become a WA Delagate, please post your intent on the [b]Regional Message Board[/b].  This way, we can weed out those who would attempt to take our Region over.  

               [i]Endorsing a nation is completely optional, but much appreciated.[/i]

[b]NOTE:[/b] Coups will [b]NOT[/b] be tolerated.  Any actions considered treasonous will be grounds for [u]immediate[/u] expulsion &amp;amp; banning.
