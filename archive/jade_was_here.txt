[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] flew into battle today, urged on by the roars of Cub-Hawk Ursus, and left several regions sacked in their wake. Unfortunately Ursus was too fixated on [region]Anti Panda[/region] and let his focus slip for a short while. If you are anti-Anti Panda and think Pandas are adorable then you should join the official [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]Panda discord[/url] of NS, and why not check out their [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]Headquarters[/url]?
