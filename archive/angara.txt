The Region of Angara was, at one point rebellions, riot filled, and violent place to live in. Lords and Barons constantly quarreled over territory and self gain, while their peasants starved, which often lead to rebellions and famine. But out of Angara came a new hope for all to see. Strong, and formidable both politically and militarily when on October 19th 1083 the Lords came together and formed a United Kingdom, a republic, a nation that would stand the test of time, ending the continents long years of tyranny.
