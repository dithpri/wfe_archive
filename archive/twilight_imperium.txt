Twilight Imperium is a large-scale space opera. It is set in the unstable power vacuum left after the centuries-long decline and collapse of the previously dominant Lazax race. The old galactic central capital, Mecatol Rex, located in the center of the universe is maintained by custodians who maintain the imperial libraries and oversee the meetings of the galactic council.
