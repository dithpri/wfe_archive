Welcome, fellow commander, to the vast and intricate galaxy of Twilight Imperium. As you embark on your journey to forge an empire among the stars, it is crucial to understand the myriad of factions, territories, and histories that shape our cosmos.

The Galactic Council convenes here, where representatives from the great factions meet to debate, scheme, and legislate. Control of Mecatol Rex is often seen as the key to galactic dominance, making it a coveted and contested prize.
