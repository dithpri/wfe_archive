we are a region created to liberate occupied regions  and reinstate native populations join us in our march against raiding regions WA members preferred but if you join and you are not a WA member please join as soon as possible. why do we need WA members you might ask well its simple really without WA members we cannot execute our mission to liberate occupied regions or eliminate hostile regions that continue to invade other regions with no respect for the native populace. as a WA member you are able to endorse native members of regions so that they can take control of the region they belong to and eject and ban the occupiers  once they have control we can then return to our region to regroup and plan our next move
