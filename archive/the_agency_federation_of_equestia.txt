The Agency Federation of Equestria sets out to make sure everything&amp;#39;s running the way it should. However, the former government of Equestria has no power in the Federation. This means that the Federation&amp;#39;s leader Lightning Zap(leader of The Allied Agency States) has final say in all government decisions.
The Federation is always looking for new members so you can join if you want to.
