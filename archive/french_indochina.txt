[color=gold][i][b]Welcome to French Indochina![/b][/color]
French Indochina was the colonial federation comprising Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos and Guangzhouwan under French rule that lasted from 1887 to 1954.[/i][hr]This region was founded long ago to pay tribune to the soldiers from France, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos who died for their countries during the First Indochina War.
Later on it was sadly taken over by fascists and collaborationists.

Now finally being rid of these horrendous ideologies, this region stands once again to commemorate these soldiers&#39; fight and sacrifice but also the memory of all civilians who were imprisoned, killed or had to flee their country due to the aftermath of the war.[hr][color=darkgreen][i][b]If you want to join, we wish you a nice stay![/b][/i][/color]
