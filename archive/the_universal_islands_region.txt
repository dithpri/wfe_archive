A strange, psychic form of sentient, intelligent, water-based life forms evolved on a planet in another dimension completely covered by an ocean with millions of small, forested islands. The inhabitants, who love peace and ukulele music, developed the Universal Islands Region, a group of nations bound by international agreements, who can access the region through an inter-dimensional space warp available to any nation who wishes to join.
