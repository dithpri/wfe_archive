Motto:[/b][/color] Futurum est Aurum
[color=#d8a830][b]Founded:[/b][/color] January 22nd 2018[hr]We are a [b]serious[/b] modern-tech role-playing region. We role-play on our own off-site forum; however, we are also willing to role-play on the nationstates forum. We [b]do not[/b] role-play on the regional message board, nor do we role-play on discord. We will forever maintain the firm belief that you get back what you put into a role-play. In order to become a member of Auratus you must first fill out an application: which can be found [b][url=https://goo.gl/forms/nZ37nAtYuvW6Kvfm2]here[/url][/b]. If you are accepted, a discord invite link and regional password will be sent to your nation via telegram.
