Empyrea is founded as a response to the unjust rejection of Nations by the greater regions. The denial of our regions&#39; rights and their exclusion from other authoritarian alliances served as a catalyst for the formation of this new regional entity. Empyrea is established with the aim of providing an open space for nations that share similar values and seek to uphold the principles of cooperation and mutual respect.
