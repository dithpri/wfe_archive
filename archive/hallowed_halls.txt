During 1919, just after the first World War, the Earth and its populace has been split into several sides&#133;

Come about extreme differences in political ideology - and the first bombs are dropped, marking the beginning of the Greatest War.

Soon enough, there was nothing left to ravage on the surface, it was left completely uninhabitable, forcing everyone but the loose ends of society to beneath the dirt.

The world went underground, but the War did not rest.

The year is 1924. This is what it has come to.
