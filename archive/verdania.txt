Verdania is a region perfect for chatting, roleplay, or making friends.
Here, you can enjoy a live, active, and fun chat.
Just five simple rules:
1. Do not post more than three times. Three times is fine.
2. Please do not bully or harass. We would like a fun community, not a parody of Twitter.
3. Follow NationStates rules.
4. Please don&#39;t recruit. This is not a place to invite other nations. If you want to recruit, send telegrams.
5. In case of emergencies, all above rules are optional.
Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you! :)
