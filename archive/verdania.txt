[b]Welcome to Verdania, seat of the glorious Imperial Verdanian Empire![/b]

Caesar [nation]Virgo[/nation]

Verdania is the heart of a glorious empire protected by the Caesar from external threats. Imperial Citizens enjoy free and fair elections as well as extensive freedoms. Verdania is governed by a democratically elected Imperial Senate which is accountable to the people.

-we will hold elections soon once we reach 10 nations which I believe will be within the next couple days. There will be 3 senate seats available to run for.
