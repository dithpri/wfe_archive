[b]Hello and welcome to the Bird Federation&#146;s newest purge.[/b]

[color=red]
It has been determined that because the Swans consort with the mammalian menace, humans, that they are pests that must be destroyed. The Pigeon and Duck wings of the Federation have arrived and will exterminate all swans.
