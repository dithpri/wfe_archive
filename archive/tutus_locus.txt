It used to look rather nice and friendly ... but is currently undergoing reconstruction as the previous owners were a bit cranky and careless.

Tutus Locus is a region of many wonders, the first one being how it managed to even become a region again in the first place. The dripping, slightly radioactive, rat-infested remains of the previous land of Tutus Locus, were dredged up and then transported using fifty-seven shiny, black helicopters and a large, hairy yak to be deposited somewhere very nice indeed and not even a tiny bit hazardous to anyones health. The people rejoiced, and look forward to a bright, healthy future of democracy and shouty politicians!
