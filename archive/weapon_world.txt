Nuke &#39;em headbands for light blue German Lugars
Forcefields protect, razor bumps behind your neck
Automatics from seven chambers eighty-two bullets
When you pull it the little twenty five sound like Ganas
Machine guns electric cords rob the power run
Remington 870, for the pedigree
Night time militant mask, fueled with laser gas
Atomic ACP thirty round American slugs
With bugs undefeatable navy systems
Brown pearls pistols with FBI whistles
Suitcase with missles stashed with toilet tissue
