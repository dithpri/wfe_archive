[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to ask themselves a very important question. 

What is a [color=brown]cookie?[/color] What are these mythical things? Could they be eaten, or perhaps they were used as decoration?

[color=paleblue]We visited your region to find the legendary cookie.[/color] We searched up and down, left and right, but could not find anything.
