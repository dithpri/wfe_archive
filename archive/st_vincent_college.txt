A long time ago a nation known as [nation]Element115[/nation] was founded at St Vincent College during Philosophy(or Sociology?) lessons.
That nation survived for nearly a year before CTE&#39;ing

11 years later the owner returned to NationStates and founded the shiny new nation of [nation]Apexiala[/nation] in Jan 2022.

After trawling through over a decade of emails, [nation]Element115[/nation] was resurrected in Mar 2023.

The region St Vincent College has now been refounded in memory.
