The United Federation for Objectives, or UFO, is a federation of united allies who work towards nations with high ethics. 

To join send a telegram to the founder to receive the password after a vetting process. To pass the vetting process you must have policies that represent the direction your nation is heading. If the direction your nation is heading is towards an equal, fair, and prosperous nation. Your nation can have capital punishments and hard restrictions, but they cannot lead to poor civil rights. Other than that, there are no restrictions. If you have a current member request for your acceptance, it will be taken into account. After being accepted you will have gained allies.
