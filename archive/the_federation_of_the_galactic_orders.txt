The Federation of the Galactic Orders is an alliance of the Galactix Peacekeepers, the Holy Roman World, and the Great Republic of the Eastern Galaxy, working together to maintain order and stability across 500+ star systems. Governed by a Supreme Council, it balances military strength, religious authority, and economic influence while its capital, the Orbital City of Concordia, serves as a political and diplomatic hub. With a strong defense fleet and a thriving trade-based economy, the federation remains a dominant force in the galaxy, guided by its motto, &quot;Through unity, we conquer the void. Through order, we sustain peace.&quot;
