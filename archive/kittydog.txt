A small [strike]reigon[/strike] region home to [strike][nation]Switzerland-but communist[/nation][/strike] [nation]Kittydog[/nation], it&#146;s basically isolation. You&#146;re welcome to join and form a community, but [strike]Switzerland[/strike] Kittydog won&#146;t care what you do, and will rarely join in. Have fun!
[strike](Also a bit communist but whatever)[/strike]
