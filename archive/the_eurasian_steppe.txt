[b]Welcome message[/b]

The Eurasian Steppe is vast enough for anyone to find their place under the Sun to chillax and enjoy life drama-free.

Welcome one, welcome all!

[b]Symbolism of the flag[/b]

[color=blue][i][b]BLUE[/b][/i][/color] represents the sky.
[b][i]BLACK[/i][/b] represents the oil and natural gas of the steppe.
[color=yellow][i][b]YELLOW[/b][/i][/color] represents our fertile soil and its grains.

The [color=blue][i][b]BLUE[/b][/i][/color] and [color=yellow][i][b]YELLOW[/b][/i][/color] stripes are larger than the [b][i]BLACK[/i][/b] stripe to represent both the vastness of the sky above Eurasia (i.e., Eurasia&amp;#39;s expanse) as well as to remind us that our true wealth lies in our grains (i.e., food production) and not our oil.
