Welcome to the home of the Harding Knights!  Located of the east side of Saint Paul, we are one of the largest high schools in Saint Paul.  Harding High School is home to several specialty programs including the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), NJROTC and American Indian Studies Program.  We also have a Ninth Grade Academy that helps eighth graders make the transition to high school easy.

Harding High School is fortunate to have a partnership with 3M.  Many opportunities are afforded our students because of this partnership.
