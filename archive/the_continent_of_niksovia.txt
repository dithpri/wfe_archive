The Continent Of Niksovia Is and island landmass with countries vastly different from on another, the Countries are:

- Central Niksovia, The most big and succsessful country, people enjoy high wealth and freedoms, but are still moralistic

- South Niksovia, a country ran by a totalitarian dictatorship, people are the puppets of the government

- East Niksovia, A socialist country with a bad economy, people enjoy freedom of politics and identity but not economic.

- North Niksovia: an anarchic wasteland, this place is abandoned my most Niksovians
