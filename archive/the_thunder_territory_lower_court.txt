This is the Lower Court of the The Thunder Territory. We are inferior to the great Supreme Court of the Thunder Territory. If you&#39;re here, your case was sent here by [nation=short]Magicarnia[/nation], or another officer from the Thunder Territory. Obey all rules said by the Judge and you will be out in no time.

Nation vs. Nation cases usually come to this region, and are persecuted unless it was declared an unconstitutional case. Then it goes to the Supreme Court. We will be hiring a permanent jury, contrary to prior belief.
