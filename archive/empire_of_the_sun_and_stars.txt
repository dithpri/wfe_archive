[u][b][color=#A60000]The Empire of the Sun and Stars[/color][/b][/u]

[i]From seas eternal to planets distant;
The Empire shall rule supreme, omniscient.
The vanguards shall die for land so hallow;
Threats unknown abound - silent in the shadows.
Yet despite all, she is victorious;
For she is the Empire of the Sun and Stars - forever glorious.[/i]
