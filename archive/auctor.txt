Predecessor of the burning region of [region]Sophia[/region], see that place for if you&#39;re looking for an active region. For one that&#39;s not in a raid... I can&#39;t help you.

[strike]If there&#39;s not much going on about this place, it may be integrated into the Verchy Keeper Network in the spring of 2025.[/strike] SOPHIA IS UNDER ATTACK! VKN INTEGRATION WILL NOT OCCUR. This region will be opened in the event Sophia&#39;s legitimate residents and government do end up having to relocate here.

[i]Unless you have been told to, do not attempt to flee to here yet![/i]

Password revocation soon.
