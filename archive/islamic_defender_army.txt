The idea for this region is to grow an army to [b]defend any and all founderless Islamic regions in the event of a raid[/b].

Regardless of our differences, we are all Muslims, and [color=green][b]when one region is attacked just because it is Muslim, all of Islam is attacked[/b][/color]. 

Join us and stand against the enemies of Allah (swt)!

[b]I shall be contacting the founders and delegates of Muslim regions in the next few weeks with proposals, Inshallah.[/b]
