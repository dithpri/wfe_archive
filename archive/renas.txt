[color=blue][list]Renas is a fantasy world created by the Galdarim, seven beings typically worshiped by Renasir as deities. Over the millennia, the religions that formed around the Galdarim and the nations that follow these religions would interact with each other; whether they be peaceful or non-peaceful, on a largely political scale.

Each nation is initially created by [nation]Grenlostheria[/nation] and given to select individuals to run and further worldbuild. To join Renas, one must acquire a nation from [nation]Grenlostheria[/nation]. If interested, contact him through telegram or discord at [B][i]MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat#4903[/i].[/B][/list][/color]
