Kraftwerk-Union A.G., a unit of Siemens AG, was contracted to build two nuclear reactors based on a contract worth $4 to $6 billion signed in 1975. Work stopped in January 1979 and Kraftwerk-Union fully withdrew from the project in July 1979, with one reactor 50% complete, and the other reactor 85% complete. They said they based their action on Iran&amp;#39;s non-payment of $450 million in overdue payments. The company had received $2.5 billion of the total contract. Their cancellation came following the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
