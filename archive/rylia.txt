This region is an offshoot of the region of Tolkana. Yet, this does not make it lesser, no. It means that those present here were courageous enough to stand up to the tyranny of others and do that which is right. To all those reading this I say, &#147;May glory and honour be with you should you choose to join this battle of ideals in the side of democracy, of justice, of freedom, of righteousness.
