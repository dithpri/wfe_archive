[b]Welcome to [color=green]Ryeland[/color][/b] || [i]Founded on [color=green]July 7th, 2018[/color][/i][hr][i]In the silence of the day with a pale blue sky, Earth breathes on a peaceful field of Rye. The air is cool and smells of grain, and the field is flat for as far as the eye can see. The land has never been touched by the hand of Man. This is Ryeland, a free community of loosely connected nations. We have no set ideals or ideologies.[/i][hr][b]Important Links: [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=ryeland_founder/detail=factbook/id=1057157]Constitution[/url] | [color=green]Government[/color] | [color=green]Map[/color] | [url=https://discord.gg/VFz9Zv4]Discord[/url] | [/b][hr][b]Affiliated Regions: [url=nationstates.net/region=new_western_atlantic]New Western Atlantic[/url] | [url=nationstates.net/region=democratic_states_alliance]Democratic States Alliance[/url] | [url=nationstates.net/region=the_lost_city]The Lost City[/url] |[/b][hr][b]Rye Radio: [url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X791IzOwt3Q#]Stairway To Heaven - Led Zeppelin[/url]
