The region is not meant to be an alliance of states working together with a UN like tribunal ruling over them. Longe Attingit is a vast region containing states of all kinds free to rule themselves how they see fit and roleplay amongst each other their interactions all on levels with one another. We aren&amp;#39;t cut off from the rest of NS, but the idea of the region is getting together a group of people to have reliable roleplay with. If this is something that interest you feel free to join.
