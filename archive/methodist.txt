This region, thanks to the help of Christians United (Morituram) and the Christian Republic, is now a Protectorate of the Christian Republic. We thank all those involved.
Currently, it would seem that there are no natives, but if there are, they must tg Jumalariik or Morituram to claim that they are native. 
We thank God that we could defend the region from anti-Christians like the Black Riders.
