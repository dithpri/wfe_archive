The Azores, officially the [b]Autonomous Region of the Azores[/b], is one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal, an archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the North Atlantic Ocean about 850 miles west of continental Portugal, about 550 miles northwest of Madeira, and about 1,196 miles southeast of Newfoundland.

Its main industries are agriculture, dairy farming (for cheese and butter products primarily), livestock ranching, fishing, and tourism, which is becoming the major service activity in the region. In addition, the government of the Azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in the service and tertiary sectors.  &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
