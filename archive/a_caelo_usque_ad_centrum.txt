Salvete, from [region]A Caelo Usque Ad Centrum[/region]

Just in case you didn&amp;#39;t know, [region]A Caelo Usque Ad Centrum[/region] means[b][i][u]  &amp;#39;From Heaven To The Center of the Earth.&amp;#39;[/b][/i][/u]

We chose this name because this is a region where each nation can act as its own separate entity, from the ground to the air, while continuing to be a part of the whole. 

We do not believe that a region can control individual nations, but rather that a region&amp;#39;s goal is to support and provoke new discussions among its people.

[b] *Different types of governments are more than welcome.*[/b]
