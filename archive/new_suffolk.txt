Founder of Suffolk: The Lower Tawe - Died in the great turkey raid on Norfolk - December 2009 
The nation of Finlayville passed away just a few short weeks later after  going into Norfolk to avenge the region&amp;#39;s founder.

In the middle of 2010 the region of Suffolk was invaded, many natives were scattered two sadly passed away, we shall not forget Pieta and McGod who fought hard to defend our region.

While not in battle the deaths of our brothers and sisters will not be forgotten
