The United Liberal Territories (ULT) are a group of Liberal countries which are in union with each other. We keep an open mind and accept all left wing countries. We don&#39;t, however, accept right wing countries or dictatorships as we promote freedom and, more importantly, the left wing.

Citizens of any country within this region do not require passports to enter any other country in this region as we promote peace and trust, plus the fact there are no border checks between these countries.

Enjoy the freedoms of the ULT!
