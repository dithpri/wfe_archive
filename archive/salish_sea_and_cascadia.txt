A region stretching from Anchorage, Alaska down to the San Francisco Bay Area. Borders generally follow the Cascade Mountain Range and the surrounding ecological region. 

The core area of this region is centered around the Salish Sea, also known as the Puget Sound.

This region is welcome to anyone sick of those region-spam telegrams. Rest assured, I&#39;m extremely unlikely to send you any messages. No communists, no fascists, and no anarchists. All other political ideologies welcome, begrudgingly or otherwise.
