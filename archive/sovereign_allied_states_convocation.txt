With strong militaries to defend us, gifted intellectuals dedicated to advance us, power house economies to support us, and the people whose unending patriotism, loyalty, and dedication gives us the strength and might to be able to call our self&amp;#39;s sovereign states and continue on to withstand the test of time. We are dedicated to the agenda and goals of our people, workers, soldiers, leaders, and to overall that of our country. As allies in this convocation we shall stand strong against any who dare to infringe on our rights to live as we are and will not yield to those who actively seek out to destroy us. Glory To The S.A.S.C.!
