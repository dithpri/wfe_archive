Tebbec is a small but hard-working region, in which everyone&#39;s opinion is taken into account. Democracy is not required, however it is encouraged that you at least be co-operative with the other countries in the region, for the betterment of us all.


If you have any questions or ideas of how to improve the region, please send a letter to the [i]President of the Tebbec Commission[/i] in [nation]Endoax[/nation]. (PM me.)
