From the destruction of Aukum, arises a new leader, the Werefrog.

The Werefrog is a glorious leader. By day he is a normal person, going about his dictatorial business as usual, but by night, he becomes a frog. He hops though the streets and legal loops of his kingdom, acting as a vigilante, preventing crime on a mass scale.

Know body knows where the Werefrog exactly came from, but legend says, a man was bitten by a frog, and then became the Werefrog... probably.

The Werefrog rules with an iron fist, but has a kind heart. He will listen to all your wishes and demands, and act upon them justly.
