The Glorious D&amp;#39;Haran Empire:
The D&amp;#39;Haran Empire consisted of the whole of Weyland-Yutani Company, and all the lands of the Genevian Empire that willingly joined with Weylnad-Yutani Company, whose armies defend the Empire against the Old Genevian Empire.
It is ruled by Lord Charles Bishop Rahl Weyland, who upon discovering the invasion of the Borderlands of Eastern Pandora, and subsequently, Schrodopolis, took Acheron, rallied the Genevian Empire, created the D&amp;#39;Haran Empire, and brought all the military under one command: D&amp;#39;Haran Empire Army.
