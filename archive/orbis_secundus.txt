[b]Welcome to [color=teal]Orbis Secundus[/color]![/b]

Feel free to pour yourself a cup of tea and make yourself at home!

We&#39;re a roleplaying region about relatively modern humans colonising an age-of-sail planet that, curiously enough, is also inhabited by humans. Our roleplay is currently underway!

We are currently filling out the solar system with planets. If you have an idea for a planet, take a look [url=http://i.imgur.com/AYp2SZC.png]here[/url] to see which planets are available and telegram me a suggestion.

Just a note to new members: Please come up with your own information on your nation, we don&#39;t use the stats and descriptions that NationStates generates.
