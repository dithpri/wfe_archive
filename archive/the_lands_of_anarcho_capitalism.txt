Here are the lands that hold liberty as the highest importance. Free markets rule the land, in societies where people are free to live their own lives. People are expected to interact voluntarily and without agression.

To be welcomed to this region, your nation [b]must[/b] follow these rules:

1) 100% Private sector.
2) High or extremely high &amp;quot;Civil Rights&amp;quot;.
3) No World Assembly membership.

[b]Additionally you must not post any offensive remarks on the message board. Anything other than peaceful discussion, as should be expected from anarcho-capitalists, will be met with zero tolerance.[/b]

[b]Have an iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad?
