[b][color=444ec4]A shoal of sharks from the North Pacific Ocean ventured into the greater ocean for their routine feeding time today to see what they could find. With great big teeth and very fast reflexes, they found no difficulties in getting food. Once they had filled up their bellies, the sharks retreated back into the North Pacific Ocean, ready for their next hunting excursion. If you happen to be a shark and would like to join our shoal, join the shark division of the north pacific army[/b][/color]  [url=https://forum.thenorthpacific.org/topic/9145375/post-8176250][b][color=444ec4]here[/color][/b][/url].
