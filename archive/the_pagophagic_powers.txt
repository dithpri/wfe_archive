March Sixteenth, Twenty Thirteen, a date which will live in infamy - the The Pagophagic Powers were suddenly and deliberately attacked by the Block Ridas. I believe I interpret the will of the Powers and of their people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again, so help us God.
