Welcome to the Parliamentary Republic of the Natan Region, otherwise known as the [region]Natan Region[/region] Government-in-exile. In protest of the Natan Region Government&#39;s refusal to accept our belief that the region should operate under the parliamentary system, we have formed our own government, currently in exile here in Harboria, after having our movement kicked out of the Natan Region.

Prime Minister of the Natan Region: [nation]Gorthis[/nation]

We will hold elections when more people join.
