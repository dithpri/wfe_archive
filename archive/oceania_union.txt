The [color=blue]OU[/color], or Oceania Union, is a unique economic and political partnership between 19 Oceanic countries. The [color=blue]OU[/color] was created in the aftermath of the Third Oceanic War. The first steps were to foster economic cooperation: the idea being that countries who trade with one another become economically interdependent and so more likely to avoid conflict. The result was the [color=blue]OU[/color], and initially increasing economic cooperation between Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and Somoa. Since then, a huge single market has been created and continues to develop towards its full potential.
