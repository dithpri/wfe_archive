So called because of the numerous yak herds that rove throughout the area, Yak&amp;#39;s Bend is the last refuge for travelers who are about to undertake the rough passage through the Shiverpeaks. Because of its lower altitude, the weather here is somewhat less harsh, providing a place to rest, regroup, and re-equip.
