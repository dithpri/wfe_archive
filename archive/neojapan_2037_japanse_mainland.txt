The year is 2037 and a lot has changed, global warming has taken its worst tolls on coastlines worldwide and droughts have ravaged the American Midwest. Sea levels rising due to global warming has meant that Japan has resorted to building HRHD (High Rise-High Density) cities covering 76.49% of the Japanese islands due to the shrinking amount of land capable of being used due to global warming. The Okazuyishi Metropolitan Area boasts the second highest population of any Japanese city with Tokyo being number one still. It also has the highest autonomy alike all major Japanese HRHD&amp;#39;s, of which 95% host their own governments.
