Welcome to The Demonuist Haildom! 
We are a loose collection of people who played this game a year ago, and now only log in once every 30 days!

NEWS
--------
We were invaded, and crushed! As our new Delegate and Supreme Leader, [nation]Squagnar[/nation] has cobbled together the remains and taken the region back!

We are now password protected! I will NOT be giving anyone the password other than those already here (Not that any decent person wants to get in anyways.)

All features that [nation]Squagnar[/nation] controls are subject to constant and unexplained changes.
