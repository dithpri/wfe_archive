A man rides in, on a dark horse. He holds scales in his hands. He faces the red horse. He holds the sword of Liberation in his palm. Hark! He rides! For Us! He rides to conquer, as he has a thousand times before!

He has liberated us! Love him! He is the leader of Old, freeing us the yoke of Liberal Ruling, and Religous freedom! May he bring an era of Totaltarian Peace. 

Clava!
