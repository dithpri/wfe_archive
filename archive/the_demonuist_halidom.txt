Rules of RP:
1. I will allow battles to be fought by the people fighting them with no admin control. If you make yourself O.P, or do something impossible (Light calvary breaks spears) Then I will be forced to put restrictions on, which I don&amp;#39;t want to do.
2. One day is 1 month in game. An army can walk 200 Km in one month. (This is actually way higher, but I dont want a boring game.) A navy can move 300 Km a month.
3. One vassal per nation. This vassal should be a vassal, and not larger then yourself.
4. Seiging. Small cities: 1 month to starve out. Medium cities: 2 months to starve out. Large cities: 4 months.
5. Have fun! If you want me to add more rules, let me know.
