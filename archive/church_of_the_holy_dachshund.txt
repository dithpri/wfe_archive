Are you tired of religious intolerance?

If so, [b][color=blue]Join the Church of the Holy Dachshund.[/color]

We understand that religious violence is far too common in human history, and therefore have created an entirely new silly parody religion in the name of our Holy Father Dachshund to counter religious extremism in all forms.

This region is only for fun, and we do not mean any offence to any people or beliefs.

Peoples of all faiths are weclcome. :)
