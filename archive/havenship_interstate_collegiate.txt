The Havenship Interstate Collegiate is a non-governmental consulting agency made up of bureaucrats, scientists, researchers and members of private and state corporations, as well as many other NGO representatives or even diplomats from other countries. They assemble monthly to discuss the current state of the Three Nations, report on scientific, economical, cultural and social advances and award prizes in the many fields of science, art and social justice.
They often provide an alternate viewpoint on various issues that the government may have overlooked, aiding in the decision processes so that all sides are heard and only the most objectively good decisions are taken, most of the time.
