[i]Welcome to the [b][color=#FFD200]League of[/color] [color=purple]The Mediterranean[/color][/b].[/i]

[u][b]Who are we?[/b][/u]
The League of The Mediterranean above all serves as a hearth for free and uncensored speech. We believe in the ancient Greco-Roman systems/standards of Republicanism and Democracy so that tyranny may never prevail over the sovereign and independent islands, archipelagos, and nations that we host. We believe that the questioning of authority, audible opinions, as well as fair, public, just, and uncorrupted elections, are the tenets that keep us united.
