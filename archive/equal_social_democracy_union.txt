This equal Social Democratic region ceased to exist after it&amp;#39;s Founder ceased to exist. 

To prevent this region from being seized and refounded by Fascists and Nazis, this region has been refounded and taken into the care of [region]The Internationale[/region] as an anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi protection operation.

[region]Equal Social Democracy Union[/region] lives once more, and [region]The Internationale[/region] will respect [region]Equal Social Democracy Union[/region]&amp;#39;s independence as a region while making sure it stays safe from raiders, invaders, Fascists and Nazis.
