Ereaan is a Futuristic RP Region based on an Earth-Like planet many light years from Earth.

Contact with Earth is null and is expected to be in disarray. Though, with those issues currently irrelevant, war flourishes on Ereaan with devastating effects not seen before in the Real World. Though WMDs are non-existent with the lack of necessary resources required to create them but despite that conflicts are even more common with no deterrent.
Star ships are in low supply with people who can afford to create them quickly swatted down by Military Powers though low-orbit engagements are not uncommon.

Planetary Date: 2385.
