United Nations is a region dedicated to ensure the prosperity of the nations within it&amp;#39;s boundaries.  

The nations will work unitedly to assist each other in their efforts to provide a better living for their citizens.

We will propose resolutions to both the Security Council and General Assembly to provide highly needed legislation. We will also attempt to repeal all resolutions deemed to have an negative impact on our communities. 

We will provide alternatives to each resolution we attempt to repeal and those others seek to repeal. We will work with our fellow regions to get high priority resolutions passed and those unneeded repealed.
