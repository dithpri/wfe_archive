The settlements in this region, founded initially by their metropoleis (mother cities), eventually evolved into strong Greek city-states (poleis), functioning independently. The settlers brought with them their Hellenic civilization, and developed their own civilisation, due to the distance from the motherland and the influence of the indigenous peoples of southern Italia which left a lasting imprint on it. They also influenced the native peoples, such as the Sicels and the Oenotrians, who became hellenised after they adopted the Greek culture as their own. In some fields such as architecture and urban planning, they sometimes surpassed the mother country. The ancient inhabitants of Magna Graecia are called Italiotes and Siceliotes.
