The Far Western Nations of Dominea (FWND) are a localized group of nation-states that influence each other in many ways. Trade is the primary relationship between each nation with The Lythynian Empire using its military superiority to &quot;persuade&quot; it&#39;s neighbors to support its Economic actions. The Republics of Senturria and Giosue supply the regions with ample economic prosperity while demonstrating high levels of political freedom. The Theocracy of Thyssel is one nation that stands out amongst its fellow nations. It struggles in almost every measure possible being completely backward in most regards. The Theocracy has much to fear from its FWND contemporaries as its territory is ripe for the taking.
