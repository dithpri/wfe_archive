Vinland survived to create a lasting Scandinavian presence in Canada, be enough of a success that word comes out; More Vikings actually show up to sustain the colony in North America. Peace is maintained between the Vikings and Native Americans just enough for Vikings to be enticed to sail to the land of wine. A war broke out between their two peoples some time later - ending in Scandinavian Victory as the Vikings sustain their foothold in the continent. Vinland by now has a reputation a far-off land with strange natives but full of grapes to make wine from. Greenland becomes a pitiful struggling colony and bad winters forced the Vikings off as Greenlandic refugees fled to Canada.
