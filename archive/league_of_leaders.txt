This region, formally an unlikely alliance between The Holy Empire of the New Order Hierarchy and The United Socialist States of BernSandia, was created to further our impact on the world and to connect with other states. NOH, a authoritarian and militaristic state, offered military stability while BernSandia, a socialist democracy, lead the charge on peaceful foreign policy. The hope for this region is that we can become a great example of leadership through out the world.
