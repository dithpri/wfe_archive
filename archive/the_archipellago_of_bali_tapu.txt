This region is comprised of many vastly rural islands covered in thick jungles and canopies. The fish is plentiful, and natural resources have yet to be exploited. The majority of the population in this region belongs to many independent chiefdoms. The Kingdom of Bali-Sumat, a modernizing and up-and-coming nation, resides on the largest island of Sumatra, and is approximately 150 miles from the coastline of Bali, a much larger land mass that is separate form the region.
