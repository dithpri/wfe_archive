Hello everyone, Thank you for joining my region. If you&amp;#39;re wondering about the history of this land, well here it is: Britain Equestria was founded by 3 wonderful alicorns from Britain that wanted to explore the world. After many days of travling they found this land and wanted to explore no longer. So they settled down and even invited other ponies to come and live with them. Finally there were so many ponies that settled there, that they decided to make this land a region, and of course since they were from Britain, they decided to call it Britain Equestria.
