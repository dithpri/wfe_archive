[color=red][i][b]SUMMARY[/b][/i][/color]
The [b]New[/b] Essential AntiFascist Alliance is a region dedicated to overcoming fascism and bigotry worldwide. We promote a green outlook, with only the most humanitarian morals tolerated. We prefer to be a peaceful region, but we are very willing to decimate any offending right-wing hell holes.

[color=red][i][b]WHO WE INCLUDE[/b][/i][/color]
We prefer anarchist paradises and communist regimes for the most part. You must be a left-wing nation.

[i]Note: We vote for administration positions quarterly (every 3 months).[/i]
