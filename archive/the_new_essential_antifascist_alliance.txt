[b]Under the control of the United Conservative Alliance[/b]

[Color=red]Originally a dead region, the UCA Army has seen it within the interests of the region to refound it. Even now we continue to selflessly protect it from raiders.

Its original goal was to protect those against the evils of fascism and anything right-wing. But now it has a new goal: Join the [region]United Conservative Alliance[/region] region. Become a part of our regional armed forces.

Together we will fight against the evils of authoritarianism, whether fascist, communist, anarchistic mobocracy, etc.[/color]
