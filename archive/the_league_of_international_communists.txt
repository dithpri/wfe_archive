the LIC is dedicated to its goals of global and international communism. we welcome all communist nations and consider all of our nations as comrades. we welcome all nations with a place in politics, but urge them to join the WA first. we rarely ban nations, although invaders, fascists, and capitalists will be banned. inappropriate messages on the board will be deleted. other than that, enjoy the freedoms of communism here.

MAY THE WORKERS UNITE!
