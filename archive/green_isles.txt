[b]This region has been temporarily captured by the [region]Europeia[/region][color=green]n[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=blue]Navy[/color]!

The Europeian flag has green in it. [nation=short]Magentafairy[/nation] was the only lady on board. [i]AGAIN[/i]. [nation=short]Cerian Quilor[/nation] almost counts as a lady, though. [nation=short]Drexlore[/nation] is still playing lute somewhere in the background. [nation=short]SPQR[/nation]....is awesome. *swoon* Super special thanks to [nation=short]Leutria[/nation], as he was the only one who endoed in time to save this operation! And I...am [nation]Elias Greyjoy[/nation], and this is not the last you will hear of Europeia.

Thanks to [region]Kantrias[/region] and [region]The New Inquisition[/region] for participating yet again!

Come visit our [url=http://s6.zetaboards.com/Europeia/index/]community forums[/url]. Please? FINE, I HATE IT HERE ANYWAY.
