Welcome to [region]The Burning Hole[/region], a whole region built as a large tavern. 

[nation]The Pubmaster[/nation] is, as the name suggests, the kind fellow behind the bar and owner of this fine establishment. He&amp;#39;ll hear your stories of grandeur and keep you company along with the other bar dwellers that may be within.
 
[nation]The Burning Hole Tavern[/nation] is our very own mobile tavern and appears to regions as its drunken pilot sees fit. They&amp;#39;ll try and keep the drink cold and conversation going.
