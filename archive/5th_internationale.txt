Greetings to the Workers and Peasants of the World!

Are you tired of Capitalist oppression?
Do you loathe the mega-corporations that are ruining your country and our planet?
Do you want to live in a better, fairer, and just system?

Then join the 5th Internationale!

We welcome comrades from any corner of the globe, for it is only us alone who will wipe bourgeois society from the face of this Earth!

Workers and Peasants of the World;
Your liberation is here!
For you have nothing but chains to lose,
And a whole World to gain!
