The 5th Internationale is the final breach of socialism. Syndicalism has taken back as the dominant form of socialism, however others are welcomed too. It is generally heavy anti-authoritarian, and rejects the ideas if Leninism, Maoism, and other various heavily statist ideologies. The 5th Internationale was revived with the second coming of radical unionism and the heavily leftist power of Galaeveria.
