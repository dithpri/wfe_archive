Amyong Mr was a large and somewhat prosperous region in the continent of Urinu. However, it was plagued with poverty and massive income equality. When potential communist threats began to rise in the region, some major capitalist powers began backing coup d&#39;&eacute;tats in the country. Among the most successful was the Yr Mun, lead by somewhat popular leader Barlo Ylarlo. He created the dictatorship of Banyam Nn, which quickly became one of the biggest powers in the region.

The region is in a constant state of war, with various communist groups fighting against the more facist confederates.

Perhaps you can bring order to this war torn region? Or maybe you&#39;ll join the increasing number of dicatorships that plague the states.
