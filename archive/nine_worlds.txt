[b]Old Norse texts mention the existence of N&iacute;u Heimar, translated by scholars as &#147;Nine Worlds.&#148; These nine worlds encompass Niflheim, Muspelheim, Asgard, Midgard, Jotunheim, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Svartalfheim and Helheim, all held in the branches and roots of the world tree Yggdrasil. We are also a region of family members and close friends too.[/b]
