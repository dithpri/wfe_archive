[b]Welcome to Freedom![/b]

Freedom is one of NationStates&#39; longest-standing regions. Long before the concept of Founders existed, this was a bustling hive of activity. We had exciting debates and delegate elections. We&#39;ve survived invasions and even a hostile refounding. We had fun!

Today, Freedom is a monument to bygone glories. If you&#39;re a lover of freedom like us, and you think you could have a stab at running a region - get in touch, I&#39;d be delighted to support someone who&#39;d like to be delegate and revive the mighty Freedom.

Until then - or the day the servers shut down for the last time, whichever happens first - I&#39;ll be standing guard. Raiders come and go; freedom is forever.

[b]Freedom is free, and free it shall remain![/b]
