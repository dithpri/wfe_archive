&quot;The air of England is too pure for a slave to breathe, and so everyone who breathes it becomes free. Everyone who comes to this island is entitled to the protection of English law, whatever oppression he may have suffered and whatever may be the colour of his skin.&quot;
William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, British judge, speaking on slavery, 1772
