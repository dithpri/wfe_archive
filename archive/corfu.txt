[b]The Isle of the Phaeacians[/b]

Named for the mythological nymph [i]Korkyra[/i], daughter of the nymph [i]Metope[/i] and the river god [i]Asopos[/i].
[i]Korkyra[/i] was captured by [i]Poseidon[/i] who brought her to Corfu and gave her name to the island.

The emblem of the rudderless ship is a testament to the maritime prowess of the Phaeacians, and the modern Corfiots.

The name [u]Corfu[/u] comes into English from the Italian [u]Corf&ugrave;[/u], a rendering of the Medieval Greek [u]&amp;#922;&amp;#959;&amp;#961;&amp;#965;&amp;#966;&amp;#974;[/u].


[b]9th April 2021:[/b] [i]Rest in Peace Prince Philip, born on Corfu in 1921[/i]
