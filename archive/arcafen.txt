Hi Dudes and Dudettes! 

I&#39;m [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=united_vinceland]Vincent[/url] and this is my Card Hunting Clones&#39; Region. 

[i]Why ArCaFeN? 

Cause life&#39;s a series of chemical and electrical reactions and Ar, Ca, Fe and N are chemical elements I like the combination of. :) 

Anyways I&#39;m [nation]United Vinceland[/nation], [nation]Legolas Thranduilion[/nation], [nation]V I N C E N T[/nation] in [region]Texas[/region] and all the Card Hunting Clones in [region]ArCaFen[/region] :) 

June 28: Someone asked why I bought a few copies of the same card: My whole family plays NS &amp; there&#39;s 5 of us. So If I buy 5 copies of a card I&#39;m keeping 1 card and giving the other 4 cards to my two brothers ([url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=a_r_i_a_n]Arian[/url] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=gileadavia]Emmett[/url]), my Mom ([url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=quetzalleia]Leia[/url]) and my Dad ([url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=v_e_r_n_e_r]Verner[/url]).[/i]
