[i]The Volkshalle is at the northern end of the Prachtallee, on a north-south boulevard originally planned by German Emperor William II in 1895. The dome of the Volkshalle rises from a massive granite podium to a total inclusive height of 290m, and diameter of 250m. 

Inside the Volkshalle, there is a massive apse, covered with gold mosaics and enclosing a giant silver statue of the Reichsadler, beneath which is situated the F&uuml;hrer&#39;s tribunal. From there, in three concentric tiers of seats crowned by one hundred marble pillars, 180,000 people can hear the F&uuml;hrer.[/i]
