Welcome to New Algerheaven. 
We&#39;re a region built up by loyalists and remnants of the old Alger Successor regime or better known as the Arab regime in Algerheaven. 
We mourn the death of the Emperor Algerstonia I, and we claim as the true successor state of Algerheaven. 
Long live Algerheaven, long live the successor.
