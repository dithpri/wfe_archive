The Seven Starr Alliance is a multinational, intergalactic organization from the First Gigaquadrant, a location in an entirely different universe, home to many grand and powerful civilizations and empires. The Seven Starr Alliance strives for peace and unity in this universe and all universes, however, nowadays, it merely serves as a conduit for Gigaquadrantic interests in Universe NS.

This colony was founded by the Republic of Cyrandia many years ago. When the Republic fell due to internal power reworkings back in the Gigaquadrant, the Tybusen gained power. This changed however, when Cyrandia returned.
