Are you a black nationalist who wants to make black people Kangz again? Are you a German who hates how the treaty of Versailles destroyed you colonial ambitions? Do you idolise Cecil Rhodes and wish to restore the British Empire in Africa? Are you an Afrikaner who unironically believes that Nelson Mandela was worse than Hitler? Are you a white millennial that wants to make amends with the Africans? Are you Alberto Barbosa? Then the Afrikan Colonial Department is the region for you! Exploit developing nations, reinstate apartheid, or make Rhodesia great again, anything&#39;s possible with colonialism. To get started, just select the territory you&#39;d like to control on our map (this must be approved by our founder, the Palmerian Gold Coast).
