[region]Eocacira[/region] - A small island continent with rolling green hills, snow-peaked mountains, windswept plains and white sand beaches.
A small, uninhabited atoll lays off of the eastern coast of the main isle, formally named the Saint Sarah Atoll

The regional government of Eocacira is very hands-off in the specific governing of member-nations, the only real initiative put forward is the regional currency, the [i]Eocaciran Mark[/i]; an entirely voluntary opt-in.

**Eocacira is a pro [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url] region, thus the regional government finds that it would further regional cohesion if member-nations were also WA Members.**
