[region]Eocacira[/region] - An Island-continent with rolling green hills, snow-peaked mountains, windswept plains and white sand beaches.

Oriamont; the capital of [nation]Stregua[/nation], also hosts the regional council.
The regional council of Eocacira is hands-off in the specific governing of member-nations, the only real initiative put forward is the regional currency, the Eocaciran Mark; an entirely voluntary opt-in.

**Eocacira is a pro [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url] region, thus the regional government finds that it would further regional cohesion if member-nations were also WA Members.**
