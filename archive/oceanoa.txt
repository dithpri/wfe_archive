Oceanoa is a region of conserving your Nations ideals, limited supranational interference is better for every nation. We should conduct ourselves our own legislations and not feel forced or influenced by some political authority outside our own nations.

It is important to communicate with the World Assembly, but we shall not be governed by their ideals. The crown, the leader, the elected official, the dictator, the founder and all other leaderships should come before the WA for each Nation. 

At its core Oceanoa is about;
- Freedom of Ideology.
- Freedom of Criticism.
- Independent sovereignty for each nation to truly thrive in.
- Protecting culture and historical significance of all Nations (to whatever extent the nations choose).
