Unholy creatures have escaped from [region]The Black Hawks[/region]&#39;s secret laboratory! These rabbit-hawk hybrids are designed to be ruthless animals, and now that they&#39;re in an uncontrolled environment they are capable of invading the entire planet, spreading poisonous chocolate eggs far and wide. This region&#39;s entire ecosystem has been destroyed by these... things. Oops.
Codenames of the escapees:
Private First Class [nation]Bedetopia[/nation] (pack leader)
Sergeant [nation]Felt Karpit[/nation]
Sergeant [nation]Qonon[/nation]
