Medatlanti is an island in the middle of the Atlantic, and home of the ancestors of Romans who left Europe in the dark ages. It is a diverse region, ideologically and ethnically. In the north-east lies Atlassea, home to the liberal people who are a combination of Norse and Latin decent. There are the native Medatlantians in the East, most living inside the United Socialist States of Lanark. However the majority Roman-descended peoples mostly live in the old Kingdoms of New Rome and Praetoria, who used to dominate the island.
