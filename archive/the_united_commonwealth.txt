The United Commonwealth is a region based on an alternate-history modern world, in which all superpowers have dissolved and including some different nations, represented by our members, but with the same geography. The regional members may be located anywhere IC, but are united under one constitution that sets up an international federation government, in which all may take part -- though members can still administer their internal affairs, diplomacy, defense, trade, and so on, subject to a few limits imposed by the United Commonwealth&amp;#39;s representatives. For the details of UC law passed thus far, and for official membership, territory claims, voting, intra-regional RP, etc., please visit our offsite forum, linked below.
