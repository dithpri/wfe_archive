Otherwise known as ICON (ha ha, witty anagrams), the International Concord of Nations is an intergovernmental organization founded on April 4, 2021 by Nizhanhou, to serve as its sort of UN-esque entity. In meta terms, I created this region to serve as the home of communications and organization for the select nations in the RP world I have created as well as one in which some friends partake in. It will hence include nations that are created by me and maybe of others, depending on whether those nations agree to enter into ICON.

By nature, this region is pretty much exclusive, but feel free to interact at discretion, until further notices.

This is the second iteration. This one has a &quot;The&quot; in the name. The first one did not.
