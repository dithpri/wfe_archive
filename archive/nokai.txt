[b]Nokai is a desert wasteland planet where the kyldellian libertarians have settled for a new life. It is a tax haven world where people move away from other kyldellian nations with insanely high tax rates that The Founder, [nation]Kyldellian Halon[/nation], has established to allow them to relocate here. The people here enjoy and experience capitalism, with little to no taxes, and let&#146;s not forget REAL freedom.[/b]
