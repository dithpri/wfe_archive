We are the Holy European Empire. Founded by our Emperor King Silvetine I after he left the Imperialist Union. We are an Empire based on the ideals of strong governmental influence, strong regional economics, and strong military. We welcome all new and established nations. If you are a new nation and wish to grow and become a powerful nation than join us. If you are established and are tired of the politics of the region that you are in then come to our region and help shape it. Long Live the Emperor!
