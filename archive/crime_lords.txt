This is a very respectable group of nations, all varying in many ways but all getting along in the long run. Not every nation is allowed and those who are should be proud to be part of this wonderful region. Free or not each nation in the Crime Lords region is allowed to govern how they want and the Crime Lord authority does not interfere at all. Welcome to your new region fellow rulers.
