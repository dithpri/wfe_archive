Welcome to Technocopia, an Anarcho-cybernetic network of Self-determining associated populations who strive to achieve cybernetic socialism without overarching bureaucracy and authoritarian governance and seek to Automate all things that can be automated to eliminate the need for individual employment. 

Technocopia maintains no standing army but is instead defended by a heavily distributed synchronous network of Machines.
