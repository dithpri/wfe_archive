A quiet socially conservative region. Tradition, morality and common sense prevail. From mixed economies to rampant free-market tax havens all traditionally-minded nations are welcome. Nations are welcome to participate however they feel comfortable. We do not encourage raiding or raiders. However we are not a defender region either. The region is committed to total freedom of speech. However those attempting to censor or &#39;shame&#39; others for their views will face a ban. No real world sports discussion though.

We reject the authority of the World Assembly and Security Council as Liberal/Communist bodies.

A constitution will be published in the next few days along with a Criminal Code.
