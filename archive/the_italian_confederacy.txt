Buongiorno, signore e signori! 
Welcome to our region! All members of this region share a passion for Italy, whether it is because of the food, because of the people, or anything else! So far, we&#39;re a fairly small region, but we hope to grow in the future! So far, a discord server has been instated, and we plan to create other fun activities and platforms to partake in! Of course, any nation would be allowed to join, and again, once more nations have joined the Confederacy, regular Delegate elections will be held.

To all regions: feel free to propose an embassy; we love meeting other people!
