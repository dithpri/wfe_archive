[b]  EWU [/b] was founded back in 2003 by a group of friends on the 7th floor of Streeter Hall. Over the years many have left, but one original member remains-Weitzel.

I am still friends with most of the people that once had nations here.  However, one member passed away unexpectedly Feb 7, 2009. Her love for politics and her passion for lively debate, and her friendship will forever be missed by those that knew her.

While my friends are gone, I have faithfully logged in for over 8 years. I keep my account alive for one simple reason-because it keeps alive the memories that I cherish and miss dearly.

For Kris, Brad, Jeanette, and all the others that have come and gone from this game and this world-this is for you. :-)
