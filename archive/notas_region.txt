[b]What&#39;s that ticking sound, you ask? Why, it&#39;s the carefully synchronized watches of participants in tonight&#39;s [color=red]Raidercon[/color] trigger battle!

With clockwork precision, we stormed into this region, and converted it into the perfect party venue - complete with refreshments, a dance floor, and a DJ booth! (We would have opted for live music, but nobody wanted to listen to a metronome again for at least a week)
