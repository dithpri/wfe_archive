[B]The United Sovereign States of Finland[/B] stand in unity and in freedom together. The members of the region have [i]full autonomy[/i] and are only united in their representation to the World Assembly and to the other regions. 

Recently the region has been liberated from the invading Black Riders who usurped the position of the World Assembly Delegate by brute force. [nation]Western-Ukraine[/nation] has assumed control of the region after ban-ejecting the usurpers. 

New members of the region must endorse Western-Ukraine or they will be ejected with a warning from the region. For reasons of stability the position of the WA-delegate must be held by the founder. [B]No further comment on this.[/B]
