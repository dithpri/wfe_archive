In 4000bc a Prophet was born in a small fishing village. He told of a man who would one day be born. The prophet said this man would unify the coastal tribes into a grand and Shining coastal Empire. 
In 2000bc this man came and the first Holy Emperor rose to power.  The Empire became a Shining beacon of hope in a dark hopeless region. In 23ad the Empire reached out to its allies and offered to absorb them for greater security and a stronger regional economy.

With the  death of the original Emperor, Palatine has risen to reshape the empire into something greater.
