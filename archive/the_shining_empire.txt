[b][i][color=blue]CONGRATULATIONS!![/color][/i]

Your region has been invaded by [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] in a surprisingly amusing training exercise. Without joining [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], this is the highest status you will ever achieve in NationStates.

To celebrate your newfound glory, we invite you to join in [url=s1.zetaboards.com/Invader_Haven/index/]on the forums[/url] as honorary wolves or hang out on the RMB discussing how the growing student loan debt bubble, subprime auto loans silliness, incumbent-less election year madness, and somewhat plump markets will [i]make puts on SPY great again.[/i]

Thank you again for your hospitality and let me know how you want me to vote on this WA nonsense.
