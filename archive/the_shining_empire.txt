In 4000bc a Prophet was born in a small fishing village. He told of a man who would one day be born. The prophet said this man would unify the coastal tribes into a grand and Shining coastal Empire. 
In 2000bc this man came and the first Holy Emperor rose to power. The Empire became a Shining beacon of hope in a dark hopeless region. In 23ad the Empire reached out to its allies and offered to absorb them for greater security and a stronger regional economy.
Now I the 400th Emperor call my nobles from all across the Empire. We face new evils in our world
We now must choose to liberate the oppressed. And shine our beacon of hope upon the evil of our world. Join the good fight and end evil once and for all. We are liberators
