The Haven Pact is a Region in the true sense. There is no Political inclination. You do not have to be Socialist or fascist or Democratic. You are free to be whatever you wish to be. All we ask is a commitment to the Role-play of the Region.

Any nations interested in joining the Haven Pact should contact a permanent Nation.
