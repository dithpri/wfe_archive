[u][b][i]THE FEDERATION OF NATIONS[/i][/b][/u]

The Federation of Nations is a Region, mostly focussed on Roleplay, which plays in modern time. The roleplay is based around the Council of Nations, something like the UN. And altough the Region will have offices to administrate the Region, most of the Decisions will be made in the Residents Council, where all nations have a voice to decide.
