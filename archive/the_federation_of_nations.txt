All political systems are welcome here as long as you&#39;re willing to work for the common good. The Federation is looking for strong nations with leaders willing to make the tough decisions that come with government. We will not tolerate cheating nor will we tolerate rudeness toward others. Having different opinions is one thing but civility should always be the priority. We roleplay as our nation&#39;s, hold elections, and just chat!
