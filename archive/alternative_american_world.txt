This world is based where, none of the colonies get independent, and France, England, Spain, Netherlands, Russia, and Portugal. These colonies waged a series of wars, called the Colony Wars, thus making space available to others to make their own nation, and these nations will try to survive in a world of super powers. The technology in this world only go to WW1 standards, as many things in history have not happened. WW1 was also alternative, it was finished fast because of the extra troops that were available in the colonies. WW1 was apart of the Colony Wars, and now that the superpowers are weaker from the war, other nations can pop up and claim independence.
