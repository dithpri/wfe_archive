Welcome to Mon Sagnus, &quot;The Planes of Dawn&quot;.

This region is currently a work in progress, and will hopefully be up and running soon.

The region will start in the 7th or 8th century with a semi-fantasy theme. This is a somewhat serious region, so no &quot;republic of the great meme&quot; or garbage like that. Try to have some form of dark ages/high fantasy name for your nation.
