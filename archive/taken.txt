A post-apocalyptic region and/or alternate universe reality.  You and your fellow survivors were plucked from your world (or were YOU left behind) and everyone else was taken?  Also in this region are other survivors taken from their reality and suddenly transported here.  A mix of people (and possibly beings) from various timelines and universes.

Also includes a RISK type system for battle and conquest to complement the role play by post.  At the time of this writing the world is extremely chaotic, reality is in flux and it&#39;s all a huge work in progress.  Welcome to the world of Taken.
