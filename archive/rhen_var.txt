Rhen Var (also known as the Forest of Var and the Sanctuary Forest) is a heavily wooded forest lying on the outskirts of a giant tellurium field and is the nearest known settlement to the field. An enchanting region, it unfortunately winds up playing host to many wars. Due to its proximity to the Unknown Regions, Rhen Var is a relatively quiet forest both prior to and after battles. Rhen Var is also known for the vast amount of sentient species it supports, from baseline to exotic. This is largely due to the unusually large number of plane wrecks Rhen Var experiences, scientists tend to blame the magnetic field created by the tellurium fields nearby.
