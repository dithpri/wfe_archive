[color=blue][b]Greetings! You have stumbled into the NationStates Court of Regional Disputes (NSCRD), a region dedicated to settling legal disputes in a fair and legal manner. We are a very new region, however, we are working on developing a fair system of how to settle disputes between regions. Our initial ideas can be found below, in the pinned dispatch. If you&#39;re interested in helping to develop these ideas or want to serve on our panel of judges, feel free to move to this region![/b][/color]
