The Union of Caribbean States (UCS) is an international government designed to bring democracy and freedom to all. Similar to EU, UCS states grant their own citizens UCS citizenship. With UCS citizenship comes the rights of free movement and residence, freedom from discrimination on nationality, and rights to consular protection from the UCS and all UCS states. As a new region, opportunities are boundless- all you have to do is step up.
