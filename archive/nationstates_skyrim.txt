[b][color=blue]Skyrim in NationStates![/color][i] [color=purple][u]The Travelling Khajit Caravan of Khajit Card Puppets.[/u][/color][/i] [color=blue]I&#39;m [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=a_r_i_a_n]Arian[/url] and I&#39;m farming some Epic cards for me and my brothers Vince and Emmett and our Mom and Dad. And Legendary cards for myself unless it&#39;s a [region]Texas[/region] nation card cause that goes to my bro Vince&#39;s [region]Texas[/region] collection. Lastly I might donate ultra rare or lower rarity cards to other people in [region]Texas[/region] if I know what they&#146;re collecting cause otherwise I&#146;m scrapping those cards unless me and my family wants them for our own collections. 

I misspelled Khajiit as Khajit and that&#39;s how I ended up with twice as many card puppets as I wanted. :p[/color][/b]
