This is the Era of change! In this fast moving world, even the smallest country has to change to stay afloat! But if we all bond together, as a &amp;quot;raft&amp;quot; of nations, together we can change our world for the better! Join our region and together we shall make this happen! 

The EPC (the eratovan peninsula council) votes on all matters from the trivial to the extremities of all out war (witch we hope shall never have to be implemented). The council consists of all member states.

We are a territory of The CSSR
