This is the Cyber Union. The only inhabitants are the Cybermen, a &amp;#39;race&amp;#39; of Cybernetically augmented humans who are completely robotic apart from an Emotionless brain incapable of Empathy, feeling pain or reasoning beyond it&amp;#39;s orders. Crime does not exist as the entire population is linked mentally and is programmed to be loyal to the Controller and obey their Programming rules. The entire population IS the military and scientists. No political parties exist as everyone thinks alike. Because Cybermen do not sleep (Although they &amp;#39;hibernate&amp;#39; in ice tombs to preserver power if none is available) means that they are always one guard. 

This is a region allowed only for Cybernetic Nations. We are unified to survive.
