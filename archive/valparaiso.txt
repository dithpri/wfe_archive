Valpara&iacute;so: City, central Chile. The colonial city of Valpara&iacute;so presents an excellent example of late 19th-century urban and architectural development in Latin America. In its natural amphitheatre-like setting, the city is characterized by a vernacular urban fabric adapted to the hillsides that are dotted with a great variety of church spires. It contrasts with the geometrical layout utilized in the plain. The city has well preserved its interesting early industrial infrastructures, such as the numerous &#145;elevators&#146; on the steep hillsides. &#151;whc.unesco.org
