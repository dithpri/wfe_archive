We are here because some shrubbery seemed to have pointed us here. (Thanks shrubbery!)
We can&#39;t tell which group last claimed this region, so we can&#39;t give any final credits. So we&#39;ll fly a shrubbery flag instead, hoo-hoo!

In any case, the Messengers of Truth have arrived here and we would now like to retire it. Sometimes this takes some time, so help us by not making it take longer than it needs to.

To learn more about the benefits of retiring trophy regions, please read the dispatch below.
