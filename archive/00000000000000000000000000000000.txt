[url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=0000]Interesting[/url], they didn&#39;t beat me to this one, eh?

Puppet storage for [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=addy_and_arielle]the illusive Addy[/url] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=out_of_control_addy_and_arielle]Arielle[/url] and yes they&#39;re the same person since it&#39;s only one person running those two nations. Whatever, the lights are [color=lightblue][b][font=arial black]luminescent[/font][/b][/color] and stuff, so... still a puppet storage. Those lights will never change color, I just know it. It&#39;s in my [color=maroon][font=arial]veins[/font][/color] n stuff. Or not... \_[-:]_/ [font=m]AND WHY DOES THE FONT KEEP CHANGING[/font]
