The grand region of Woot Vin has a long and storied history, including several centuries spent as a large empire sprawling across the known world, but due to a combination of local and economic issues (including the unsustainability of conquest-based economies over time), the Empire of Woot Vin became several individual nations of Woot Vin.

Here within the region, you will find the various nations, all of whom share the lire as their currency, and some species of emu as their national animal.
