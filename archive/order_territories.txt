This region is exclusively controlled by a single state: The Empire of Sovereign Order (The First Order). It serves as the sole territory and stronghold of this totalitarian regime, which emerged from the remnants of a collapsed democratic galaxy. No other countries exist or are recognized within this region.

The First Order exercises absolute control over all political, military, and social aspects within the region, under the leadership of the Supreme Leader. The region functions as the central hub for the Order&#146;s operations, military training, ideological indoctrination, and governance.
