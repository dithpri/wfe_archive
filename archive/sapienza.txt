The region of Sapienza, meaning wisdom in Italian, is home to winding rivers, towering mountains, expansive fields, lush forests, and most importantly the four great Kingdoms dominating Sapienza: Tigre, Falena, Volpe and Lejoninna. Each Kingdom rules a quarter of Sapineza, with Tigre being the largest and most powerful region, belonging to the Mother Tigress bloodline. Lejoninnains belong to the Wise Lioness Bloodline, most notably Princess Kyra of Lejoninna. 
This region, though not large, is bountiful and a convenient place for nations to make their home.
