Hello !
Welcome to the [region]Napoleonic Patriotic and Conservative Union[/region]. 
We are a close-knit and open nations.
You don&#39;t have to like Napoleon (because actually Voisey prefers Charles De Gaulle) to integrate our continent.
We do regular polls. The founding members ([nation]Voisey[/nation], [nation]Hongroisie[/nation], [nation]Zemmourie[/nation], [nation]Haute Marne[/nation] and [nation]Vallage[/nation]) decided that each WA delegate mandate will be during 2 weeks. Then there will be open elections.
Do not hesitate to ask us questions...
