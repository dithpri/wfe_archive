Rejoice, Secularia has been liberated.

Secularia is a region dedicated to secular governments.  Members of this region believe strongly in church state separation.  Though atheism is common in Seculria, we believe in freedom of religion, so long as the government doesn&amp;#39;t take a stance supporting any religion.
