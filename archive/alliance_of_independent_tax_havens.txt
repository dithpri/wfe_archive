The Alliance of Independent Tax Havens (AITH) is a multilateral economic bloc composed of high-income jurisdictions. A defining characteristic of AITH is its institutionalized international impartiality. The alliance formally commits to political neutrality in interstate conflicts, sanctions regimes and ideological blocs. Its member states position themselves as non-aligned financial intermediaries, facilitating lawful capital flows without political discrimination. The Alliance of Independent Tax Havens is not merely a coalition of low-tax jurisdictions; it is a structured, rules-based bloc built around the doctrine of international impartiality.
