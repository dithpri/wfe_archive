[i]We accept all Embassy request and welcome to all nations to move here, except for those whose name is [u]unacceptable[/u] to be used as a nation/region name[/i].

[color=#777777][i]Once a nation decided to move to this region, they must use [u][nation=noflag]Exonesia[/nation]&#39;s flag[/u], and must change the classification to a [u]Principality[/u] immediately, and keep it that way forever, in and outside [region]Exonesia[/region]. Changing the flag and the nation&#39;s classification afterward is not allowed. Failure to do so will make the nation considered as enemy and will banned for eternity.[/i][/color]
