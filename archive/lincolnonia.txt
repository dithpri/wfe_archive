The year is 2101 AD. The Georgia Flu swept through years ago, decimating the population. Within a matter of weeks, whole nations fell. The survivors were the isolated, the lucky, and the immune. For years, the world was left in ruins. Nature began to take back the cities and concrete turned to dust, but the survivors began to slowly group up for protection. First there were small farmsteads, then villages, and finally, after decades of repopulation, cities and empires. Out of the ashes of old rose new powers. These powers became merchant republics, agrarian monarchies, and warmongering dictatorships. This is Lincolnonia.
