A small continent nestled between the Antarctic and the Indian oceans, the diverse peoples of Proto-Clapistan are united as a region for only one thing; geographic isolation. Located  unrealistically far from the rest of the world, the only known way to reach the continent has been to simply will your ship or airplane there. The rich hilly soil and the temperate climate allow for top notch terrace farming and goat ranching.
