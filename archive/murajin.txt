Murajin is a beautiful coastal region, recently discovered by a handful of adventurous nations. Murajin contains thick, lush forests chock full of vegetation, rippling golden fields of ripe wheat, and rugged, rocky red canyons and mesas, bordered by sparkling deep blue ocean waves. Dazzling, cobalt streams and rivers cut through the abundant, rich soil of this new homeland.
