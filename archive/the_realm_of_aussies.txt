[color=blue]Welcome to the Realm of Aussies![/color]

We are a friendly frontier that is quite safe. We have very high security levels due to 4 attempted invasions. Please endorse WA delegate [nation]Greater Doges[/nation] and leading security officer [nation]Porongos[/nation] to help keep power! Below we have our officers. [color=red]Please respect them! They work very hard to keep the frontier running.[/color]

Also special thanks to [nation]Cards of Eagles 7[/nation] for alerting us at this late hour (around 11 p.m.) of an attempted invasion.
