Todays hunt: the brachydios. A brute wyvern that uses slime and its fists as its deadly weapons, becareful and happy hunting.

We are the league of monster hunters
obviously we play the monster hunter games

we are also a roleplay nation so we do hunt in forums

Rules:
1&amp;gt; if you were ever a raider (like the black riders) i am not interested in having you in this region
2&amp;gt; You can&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;give&amp;quot; the password to someone else, you need my permission to do so
3&amp;gt; these are the only rules i can think of, more will be added over time
