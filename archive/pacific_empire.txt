This region&amp;#39;s government is served by our governor-general [nation]PacificEmpire[/nation] who addresses all telegrams, is on the regional administration, and has been the nation-in-duty for one month.

Your delegate to the World Assembly, [nation]Pesticidia[/nation] was ejected on accused &amp;quot;rule violations&amp;quot;. Therefore the Pacific Empire council would like to make a motion to either commit to a new delegate or no longer recognize the World Assembly as a whole.
