[b]Something has happened...VOTING TIME![/b]
Proposition 22:[i][region]black_mesa_islands[/region] has offered to make [region]Pacific Empire[/region] a Protectorate\Colony of their respectable region. Meaning, they would take care of Pacific Empire in exchange for complete status over our region. Please vote by wiring a telegram to your delegate, [nation]Pesticidia[/nation] [/i]
YES - Means that you want to become a colony\protectorate of black_mesa_islands which could result in our freedom being compromised.
NO- Means that you want to stay free in Pacific Empire apart from black_mesa_islands which could result in our own global domination :)
