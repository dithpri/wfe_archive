Welcome to the Pacific Empire.

Established 2013, we have been through several re-establishments of the region; first in 2015, second in early 2016. We hope to create a permanent region promoting the prospects of peace, freedom, and democracy.

More information into the structure of government, functions, and other key areas of infrastructure will be addressed shortly.

Please feel to message [nation=pacemp] or [nation=brandensland] if you have urgent questions/information.
