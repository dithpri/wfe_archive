[b][color=red]The World Leftist Union is an new region dedicated to all leftists in the game. It is a pan -leftist region and is open to all sorts of leftists including democratic socialists, marxist-leninists, anarchists, etc.

The region will be run by a regional government elected democratically. But since the region has a very small population, the region has not yet started functioning.

Once the region will attain a population of 15 or above, a new Constitution will be formulated and the government will be elected.

Therefore I request all leftists who want to start again and be the earliest members of a new region to join the World Leftist Union. [/b][/color]
