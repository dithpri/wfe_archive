The Commonwealth Alliance of Nations is a region based on a series of alternative international historical events. These events and their resultant nation states all stem from the British Colonial Empire. At certain times throughout history British military and colonial endeavors were halted, every nation in the CAoN is to be based on an alternate history in which none of these endeavors were halted or discontinued. 

A perfect example of this would be the American Revolution. In the CAoN universe, the Thirteen Colonies may have remained in the possession of Britain upon the suppression of the colonial uprisings. 

I will hopefully have time to update and expand of these thoughts.
