Woof Woof, Mac and Gordie are bad doggies who are wondering, &quot;Who let the dogs out?&quot; 

They left a trail that arrived right at your doorstep! No guard dogs along the way!  Nothing &#39;suspicious&#39; about that, is there?

Well, they&#39;re disinterested in turning your region as a &#39;warzone.&#39; They just want a nibble of steak and an ice cream cone and they&#39;ll be on their way soon enough!

What would you say? If you a doggie on a chain 

&quot;Up and Down the puppies&#39; hair
fleas and ticks jump everywhere
Cause of original sin&quot;
