[color=red][b]Welcome to Europe Oriental![/b][/color]

Europe Oriental is a politico-economic union that is mostly based in Central to Eastern Europe. Like the European Union in real life, Europe Oriental operates through a system of supranational institutions and intergovernmental-negotiated decisions by the member states.

Europe Oriental is led by the Founder and Regional Delegate. We have monthly conventions to debate important topics, decide the future of our region, and elect Regional Authorities.
