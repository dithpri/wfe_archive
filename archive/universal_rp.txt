To raiders, such as DEN: [color=ea1f1f]Get out.[/color]

Take note, you may deal a critical blow to an opponent character, but to kill the other user&#39;s char, you need to ask for Permission To Kill.
You may have Auto PTK only if: The character cannot flee [t.ex surrounded when wounded, lost both legs.]
But you may not abuse this.
