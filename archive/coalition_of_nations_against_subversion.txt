[b]Welcome to the CONASU, a safe place for your right-wing government to thrive.[/b]

The CONASU exalts and defends Religion and Fatherland as main imperatives for the reconstruction of society, fallen into the debacle of egalitarianism and debauchery induced by the principles of 1789.

We don&#39;t allow:

liberalism, communism, globalism and definitely not any trend coming from the post-modern left!
