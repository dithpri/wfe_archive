This region is a perfect blend of traditional Japanese &amp; traditional American cultures, but people of all identities will feel at home. Everyone is free &amp; treated equally. Enjoy everything we have to offer &amp; come back as often as you would like. There is a thriving city life to go along with the stunning nature areas.

Some of the exciting things we recommend you can do while you&#39;re here are to put on a koto record to enjoy with a nice cup of tea, watch a bit of wrestling or kabuki theater, play a round of golf, walk on one of our pristine beaches or in any of the beautiful forests, take a relaxing hike in the mountains, tour a church or shrine, &amp; have fun any way you like.
