This region is a perfect blend of traditional Japanese and traditional American cultures, but people of all identities will feel at home. Everyone is free and treated equally. Enjoy everything we have to offer and come back as often as you would like. There is a thriving city life to go along with the stunning nature areas.

Some of the fun/exciting things we recommend you can do while you&#39;re here are to put on a koto record while you pour yourself a nice cup of tea, watch a bit of wrestling or kabuki theater, walk on one of our pristine beaches or in any of the beautiful forests, take a relaxing hike in the mountains, and have fun.[/color]
