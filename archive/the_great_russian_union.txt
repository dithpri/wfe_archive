[b][region]The Great Russian Union[/region] [i]has been preserved for Russian Socialist, Prussoslavia[/i]

The Union is comprised of [region]Rossiya[/region], the [region]Novorossiya[/region]/[region]New Russia[/region] border region, the Capital City of [region]Moskva[/region] and is a proud member of the [color=#e60000]N[/color]ational-[color=#e60000]S[/color]ozialistische [color=#e60000]E[/color]urop&auml;ische[color=#e60000] A[/color]rbeiter-[color=#e60000]P[/color]artei ([region]NSEAP[/region]) Alliance of region states and signatories.

True Russians are European descended; not mongol or Turkic stock and we draw the Union borders along racial lines, with non-Russians in the Union as Satellite States for the people of those nations.
