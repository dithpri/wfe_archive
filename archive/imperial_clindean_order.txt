Welcome to Clindea.
Please enjoy the rest of your stay.
Countdown: (1 Day)
God Speed and Thank you for your faith and trust.
The ICO will be under a remodling process as we clear out the riff raff and tidy up a bit.

Due to the falling debris and angry migrant workers, all veterans can find residence in the region of, Ravenrock. There you have 3 square meals a day, only 2 of the meals coming from a tube. Plus pretty nurses to gape at.
We will be back shortly, and we shall be watching.

-T, signing out.
