Imagine a world like an expanded Risk board. Imagine a region of 108 nations, each with a unique political style. Welcome to R108.

Do not expect perfect correspondence of name, flag, animal and currency.

Any resemblance to actual nations, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

Imagine there was some point to all this.
