The Universal Commune is a region of communists practicing widespread communalism. We believe in equal rights for all people, regardless of gender identity, sexuality, or ethnicity. Everyone works for the common good of furthering technology and their comrades. Money is nonexistent, social classes are nonexistent, and everyone works for the government. In turn, the people themselves own the government. However, we do have a Premier and a few high-class officials.
