 We the Edenites believe in exploration and travel. Although a small region we believe there will be unity through peace. Peace obtained from putting the people first, and the government second. In doing so the minds of many can work together, rather than being isolated by class, rank, or nationality.
 Our region is full of civil rights, which is viewed as the highest quality a nation can have. We care about our people and what they want. Except for Labol with it&#39;s frightening amount of executions.
