[hr][B][region]The Alliance Of Conservative Nations[/region] [color=purple]is a region governed by the Regional Council, with final assent given by the Reigning Monarch. Upon joining, all nations automatically become full members of Parliament (i.e. the government). Most regions require nations to go through a lengthy process of establishing their credentials and then tedious elections to enable them become part of the government.[/color]
