[b][u]SISTER REGION:[/u][/b] [REGION]The Manifest Destiny[/region][hr][i]On May 11, 2017, the Residents of [region]the New Republican Order[/region] voted overwhelmingly to merge into [region]the Manifest Destiny[/region]. The transfer of Nations took place later that day. Our (third) founder, [nation]Africanican[/nation], not wanting the region to be disestablished entirely, created [nation]The New Republican Order[/nation] to serve as Supreme Leader for an indefinite term and keep the region alive. The region is securely password protected and is not open to new nations at this time, however, you are more than welcome in [region]the Manifest Destiny[/region].[/i]
