[color=gray][u][b]History[/b][/u][/color]
[color=darkgray][region]Planet X[/region] is an ancient region that once held over 1,000 embassies across the world. For years, this coveted region sat idle and under the occupation of a nation that has since ceased to exist. This region was refounded by The Radiant D&aacute;xlamic Forces of The Evergreen Foreign Legion to prevent it from being claimed by [region]The Planet X[/region], a region that has been openly hostile to D&aacute;xlam and our aligned interests.

This region is now fully incorporated into the D&aacute;xlamic Empire and is henceforth declared a [b]World Heritage Region[/b] of [b][region]Declansburg[/region][/b] by The Founder&#39;s Office.[/color]
