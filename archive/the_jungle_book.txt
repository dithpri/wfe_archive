Now I&#39;m the king of the swingers, the jungle V.I.P 
I reached the top and had to stop 
And that&#39;s what bothering me 
I want to be a man, man-cub, and stroll right into town 
And be just like those other men 
I&#39;m tired of monkeying around 
Now don&#39;t try to kid me, man-cub, I&#39;ll make a deal with you 
What I desire is man&#39;s red fire to make my dreams come true 
So give me the secret, man-cub, clue me what to do 
Give me the power of man&#39;s red flower so I can be like you
