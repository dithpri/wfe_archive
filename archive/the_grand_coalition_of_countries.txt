[color=Orange][b]Welcome to The Grand Coalition of Countries[/b][/color] founded on May 27th, 2015

[color=Red][b]The GCC[/b][/color] is a role-playing and causal region that likes to have fun. [b]The GCC also allows all types of countries[/b] to hear all points of views and not be closed minded. If you think you got what it takes to be a leader of a region, then message [nation]the rouge Christmas state[/nation] and say you would like to. If you have any ideas we would also like to hear that aswell.
