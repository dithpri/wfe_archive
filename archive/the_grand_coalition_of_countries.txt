[color=purple][b]Welcome to The Grand Coalition of Countries[/b][/color] founded on May 27th, 2015

[color=blue][b]The GCC[/b][/color] is a role-playing and causal region that likes to have fun. The GCC also allows [b]all types of countries[/b] to hear all points of views and not be closed minded. If you think you got what it takes to be a leader of a region, then message [nation]the rouge Christmas state[/nation] and say you would like to. If you have any ideas we would also like to hear that aswell.

[color=green][b]Announcement[/b][/color] Please also endorse the delegate [nation]the rouge Christmas state[/nation], we will have a formal election once we have enough countries to do so.
