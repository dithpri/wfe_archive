A short tour:

1.Try to find Gondolin
It&#39;s some sort of riddle or something 
Secretive weirdos

2.The March of Maehdros is rather cold
Maglor&#39;s Gap keeps getting screwed by Orcs
What is the name of the land Caranthir lives in?
If it wasn&#39;t for Amrod, the race of man would be in Ossiriand

3.Good luck getting into Doriath
Those guys are secretive too
If they helped in the N&iacute;rnaeth Arnoediad maybe Morgoth wouldn&#39;t win
Or is it the fault of those western guys?

4.To end it off your tour, go to Angbad
Actually don&#39;t do that
You will be forced to mine stuff
Kind of like Gwindor

Everyone who lives here is messed up in some way.
But aren&#39;t we all?
