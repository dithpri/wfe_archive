The UDF is a region of rather... eccentric people. From presidents and evil dictators to cult worship and barbarians. The UDF would rather make decisions based on how many shiny objects are on the line, or the amount of donuts for reward. But we know when to get serious, and dangerous. If you have not noticed, it is run by the self-centered nation of Darlonia. Not to be confused with the United dairy farmers.
