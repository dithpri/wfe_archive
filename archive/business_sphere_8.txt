Business Sphere 8 is a 51st-century, planet-sized office megalopolis -- every individual office cubicle a breathing, organic entity working in tandem with its neighbors to help fulfill a greater function, one it cannot even begin to imagine.

Five continents and hundreds of islands dominate the northern and southern temperate zones. Islands and archipelagos make up 35 percent of the total land area, and stabbings cause 35 percent of the total number of flesh wounds.

With hundreds of millions of human inhabitants (as of 2012 FRIJOLES [FRactional dIversified JOLly sphEre Spans]), Business Sphere 8 is a thriving bastion of human life, knowledge and industry.
