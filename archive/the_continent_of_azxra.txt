[b]Welcome to the Continent of Azxra![/b]

[hr]
We are an island that really, [i]really[/i] wants to be known as a continent. It all started when this [i]Continent[/i] was found out in the North Pacific, since then we have been growing with new nations ever since!

[hr]
This region holds elections for regional offices which [i]do[/i] get powers. The Senate is able to make policies for the region and generally decide what we do, and the Ministers deal with regional and interregional affairs. It is highly suggested that you join the WA if you would like to be an officer so you can endorse the WA Minister and have more influence to use your powers.
