We are an island that really, [i]really[/i] wants to be known as a continent. It all started when this continent was found out in the North Pacific by a rouge explorer, one typo and a spelling error later the island of Axar becomes [b][region]The Continent of Azxra[/region][/b]. Ever since then we have been growing with new nations constantly![hr]
This region holds elections for regional offices! It is highly suggested that you join the WA if you would like to be an officer so you can endorse the WA Minister and have more influence to use your powers.[hr]
