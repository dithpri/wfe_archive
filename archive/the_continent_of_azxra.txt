[b]Welcome to the Continent of Azxra![/b]

We are an island that really, [i]really[/i] wants to be known as a continent. It all started when this [i]Continent[/i] was found out in the North Pacific, since then we have been growing with new nations ever since! This region holds elections for regional offices which [i]do[/i] get powers. The Senate is able to makes policies for the region and generally decide what we do, and the Ministers deal with regional and interregional affairs.
