World: Thesulia Prime
Native Species: Dabvirari
Overview: Thesulia Prime is a world in the Milky Way Galaxy. It was warm and tropical! And the native sentient tribal, reptilian humanoid species; the Dabvirari, are not an issue! As they are peaceful, and we have given them land in our national wild life preserves to allow their tribes to continue to exist in our advanced cultures! This world is privately owned by the Ukronda, and as such we can only permit certain nations to the region we own on this planet; the Subanian Region.
Environment: This region is tropical, with many slow running, beautiful rivers, lakes, it has many valleys and grassy fields, and common day-time temperature is 22 Degrees Celsius!
