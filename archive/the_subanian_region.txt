World: Earth
Native Species: Humans, Dabvirari
Overview: Earth is a world in the Milky Way Galaxy. It was warm and tropical! And the native sentient tribal, reptilian humanoid species; the Dabvirari, are not an issue, as they have been subdued by the dominant species; Humans! As they are peaceful, and we have given them land in our national wild life preserves to allow their tribes to continue to exist in our advanced cultures! This world is locked in a Cold War, between the Federation of Nations, and the Eastern Alliance of Supremacy... or Superiority, depending on who you ask.
