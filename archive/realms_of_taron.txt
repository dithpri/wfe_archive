[color=red][b]WELCOME TO THE REALMS OF TARON![/b][/color]

For ye olde members here, this is the first part of the revamp.

For ye new members here, welcome, this is the [color=red]Realms of Taron![/color]

We aim to create an environment that is both friendly and fun. As a focus, we will be doing midevial RP, which is on our RP Discord down below. We also have basic government and chatting activities in the regular Discord server too, so you should check that out! As we are trying to make this as official as possible, we are also trying to build an offsite forum for your enjoyment as well, and we will keep you posted as we do this!

Sincerely, [color=red]Realms of Taron[/color] staff
