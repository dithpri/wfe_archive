The region of Vehicora is a region run entirely by monkeys who drive buses.
Vehicora was founded by a monkey named Bananasaurus, who was tired of life in 10000 Islands, and was tired of the World Assembly.
In the centre of Vehicora lies Bananasaurus&#39; body, on display in the centre of a large, floating glass box, with a length and width of 50 metres, and a height of 200 metres. Bananasaurus died in the year 1283.
Bananasaurus lives with all of us.
