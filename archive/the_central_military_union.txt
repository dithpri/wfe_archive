The name might be slightly contradictory but we are a group of proud nations who have united for the sole purpose of military strength. Our combined power is enough to strike fear into the hearts of any who oppose us. The only &#145;united&#146; part is our military force. If one member of the union needs military assistance, we all help. Otherwise, we are completely independent of each other and do not interfere with others in the union.
