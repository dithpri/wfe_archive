Filthy Lucre! Money has been called the root of all evil! 

Bartering and quid pro quo, the only pure forms of exchange.

Our religion allows no greedy big banks to prey upon the impoverished through usury. Money lending at interest is forbidden.

Accept our Faith and join us here, [b]interest free[/b]!
