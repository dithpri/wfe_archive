Welcome to Mitteleuropa! Here we have a region in Europe in which we are all represented!
We are strictly a council who is dedicated to keeping our members happy and safe from external threats. Though this does mean everyone must do their part as a member and help each other (Economically included as well).

Now we are a newer faction (region) so please be kind to each other I look forward to meeting you all diplomatically!
