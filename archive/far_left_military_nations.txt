[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[color=red]Once an ancient ally of [region]The MT Army[/region]. After CTE for many years it was refounded by notorious Nazi &quot;Shira Bell&quot;s ([region]The Aryan Army[/region]) under [region]Project Ragnarok[/region].

The failure, [region]Project Ragnarok[/region], was created to revive the dead regions once aligned or part of the anti-fascist forces known as [region]The MT Army[/region] and create regions which were historically part of the Axis Powers from World War II.[/color]

[color=green]Othin spake:
44. &quot;Much have I fared, | much have I found,
Much have I got of the gods:
What shall live of mankind | when at last there comes
The mighty winter to men?&quot;

Vafthruthnir spake:
45. &quot;In Hoddmimir&#39;s wood | shall hide themselves
Lif and Lifthrasir then; The morning dews | for meat shall they have,
Such food shall men then find.&quot;[/color]
