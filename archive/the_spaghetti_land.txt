[color=330066]It is well known that in order to tag a region, you have to half-finish tagging it first. In order to half-tag a region, however, you need to quarter-tag it, and to do that you need to first eighth-tag it, and so on. Progress is impossible and motion is an illusion, so why bother? 
This fictitious tag has been set by [b][region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region][/b], despite a certain Devi&#39;s best efforts to avoid doing work :(

In attendance of these assassinations were:

[b]Night Father [nation]Venico[/nation] Triggering
Assassin [nation]the devi wears prada[/nation]
Assassin [nation]Kursibar[/nation]
Assassin [nation]Thorn1000[/nation][/b][/color]
