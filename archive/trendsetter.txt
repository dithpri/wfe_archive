The bigger this region gets, the less trends will be set, because it would suffer from atrophy and more nations make more problems. Therefore this region is only open to those worthy, all others shall be trended and set.

[B][region]Trendsetter[/region][/B] is currently [color=red][B]HOSTILE TO ALL[/B][/color] in gameplay, but is open to discussion about editing this. With an [B]active founder[/B] as of 6th of October 2015, [B][region]Trendsetter[/region]&amp;#39;s[/B] alert level is [color=FF0000][B]TRENDCON 2[/B][/color], because of the death threats against the region by evil raiders (who haven&amp;#39;t accepted my embassy btw.) and Iwaku.
