[b][color=black]This region fell to the forces of [region]The Eternal Knights[/region]![/color]
[hr]Eternal Knights: [nation=short]Nephmir[/nation], [nation=short]NoblePhnx[/nation][hr]Nephmir: &amp;quot;Oh, so is that why we password protected ourselves? To keep him out?&amp;quot;
Raid Leader: &amp;quot;Kinda, but I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s necessary anymore. After all, what harm could he do?&amp;quot;

The password remained in place.

Nephmir was already inside the region.

The region had every possible defense, an active executive founder, a non-executive delegacy, and a password. Let it be known that nothing can keep The Eternal Knights out! 

This region was given three days to surrender. It fell exactly 190 days after the 3 day period had expired.

The first Invader region has fallen.
