[b][u]About Us[/u][/b]
We all met years ago on a forum called PcPuzzle, the official forum of the indie game series Wonderland (available [url=http://midnightsynergy.com]here[/url]). Since several of us like to design indie games ourselves, we made another forum specifically for that purpose, known as Epigam (hence the name Epigamia). We collectively decided to play NationStates together, although we&amp;#39;re all casual players who don&amp;#39;t really care about &amp;quot;winning&amp;quot; anything. We raid occasionally if we&amp;#39;re bored, but that&amp;#39;s about it.
