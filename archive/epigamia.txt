[b][color=scarlet]This Invader region was destroyed after an eight month long stealth operation by Nephmir ([nation=short]King Nephmir II[/nation]), with special thanks to [nation=short]NoblePhnx[/nation] for providing an endorsement.[/color]

[color=purple]Epigamia was given 3 days to surrender. It fell 190 days later.[/color]

This region had every defense, an [i]active founder[/i], [i]a password[/i], and a [i]non-executive delegacy[/i]... before Regional Officers existed. It was destroyed with only a single endorsement on the delegate nation, and destroyed in record speeds... while the founder was online. Let it be known that no region is unraidable.
