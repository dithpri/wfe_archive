USLN prides itself on equality. by the words of malcolm X &amp;quot;by any means nesseccary&amp;quot;  it is willing to incorporate wildly radical nations and the moderate to center left. with the soul purpose of world wide equality of resources manufaturing and technology. in order for nations to agree over policy there is a compulsory drug binge befor important conferences to ensure that everyone is on the same page. if conference becomes too much, your ambassador will be escorted to the chillout room.
