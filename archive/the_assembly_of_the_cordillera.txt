[i]&#147;If you are faced with a mountain, you have several options.

You can climb it and cross to the other side.

You can go around it.

You can dig under it.

You can fly over it.

You can ignore it and pretend it&#146;s not there.

You can turn around and go back the way you came.

Or you can stay on the mountain and make it your [b]home[/b].&#148;[/i]
