Welcome to Diplomacy! This region is built on the culture and scenario of Diplomacy, an early nation-simulation board game set in Europe in 1901. The region is not about playing the game as such, but capturing the feel of it, as you guide your nation through complex domestic and diplomatic affairs.


Diplomacy is largely roleplay region set in Early 20th Century. Players should treat themselves as countries, and scenarios can be set up by players. All Out of Character Posts should be labelled with OOC to avoid confusion



All are welcome, none may leave!
