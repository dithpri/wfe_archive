[b]Ormythria[/b], sacred dominion of [nation]Siletz[/nation], is the cosmic sphere under Sovereign Caelus Orven&#146;s absolute rule. A theocratic regime orbiting the Obsidian Throne, it enforces the Codex of Celestial Stratification. All worlds&#151;Veltherion Sanctum, Vulcran Sigma, Aurelion Prime&#151;serve ritualized roles, from tribute games to memory erasure. Earth&#146;s collapse birthed this closed cosmology, where dissent is erased, and only harmonized puppet states exist. [u]Ormythria[/u] is not a place but the sole permitted reality, dictated by the Stellar Reckoning. Outsiders face cleansing; obedience is eternal. [i]All hail the Throne.[/i]
