[b][color=#6082B6]Hogwarts School[/color][/b] of Witchcraft and Wizardry was a Scottish wizarding school located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted any magical student residing in the islands of Great Britain and Ireland at the age of eleven years old at the start of the incoming term for enrollment.

The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. &#151;harrypotter.fandom.com
