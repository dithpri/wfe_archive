Ariseis is a culturally diverse conglomeration of states between the Cachuna Mountains in the West and the Oestoni Mountains in the East. The Isthmus between the North and South Odij seas is taken up by Bikklid, the wealthiest, most populous and most powerful state in the region.

For their size, the six Arisein states are geographically and culturally diverse like nowhere else on earth. From historical mountain tribes in the western highlands of Cachucia to seafaring traders in the Bik delta of Sarama in the east, the sheer wonder of the region is truly unique and the foundation of Ariseis&#39; large tourist industry.
