In a strange unforeseen circumstance, this Cabin grew to be the size of a small continent. Located deep in some forgotten backwoods, it quickly grew beyond its former occupation of whimsical campsite. Now, it is destined to be the site of war, of conflict, as various nations move in to settle the fertile desks and shelves of Parban Cabin. For where there are wealth, there are those who will claim it and in this hard land there is no place for those who would simply survive. There are those who will thrive, and those who will die.
