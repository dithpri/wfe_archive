This is the new Odd Squad. With high hopes we regrouped and started anew. Here in the Odd Squad each member is treated with respect. want to run for council? Please check the fact book below(or ask any officer.) The council holds polls to set rules or regulations for the region. These elections happen randomly so do check daily! Rules:what rules? (We&#39;re cheap so don&#39;t expect a super region) just have fun.







You can run but you can&#39;t hide from the odd squad!
