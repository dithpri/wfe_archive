If you get banned from the Mormo Belt by the founder Phil because he doesn&amp;#39;t like it that you have two countries, or he just doesn&amp;#39;t like you, then you are in good company. In this land we don&amp;#39;t like Phil and it is a safe place for mormons and friends. A way better place than Mormo Belt.
