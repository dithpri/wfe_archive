Welcome to the [region]Anti Discord Alliance[/region]!

Tired of being asked to participate offsite to be part of a region?  Want to just click issues, farm cards, or chat without worrying so much about RP and such? This might be the place for you.  We don&#39;t care what you do or don&#39;t do. Invaders, defenders, puppets, people who are deep into the meta or the most casual of casuals, everyone&#39;s welcome.

New to this region? Say hi in the regional message board!
