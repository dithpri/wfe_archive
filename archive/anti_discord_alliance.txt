Welcome to the [region]Anti Discord Alliance[/region]!
Tired of being asked to participate offsite to be part of a region?  Want to just click issues, farm cards, or chat without worrying so much about RP and such? This might be the place for you.  We don&#39;t care what you do or don&#39;t do. Invaders, defenders, puppets, people who are deep into the meta or the most casual of casuals, everyone&#39;s welcome.

[b]Space permitting, any new nations will be given a regional leadership position with custom title.[/b]

[b]Stuff to do here[/b]:

1. Endorse our WA Delegate, [nation]Hustlertwo[/nation]!
2. Interact with your new community!
3. Do anything you want!

Feel free to telegram [nation]Hustlertwo[/nation] if you have any questions.

[b]All embassy requests are accepted.[/b]
