This nation is actually a democracy compared to other &amp;#39;&amp;#39;democratic&amp;#39;&amp;#39; nations I have been in. Elections are not rigged and you have a great opportunity of being who you want here. We always choose a side in war and never stay neutral. This nation is great for the people who join.
