Hello! 

Thanks for visiting this region. My cousin and best friend Ethan pitched the idea of a [b]Shared Card Puppet Region[/b] to me and I agreed to it. I&#39;ve founded a regular, non-card puppet Region before and didn&#39;t like being leader. So Ethan can be the leader here and I&#39;m content to be his follower :)
