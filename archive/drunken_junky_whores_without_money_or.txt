No matter of rebellious mind just live fast die
You can listen 80&#39;s hardcore punk drink Sorbus &amp; kilju
and get some speed nijections

Bonds and chains fall to the ground



Children of all slaves

Stand united and proud

All people of bondage shall triumph

And live by the sign of...
