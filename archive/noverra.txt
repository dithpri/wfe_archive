IMPORTANT NEWS... Jacob has won the election and is now the active WA Delegate alone with the runner up, Zack, getting the vice-delegate position.

Remember, do not use any puppet states in polls. Jacob and Zack now have the power to make polls, please check every once in a while for a poll.

The main way we will contact you is via telegram so check that regularly.

Try to stay as active in the Noverra community as possible. Check polls, post on the message board, answer issues, and ask (telegram) any high ranking officer, i.e. me, Zack, and Jacob, if you have any questions.
