THERES SO MANY PEOPLE NOW... I should probably make an official factbook.

Anyone looking to become the WA Delegate should apply for the WA ASAP, date Friday, May 13th. To enter the running, apply for the WA and contact me before the date of the election.

Anyone wondering how to vote, it will be via a poll open on date specified and the winner will be endorsed by all WA members in the region. Everyone, WA or not, will be allowed to vote but you cannot vote with a puppet state if you have one. Yes, you can vote for yourself.

To apply for a position other than WA Delegate come see me, for those of you who don&#39;t know it&#39;s Christian.

Also, it would be helpful if everyone stated who they are on message board or in person.
