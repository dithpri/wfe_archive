[b]Welcome to Borealis![/b]
[hr][b]Founded:[/b] November, 2014
[hr]Founded in 2014, Borealis is a small region dedicated to its nations, always representing the interest of each one, regardless of disputes, but almost always with compromise. Our founder, Suiss, is not a WA member, simply because it is a belief that the WA Delegate of the region should not be the one administrating it. Join today, and help make Borealis great!
[hr]Our flag is a tricolor flag with one arrow originating on the bottom side. The three colors represent the three traits of Unity, Strength, and Control. The green arrow represents the trait of Truth, and the symbol in the middle of the arrow is a sun rising over a moon, representing the sky and the Aurora Borealis, our namesake.
