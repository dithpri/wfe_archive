Pain is the way to bring peace.

The tails shall rain down pain to all.
 Even innocent foolish children will grow up in the face of pain, until their thoughts and beliefs are the same as their doubts. Even the most ignorant, innocent child will eventually grow up as they learn what true pain is. It affects what they say, what they think&#133; and they become real people. 

Pain is the way to bring peace.

Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to gain because life&#39;s greatest lessons are learned through pain.
