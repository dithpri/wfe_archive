OLYMPOS (Olympus) was the home of the gods who dwelt in fabulous palaces of marble and gold.
Olympos is essentially an ancient acropolis--a fortified hill-top and palace complex--located just below the peaks of Mount Olympos. The Olympian akropolis lay above the clouds and the paths of the stars, near the apex of the solid bronze-dome of the sky. It existed in the zone known as the aither--the bright upper-air of heaven or shining blue of the sky. The gods feasted on ambrosia and nectar, substances collected from the meadows of the earth
