[color=001CBF][b]About the Tvelmark[/b][/color]

[i]Drafting of the first constitution gas begun! Please feel free to contribute your ideas in the RMB![/i]

The Tvelmark is currently controlled by a foundational interim government consisting only of its founder [nation]Bothnia[/nation]. The stipulations of this government can be found in the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1455489]Articles of Foundation[/url].

The nations and citizens of the Tvelmark are called [color=001CBF]Tvelians[/color], and the adjective used to describe them is [color=001CBF]Tvel[/color], [color=001CBF]Tvelish[/color], or [color=001CBF]Tvelian[/color]. Thus, sentences like, &quot;Tvelians, the citizens of Tvelian nations, enjoy eating Tvelish food.&quot; and, &quot;I&#39;m proud to be Tvel!&quot; would be grammatically correct.
