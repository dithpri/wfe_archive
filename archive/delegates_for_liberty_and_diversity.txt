We are a region that contains a diverse system of ideals and traditions. The nations that reside in the region are peaceful towards each other, and if there be any dispute amongst any nation, it is settled peacefully and reasonably, with citizens having a say in discussions and debates. Each nation has their own set of laws and religions they follow on their own, and no true religion is official for the region. All who are involved in the region protect each other, and will provide for basic needs of other nations, but only when in extreme need.
