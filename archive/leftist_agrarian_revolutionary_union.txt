[color=scarlet][i]Leftist Agrarian Revolutionary Region[/i] is now under the control of the people-masses.[/color]

The popular organism has expelled the raider vermin. However, the purge continues until all apparent and hidden agents and counter-revolutionaries are slaughtered and their blood used to fertilise the soil of popular progress.

Death to reactionaries. 

Death to imperialists.

Death to invaders.
