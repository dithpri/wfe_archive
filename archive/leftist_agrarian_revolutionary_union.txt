The Leftist Agrarian Revolutionary Union (LARU) aims to rapidly complete a Maoist people&amp;#39;s revolution by destroying the root of capitalism - cities. Through the institution of anti-urban politics and ultimately, the destruction of cities themselves, we dedicate the people-masses to communal rural labour and living. 

The Leftist Agrarian Revolutionary Union is a region of countries who have completed the transition into a free, fully decentralised people&amp;#39;s society. The peasantry, the army and the Party are one. Our socium acts as a single entity, works as a single organism and defends itself as a single organism. We have achieved victory where other have failed ! 

Long-live the people-masses !
