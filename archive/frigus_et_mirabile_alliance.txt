The Frigus et Mirabile Alliance was formed with the goal of having friendly nations join together in the mutual benefit of each other. 

The alliance is passive towards the forms of government and actions of it&#39;s members, as long as members do not act with malcontent or malice towards the other nations or the alliance itself. We maintain a predominantly peaceful policy towards other regions, and will remain passive unless threatened.
