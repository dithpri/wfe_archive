[i]Let me tell you a story. I&#39;ll tell you about the land of Noon Puppet Dump, whose glory once soared high above the clouds. It was a magical land, with no RMB rules, no issues with spam, no invaders. Just like [nation]Dominioan[/nation]&#39;s own region. But there was a conflict. A population war between the region and [region]H Industry[/region]. Ultimately, H Industry won. And some idiot got lazy so all of the nations CTE&#39;d. Well, most of them...

There were survivors. And because they wanted a new name, the survivors moved to here. The land officially known as The Stronghold, but colloquially known as &quot;dang it verchy!&quot;. Why they chose to go with a longer name is anyone&#39;s guess. So welcome to The Stronghold. We hope you enjoy your stay...[/i]
