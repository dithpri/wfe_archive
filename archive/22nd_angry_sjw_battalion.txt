[b][i]This is a Special Operations battalion established at the beginning of the Internet. Formed by hardcore raiders of NationStates we seek to take our art to the next level. Every target of ours has a personal history with the TrollKing, its just for da trolls. However, we strive only to protect free speech and the right to be a free man/woman/thing whatever. Sometimes at night the Trollking cries, knowing that people take time and effort to make regions and communities and he dosent like making people waste valuable minutes of their life deleting stuff but unfortunately the boundaries of mortality only extend to the daughters of KOnder.[/i][/b]
