A large, sprawling landscape generated by a Random Terrain Editor. The layout of this region is highly unexplored and undocumented due to the sheer size and complexity of it&amp;#39;s sub-regions.


This region is under no specific leadership, resulting in several nomadic tribes ruling their own territories in isolation. There is one state within this region known to control a decent portion of this region&amp;#39;s land, known as [nation=short]Randomly Generated Terrain[/nation]. The massive size of the land and shape of the land allows anyone to slip into the region on their own free will without consequence.
