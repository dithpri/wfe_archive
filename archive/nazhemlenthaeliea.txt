-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nazhemlenthaeliea (the NHLE) has its roots in the collapse of the EU in 2354 CE, and then the subsequent political, social, and economic revolutions, reforms, and collapses during the early 25th century. It first began as a trade agreement between the newly independent state of the Federation of Kazakstan, the United Government of the Balkans, and the Ukraino-Greek Republic. At this time it was called the UWEF, or United Western European Front.
