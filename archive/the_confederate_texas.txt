[b][color=darkblue]Welcome to[/color][color=grey] The Confederate [/color][color=darkred]Texas[/color][/b]

[i]The Land of Blue Bonnets, Cattle, and Cowboys, The Confederation of Texas, or Confederate Texas is a Region promoting Confederalism, Roleplay, and the Independence of the Republic of Texas. A Region dedicated to United States Map Roleplaying, we hope to create a New Community of Roleplayers that can have a Unique Experience with this Region. Currently, under the Provisional Congress of the Confederation, we hope that this Region will grow into Happiness. The Standard Roleplay Map is soon to finish, and maybe you are the one to save or destroy, The United States.[/i]
