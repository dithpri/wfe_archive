Altorbi is a new region focusing on Roleplay in a world set in an alternate timeline of earth in the year 2040, that alternates itself based on the players that play in it. RP will be played mostly via Discord, and be different to most other regional roleplay servers in the fact that it will be somewhat regulated via a number of systems such as economic system, scientific research system, stability and political, etc. based on NS States and personal Roleplay events; while attempting to be fairly simple enough to understand but complex enough to give somewhat realistic results.
