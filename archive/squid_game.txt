[b]This region has been founded for the purposes of being a 100% totally legit shell company based at a remote tax haven in the Caribbean. We didn&#39;t even steal this one! Also, please shut up about Squid Game. Its a good show, but i don&#39;t want to see a single mention of it at all in my TikTok recommended anymore. I beg you. Wanna ask questions? Wanna complain about how this practice is ruining the game? Contact [nation]Skamparlus Dutchy[/nation] or [nation]Wapistan[/nation] and they may get back to you (probably).
