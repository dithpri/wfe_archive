Pirnes is a large continent split in half by the mighty river Pirn. Several small city-states have risen up along the banks of the river, although all of these states are subject to the laws of the largest of them all, Skegness. Fiercely religious and very proud to be Pirnian, the people of these states live in unity.

[i]Thereout pon th&amp;#39;aughty reed-beast&amp;#39;s mount,
An fir th&amp;#39; guerdon nay tane brilliant merit
May heauenly graces he-tae inherit,
Of bless&amp;#39;d Saints fir naw hef recount.
Thereon slay&amp;#39;n Alexander King,
The reed-beast thae thon Seideving.
All th&amp;#39; greetest Kings abound,
When tae hear th&amp;#39; glorious sound.
Of guid Alexander, strong an young,
Namen-he naw preedlick sung.[/i]
