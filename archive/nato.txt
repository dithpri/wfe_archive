[b]This region is a monument to all raiders, as it was purged of its anti-raider natives. What started as revenge for a SC condemnation that insulted all raiders has ended as a complete domination over [region]The Global Defense Force[/region] and her allies. The FRA was too feeble to even make an attempt to save the natives, as our coalition of raiders proved indomitable.  
Against Raiders United, None Can Survive.[/b] 

We thank our fellow raiders who made this possible from: 
[b][region]The Imperial Legion[/region][/b]
[b][region]Holy Moosean Empire[/region][/b]
[b][region]The Alliance of Dictators[/region][/b]
