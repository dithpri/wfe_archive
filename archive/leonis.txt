Leonis, a region consistently at war, seems to have reached peace with King Charles I taking the throne of Cer Leonis, the new kingdom in the region. After a bloody civil war between the communists and capitalists, the capitalists won, deciding to opt into a constitutional monarchy. After having a Parliament create a form of constitution, the leading general of the capitalists, Charles I, became the king of Cer Leonis. There is still some civil unrest, but most people seem to be happy under the rule of the crown.
