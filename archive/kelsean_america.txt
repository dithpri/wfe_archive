We are in Canada, and are protected by the Wagonerian Islands Region 
(https://www.nationstates.net/region=wagonerian_islands_region).
We have much of the same rules, like no dictatorships and that only the officers can send recruitment messages, but we allow any government that&#39;s not ruled by a dictator. Break any of these rules and you&#39;ll be kicked and banned.
