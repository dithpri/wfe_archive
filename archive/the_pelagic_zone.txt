After submitting the appropriate paperwork and treaties (a feat in and of itself due to the Jwavish love of committees and sub-committees), the polity known as the Pelagic Zone was brought onto the world stage, to allow Jwavin and it&#39;s neighbors more of a say in world politics as well as to encourage international communication between them. The only real problem was no one quite knew where the Pelagic Zone was located in the world. Hopefully they can figure that one out.
