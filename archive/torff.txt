Torff has a simple mission:  To create a slightly more dangerous, less disgusting international community.
Torff has a simple vision:  A world where a man can eat his everlovin&#39; vegetables without a darned thing to worry about.
Torff has a mother named Betty.  She raised him on a farm with a singular purpose:  Never steal a man&#39;s shoes without rubbing off his distinctive scent.
Torff favors a strong little government.  This means a strong government with limited ability to control or create new policies.  Like that kid who went to high school who was really small but drove a big truck.  He was not influential, but you definitely did not want to enrage him.
