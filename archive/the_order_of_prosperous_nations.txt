We are a group of politically, socially, and economically prosperous nations. We respect our citizens individual, natural rights and the ability to make autonomous decisions. However, as an orderly nation we recognize that some law and order must be exercised to keep our citizens safe from unruly harm. We ensure our citizens are provided with the best education possible and post K-12 educational experience to create a successful and strong labor force. We provide a plethora of benefits for our citizens covering aspects in welfare, such as healthcare, and public transportation for speedy travel from place to place. Overall we work together to ensure our citizens are living effective and successful lives, this we swear.
