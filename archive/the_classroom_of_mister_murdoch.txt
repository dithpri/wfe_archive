This is the real region of Mr. Murdoch&amp;#39;s Classroom. Here we don&amp;#39;t worship Mr. Murdoch, but simply acknowledge him as a teacher and a person who has had a lot of experience in just about everything. We haven&amp;#39;t set up our democracy yet, but it will be undergoing shortly. Thank you all, here in The Classroom of Mr. Murdoch, the common person has a say.
