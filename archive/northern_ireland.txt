All are welcome!

For tourists considering visiting Ireland, both North and South please see www.discoverireland.com and try making Belfast your base.  Fly to Belfast direct from New York, or multiple destinations in the UK and Europe. Alternatively transfer via Dublin and take the regular bus transfers direct to the city centre.
