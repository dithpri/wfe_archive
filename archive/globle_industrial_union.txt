The [region]Globle Industrial Union[/region] is committed to providing its member nations with a variety of benefits, such as boosted door-to-door insurance, increased military backup, more foreign aid, and above all, more 100km bike rides on Wednesdays. The Union was formed when several members of the [region]Global Industrial Union[/region] became dissatisfied with the government, and left. We are proud of our growing population of nations and we would be honoured if you would join too!
