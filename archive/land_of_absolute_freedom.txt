Here in Absolute Freedom, we accept people of all creeds and colors and cherish their ability to do whatever they want, whenever they want. We don&amp;#39;t mean false freedom that most offer with petty &amp;quot;laws&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;regulations&amp;quot;, but true, honest, kill your neighbors dog with a pipe bomb-type of freedom. Seriously, do whatever you want, and more importantly, have fun doing it. All member nations are urged to recruit other nations to join up so that we can keep growing, and to have open discussions with other members about current events and stuff like that, but if you prefer to be a hermit and do nothing at all, that&amp;#39;s fine too.
