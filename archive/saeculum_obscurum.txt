[*] [b]RP![/b] RP is set in the 8th Century BCE, around 750 BCE, in a world where no major empires exist and new cultures are being born. As more happens, a timeline factbook will be pinned to the WFE.

[*] [b]Vibe![/b] This region is open to everyone, and aims to be a place where anybody can feel welcome without fear of hostility.

[*] [b]Earn XP![/b] Everyone loves some tangible progression - simply interacting with the region and the soon-to-be-founded government will earn you XP, which will go towards map plots. Factbook will be pinned to WFE soon&#153;.
