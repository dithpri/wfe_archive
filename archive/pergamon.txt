Pergamum was an ancient city located in the Aeolis region of Anatolia. The city had great strategic value, and its zenith was reached during the Hellenistic period, becoming the capital of the Attalid kings. During the Roman period the city was the first capital of the province of Asia.

The prestige of the city as a cultural capital was enhanced by the Pergamon Altar, a monument decorated with depictions of the Gigantomachy and commemorating the triumphs of the Pergamenes over the Macedonians, the Galatians and the Seleucids.

Another outstanding achievement was the establishment of the Library at Pergamos, a centre of scholarship and research, second only to Alexandria&#146;s in terms of the number of volumes and repute of its scholars.
