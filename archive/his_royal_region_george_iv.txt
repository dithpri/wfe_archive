Settled accidentally by two simultaneous shipwrecks, HRR GIV remains riven by sectarian conflicts. While the former consisted of nominally libertarian politically centrist reform-minded atheistic capitalists with environmentally friendly tendencies, the latter group consisted of a party of raving psychotic theocratic fundamentalists that were exiled from their home country after a failed attempt to outlaw recognition of any helio-inclusive solar model. The region is characterized by its resource-rich rain forests, widespread cultivation of hops barley and wheat, and its infrequent social revolutions, as well as its its myriad cross-cutting cleavages which prevent effective wide-spread mobilization or policy-coordination.
