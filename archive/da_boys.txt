We are a region created for fun. Here at the region of DA BOYS we are opened to anything the natives want, if y&#39;all want to raid we will raid if y&#39;all want to defend we will defend. If y&#39;all want it to be a more serious region we will be a more serious region if y&#39;all want to be more casual we will be more casual. another thing I want to build are factions within the region for example you could create a faction based on raiding anyone interested in raiding could join and it would be a area to discuss raiding and tactics. but they can be things in IRL to like hunting, trucks, food and anything! One thing is as you can see by our name we plan to a nation with most of the natives being DA BOYS but girls can join as well if they wanted to.
