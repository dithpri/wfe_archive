Dedicated to the memory of a region long forgotten.

Here at the intersection of time and space reality breaks down, and nothing is as it seems. If you have felt unloved by other regions for your bizarre habits or eccentric personality feel free to park yourself in this twisted little region. And don&#39;t worry, we can see the flying monkeys too.

If you&#39;re interested in joining the region, we don&#39;t want you. You&#39;re not welcome. Thank you.
