This group is founded to represent an alliance of libertarian and capitalist countries allied with Palmerstone on the world stage and welcome new members that are willing to embrace a laissez-faire economy together. This group will elect the world assembly delegate once every 2 months.

This group is closed as it is only to represent the founder and friends on the world stage as a fun alliance.
