An intrepid space explorer accidentally arrived here through a wormhole, only to discover that the place was like a sewerage works for the entire universe. Many wormholes deliver debris and unwary space travellers on a one way trip. Some have left hoping to find a way back to inhabited sectors.

With unrivalled cuisine and a welcome host, many choose to make their home here.
