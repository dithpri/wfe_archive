The Sentient Hub is home to a small but great community. 

We are currently looking for nations with ideas and ambition, in order to join our regional government, and bring new thoughts and minds to our region. 

We are neutral, offer refuge to raided regions, and do not participate in the art of raiding ourselves. 

Please familiarize yourself with the following:

[b]Secretary of Recruitment -[/b] [nation]Sneedsa[/nation]

[b]Intelligence Chief -[/b] [nation]Royal Tradition[/nation]
        
      - We have a couple Intelligence Officer positions available for any interested nations

Everybody else here is nice too... so you might as well familiarize yourself with them while you&amp;#39;re here.
