Welcome to The Sentient Hub!

Our region was once home to over 150 nations! But then the AI went out (founder ceased to exist), and our numbers rapidly declined (founder&#39;s puppet nations ceased to exist).

In the years since, The Sentient Hub has been ravaged by a vicious cycle of raids, rebuilding, and periods of general inactivity.

We had a Screaming Fireworm and Ghost Scorpion Defense Squad, a Minister of Artisan Breads and Epicurean Cheeses, and a Mobile Zombie Extermination Lab. MWMSDGJWEPPC, or &#39;Make Worker More Smart for Doing Good Job Work Education Program Plan Course&#39; was then envy of governments, businesses, and scholars the world over.
