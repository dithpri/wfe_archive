Langonar is a planet in the Goryeo Galaxy home to 53.9 billion Langoreans and Chibs. We&amp;#39;re not a Police State but a democracy hidden as one. 

Welcome to Langonar the home of the Langoreans and Chibs who escaped persecution made by the Goreans. 

We were dominant but were stripped of that title because the Goreans felt like they needed a rise to power!
