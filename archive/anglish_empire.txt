&#147;We mark today, with this ceremony, the conclusion of arduous planning over more than six years which
have resulted in another great step forward towards the exertion of Anglish culture and influence.
This uniting of States within the framework of Anglish provision has been brought about by the
sustained and dedicated work of this Labour Government.
My tribute here is to all who have laboured in this great enterprise &#151; not only to those who have negotiated,
Ministers and officials, together with the members of the select committee who have contributed so much, but to
all who have supported and advanced the idea of an Anglish Empire.&quot;

- Prime Minister Douglas Kendrick (7th May 2017)
