[colour=#5e4c5f]There is a relaxing feel of the mountains making it perfect for letting the stress disappear and peace to find its way to one&#146;s soul. There are many people who love the mountains and live in them, but there is so much space that they hardly ever see each other. Less people means that there is less judgement by them, which means there is more freedom to be the person wanted to be without worry about that pesky inner critic. For someone who is not very social and has anxiety whenever I have to talk to another human, the mountains are the perfect place to get away from all of that and be the most relaxed. I love the homey feel and peaceful atmosphere.[/colour]
