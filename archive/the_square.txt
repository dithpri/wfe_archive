[i]The Square is a strange, flat world, inhabited by a genderless, humanoid, vaguely mammalian species called the [b][color=green]Polytopians[/b][/color]

[b][color=green]Topan[/b][/color], the Weaver of Order, was a being of precision and structure. They envisioned a world of symmetry, balance, and purpose. [b][color=green]Pol[/b][/color], the Dreamer of Creativity, was a spirit of endless imagination and chaos, bringing color and life to everything they touched.

Together, they crafted [b][color=green]the Square[/b][/color], the foundation of all existence, a realm that would be both orderly and vibrant&#151;a world where structure could meet creativity. Topan divided the world into perfect grids, while Pol painted each square with vibrant life, creating mountains, rivers, forests, and plains.[/i]
