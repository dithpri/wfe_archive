[b]King William Island[/b] is part of the Arctic Archipelago. While searching for the Northwest Passage, a number of polar explorers visited, or spent their winters on the island.

1845: NW Passage Expedition: Sir John Franklin made an Arctic expedition looking for the Northwest Passage; his two ships became stranded in 1846 when frozen in the sea ice northwest of the island. After abandoning the two ships, most of the crew died from exposure and starvation as they attempted to walk south near the western coastline. Two of Franklin&#39;s men were buried at Hall Point on the island&#39;s south coast. &#151;Wikipedia
