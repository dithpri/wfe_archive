Welcome to...
[b]The Talking Room[/b] 
[color=brown]&quot;The last free region on NationStates&quot;[/color]   
   The purpose of this region is for nations to gather and debate anything and everything (so you don&#39;t clog up your region&#39;s RMB). Other then the [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=260044/]site rules[/url], it&#39;s total anarchy. So yes, role play, advertising, brainrot, spam, bad words are all allowed, but there&#39;s nothing stopping people from telling you to stick it where the sun don&#39;t shine! And If you disagree with our rules, now you have something to debate! =)
enjoy your stay,
