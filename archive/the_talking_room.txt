The last free region on NationStates: &quot;The Talking Room&quot; 
   The purpose of this region is for nations to come to gather and debate anything (so you don&#39;t clog up your region&#39;s RMB). Other then site rules, it is total anarchy. so yes, you can advertise, spread brainrot, and say bad words, but there isn&#39;t anything stopping people from telling you to stick it where the sun don&#39;t shine, so idk. If you disagree with our rule, now you have something to debate
