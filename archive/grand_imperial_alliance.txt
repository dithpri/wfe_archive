The Grand Imperial Alliance is dedicated to the continued tradition or Imperial and Monarchial rule, regardless if it is by a King, Queen, Emperor, Empress, or any other title. We believe that each and every nation has the right to govern itself as it sees fit. The GIA is dedicated to the exchanging of ideas, thoughts, and a good role play. The Grand Imperial Alliance is laid back and enjoys those seeking a Role Playing experience or those seeking a causal experience.
