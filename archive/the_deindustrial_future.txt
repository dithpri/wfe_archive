Four centuries after industrial civilization stumbled to ruin along the well-worn path of civilizational decline and fall, helped in no small part by the self-inflicted blows of fossil fuel depletion and climate change, a few brave nations rise from the ruins to form the first stirrings of successor societies on the North American Continent.
