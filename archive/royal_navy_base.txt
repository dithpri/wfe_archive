The Royal Navy Base is a late updating jump point region. It was founded by Hungry also known as Sir Thomas Insaniac of the British Isles to be used as the puppet storage region for the Royal British Isles Navy. However, the region has evolved to a Neutral Ground Territory in which all walks of life, let it be raider or defender can use the region as a jump point for their mission.
