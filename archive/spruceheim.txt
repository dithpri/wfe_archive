Founded by radical new thinkers for radical people... and new thinkers.

Spruceheim is the place where the beets and potatoes can be found in each man, woman and child&amp;#39;s belly, on each and everyone&amp;#39;s dinnerplate, in each and every field, shop, dream and wallet!

Where the Mighty Spruce Trees run wild on the plains, in their slow, and almost non-moving way that we all love so much!
