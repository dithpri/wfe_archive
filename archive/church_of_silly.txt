[b]WE ARE THE SILLYISTS! WE ARE A BRAND OF SILLYISTS WHO INTEND TO BE SILLY AT ALL TIMES![/b]

I will be silly whenever humanly possible. I will always sit at the front of the bus to pretend to be the driver. I will always ask my friend who puts too much sugar in his tea if he would like some tea with that sugar. I will make all future dental appointments at 2:30.
