The Freedom Zone is a region where all nations are free to be free and are required to export it to other regions. In the Freedom Zone, you may not be a leftist, socialist, or communist or you will be kicked out. It is expected or all Freedom Zone members to make your citizens work for themselves, and provide no aid to the people who refuse to do so. Nation leaders must also work for themselves and can expect no aid from anyone else.
