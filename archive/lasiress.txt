This is A PMT region based largely around PMT, with the technology ending around the year 1250 A.D. We are a very serious RP region, and all RP will be hosted on our forums here:

We are going to have a few very large kingdoms, which would be claimed on a first come first serve basis, and after that the remaining lands would be divided based on population and budget. Of course, anyone is free to join our region, and we do not discriminate in any way..be it race, gender, sex, ethnicity, or anything of that matter.

Much more is to come as we grow and work together!
