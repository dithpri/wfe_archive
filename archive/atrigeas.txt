[b][i][color=red]Say Goodbye to Atrigeas! 
Democracy Forgotten, Tyranny Useless![/b][/i][/color][hr]

[b][i] &amp;quot; A terrible place to grow your nation and the worst choice for active gameplay.&amp;quot;[/i][/b]

[hr]Atrigeas is infected by zombies!

However, last April Fools Day, Max Barry made sure the people who worked together WON! 
I suggest we all work together and choose to treat the zombies the same way. 

Let&amp;#39;s vote, then follow the will of the majority!

[u]What we know for sure:[/u]
Exporting zombies doesn&amp;#39;t help you, it only hurts others. 
The Cure will take a large percentage of nations researching it. 
If you have a population under 150 million, you best protect yourself by exterminating the zombies while others research.
