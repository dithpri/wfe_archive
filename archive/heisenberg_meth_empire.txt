Welcome to Heisenberg&amp;#39;s meth empire.

The history of this great region is a fascinating story.

It all started with Walter Hartwell White, a chemist turned high school teacher turned meth distributor. He created a great meth empire, selling his legendary blue meth. Unfortunately, it all ended when he killed a bunch of Nazis and died fighting. But his legacy lives on, in the form of this new empire. Come, join us in our quest to conquer the world, and fill it with Heisenberg&amp;#39;s great blue meth!
