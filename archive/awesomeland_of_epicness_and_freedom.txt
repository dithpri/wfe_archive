The region was originally founded as a fun region by me and my friend. It was a slow, quiet region for a few months, until The Black Riders came. They came in, took over, and devastated the region. Only by going inactive then returning after they abandoned the region was I able to return, retake charge and sever all ties the puppet region had. I am now looking for new recruits to grow to be a major power in NationStates.
