(Star Wars Planet)

A pleasant world of grasslands, rivers and lakes. The planet is located in the Raioballo sector of the Outer Rim at an endpoint of Myto&amp;#39;s Arrow, the other endpoint of which was in the Obtrexta sector, though Dantooine itself was still far removed from most galactic traffic. It hosted a small population spread amongst single-family settlements and small communities with large land holdings. Its sentient population consisted primarily of simple Human farmers[hr]
