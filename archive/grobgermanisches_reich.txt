The Greater Germanic Reich, fully styled the Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation was the official state name of the political entity that Nazi Germany established in Europe during World War II. As early as the autumn of 1933, Hitler envisioned annexing such territories as Bohemia, Western Poland and Austria to Germany and creation of satellite or puppet states without economies or policies of their own.
