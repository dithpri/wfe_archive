[b]This region has been marked as fascist and put down. Once again, there is no platform for fascism.[/b]

We are not here for trophy collecting. We are here for anti-fascism. There is no platform for fascists, wherever you go, hiding behind the pretext of &#39;It&#39;s just RP&#39; or otherwise, when we can all see the ideology of fascism for what it truly is. If you can bring yourself to roleplay as adherents of an ideology that directly killed 20 million and brought about the deaths of tens of millions more, then do not be surprised when [i]your[/i] rotten structure comes down.
