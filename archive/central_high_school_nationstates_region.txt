This region is selected for all students of Central High School in Saint Joseph, Missouri. The last Central Region failed due to fighting, so this region will be slightly more authoritarian. When more people enter, we will create a formal way to submit all complaints and issues to Verschtenberg, where it will be handled or taken to the community. Please Join!
