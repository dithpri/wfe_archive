[i][color=gray]God has appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. 
Had God willed, God would have made you a single community, but God wanted 
to test you regarding what has come to you. So compete with each other in doing good. 
Every one of you will return to God and God will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.[/i][/color]
