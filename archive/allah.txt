&#147;We have appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. 
Had god willed, he would have made you a single community, 
but he wanted to test you regarding what has come to you. 
So compete with each other in doing good. Every one of you 
will return to god, and he will inform you regarding the things 
about which you differed.&#148; ~~~ (Surat al-Ma&#146;ida, 48).
