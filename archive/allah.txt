All are welcome in [i]Allah[/i]. May peace be upon you.

When the youth of our nations refuse to take up arms against each other 
at the bidding of corrupt despots, and instead confront their own despots 
in their own capitals, then a new world is immediately possible.

[b][color=green]Holy Quran verse 25:63:
The worshippers of the All-Merciful are they who tread gently upon the earth, and when the ignorant address them, they reply, &#147;Peace!&#148;[/b][/color][hr][b][color=green]Holy Quran verse 4:94: 
Do not say to one who offers you peace, &#147;You are not a believer,&#148; seeking the spoils of this life. For God has abundant treasure. 
You used to be like them, after all, and then God blessed you.[/b][/color][hr]
