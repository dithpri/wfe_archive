[i][color=gray]God has appointed a law and a practice for every one of you. 
Had God willed, God would have made you a single community, 
but God wanted to test you regarding what has come to you.[/color] 
[color=magenta]So compete with each other in doing good.[/color]
[color=gray]Every one of you will return to God and God will inform you regarding the things about which you differed.[/i][/color]
