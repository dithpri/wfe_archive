After just barely surviving a genocide sparked by Mi Santhrope, the people of Pastelaria wanted peace. The nation decided they needed to form a diverse coalition of nations devoted to ensure peace and safety around the globe. New Arcturus was formed for this very purpose.

New Arcturus vows to be a safe and peaceful place for all of those who call it home. Peaceful debate, discussion, and trade between regions is encouraged. We hope you enjoy your time with us.
