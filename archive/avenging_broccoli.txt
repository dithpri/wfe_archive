For [b]too long[/b] have the [b]innumerable atrocities[/b] committed against Broccoli gone unpunished. For [b]too long[/b] have the perpetrators run free, with blood on their hands and vegetables in their stomach.

[b]No longer.[/b]

From today onwards, [b]we fight back[/b]. We will track down the scum that dared to hurt the Brocolli, and we will [b]obliterate them[/b]. 

[b]Join us, comrades, in our righteous crusade.[/b]
