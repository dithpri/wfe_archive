Nations around the world broke with their mother regions and established the new region of Elonbara. A decade after its founding, eight new nations were added to the original three as the region expanded across large swathes of unclaimed land. The most traumatic experiences in the nation&#39;s history were the Fourth Zombie Apocalypse (Z4), in which two refugee nations were accepted into the region and the borders closed, and the attempted hostile takeover of the region by three nations after a post-Z4 border mishap left Elonbara vulnerable. The regional economy has gained steady growth, low levels of conflict, and national revolutions have taken place. Communication and cooperation have kept Elonbara&#39;s interest in national diversity solid.
