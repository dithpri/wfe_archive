Several nationstates broke with their mother regions in 2015 and were recognized as the new region of [region]Elonbara[/region] just before the catastrophe known as Z-4 plagued the world. During the first month, five more nationstates were added to the original five as the region expanded across the land. The single most traumatic experience in the region&amp;#39;s history was the Fourth Zombie Apocalypse, referred to as Z-4. Elonbara is an explicitly diverse group of nationstates, being home to a swathe of political, economic, and civil rights beliefs.

Elonbara was established through a treaty between nationstates, to provide a safe harbor for any governmental body that wants safer borders and a thriving regional economy.
