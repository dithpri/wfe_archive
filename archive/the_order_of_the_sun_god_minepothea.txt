The Order of the Sun God/Minepothea is a region with low tolerance for communists. In short, come on democracies! Fighters are welcome, and if you want to take over some land, go ahead! Here are some rules, though. 

1. Don&#39;t try and steal water. 
2. (just a reminder) Before fighting, be sure to check that you have some pretty good fighters or allies.
3. Have fun, and help make TOotSG/M the biggest region! [color=purple] I know the region name has no / in it, but pretend the slash is there~ [/color]
