In days long past, there was one man who sent to change everything he ever knew. This was Saint Beoaodh of the Pagan faith. He was ousted by his friends and his comrades in arms from The Swamp, and later killed at the hands of some of his closest band mates. His followers learnt of this and made the choice to come back to The World stronger than ever. It is very lucky that someone might find their way here, but we welcome you with open arms, until we are met with hostility, in which case, there is no mercy, and there is no redemption for those poor souls.
