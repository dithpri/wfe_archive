Welcome to the most glorious region of [region]The New International[/region]
In this region we find [u][b]HARMONY[/u][/b], although not too much, [u][b]PROSPERITY[/b][/u], too a point, and [u][b]FREEDOM[/u][/b], every thirty days.
 

[b]*With our WA delegates 30 day term about to end final votes should be cast before midnight, all states are expected to endorse the winner of the poll within 24 hours of it&#39;s conclusion.[/b]
