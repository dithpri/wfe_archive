Welcome to the most glorious region of [region]The New International[/region]
In this region we find [u][b]HARMONY[/u][/b], although not too much, [u][b]PROSPERITY[/b][/u], too a point, and [u][b]FREEDOM[/u][/b], every thirty days.
 
[color=red][b]STATE OF EMERGENCY[/b][/color]
[nation=short]Normaria[/nation]&#39;s collapse into anarchy has triggered a state of emergency within [region]The New International[/region].
The Administrative Council has engaged &#39;Security Protocol&#39;, restricted the Ministerial powers of [nation]Normaria[/nation] and is now contemplating further action.

May we maintain security and order during these turbulent times!
