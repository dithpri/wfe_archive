[b][u]WELCOME TO THE DEMOCRATIKA[/u][/b]

In The Democratika, we don&#39;t force you to conform to back-breaking rule of law, we welcome you with open arms and hearts to a rapidly growing community of friendly, enthusiastic NationStates players, with frequent general and political discussions in the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region_rmb/region=the_democratika]Regional Message Board[/url] and the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1022123]Discord server[/url] and a roleplay framework complete with customisable statistics separate from your NationStates nation and completely custom land claims all accessible through our Discord network. 

In The Democratika, you&#39;ll be recognised. You can engage with a soulful, ever growing community, and you&#39;ll soon feel right at home amongst your new comrades-in-faux-politics both in this region and the TAF.
