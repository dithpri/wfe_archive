[b][u]WELCOME TO THE DEMOCRATIKA[/u][/b]

We don&#39;t force you to conform to back-breaking rule of law. We welcome you with open arms and hearts to a growing community of friendly, enthusiastic NationStates players, with frequent general and political discussions in the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region_rmb/region=the_democratika]Regional Message Board[/url] and the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1022123]Discord server[/url]. We&#39;re willing to help out new nations 24/7 and we keep a strictly open-book policy in The Democratika, so don&#39;t hesitate to make a suggestion or ask a question!

In The Democratika, you&#39;ll be recognized. You can engage with a soulful community and you&#39;ll soon feel right at home alongside your new comrades-in-faux-politics. Every member of our region has equal opportunity to exceed and succeed!
