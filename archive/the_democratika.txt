[b][u]WELCOME TO THE DEMOCRATIKA[/u][/b]

In The Democratika, we don&#39;t tell you how to run your nation, and we don&#39;t force you to conform to back-breaking frameworks for the sake of over-zealous roleplay. Instead, we welcome you with open arms and hearts to a rapidly growing community of friendly, enthusiastic NationStates players, with frequent general and political discussions in the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=display_region_rmb/region=the_democratika]Regional Message Board[/url] and the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1022123]Discord server[/url] and a [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1029099]roleplay[/url] framework complete with customisable statistics separate from your NationStates nation and completely custom [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1029177]land claims.[/url]

In The Democratika, you&#39;ll be recognised. You can engage with a soulful community, and you&#39;ll soon feel right at home amongst your new comrades-in-faux-politics.
