[color=red] Wilkommen! Wir bin Das Kaiser Reich [/color]

[color=crimson] We here at Das Kaiser Reich support anything that supports our Kaiser, and if you move here you  better too or else. Other then our strict kept love of the Kaiser we are pretty laid back on things unless it is communism. [b]WE HATE COMMUNISM[/b]. For, as you all should know, Capitalism and the free market are the only true ways that economy can and should work. Here we do more support Fascist or Dictatorial nations for they are able to share our respect for a Kaiser though we do not turn away nations with a more democratic process or Anarchy&#39;s. You must always remember however, [b]WE HATE COMMUNISM[/b]! [/color]
