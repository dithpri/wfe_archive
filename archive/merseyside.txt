Merseyside is a jungle island just across the Great Sea from mainland Regnum Mons. Until just a few centuries ago, it existed in complete isolation, being ruled by the descendants of the pirate king Shen Mersey, who hailed from the far off western lands of Xifang. Over half of all Merseysiders can trace their lineage back to either Shen Mersey himself, or one of his many Xifang pirates.
