&quot;People like us, we&#39;ve gotta stick together
Keep your head up, nothing lasts forever
Here&#39;s to the damned, to the lost and forgotten
It&#39;s hard to get high when you&#39;re living on the bottom

Oh whoa oh oh whoa oh
We are all misfits living in a world on fire
Oh whoa oh oh whoa oh
