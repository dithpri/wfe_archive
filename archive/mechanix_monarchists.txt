Mechanix Monarchists is capitalist and casual alliance/region, despite the name, all types of nations from normal to colourful and wacky, dictatorships to civil rights lovefest are welcome to join. Mechanix Monarchists used to be a region that contained up to 20 nations and was even once featured as the region of the day! Alas due to IRL problems, the alliance was disbanded and lost many members... That is where you come in! The nations that are left in Mechanix Monarchists invite to rebuild the region/alliance to its former glory and maybe even beyond!
