[color=199606]Located just north of the flat earth and two doors down from the universe where everyone is a spoon, lies a nice humble region. The Krokswed assembly was created by Kolchevhelm and Hesquapaac in the year 5778 in an attempt to revive an ancient alliance known as the BOZ. Internal struggles ripped that world apart but from the ashes these two countries came together to restart diplomatic progress. Since creation, the region has welcomed (2) new nations. The Krokswed Assembly hopes you enjoy your stay and consider joining the fun. [/color]
