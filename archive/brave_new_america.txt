For the last 6 years, Brave New America has sat idle. Blacklisted, locked, and kept safe by [nation]BNA Founder[/nation]. I did not know BNA founder, but I would like to thank them for the years of service keeping the region safe.

For years I have been wanting to return. I can only hope that Licentia, Can-ymir and the others may find their way back one day.

I am home.
