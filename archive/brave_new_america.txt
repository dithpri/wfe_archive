Brave New America was conquered by [nation]Degitania[/nation] on January 18, 2010.
In response to this, some nations went to found [region]A Second Try[/region] in the hopes that one day they may reclaim the region.

With lack of activity, both regions succumbed to multiple invasions. 

In May 2011 the region was refounded by [nation]BNA Founder[/nation]. It lied dormant, but safe, until 2017 when control of the region was relinquished to [nation]Vupaguun[/nation], an original member nation of Brave New America.

I would like to thank [nation]BNA Founder[/nation] for keeping the region safe for all those years.
