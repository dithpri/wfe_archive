For the last 6 years, A Second Try has sat idle. Blacklisted, locked, and kept safe by Bna founder. I did not know Bna founder, but I would like to thank them for the years of service keeping the region safe.

For years I have been wanting to return. I can only hope that Licentia, Can-ymir and the others may find their way back one day.
I am home
