Hi!
I&#39;m Nostalgia and Loneliness and I am so happy you found this little region. If you want to talk about anything at all even though I&#39;m a complete stranger telegram me and I&#39;ll get to it within two days max. I&#39;ll be readily available for a while after I reply because I really, really love just listening and giving advice. The forum can be mainly for connections and maybe some roleplay if you want to join in or start a new world. I&#39;m good with that. Anyways... join Admondir and I assure you that you will never be overlooked again.
We don&#39;t have any rules yet so I suppose I should remind you to be nice and realize you&#39;re not alone.
