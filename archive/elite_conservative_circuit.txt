Welcome to the Elite Conservative Circuit!

In its heyday, the Elite Conservative Circuit (ECC) was a bastion of conservative ideals devoted to the propagation of such beliefs and through lively debate and discussion the dispelling of rumor and stereotypes regarding conservative ideals and philosophy.  Today the new reborn ECC seeks to become a region that facilitates discussion and debate about all topics.  Open to all, regardless of political beliefs or affiliations, parties interested in joining the ECC should send a telegram to the WA delegate to get the password.
