Beyond the borders of the known world lies a realm shaped not by a single culture or creed, but by the boundless dreams of the nations that inhabit it. This is the United Nations of Mendex&#151;a grand assembly of sovereign states, ancient kingdoms, futuristic powers, and bold newcomers who together forge one of the most vibrant and storied regions in existence.

Here, roleplay is not just encouraged&#151;it is woven into the very fabric of the region. Diplomatic envoys cross oceans and starlanes alike to negotiate alliances, settle disputes, or spark rivalries that may echo for generations. Senates convene, royal courts bustle with intrigue, and great assemblies deliberate on matters that affect the fate of all who dwell within the union&#146;s reach.
