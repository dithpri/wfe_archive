Welcome to Chinaland! A region ran by the newly founded Republic of Chisia.

Formally ran by the old Chisia and the now extinct Chinese Federation, Chinaland is now under the newly founded White, Red, and Blue Regime of Chisia after Chisia reformed this region into a completely Chisian-held region after the Chinese Federation fell apart.
