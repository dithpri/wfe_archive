The Seraphs, also known as the Seven Seraphs, were a peacekeeping force that was active during the Golden Age. They worked closely with the Warmind Rasputin with each member being entrusted with a Warmind Khanjali.

They operated from several combat bunkers across the system which were built and stored by Rasputin. Eventually, all of the Seraphs were wiped out during the Collapse. When the Guardians joined forces with Rasputin, they uncovered their armaments in defunct bunkers and rediscovered their legacies.

May their sacrifice in service of the Warmind and all of Humanity be remembered forever.
