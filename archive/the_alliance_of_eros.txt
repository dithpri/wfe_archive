Welcome to The Alliance of Eros, a safe haven for all nations no matter what! We accept all, no matter what they are (except for raiders, but those from [region]Lily[/region] are fine). We boast an active community with a self-elected regional government. We strive for economic, environmental, and military splendour in the world census. Our more capitalist offshoot region, [region]UCON[/region], is basically dead, so ignore it. Enjoy your time in Nationstates, join the Alliance of Eros, and above all, endorse [nation]Levachia[/nation]!

Yours sincerely, [nation]SKM[/nation], [nation]Stengland[/nation], [nation]Levachia[/nation], [nation]Vaymeria[/nation], and [nation]Victoslavia[/nation].
