Hey guys...Its Masimau. I just came back to visit and see how my old region is doing. Oddly. I left The IPNU. And everyone else left this region. I made a new region.  Its called [region]The Alternate World[/region]. I felt thtlat i should not come back to this region yet make a different one instead. I still have admin over this region. If you are a resident and have any requests involving this region just telegram me. However, Don&#39;t be too persistent or else ill just ignore the telegrams. Ill check in once in a while. Sorry it had to be this way [nation]Neo Vatican[/nation] and [nation]Luchinye[/nation].
