When the Bearsheviks, led by Vladibear, overthrew the Care Bear Stare Provisional Government, the UCBSR was formed with the Care Bear Stare, Carebearia, Sharelandia and Rainbola republics. Following Vladibear&#39;s death, Crazybear came to power. She committed the state&#39;s ideology to Bearism&#150;Shareism and initiated a centrally planned economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization. During this period of totalitarian rule, forced labor and famines were carried out by her government causing the deaths of some 7 million citizens. In the present day, power is distributed equally within the union to avoid a repeat of the dark period in UCBSR&#39;s history.
