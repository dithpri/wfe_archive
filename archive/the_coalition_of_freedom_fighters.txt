This is a dream, a idea. I want to form a NSG party with this name. I will accept anyone who is more left wing then centre. We will fight for freedom where there is none, we will fight for democracy where there is none. We are a Coalition because there is no leader of us. 

We exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty equqlity and community and in which no one shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity.
