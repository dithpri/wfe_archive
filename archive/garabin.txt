The World of Garabin

Garabin is a modern world shaped not by myth, but by history, ideology, war, and uneasy cooperation. Satellites watch every border. Trade routes are as decisive as armies. Power is measured not only in tanks and missiles, but in logistics, diplomacy, cyberwarfare, and public influence. Every nation in Garabin exists in the shadow of past conflicts and the anticipation of future ones.

At the heart of this world lies a constant struggle between control and cooperation, dominance and neutrality, unity and fragmentation.
