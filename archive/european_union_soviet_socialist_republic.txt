The European Union of the Soviet-Socialist Republics is a union of nations endorsing &#132;social justice&#148;, &#132;political correctness&#148; and all the other modern radical left and cultural Marxist policies.
Our common currency is the Euro and our goal is establishing regional social justice, eating of the rich, an Orwellian-oppressive society that kills individual freedom and all the other policies that the real-world European Union promotes.
