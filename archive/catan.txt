So much for a region where anyone can hang out.  Unfortunately, raiders from The Black Hawks don&amp;#39;t seem to get that instead of pillaging an RP region, they could have been partying up with the sheeple of the Catan Wonderland.  I am considering scraping the project due to a lack of interest from my sign up posts on NS Forum and the advertising for the region itself.

Just hang out.  That is all, my children of the wheat crop.
