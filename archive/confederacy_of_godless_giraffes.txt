The Confederacy of Godless Girraffes was founded in 1969 by a radical religious group know the Godless Emu.  The cult departed the United States after the 1969 moon landing in fear that our savior Cathulu would be unhappy with a man being placed on the moon. They ventured to a massive island in the Pacific called Ibrahim where they founded the confederacy of Godless Emus.  The name was changed in 1997 to the Confederacy of Godless Girraffes to attract a more diverse demographic.  The Nation today supports life, liberty, and the worship of Cthulu.
