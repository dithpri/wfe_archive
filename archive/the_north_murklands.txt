A Northern region filled with bogs and cold weather. Known for its strong nations and hardy people. 

Today is the end of the Chads. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. At this very moment in a region far from here, the Chads lies to the world while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Spam Accounts. Our fierce war machines which we have developed, upon which we rule will bring an end to the Chads, to their cherished Spam Accounts. All remaining Chads will bow to the Imperial States, and will remember this as the last day of the Chads!
