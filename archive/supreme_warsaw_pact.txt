This pact is only for Communist&#39;s
We will be the Strongest one day,believe me :)
Stalin will lead us
 

OUR ANTHEM

United forever in friendship and labour
Our mighty Republics will ever endure
The great Soviet Union will live through the ages
The dream of a people, their fortress secure.

[Chorus]

Long live our Soviet Motherland
Built by the People&#39;s mighty hand
Long live our People, united and free
Strong in our friendship, tried by fire
Long may our Crimson Flag inspire
Shining in glory for all men to see!

We fought for the future, destroyed the invaders,
And brought to our homeland the laurels of fame.
Our Glory will live in the memory of nations
And all generations will honor her name!
