[b]The Union of the Americas also known as TAU is a multi-national organization located in North, South, and Central America. TAU is dedicated towards assisting, supporting, and protecting all nations within it. TAU is a relatively neutral region and will accept any nation no matter it&#39;s ideals. The one thing that TAU does not accept is aggression and oppression. If TAU deems a nation aggressive and or oppressive of it&#39;s citizens it will eject the nation from TAU until the nation has met TAU&#39;s standards.[/b]
