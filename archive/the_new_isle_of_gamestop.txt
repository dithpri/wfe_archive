A better world, without Chris and [color=red]Republicans[/color]. 
Basically, the rules are as follows: [u]Don&#39;t be an idiot[/u], don&#39;t [b]spam[/b] the RMB, don&#39;t post [strike]Trump propaganda[/strike] Neonazi BS, and remember that begging [nation]Armaidus[/nation] or the WA delegate for a rank usually will not result in you getting one. Any country made by:
[list][*]Alex ([nation]howley monkey nation[/nation])
[*]Ben H ([nation]thelandofpizza[/nation])
[*]Ben R ([nation]chickeneaters[/nation])
[*]Chris ([nation]the democratic states of North America[/nation])
[*]Any nations named after rapists[/list]
are banned from the New Isle.
