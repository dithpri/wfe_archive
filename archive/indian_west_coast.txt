The Indian west coast begins in the salt-white Rann of Kutchch, where desert mirages meet the sea breeze. Moving south through Saurashtra and Mumbai, the land turns lush along the Konkan coast, where beaches and the Western Ghats run side by side. Beyond the spice-scented shores of Goa, the Kanara coast of Karnataka blends forests, rivers, and fishing towns like Mangalore. Entering Kerala, the Malabar coast unfolds in a maze of backwaters and coconut groves, leading past Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. The journey ends at Kanyakumari, where the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean meet &#151; a serene meeting point of land, water, and light at the very tip of India.
