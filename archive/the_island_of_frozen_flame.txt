The day we had dreaded for years had come, the Fire Nation had succeeded. Our world was burning.For three years the world burned, everything the fire touched turned to ash. The only ones who survived where the villagers from the Southern Water Tribe, about half of our brothers from the North, led by me and my sister Katara and the rebels from the Fire Nation who were led by our friend Zuko. We searched for two years to find a land that wasn&amp;#39;t ash and finally found it in a large island in between the remains of the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom.Over the years we have learned to adapt like the water and strike like the fire. We are last remnants of a once great world and we are strong. We are the Kingdom of the Frozen Flame.
