[b]WELCOME TO SLUSHIE RUN[/b]
Here in our great region, you can find a multitude of different types of nation.  We have those that are small, those that are large, those with restrictive governments, and those with nonexistent laws.  All types of nation-state belong here, and we are welcoming to any region that come along.
