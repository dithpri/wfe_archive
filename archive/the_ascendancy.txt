Former state of [region]The Imperial Dominion[/region]. The patriarch of our noble line, Leviathan Romefeller, once had 30 accounts on the regional forum that he used to talk to himself.

This once-proud throne of the Romefeller line was conquered and destroyed in July 2019. We&#39;re now proudly part of the &quot;Aeazen Combine&quot; or some such thing. We continue to provide succour to all forum destroyers.

Ya gotta admit, tho, [i]Romefeller[/i] is a pretty dumb name. Srsly, you can use literally any name for your dynasty and you come up with . . . [i]Romefeller[/i]?
