Former state of [b][region]The Imperial Dominion[/region][/b]. The patriarch of our noble line, [b]Leviathan Romefeller[/b], once had 30 accounts on the regional forum that he used to talk to himself.

Here was the last redoubt of the inbred Romefeller line before it faded into the ignominy of oblivion.

Founded in 2011 from a merger between the Holy Dominion Federation/Intergalactic Dominion and New Britannia. Conquered and destroyed in July 2019. We&#39;re now a [b]Europeian[/b] province that&#39;s proudly part of the [b]Aeazen Combine[/b]. We continue to provide succour to all forum destroyers. ([i]Especially the folks at TapaTalk.[/i])

Ya gotta admit, tho, [i]Romefeller[/i] is a pretty dumb name. Srsly, you can use literally any name for your dynasty and you just rip off an existing one smh
