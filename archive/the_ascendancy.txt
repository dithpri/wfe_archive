Walls of spam have long kept us out, but now the uncivilised hordes of the [i]Eurosphere[/i] have broken into the one real bastion of civilisation, The Ascendancy. In a fashion befitting of our evil occupation we will be censoring all negative comments, and clothing ourselves in a veneer of benevolent autocracy. Also, only members of the Hegemony are permitted to use public conveniences during the occupation. Addendum: We are here as long as the Trinity will permit us, before they come to save the day.
