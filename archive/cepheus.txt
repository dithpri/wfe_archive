We do only good things for our nation. We protect our neighbors and stand up against the bullies. We will do only good things in our region. Embassies will be created in region&amp;#39;s in which we trust and have the same ways. We recruit those who come and reject those who oppose. If force is needed we will use it but we have a political mind first and foremost. Our name resembles the constellation of King CEPHEUS.
