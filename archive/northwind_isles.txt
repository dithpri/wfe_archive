A group of medium to small sized islands situated a few nautical miles north equator; Most remain uninhabited and filled with exotic plants and animals. The region&#39;s main source of travel between islands are wooden sailing ships similar to those that ruled the oceans centuries ago ( Basically think of a modern world mixed with East Indian Frontier stuff ). The inhabitants of the island are more worried about what&#39;s going on within the isles and tend to ignore happenings from other parts of the globe ( not interested in embassies. )
