[color=green]Orda[/color] a once proud former role-playing region in the international community, and the site of two major regional organizations. Sadly the region died after the members decided to move back to the [region=Global Powers], and then to [region=Greysteel]. The region is now back under the every watchful eye of the Revolutionary People&amp;#39;s State, and it&amp;#39;s Sphere of Influence.
