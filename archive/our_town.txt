Life is so grand in our town.
We&#39;re always filled with cheer.
We never have to look around,
To know that we&#39;re all here.

In our town, in our town.
We don&#39;t have to wait,
To find out that our destiny
Is just to emulate.

Life is a smile in our town.
Our flying flags the same;
Because we do not separate,
Ourselves by more than name.

Life is a joy in our town.
We&#39;re all equal here.
No one is superior,
And no one shakes in fear.

In our town, in our town.
We work as a team.
You can&#39;t have a nightmare,
If you never dream.

Join in our utopia.
Come out of the dark.
Banded by equality,
By our flying mark!
