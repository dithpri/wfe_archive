[b]In ancient [region]Hyperborea[/region] the great northern people lived in balance with the creatures of our wild land; its far-reaching forest, hills and valleys. In the years of the great cold that turned our lands to ice, we were forced south along with the animals that adapted to survive. In the great expanse of time that followed, the priestess that spawned our [region]Lycan[/region] race enabled our descendants to flourish in human form, as wolf keepers, and founders of ancient fortified city-states. [region]Lycans[/region] spread across Eurasia with [region]Wolves[/region] ever as our companions.
