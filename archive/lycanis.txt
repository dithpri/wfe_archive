[b]In ancient [region]Hyperborea[/region] before the need of written word, we of the great Royal House of [region]Lycanis[/region] lived with the northern creatures of our wild and far-reaching forest, its hills and valleys. In the years of the great cold that descended from the skies and turned our lands to ice, we were forced south along with the animals that adapted to survive. In the great expanse of time that followed, the priestess that spawned our [region]Lycan[/region] race enabled our descendants to flourish in the new lands in human form, as wolf keepers, and founders of ancient fortified cities. The race of [region]Lycans[/region] spread across the continent with [region]Wolves[/region] ever as our companions.

Our border-less domain is [region]Lycan Imperium[/region], where the last ancient, [nation]The Lycan Emperor[/nation] guides our great people.[/b]
