Oh my land, the land of the ancestors
Warrior, warrior, warrior,
Oh my people, people of eternity 

With my determination, my fire and the volcano of my vendetta
With the longing in my blood for my land and my home[/b]
[/color][hr][b][color=blue] As long as in the heart within,
The Jewish soul yearns,
And toward the eastern edges, onward,
An eye gazes toward Zion.
Our hope is not yet lost,
The hope that is two-thousand years old,
To be a free nation in our land,
The Land of Zion and Jerusalem![/color][hr]Both [color=blue]Israelis[/color] &amp; [color=green]Palestinians[/color] can join we don&#146;t mind. Just abide by NS rules obviously.[hr][/b]&amp;#127470;&amp;#127473; &amp;#127477;&amp;#127480;
