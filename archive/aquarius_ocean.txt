The Aquarius region is a region in which lies the Commonwealth of Mystic States, an archipelago known as the place in which the dead stick around to play! The ocean has a few more archipelagos and atolls. The temperatures can go as low as 2 degrees Celsius and go up to 25!! In the ocean there are a number of caves where nuclear weapon stations sit. It has been a long time since this area has seen any military action though.
