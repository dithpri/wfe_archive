[i]It&#39;s been centuries since we stumbled upon the cold, dead iron hand of the Caaradus. We [b]were[/b] the last light.[/i]
[i]We [b]were[/b] the replacement.[/i]
[i]We [b]were[/b] the final, loud inhabitants.[/i]
[i]But now, we are quiet.[/i]
[i]We don&#39;t talk to each new civilization.[/i]

[i]Everything is quiet and sombre.[/i]
