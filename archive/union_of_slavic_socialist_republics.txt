                                           Welcome!
Before the Union of Slavic Socialist Republics was created, Slavs were separated into many pseudo-states with puppet governments that were controlled by the USA and its close allies. The Slavic people were oppressed and Slavic culture was dying out. In those days, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were the only sovereign Slavic countries. But that changed. The Slavic people rose up against their imperialist puppet governments and under the leadership of the United Slavic Alliance led by the great supreme leader of all Slavs, Adam Sestak, united and created the Union of Slavic Socialist Republics. Comrade Sestak was democratically elected the first Slavic president.
