From occupying vast European territories stretching from the British Isles to Gallatia, our forefathers once carved out an enormous empire. Presently, the Six Celtic Nations are Brittany (Breizh), Cornwall (Kernow), Ireland (&Eacute;ire), the Isle of Man (Mannin), Scotland (Alba), and Wales (Cymru). 

Glory to us all! Long live the Celts and our other European siblings!
