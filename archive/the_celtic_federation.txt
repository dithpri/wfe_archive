The essential premise of Pan Celticism is the recognition that through Inter Celtic cooperation, we base the indefatigable unitary spirit/solidarity of our region and the autonomy of our fellow Celts.  

From occupying vast European territories stretching from the British Isles to Gallatia, our forefathers established an enormous empire in the Iron Age. Presently, the Six Celtic Nations where our common ethno-culture flourishes comprise of Brittany (Breizh), Cornwall (Kernow), Ireland (&Eacute;ire), the Isle of Man (Mannin), Scotland (Alba), and Wales (Cymru). 

Celts and our non-Celtic guests are all welcome, even the English. However bear in mind that Zionist and Communist elements are strictly forbidden.
