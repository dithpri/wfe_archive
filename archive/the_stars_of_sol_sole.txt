A future tech region which I hope to begin developing into an active RP region at some point in the future. It&amp;#39;s based on the idea of a supermassive star ([nation=short]Sol Sole[/nation], meaning &amp;quot;sun of suns&amp;quot; in Latin) around which other stars orbit. Thus it can be realistic (no violations of the laws of physics like faster than light travel) while still allowing interaction between various civilisations of different species.
