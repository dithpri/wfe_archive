[color=#ED4719]The KGB was the main Soviet state security and secret police agency from 1954 until 1991, when the USSR inevitably collapsed. The KGB was responsible for many human rights violations and suppression of political dissidence across Eastern Europe. This region has been seized and permanently destroyed to prevent the agency from being glorified. It was previously owned by [region]Antifa[/region], [region]North Korea[/region], and [region]Zarathustra[/region] throughout history.[/color]
