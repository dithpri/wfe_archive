Located in the southeastern corner of the American Union. Once seceded from the Union in the 1800s, and it&amp;#39;s set to do so again, only under the name &amp;quot;The Southeastern Confederacy.&amp;quot; Only this time, it does not seek any form of warfare. Welcome to The Southeastern Confederacy.
