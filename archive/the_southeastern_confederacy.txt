This region covers the southeastern portion of North America. It was once a separate region within the United States of America during the Great American Civil War. It had lied dormant for over 150 years. Tired of the same old stuff?! Been banned from another region through no fault of your own?! Bring your huddled masses to The Southeastern Confederacy!
