[b]Greetings weary traveller![/b]
Here, on the glorious island of carrot. Everything is a little more orange. According to the internet, orange is the colour of [i]joy, frivolity, amusement, happiness and enthusiasm[/i]. If these are words that you can associate you and your citizens with, we will be more than happy to give you a warm welcoming. Best wishes [nation]Daucus Carotia[/nation]
