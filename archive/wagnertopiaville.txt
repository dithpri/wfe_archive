Wagnertopiaville is a mildly entertaining autonomous collective. We&#39;re an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take it in turns to act as sort-of-executive officer for the week but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting by a simple majority, in the case of purely internal affairs but by a two thirds majority, in the case of more major decisions.
