Oh, it all started on that small tobacco farm down in Kentucky, oh yes. Our boy, our lord, our leader, Darrin Pollock was raised there, oh yes. He aspired to become a horse jockey, but a tragic incident involving a bucket of Cookies and Cream Ice Cream, several large, angry falcons, and a nearby orphanage rendered him unable to ride again. He took up life as a suburban language arts teacher before then fleeing from the United States and establishing the region of Darrin. Oh yes, the rest is history.
