A realm of high fortresses and mist-filled valleys, the Empire of the Seven Peaks rises across seven colossal mountain ranges. From the imperial capital of Lutristan, the High Crown rules over kingdoms, duchies, city-states, and knightly orders bound together beneath one banner.
Founded by the Kingdom of Lutristan to bring order to the heights, the Empire values honor, strength, and clever statecraft in equal measure. New realms are welcome to swear fealty, scheme in the shadows, or carve out glory on the frontiers&#151;so long as they respect fellow nations and keep conflict in-character.
