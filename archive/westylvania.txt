A region of Honor, Ideals, and Freedom. When we say freedom though, we mean all nations of all sorts can co-habit here in peace. We pursue a policy of Honor as well, and shan&#39;t stray from the path of righteousness. Our diplomats focus on making sure the ideals of Westylvania are protected and promoted.
