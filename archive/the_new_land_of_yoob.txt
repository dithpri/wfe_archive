After the founding of Bippilandus, Thaddeus Bippy decided to form an alliance with surrounding nations in order to further bolster strength against the raging wars amidst the Outer Regions. Originally titled &quot;The Inner Regional Territories Alliance,&quot; the region was renamed [region]The New Land of Yoob[/region] in honor of the long-disbanded region of similar title. The region&#39;s goal is to gain strength through numbers and impose power against those who dare stand against any within its allied walls.
