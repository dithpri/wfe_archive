Hello, 

How about that ride in? I guess that&#146;s why they call it Sin City (hahaha) 

You guys may not know this, but I consider myself&#133;a bit of a loner. I tend to think of myself as a one man wolf pack. But when my sister brought Doug home, I knew he was one of my own. And my wolf pack, it grew by one. So were two&#133;so there was two of us in the pack. I&#133;I was alone first in the pack, and then Doug joined in later. 

And 6 months ago, when Doug introduced me to you guys. I thought&#133;wait a second, could it be. And now I know for sure, I just added 2 more guys to my wolf pack. 4 of us wolves running around the desert together, in Las Vegas looking for strippers and cocaine. So tonight, we make a toast!
