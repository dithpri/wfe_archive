This region is democracy based, so all ideas for laws, formatting, are appreciated. Any and all questions will be answered as soon. But idiotic spam messages are not tolerated. Ask me (The Jiggles) or any of my officers about any questions you may have. Any and all recruiters are extremely difficult to find, so if you have stamps and want to move here, use them so that we can expand. The Siths Lords are always willing to accept newly founded nations looking for a region. In-fighting isn&#39;t allowed, so all nations are completely safe.

Peace is a lie; there is only Passion 
Through Passion; I gain Strength 
Through Strength; I gain Power 
Through Power; I gain Victory 
Through Victory; my Chains are broken 
The Force shall free me.
