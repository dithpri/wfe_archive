In [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_lumpy_sith_lords_of_rock]The Lumpy Sith Lords of Rock[/url], we are strong. We are legion, and rule the Galaxy. In this region, we do like to raid, but not without reason, so we are not like the would be tyrants of DEN. We are almost completely safe from raiding, and I say almost because we were attacked, but we won. This region is an empire, but it does have a ruling council. If you&#39;re not in this region and reading this, join us. WA MEMBERS PLEASE ENDORSE OUR [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=falkyratanka]Delegate[/url]!!!
Alert Level: Yellow. Raider region hates us.

&#147;Peace is a lie, there is only passion.
Through passion, I gain strength.
Through strength, I gain power.
Through power, I gain victory.
Through victory, my chains are broken.&#148;
