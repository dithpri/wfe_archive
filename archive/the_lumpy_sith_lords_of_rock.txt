The Sith Lords of Rock are all good people. Just wanted to get that out. Anyway, this region is still under construction, so all ideas for laws, formatting, and anything else like that are appreciated. I say that because if I know what you want, I can try to fit this region to your happiness. Any and all questions will be answered as soon as possible, but idiotic spam messages are not tolerated. You can ask me (The Jiggles) or any one of my officers, which can be found on the home page. Join the Dark Lords of the Sith!

Alert Lvl: Green
Green: all good
