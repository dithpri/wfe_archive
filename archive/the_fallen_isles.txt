[b]The Fallen Isles[/b], a post-apocalyptic wasteland that was once a popular tourist destination in the United States before the Great War of 2077. Formerly known as Hawaii, the isles were invaded by the People&#39;s Republic of China and a climatic battle was fought between the Chinese and Americans to wrestle control of the islands. Just as Honolulu&#39;s defenses were breached and Chinese forces were about to take the city the bombs dropped and the world as we knew it ended.

Now in 2285, hundreds of years after the bombs dropped, Oahu is slowly recovering from the bombs while raiders, mutants, irradiated creatures, small tribes and emerging settlements are beggining the fight for the Hawaii Wasteland.
