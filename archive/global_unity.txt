This region was founded by the great nation of The Free Land of Niger-Bakongo. It&#39;s aim is to ensure peace and prosperity to all nations seeking a home founded with love, compassion, and kindness. We reserve the right to dispose of nation who do not follow our procedures. We also would like all new nations to embark on a simple course about our region to familiarise themself. Thank you &amp;lt;3
