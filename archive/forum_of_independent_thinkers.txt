[color=blue][b]Welcome to the Forum of Independent Thinkers, or FIT![/b][/color]

[color=blue]We are a region committed to discussion, debate, and civility. We aim to face the political divide of our world by actively discussing practical and common-sense solutions to major problems. This is an ideal home for centrists, moderates, and independents, but partisan liberals and conservatives are welcome if they are respectful and open to having their views challenged.[/color]

[color=blue]Our regional values are [b]critical thinking[/b], [b]free speech[/b], and [b]compassion for those in need[/b].[/color]
