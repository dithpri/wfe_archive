The rebirth of Admiraria!
New Sen is a place where anyone is allowed. All nations in New Sen are allowed to be whatever type of nation they want, authoritarianist or democratic. Nations not in the WA can vote in polls on the nations page, and the Capitol will vote based on the winning vote. The presdient will also vote on behalf of the Confederacy, but is not directly influenced by the poll. 
All members are encouraged to install NS++ to enhance their playing experience.
