In Victorian times, the British replace Christianity with Spiritualism as the dominant religion. The religion spreads to Australia and the whole of the pacific except for Indonesia, which stays Islamic, and the Philippines, which says catholic. During the cold war, the union takes over Greece and a political revolution takes place called the Blue Revolution, where a one party system takes over, and implements Centrist policy across the whole Pacific, UK, Balkans and British territory. It becomes a superpower, against the US and USSR Britain never loses its empire, and the whole country is dominated by a 70% Spiritualist population, which leaves peacefully with the protestant community in modern times.
