The Federation of the [color=blue]AMERICAS[/color] was
nothing more than a single nation region in 2013.
But in this new year of 2014 the Americas is now home to
more nations, we hope to expand and have new nations and
a regional delegate. This small but armed region was founded
by [nation]WORLD WAR 3 AMERICA[/nation], it&amp;#39;s leader
Gabriel Rorke founded the region in the name of Liberty.
So if you want to join our region go on ahead!
JOIN THE FEDERATION!
