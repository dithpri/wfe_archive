[b]As high as hawks soar, defenders can fall. 

These native communities have fallen victim to the INFERIORITY of the defender masses. Numerical advantages have been EASILY overcome by the SHEER SIZE of our most holy manly equipment. 

May the natives appreciate not looking ugly for once, as we breathe renewal of artistic value into their lands and waters, that they may find solace and peace in the idea of trusting our benevolent rule and guidance that will inevitably lead to their flourishing.
