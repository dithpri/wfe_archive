[b]Welcome to the idyllic continent of Eupero![/b]

This region is home to [i]Daarwyrth, Great Robertia, The Blackcat Isles, Slavokstan[/i] and [i]Lirsene[/i], five states that hold sway over the myriad nations and peoples of Eupero. Together, these five countries have formed the Pentad, a confederacy of states that seeks to increase the stability, cooperation, wealth and peace between the nations and peoples of Eupero.
[hr][b]Note: currently, this region does not accept any new members, as it is primarily intended to tie my main nations together.[/b]
