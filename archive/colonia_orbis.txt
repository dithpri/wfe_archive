[i]RP Year: 1770[/i]

-----C.O. is an RP region dedicated to living out one of history&#39;s most interesting eras-the Colonial and Industrial ages. Featuring some of the world&#39;s most dangerous weapons and ideas, Colonia Orbis seeks to fit the role that many a region cannot: a region where a nation is only limited by imagination (and firepower).
