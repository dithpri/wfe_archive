Aethor is a multi-species world with a modern tech level equivalent to the early industrial era. We took out the magic, but kept the Elves and Orcs! If this premise interests you, come and join us!

We&#39;re a new region, so bear with us as we begin setting up embassies and factbooks!

We&#39;re transitioning into an 18th Century Era Region. We feel this is a more interesting era to explore for Aethor. Roleplay will be starting soon, and discord will be up soon as well!
