If you would like to become a dominion or ally of the wondrous Socialist union of Coolkid6991ian states, then feel free to make an appointment with our Premier, Winston Kimyo.

Also, it is possible to ally or join with us whilst not being a socialist nation, however, you WILL NOT have a say in regional politics unless reformed by the socialist committee.
