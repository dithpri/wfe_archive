While a good amount of land from Haudernian conquests is directly integrated into the empire, and indeed sometimes the nations subjected to war by Haudern escape more or less unscathed, there is a middle ground. This is that middle ground, nations who were not subjected to utter conquest or even mild conquest, but which Haudern wishes to use and abuse. They are officially integrated into a community of nations who pay homage and vassalage to the emperor; a sort of copycat ComIntern, except far harsher. It&#39;s a living!
