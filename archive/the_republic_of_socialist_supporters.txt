It can be hard to keep track of all these abbreviations. So tonight, we decided to do some practice!

[url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_black_hawks]The B Hawks[/url], along with their friends from [color=#B0171F]The S Legion[/color] of [region]Osiris[/region] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_brotherhood_of_malice][color=purple]The Brotherhood of M[/color][/url] went out tonight to take a G tour of the NationS Multi-V, and practice some of their abbreviations!
 
[color=red]The H&#146;s were still getting the hang of it by the time update had finished, but at least they got to raid plenty of R&#146;s and make lots of M&#146;s along the way![/color]
