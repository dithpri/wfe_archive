[color=blue]Imagine a world where &amp;#127794;forests flourish and &amp;#127754;oceans are full of &amp;#128044;life. Where &amp;#9889;&amp;#65039;energy is as clean as a &amp;#127956;mountain stream. Where everyone has &amp;#128305;security, &amp;#9884;&amp;#65039;dignity and &amp;#128157;joy. But, we can&#146;t build this future &amp;#129335;&amp;#8205;&amp;#9792;&amp;#65039;alone, but we can build it &amp;#128104;&amp;#8205;&amp;#128104;&amp;#8205;&amp;#128103;&amp;#8205;&amp;#128103;together.[/color]
[color=green]If you want a &amp;#9851;&amp;#65039;green &amp;#127757;world, then we all have to march alongside each other. If you&#146;ve got &amp;#128161;ideas of how to get there, we want to &amp;#9989; learn from you. 
LET&#146;S DREAM TOGETHER, PLAN TOGETHER AND ACT TOGETHER![/color]

[color=red]We can do this together! 
ALL EMBASSIES WELCOME! Regions automatically become a member of this Council once you have embassies.[/color]
