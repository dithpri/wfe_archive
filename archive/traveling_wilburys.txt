[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

Traveling Wilburys was once an embassy collecting region with almost 1000 embassies to its name. It was not a politically charged region compared to other regions I usually capture and exterminate. However, considering the fact that this region had almost 1000 embassies, and the fact that I find embassy collecting dumb, this was worthy of being occupied and annexed by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation].
