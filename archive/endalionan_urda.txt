Welcome to Endalionan Urda. It literally means Connected by the Divine or Union of the Divine. As your Emperor, I am your Divine conduit, and anyone who disobeys the common laws I set can be banished from my empire. Anyone is free to pay me homage. The weak we grant protection for loyalty, the strong can add their power to mine to reach for greater Dominion over my enemies. Association with World Assembly, that bunch of idealistic buffoons, is outlawed.
