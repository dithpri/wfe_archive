The Nexus isn&#39;t a localized region; it is the term for the infinite, ephemeral threads that link universes, dimensions, and realities (&quot;Realms&quot;) to each other. It is through these threads that travelers&#151;whether by technological, arcane, divine, or other means, often intentional, accidental, or chaos&#151;are able to find themselves in new worlds.
