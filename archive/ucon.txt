Greetings, my fellow people.
[hr][b]NOTICE:[/b]
This region is in decline, as our founder recently CTE&#39;d. Most nations remaining here are inactive ones which will soon meet the same fate, or puppets. [b]All active nations in the region are moving back to [region]The Alliance of Eros[/region]. (THAT IS AN ORDER!)[/b]
[hr]Our old home and parent region, [region]The Alliance of Eros[/region], is still growing, so most of our citizens moved back there. However, out here in this pleasant split-away outpost-thing, you can stand out among us, rather than be below the deep depths of [nation]SKM[/nation]&#39;s ancient influence. 

Again, please consider moving here, to [region]UCON[/region], we are a nice place, so why don&#39;t you stay here?

Best regards,
[nation]Intergalactic coutrys[/nation], [nation]SKM[/nation] (via [nation]SKM Ambassador[/nation]), and [nation]Vaymeria[/nation].
