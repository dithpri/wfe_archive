Hello, and welcome to the glorious region of Val Atlase!

Located deep in space in the Atlas Quadrant, Val Atlase is home to a number of different nations, located on their own planets, moons, asteroids, space stations, anything the imagination can conjure up! Val Atlase is also known for its somewhat... shadier reputation. Nations of mixed reputation, from the oppressive to the just plain odd, make up the region.

Val Atlase is a small, newer, rapidly growing region. Role-play, personal customization of your personal planet (or moon, or space station, etc.), and participation in the decision making for the future of Val Atlase via polls are a few features found in Val Atlase.

We look forward to having you join Val Atlase!
