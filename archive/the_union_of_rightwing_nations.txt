[u][i][B]To Defender Noobs: It&#39;s not a liberation if you failed to secure the region originally and are grabbing it now that we&#39;ve left. Have fun on your fancy detag![/B][/u][/i]

[i]The ever-so-lovable liberators of [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b], with the aid of [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]the West Pacific[/region] and [region]Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army[/region] have come to bring the revolution to oppressed raiders around the world, and this seemed like a good start. Any questions about the revolutions will be addressed by the benevolent leaders, any criticisms by the banhammer. But why don&#39;t you [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]join us[/url]? After all, you have nothing to lose but your chains![/i][/color][hr]
