A separatist county in Northern Ireland, ruled by the Mac Cana clan. It seeks reunification with the Republic of Ireland, and will use any means deemed necessary to achieve this. The Mac Cana are notorious for their brave, boarish nature, but they also value the finer art of philosophy. They are widely known to fight to the last breath for any friend in trouble, earning them the nickname &quot;The Valiant Protectors&quot;. They place loyalty and integrity in exceedingly high value, but also have deep respect for good morals and those strong enough to follow them. The Mac Cana are here for you to become a sept, should you feel the need to do so, and look forward to enjoying the more brazen aspects of life with you.
