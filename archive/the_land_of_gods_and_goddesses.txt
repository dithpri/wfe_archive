This land has been bestowed upon the men and women that had the courage and heart to become something. Something of greater value than these unworthy pagans. This land shall be used as a shield for when the times are harsh, but it also shall be used as a sword which will cut every enemy in its way. Come my brothers and sister, for we will be victorious!
