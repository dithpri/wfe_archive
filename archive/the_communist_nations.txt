Welcome fellow authoritarian regimes. (Or freedom filled ones)
I personally welcome you to [region]The Communist Nations[/region]!


You will join a strong and active government here in this region, and anyone may take office as long as they&#146;re active players.
While it&#146;s not required to endorse the delegate, we recommend it so that he will take your input and advice with the World Assembly. Our current delegate is [nation]Noporine[/nation] so help him out with endorsements and advice


Our region is run by a triumvirate of the nations of  [nation]Manticore A1[/nation], [nation]RIP Abraham[/nation], or [nation]Noporine[/nation]. These are who you look towards in times of despair or crisis
