Shadiotic was formed by the tectonic plates shifting and causing a large piece of land to break off of a country. The large island floats near its original home, but sustains its own government and rules. Shadiotic was once one whole and unified area, but they recently had a Civil War, commonly known as the &quot;Red Tragedy&quot;, and the country has broken into different sectors and areas. Currently the country is recovering and rebuilding.
