Curious about a region to join? Think [color=darkred]nevermore[/color]. The [color=purple]Order of Poe[/color] is set out to enhance the world with its knowledge and imagination. We are open for positions of power to be delegated once we reach ten nations. A forum will be built for topic discussion once we have enough participants. Posting on the board regularly is encouraged. Express your love for [color=lightblue]&amp;quot;Annabelle Lee&amp;quot;[/color] or confess about the [color=red]heart[/color] you have hidden in your floorboards. Remove your [color=orange]&amp;quot;masque&amp;quot;[/color] and be yourself.
