[b]We, the members of [region]the Amish Republic[/region] have reclaimed this land for ourselves and the natives. [/B]We will now colonize this region, and help them restart.

This region is a Proud Colony of [region]the Amish Republic[/region]

[I]So please, don&#39;t try to take this away. 
Or else we&#39;ll come back and reclaim it.
That&#39;s a promise[/I]
