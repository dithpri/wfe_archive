[b]Commonwealth of Solaris[/b]
[i]Territory of The Dominion[/i]

A ancient region that once crumbled into the sea. The region was raised from the ashes better than before. Now the Commonwealth hosts the most fearsome nations in all the world, well known for their military arms manufacturing sectors as well as large Intelligence gathering networks. To trifle with this region is to taunt death.
