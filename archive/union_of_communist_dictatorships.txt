The Union of Communist Dictatorships, or UCD, was established on 11/26/2013 by the Communist Dictatorship of &amp;#39;Murica. The goal of the UCD was and is to unite the Communist Dictatorships of the world into one Union to help seize power and build ourselves up on the ladder of world leadership. We work together to perform Coups, Vote on certain subjects, and to help spread the power of our Communist Dictatorships. WE ALSO ACCEPT PSYCHOTIC DICTATORSHIPS AND OPPRESSIVE DICTATORSHIPS.
