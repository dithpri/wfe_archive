[color=red][b][u]History[/u][/b][/color]: Back In the middle of 2021, The Holy Sha Alliance seceded from [region]The Heirs of Rome[/region]. Everything was good until December 29th, When a great plague ravaged the Holy Sha Alliance, killing 87% of the Holy Sha. Major nations like [nation]Yesmanland[/nation], [nation]Of The Tyrannical Frogs[/nation] and [nation]Yeettown usa[/nation] survived...but in the end, Yesmanland voted to disband the Holy Sha. The Holy Sha stayed dead for months, until 4/21/2022, when the three great nations came back together...forming the Holy Sha Reformation.
