Back In the middle of 2021, The Holy Sha Alliance seceded from [region]The Heirs of Rome[/region]. Everything was good until Winter, 2022, When a great plague ravaged the Holy Sha Alliance, killing 87% of the Holy Sha. Major nations like [nation]Yesmanland[/nation] and [nation]Yeettown usa[/nation] survived and some badly wounded like 
[nation]of the tyrannical frogs[/nation]... but in the end, Yesmanland voted to disband the Holy Sha. The Holy Sha stayed dead for months, until 4/21/2022, when the two great nations. came back together... forming the Holy Sha Reformation 

LONG LIVE THE HOLY SHA!
