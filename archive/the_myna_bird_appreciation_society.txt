[i]Along a long highway, train line, next to a shipping and below an airline route is The Myna Bird Appreciation Society. A tavern with rooms and a restaurant for weary travelers&#133;[/i]
We are a point for random people to have a nice stay on a long journey unless you are an invader.
We are committed to ending the horrible treatment of Indian Myna Birds in Australia and promoting the Myna Species.
