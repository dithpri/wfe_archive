[i]along a long highway, beach on a major shipping line and below a major airline route is The Myna Bird Appreciation Society. A tavern with rooms and a restaurant for weary travellers&#133;[/i]
We are here as a jump-point for any defenders. Yes we have no alliances with them but maybe it will fall and a major raiding organisation will fall.
We are committed to ending the horrible treatment of Indian Myna Birds in Australia and promoting the Myna Species.
