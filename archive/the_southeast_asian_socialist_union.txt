The Southeast Asian Socialist Union (SEASU) was officially established in 2010 as a political, economic, and cultural alliance led by the Democratic Republic of Indochinese Commune (DRIC) and the United Socialist States of Majapahit Union (USSMU). SEASU was envisioned as a socialist counterpart to regional organizations like ASEAN but with a distinct focus on promoting socialist governance, economic equality, and regional solidarity. Its mission was to foster unity among member states, ensure collective defense, and lead Southeast Asia in sustainable development and decolonized modernization.
