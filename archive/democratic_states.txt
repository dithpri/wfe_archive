[color=red][b]IL CREDO DEL FASCISTA E L&#39;EROISMO, QUELLO DEL BORGHESE L&#39;EGOISMO[/b][/color]

[b][color=blue]&quot;Democracy doesn&#146;t favor the individual above all else, nor does it promise to. One of it&#146;s greatest failings is that single voices of reason are too easily drowned out by the cacophony of the masses. The concept of [i]The Will of the People[/i] is dangerously arbitrary. Certainly not worthy of being the foundation of a rational and practical political system.&quot;[/b][/color]
