[b][color=blue]&quot;Democracy doesn&#146;t favor the individual above all else, nor does it promise to. One of its greatest failings is that single voices of reason are too easily drowned out by the cacophony of the masses. The concept of [i]The Will of the People[/i] is dangerously arbitrary. Certainly not worthy of being the foundation of a rational and practical political system.&quot;[/b][/color]
