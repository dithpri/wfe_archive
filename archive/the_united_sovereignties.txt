The United Sovereignties (fr. Les &Eacute;mirats souverainet&eacute;s) is an intergovernmental organization. Its aims are facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights and the ultimate goal of making the world a better place. It was founded in 1973 by Prime Minister Gerard de Montcalm and Grand Admiral William Matthews in the outbreak of the Archean Crisis which started in 1970 with a global recession and peaked in 1973 with the Grand Revolutions in which 67 governments were overthrown, often with violence.
