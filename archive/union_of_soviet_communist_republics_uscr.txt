In the far North lies the Soviet Union. It&#146;s snowy in the east, and mostly habitable in the west. It has tons of pine trees, meadows, and tall mountains. It&#146;s known for its picturesque buildings full of dazzling old buildings, and cobble streets. Only communists and socialists are allowed in, and we only want dictatorships.
