Ok so this is supposed to be a democratic region for elections and stuff. 
This is for players who want frequent elections and think electoral politics are interesting. 
DON&#39;T PANIC! While yes, Iusl has executive authority, They have pledged not to use it, 
making this region a constitutional monarchy of sorts.
