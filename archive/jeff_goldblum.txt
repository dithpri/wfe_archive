[i]Welcome to the Region of Jeff Goldblum[/i],
[i]Founded [u]15/04/18[/u][/i],
[b]Regional Anthem[/b]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJelEXaPhJ8&amp;t=49s

A Region dedicated to spreading the Religion known as &quot;Goldblumism&quot;. For more information, take a look at the dispatch I&#39;ve pinned to the region!
Note that you are not required to adopt the Goldblumist faith to reside in this region, nor are you required to be part of the Region to be a Goldblumist! However, you will not be able to apply for any government position unless you adopt the faith.

Not interested in converting? Very well, let&#39;s make fun of people who dig up dinosaurs and discuss the mysteries of life that always, without a doubt, finds a way!
