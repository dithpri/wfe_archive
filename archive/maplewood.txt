[b][color=#29AB87]Welcome to Maplewood (also known as the Commonwealth of Trees), a sprouting forest founded around the pillars of [/color][color=#3F00FF]democracy[/color], [color=#228B22]ecology[/color], [color=vermilion]equality[/color][color=#29AB87], and [/color][color=darkgoldenrod]pacifism[/color].[/b]

[color=#C71585]Maplewood is a new region, so we&#39;re actively searching for nations willing to join us in a quest to create an [B]interesting regional culture and government[/B], a [B]verdant community[/B], and most of all, an awesome, welcoming forest for all nations.[/color]

[u][color=#954535]Once demography statistics have become stable (about 15 nations), we&#39;ll be able to institute a regional government. For now, join the Commonwealth to help us get the Forest growing![/color][/u]
