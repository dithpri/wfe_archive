This is the place where cellists go to be among their peers, where magic happens, and where everyone is safe. We accept you for who you are. We love you for no other reason than that we want to. The bonds between cellists are unbreakable, or nearly so. 

Come join me, fellow cellists, and bring tales of you adventures, wherever you have roamed. Join us, and be among your friends.
