Greetings, my dear friend. You have arrived at [region]Parliament[/region]; a place where Bills are written and the Law is amended every day.

If you are eager to join our ranks and help us influence the actions of not only the present moment but the future as well, please contact the House in which you are interested in joining. They can exactly tell you how to join and what is requested. But most importantly, they can also advice you on the especial privileges you receive once joined ;)

If you have any further questions or issues that you would like to see addressed, please contact our founder.
