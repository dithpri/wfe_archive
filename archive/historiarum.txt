Reborn from ashes we build a new kingdom, with our old empire in crumbles. We take the remaining and brightness shines. Conservatory runs rampant but little arguments fuels a region with life. We will make our father region proud with a bright and vibrant region where everyone is accepted and no one is discriminated and every one has an opinion. WE WILL LIVE LONG!
