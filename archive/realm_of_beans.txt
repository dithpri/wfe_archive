Here in the Realm of Beans, we love nothing more than to sit around a campfire, eat some beans straight from the can, and sing. Singing is good for the soul, and in the Realm of Beans, you can sing to your heart&amp;#39;s content; while eating beans and sitting by a campfire. 

Why yes, we do accept donations of beans, thanks for asking!
