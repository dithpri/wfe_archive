[b]The Skyheld Alliance[/b] was founded in 2022 by the alliance of Thama and Kaldaran. In 2040, the Alliance was fused into a slightly politically-and-culturally-split nation, [i]The Desternian Imperium of The Skyheld[/i], AKA [b][i]The Skyheld Empire[/i][/b], through the marriage of the Princess of Kaldaran, Andaya Valdas, and the Archon-Engineer of Thama&amp;#39;s son, Duncan Fenr&iacute;s.

In 2217, The Chaotic Cycle started. Ancient Enemies of Kaldaran, the Destaran Remnants, rose and collected on Terra. Infiltrating the Empire, their legions ravaged the planet and drove us off it, using our own technology against us. The Sol system was abandoned and put under guard, but the Remnants are still a major threat.
