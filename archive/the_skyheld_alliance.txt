[b]The Skyheld Alliance[/b] was founded in 2022 by the alliance of the Technodemocracy of Thama and the Holy Imperium of Kaldaran. In 2024, the Principality of Lopandu almost forcefully entered the Alliance. In 2026 The United Communist Republics of Bojikami were persuaded to join, it was a success. The Alliance&amp;#39;s territories are located mainly in the Pacific and Indian oceans, with Bojikami in Asia.

In 2040, the marriage of the Thaman Archon-Engineer&amp;#39;s son with the Kaldaran Crown Princess fused Thama and Kaldaran into the Skyheld Empire. The Alliance kept existing as a separate entity of course.
