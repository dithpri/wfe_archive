Westrnland is a continent located far away (really far away!). The people here are simple, kind, and united, supporting democratic socialism. Because they are over 20000 kilometers away from the nearest other continent, this place was rarely known until the 20th century. But with the development of aviation and navigation, more and more visitors will come here. Westlin, the people living here, eagerly anticipates the arrival of tomorrow.

If you have a dream and a kind and brave heart, then come and join us!

We do not have a unified organization, but you can choose to send a telegram to the Kingdom of Sugarville in Westrnland or send an email to newswitzercandy&amp;#64;gmail.com &amp;#12290;
