Welcome to the ultimate free market frontier. Here, in this barren landscape, the government guarantees nothing: no police, no welfare, and no safety nets. We reject the World Assembly&#39;s morality. In this region, wealth is earned, not given. The weak may starve, but the strong shall thrive. A sanctuary for the Sovereign-Profit-Zones. Caveat Emptor.
