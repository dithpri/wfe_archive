[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] went out to search for some animals today!

[color=aqua]The animal that we were looking for is a mystical one, with footsteps that none can hear, and a shape that none can see![/color]
[color=blue]We turned left, right, up and down to try to find it in your region. [/color]

We checked the corners, sent inspectors to your nations, but all we found was this colourful WFE. We hope that we&#39;ll be back, this time with the legendary animal!
