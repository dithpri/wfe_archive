[color=#BF0000]Welcome to [u]Cape Maher[/u]![/color]

Cape Maher is a new region recently refounded, and will welcome nations of all political and personal beliefs and ideologies. The region as a whole is a parliamentary monarchy, since the founder has permenant access to regional controls, and the WA Delegate is allowed controls.

You are allowed have a weird origin, a non-human population (exception of MLP), an intelligent cave society, or a land like Middle-Earth. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter!

As more nations arrive, the region and its relations will continue to grow.
