Marginalized by the rest of the world, the Periphery is a region that the rest don&amp;#39;t bother to look at. Here, wars take place beyond the knowledge or care of the General Assembly Issues arise to which the rest of the world is ignorant, and crimes are committed beyond the reach of the Security Council. It is the rim of the world, the edge of society. Here, there is an epic struggle taking place. The socialist Sinema has formed a shaky alliance with the religious Jassania against the Corporate Playground of Stakata and the Totalitarian world of Cruelty that is the Dominion of Repina.New nations must alight themselves. Socialist for Good, Religious for Peace? Or perhaps Corrupt for Profit, maybe Cruel for Evil.
