Out on the edges of the Galaxy lies The Periphery.  Under the protection of the Xeraphian Empire, The Periphery consists of the Taiueen Expanse and the Typhon Expanse within which the Tri-Zone Hegemony of the Square Zone, the Spiral Zone, and the Third Source contain the majority of the star systems and planets of The Periphery.

In addition to the 20-odd inhabited planets within the Expanses, there are planetoids and asteroids that serve as mining enterprises and prison worlds.

The entirety of the Periphery is governed by the Imperial Principality of Auralinia.  The direct representatives of the Prince of Auralinia reside on the worlds of Jerusem and Xeraphington.
