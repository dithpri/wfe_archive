The Middle Western Province, a flat, quiet land, draped by fruitful plains of wheat and soy, dirt roads that turn to bustling highways and blotches of smalls towns to larger cities. A mountain range forces a border along the eastern most feature of the region. Canyons, cliffs, and plateaus sand this once red baron landscape. The Middle West has much history beneath its roots and tumbleweeds. Currently run by The Armed Republic of New Texarkana, the Province is always looking for new states to request admission. Come to The Middle West Province! On the corner of Classy street and Wasteland Avenue.
