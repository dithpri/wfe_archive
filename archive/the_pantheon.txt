The Pantheon is a organization made up of the elites of NationStates. Based around PMT and FT, our organization sets a high standard for the companies and nations of our game. Making rulings in the Pantheon via voting in a manner that has one portion of our group utilizing two votes[The High Court] and the other utilizing one vote[Lower Court], fairness is assured. Based around technology, tactics and intelligence, brute military force is not always the way with us but when necessary we will resort to it.

All hail the Black.
