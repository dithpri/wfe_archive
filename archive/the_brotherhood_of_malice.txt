[b]Welcome one and all to the [color=purple]Brotherhood of Malice[/color]! This region was founded upon the ancient ideals of fraternity and efficiency by [nation=short]Venico[/nation] and [nation=short]Valtarre[/nation].
Here you can find raiders and roleplayers having a grand old time, in a party that has on occasion slowed down but never stopped since 2012.[/b]
