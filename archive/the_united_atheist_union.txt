[hr]The United Atheist Union is a region founded on February 6, 2014, out of a desire for an elite group of atheist nations to form a union and work together to improve Nation States. The Union does not discriminate in any way or form against ethnicity, political party, beliefs, ideas, sexual orientation, or anything else. We are very tolerant of others, we function in the beliefs of there being no god, as stated this is an atheist union for those who believe that there is no god. We welcome any nations to join the United Atheist Nation.
