   &amp;quot;Welcome! I give to you a glorious region for the alliance of Germans and Norwegians for econoomic and spiritual similarities to be a shining beacon of hope for those nations in inequality. I will allow all types of nations to move to this alliance. Rogue, corrupt, dictating, shining, frightening, and all others are welcome to share a rich and traditional culture.&amp;quot;
