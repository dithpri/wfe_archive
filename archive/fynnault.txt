Welcome all to the newly founded, Fynnault! I&#39;m proud to announce that this region has been founded and may it&#39;s years be many! All I ask of anyone that sees this region, is to please think of it for a moment, Fynnault doesn&#39;t wish ill intent on any region or nation but will gladly defend itself in the face of threats. I plan on building up a region that prioritizes the safety and alliance of it&#39;s members. Nations of any type and background is warmly welcomed. If you choose to make your home in Fynnault, I hope you enjoy your stay!
