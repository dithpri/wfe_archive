89 years ago, the Herin archipelago was a part of the UK&#39;s colony of New Zealand. When NZ was granted independence they chose to share the gift with the Herinians. The most notable of the islands is Connius, which has been in a long civil war between the Socialists (South Connius), Republicans (Connius), and Monarcho-fascists (Mighty Connius).
