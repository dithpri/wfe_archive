The Christian Communist Union stands for the ideals of Liberty, Equality and Justice (hence Communism) and faith in Our Lord Jesus Christ. We fight for a better world, free of injustice and oppression. We shall feed the hungry, heal the sick and clothe the homeless, we shall bring hope and faith to those who have none!
