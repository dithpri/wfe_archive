We are diverse and cover every need, from WA issues to our Military.

[b][u]Short Biography[/u][/b]
Created in 2003, TWS has a long and interesting history. It was the founding member of a large and successful multi-region defender organisation called the Emergency Auxiliary Army (EAA). After a period of doing good deeds the EAA disbanded and TWS has been somewhat of a hermit ever since.
