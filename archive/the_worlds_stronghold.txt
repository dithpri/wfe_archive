[b][i][color=olive]Welcome to The Worlds Stronghold!
The residents of TWS talk freely. Our garden allows us to relax and get away from the usual politics of NS.
We are diverse and cover every need, from WA issues to our Military.
If you need a place to live, then TWS is always right for you![/color][/i][/b]

[b][u]Short Biography[/u][/b]
Created in 2003, TWS has a long and interesting history. It was the founding member of a large and successful multi-region defender organisation called the Emergency Auxiliary Army (EAA). After a period of doing good deeds the EAA disbanded and TWS has been somewhat of a hermit ever since. Are we on the way back up?
