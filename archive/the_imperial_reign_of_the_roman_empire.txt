NationStates&#39; Premier Roman Themed Region!

The Imperial Reign of the Roman Empire values freedom above all else. No player will ever be forced to play a certain way or endorse a nation that they do not wish to endorse. However if the expirience is good here please try and endorse your founder.

The Imperial Reign of the Roman Empire is a Meritocracy. Here you&#39;re only limited by your own ambitions and statesmanship.

We are a Roman Themed region, but all cultures are welcomed!

We do NOT communicate with NS Moderators, as their decisions are largely unfair and arbitrary at best.

For immediate administrative concerns please telegram a Regional Officer
