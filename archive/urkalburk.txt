Urkalburk is a horrible, segregated region, devoid of any nations, and with no resources in anyone&amp;#39;s hands. Geographically, Urkalburk is shaped like your mother, or at least it is if you stand on it. To the east is nothing; to the south is even less. The Mhhhhhh Peninsula makes up the southeast part of absolutely nothing, despite there being even less than nothing. Undiscovered by everyone, nevertheless not caring, Urkalburk will never grow as a region.

Jesus Christ cannot be quoted uttering the names of these deserted lands. Near birth, he was not heard saying anything because he wasn&amp;#39;t born yet. It was probably something about Urkalburk, though.
