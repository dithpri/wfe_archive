[b][color=990000]History of the French Republic[/color]:

[color=003399]The Republic arose in 1792 after the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen in 1789; it was built by the people for the people. Despite several returns to monarchy and the empire in the nineteenth century, the Republic is guided by the same spirit. Thus, France&amp;#39;s republican history is primarily a political construct of a community of citizens who are equal regardless of their social, ethnic, religious or other backgrounds.[/color][/b]
