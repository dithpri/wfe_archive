Where all nations under the sky and connected by the sea are accepted as &#39;of Bhel&#39;: the Community of Bhel accepts the Greater Community of Bhel as those who acknowledge the common connection of the sky and sea. To harm one of the Greater Bhelian is to harm one of all Bhelians. Forever free, forever connected to the skies and seas, forever together and inseparable as children of sky and sea. Those whom oppose this, oppose the sky and sea and deny our natural and eternal condition and thus reality itself.
