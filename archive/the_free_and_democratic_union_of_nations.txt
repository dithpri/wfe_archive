This is a region of countries that are free and democratic. The leader of the region(titled Predsjednik, pronounced prehd-syehd-neek) is elected for a monthly term by the nations. These nations must be for the people. We are a NEUTRAL region with a strong defense. WE WILL NOT ATTACK ANYBODY NOR ENTER A WAR UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED! Unlawful nations will be ejected. The region has monthly elections to a lower chamber called the House of Delegates and to an upper chamber called the House of Representatives. Being a neutral region we will not be in the World Assembly.
