This region has been occupied (with the consent of the original founder) by an interregional communist force due to the rise of right-opportunist and revisionist elements in the region as well as a new threat from external reactionary imperialist forces following the death of its founder.

Thank you to all comrades who helped secure the region, in particular to [nation]Free Esch[/nation] for mobilising the Red Army to help us.

URA!
