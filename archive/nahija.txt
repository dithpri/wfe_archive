Welcome to Nahija, a region honoring the struggle of the hajduks against the Turkish oppressors during the First Serbian uprising.
Nahijas (English nahiya) were the local government units at the time of the Uprising, and, thus, at the heart of the life of the hajduks.
As a region, Nahija was founded on June 15th, 2013, and is currently the only region on NationStates founded upon the events of the First Serbian uprising of 1804 and the rebirth of Serbian statehood after four centuries of foreign rule.
Enjoy your stay.
