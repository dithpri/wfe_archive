Please join the World Assembly! To do so, link your nation to an email account (one that has access to email), go to nation states in your main nation, click the &quot;World Assembly&quot; button, click the &quot;Apply to Join&quot; button, and after one to two minutes, you will be emailed. If you do not see the email, please check your spam folder. The email will be from nation states. It will most likely contain a link. Click that link and you will be part of the World Assembly! Now, go to our own WA Delegate, the Republic of Lazadonil, then click on it, scroll to the bottom of the nation&#39;s page and click the &quot;Endorse&quot; button to let balloons have more influence in the World Assembly.
