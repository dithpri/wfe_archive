[Color=#27AE60][b]Founded: September 25, 2017 by [nation]Crystalsummer[/nation] (Zeus)[/color][/b][hr][color=#66CC00][b][i]Long Ago, There was a time when the world was ruled by evil forces (raiders) who were destroying regions. Evil forces successfully killed all the defenders as defenders weren&#39;t stronger than them. All defenders landed to The Elysian Field and because of their sacrifices in their past lives. They became Gods and now their only mission is to protect the world from evil raiders and bring destroyed regions back to life by refounding them through The Elysian Fields.[/i][/b][/color][hr][b][color=#669900]If you want to join the gods and help them to accomplish their mission send a telegram to [nation]The Elysian field founder[/nation] or [nation]TEF Ares[/nation].[/color][/b][hr][color=#669999][b][u]&amp;#128199;Regional Links&amp;#128452;[/u]
