Established 30th of January 2023

We are an all inclusive region so please be yourself!
What makes us unique? We are a Democratic Monarchy (Constitutional Monarchy) which for us mean our Founder and WA Delagate are both Executives! This means if you receive enough endorsements and get elected into Delagacy you receive all executive powers!
Our Region Law and Common Dignities are posted under Factbook. So take a look!
We hope you find Xethuitho a pleasant home!

Please endorse our Prime Minister [nation]Franada[/nation] as your WA Delagate!
