Hello, and welcome to [region]The Liberty Bell[/region], where nations liberties and freedoms can be explored! 

Summary: [region]The Liberty Bell[/region] is a Libertarian region. Our approach to this region is to let every nation&#146;s Liberty be expressed, hence being Libertarian, and have a hands-off approach and allows nations to do anything they want, just as long as it follows NationStates rules and guidelines, of course.

[b]Note[/b]: As stated in the last sentence, follow NS and regional rules! Posting anything that is deemed inappropriate will be reported ASAP, and violence, hate, etc. is not acceptable and the nation[s] will be punished accordingly. Remember, we want a fun and healthy environment.
