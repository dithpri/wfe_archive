Welcome, Scholars to your new regional home! 

This region was founded by the last survivors of the [region=Eternal Scholars]

This was a region used particularly for the nations of people who attend CFHS. However, we did allow people outside of that, should they want to join. 

We ask that if you&#39;re a member of the World Assembly (which we fully support) that you endorse our WA Delegate. Of course, I this isn&#39;t mandatory, we just request it.  

Thanks for joining us, and we hope you enjoy your stay with us as Eternal Scholars.
