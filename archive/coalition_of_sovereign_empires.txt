The Coalition of Sovereign Empires is a Coalition established in the early 2000&#39;s to protect and preserve imperialistic ideologies. Most nations involved share similar interests in military and industry with little care of freedoms. Those who are not similar are sponsored client-states or establishments that support the Coalition. The Coalition requires each nation to give 100,000 soldiers to the Sovereign Army of the Coalition who execute peacekeeping operations and operations that are of agreed Coalition interests. Each nations standing army may also serve for Coalition interests but are not required to do so. WA membership is strongly advocated but not necessary.
