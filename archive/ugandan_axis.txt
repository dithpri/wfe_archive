It is 2018. Uganda Memes have spread like wildfire, until they reached actual Uganda. Some people study the culture of Ugandan Memes, that date all the way back to &#39;Who Killed Captain Alex&#39;, one of the first (relevant) Ugandan movies. Surprisingly someone nicknamed Captain Alex starts an Axis, or an alliance of many nations. As Captain Alex plans to invade most of Africa, he might invade you if you don&#39;t join our Axis of Uganda. We hope all new nations to da Axis feel welcome, as we are a new region, and I hope we find Da Wae (no region puns intended for all those in the know). Feel free to recommend any ideas to me. our Discord is https://discord.gg/7vvYXG3
