Founded as a quiet place for a former NSer, to observe and ponder the world she once played in on a daily basis.

No active recruitment but you are very welcome to open an embassy with here or move here, it will be quiet though. Please observe the basic rules:
1. No hate speech (racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny etc.)
2. No hostility; this is a place of calmness not drama
3. Be nice to each other.
