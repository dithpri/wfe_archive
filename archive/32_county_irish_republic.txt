[b][color=green]***Risen from the ashes, comes the once proud &amp; true original Irish region for rebels &amp; patriots***[/b]

We hope that you&#39;ll spread some craic &amp; raise a pint with us. You are also encouraged to become involved in our regional politics and to enlist in one of our two military branches.[/color]


[i][b][u]Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann[/i][/b][/u]
[color=orange][i]&quot;Soldiers are we,
whose lives are pledged to Ireland,
Some have come
from a land beyond the wave,
Sworn to be free,
no more our ancient sireland,
Shall shelter the despot or the slave.
Tonight we man the &quot;bearna baoil&quot;,
In Erin&#39;s cause, come woe or weal,
&#146;Mid cannon&#39;s roar and rifles&#39; peal,
We&#39;ll chant a soldier&#39;s song!&quot;[/color][/i]
