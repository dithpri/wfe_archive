With the smoke cleared on the ruins of Dublin&#39;s streets, a new era has arrived for the liberated Irish who no longer shall be slaves to the Roman war effort. The soldiers of [nation]Cake Island[/nation] and [nation]Epson12[/nation] and the Irishmen who joined the fight are cheering loudly, for the tricolor flies over Ireland once again!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
This rebellion is a warning to you, [nation]Plagentine[/nation]! The people of Ireland shall never surrender to foreign tyrants who dare to invade for the sake of power, for Ireland unfree shall never be at peace!
