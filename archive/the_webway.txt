The Webway is Hell&#39;s own labyrinth.  It is a network of tunnels and paths that bore through the space between realities.  The Webway is dominated by the vicious Drukhari.  Their capital is the Dark City Commorragh.  They leave Commorragh only to capture slaves and seize resources.  Centuries ago, the Kabal Man&#39;men dominated Commorragh. They established an exit from the Webway in a desolate desert known as Raem.  It was from this blasted land that the Drukhari launched raids against many other nations, and found allies such as Melkor Unchained.

When their leader was seized by vicious enemies, the Kabal fractured.  The Sunless War has raged for centuries.  All the while, the C&#39;tan, have encroached deeper and deeper into the Webway.
