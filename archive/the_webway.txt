The Webway exists as a labyrinth between the material dimension and that of the Warp. It exists as a part of both yet existing in neither.  In fact, it has been described as not being a true dimension but instead a complex network of capillaries and arteries.  This forms a maze of glowing tunnels making a tapestry of hidden threads that spread between the veil of realspace and warp space. Ultimately, it is a construct that spans the dimensions.  Elements of its construction includes complex psychic wards to protect it from being breached and included hyperspatial pathways.  Present day Eldar do not fully undestand the exact shape or form of the Webway.
