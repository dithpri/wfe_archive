The birth of the United Nations of Pomperaug began when Supreme Overlord Boettcher met with President Funkerson at the East Pacific Conference. After a couple of drinks and some fooling around, the two leaders decided to elope and create their own Region. They wanted to go to Darien, because the land was perfect and the people were happy, but they were too poor, so they settled for Pomperaug. And thus, the United Nations of Pomperaug was born. The UNP is a coalition of friendly nations with the goal of dominating the entire world.
