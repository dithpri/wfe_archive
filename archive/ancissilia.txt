Welcome to Ancissilia

Ancissilia is a miniscule fantasy region! built for losers like myself and others.

The date is 1211 AD, and you can pick whichever nation you want, although it can&#39;t be too big

Also, while the exact definition of &quot;too big&quot; is admittedly vague, use common sense, obviously, you can&#39;t have a third of the map or a continent.
