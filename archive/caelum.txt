[B][i][color=#8C185B]Out of the darkness we will rise
Into the light we will dwell
We came to rule the world with muse in arms
We are the clouds in the sky
We are the storm and the tides
We are the wind and the rain
The sun and the moon and the end of all time

We are the Gods of the New World Order, We are the Soldiers, the Legion of Light!
We are the Centre, the Death of the Dun, Fire and Flame, We are One![/color][/i][/B]
