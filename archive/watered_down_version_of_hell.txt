Welcome to Watered Down Version of Hell, a relatively peaceful place so far. We are a small, newer region that acts more like an alliance as opposed to a region.

Why are we here if there&#39;s so many other regions? Well, I can answer that. I left after reforming my nation because I wanted to make my own. Simple, yeah? 

Anyways, welcome again to Watered Down Version of Hell. Enjoy your stay!
