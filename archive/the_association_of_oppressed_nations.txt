[color=purple][b][i] The Association of Oppressed Nations[/i][/b][/color]

[color=#8d679d]We have been oppressed by a violent and ruthless dictator and are looking to start again ... again

Sorry any genuine nations that I eject but regional security is currently fragile as we have an imminent threat of invasion by 2 different regions

Our Regional Board is here : [url=http://assofoppnations.boards.net/] AssOfOppNations Forum[/url]
 
If there is ANY questions, contact one of the cabinet members, or someone on the forum! We would be happy to help out![/color]
