 [b]Judea[/b] is the biblical name of the mountainous southern part of the historic [region]Land of Israel[/region], known since the mid-twentieth century as the West Bank. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Babylonian Judea, Persian Judea, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively. The term [i]Judea[/i] as a geographical term was revived by the Israeli government in the 20th century as part of the Israeli administrative district name Judea and Samaria for the territory generally referred to as the West Bank.
