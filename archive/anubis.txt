Anubis is not necessarily a raiding region, nor is it anti-raiding. We are a complex organization willing to lend a helping hand both to raiding and defense efforts, whichever we deem necessary. 

We have a democratic system, where citizens vote on whether or not to aid the aforementioned efforts, and anybody can run for leadership positions, as long as they are citizens. 

Join our forums, they are where most of the action takes place, including voting: https://nsanubis.forumotion.com/

Anubis aims to make the world a greater place through both covert and overt operations. Who knows, we might even get a few condemnations along the way!

Join now to help Anubis grow to greatness!
