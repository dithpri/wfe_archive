The Elandian Archipelago is a region in the [redacted] ocean that strive to never be dictated by others. Although we can have great goals, we aren&#39;t to be bossed around by others. We strive to excel, and celebrate diversity, but also be tough and not go down without a fight. Its name derives from the old Kingdom of Elandia; which, before its collapse in 1871, took up all of these mid-sized islands. Of course now, many of these islands are still up for grabs, and have a lot of territory to spare.
