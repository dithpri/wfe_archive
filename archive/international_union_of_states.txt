[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to kick off [i]March Madness[/i] with a good old fashioned training raid. With their Narwhal tusks strapped on and &quot;thank u Penny&quot;s at the ready, even update shenanigans couldn&#39;t get in their way. If you fancy yourself as the fastest Pennyslinger in NS, or maybe you&#39;re just really good at larping as a Narwhal, why not join our [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]discord[/url], or sign up on our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]forums[/url]?
