The International Union of States is a fledgling region looking to make a name for itself among its peers! Due to our smaller size, we are better able to interact with ALL members. From roleplaying to day-to-day chats, this region is for everyone.

With no discord, no outside forum, and no private conversations outside of Telegraphs, our business is conducted solely on the NationStates forum. If you want things non-complicated, that&#39;s why the IUS is here!

Constitution TBA, but terms MUST be followed!!!

With free elections and a government that is still to be shaped, the IUS promises you the chance to have a great deal of influence in shaping a region. So welcome aboard!
