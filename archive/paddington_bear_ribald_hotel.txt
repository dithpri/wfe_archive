During the early days of November, 2023, a cavalcade of regions named for fictional hotels with British sounding names, were created by nations with [b]&quot;OIS&quot;[/b] as part of their names. Such a glut of regions will certainly prove to be difficult to maintain, and their founding nations will doubtlessly soon disappear into oblivion. However, the cornucopia of &quot;Hotel&quot; Regions inspired that a parody of them in the form of this [region]Paddington Bear Ribald Hotel[/region] region be created. Because what could be more British than Paddington Bear? And &quot;Ribald&quot; because this is not merely one of the mindlessly same, cookie-cutter, cast of the monotonous Hotel named regions.
