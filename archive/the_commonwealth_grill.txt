[b][u][color=teal]Welcome to The Commonwealth Grill. We have burgers and hot dogs.[/color][/u][/b]
The Commonwealth Grill is the military jumping-off point for [region]The Commonwealth of Regions[/region]. Here, our valiant forces rest. Beyond, they continue the fight!

[color=goldenrod][b]Liberated regions will be given an embassy here so we can make sure they aren&amp;#39;t re-raided before the natives can regain control, but once they do they are free to cancel it themselves. Feel free to stop by and share a beer with us before you do, though![/b][/color]

While you&amp;#39;re here, why not come and say hi?
