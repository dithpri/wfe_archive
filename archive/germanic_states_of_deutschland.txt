Nothing is possible unless one will command, a will which has to be obeyed by others, beginning at the top and ending only at the very bottom. This is the expression of an authoritarian state &#150; not of a weak, babbling democracy &#150; of an authoritarian state where everyone is proud to obey, because he knows: I will likewise be obeyed when I must take command.
