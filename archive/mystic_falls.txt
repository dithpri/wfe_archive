many nations make up this big, colourful land. Not all of them are good but its still very colourful. you could visit the tamaran nations lush forests and the magestic temple of lord laurance or you could visit one of the water tribes and go sledging in the snowy mountains or make ice-icles if you want. Or you could visit the fire and hell-hounds that will rip you apart in the nation of the lunar clan if your into that kinda thing.
