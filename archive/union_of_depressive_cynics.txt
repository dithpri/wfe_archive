Cool, you found the [b]Union of Depressive Cynics[/b]. Leave your optimism at the door.

The [b]UDC[/b] rejects the idea that humanity is redeemable and supports the philosophies of cynicism and nihilism.

If you wish to join here, which I&#146;ll accept is unlikely, telegram [nation]Djisland[/nation] with a brief application stating your reason for wanting to join. Do not try to infiltrate our region with the purpose of &#147;spreading optimism&#148;. You WILL be banned if you do so.

Embassies are not being accepted, so don&#146;t send any requests.
