The Hollowlands Region is overseen by a secret group known as the Hollow Lords. The group consists of a number of members equal to the number of countries that are a part or the region. When a new country joins, the current members of the Hollow Lords each search out a candidate to nominate as the representative for the new country. After the candidates and all information about them is revealed, an anonymous vote is taken, and the candidate with the most votes is brought before the group and inducted. If a member leaks any information about the group or its members, they are executed and the remaining members go recruiting for that country again.
