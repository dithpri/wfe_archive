There I was, refounding my old nations, and apparently [nation]Grande Normandie[/nation] sat in this region years ago (even as a regional officer, &quot;Senator&quot;). How curious, given I don&#39;t remember it at all. 

According to [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=31479458]this[/url], the region had a fascist tag. Meanwhile, [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=27789200]this[/url] seems to indicate that they ran some inexperienced raiding operations.

So now this place belongs to [region]The League[/region]&#39;s Defense Forces! Specifically, [nation]Quebecshire[/nation]. But if you have more information about this place, do tell. It seems quite obscure but I&#39;m curious nonetheless.
