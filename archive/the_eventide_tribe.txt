The Eventide Tribe is a vibrant Christian community in a peaceful valley nestled amidst breathtaking forests and flowing rivers, rooted in a shared love for faith, nature, and fellowship. Within our tribe, we foster a sense of unity, understanding, and support. We are dedicated to providing a safe and respectful environment that is chill and free of drama (we take that very seriously). Individuals are incouraged to engage in conversations with openness, kindness, and a humble willingness to learn from one another. Join us in this sacred valley, where faith, nature, and community intertwine, as we journey together towards a deeper understanding of God&#39;s love and purpose in our lives.
