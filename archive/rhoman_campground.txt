[b][region]THE W0RLD[/region] militia was looking for a nice restaurant to have lunch, and we found this one! Hope the &#39;fendas don&#39;t mind cleaning after us, as well as paying for our sumptuous meal! [nation]Fortunin[/nation] ordered a large chocolate smoothie, a 12 piece chicken nugget with a side of fries, and a sprite because (nooooo) he spilled his chocolate smoothie all over the table! But sadly the restaurant wasn&#39;t able to accommodate the large amount of napkins required to clean up the spill! [nation]Nova Dackians[/nation], unhelpfully dropped his burger too (nooooooooo) T-T This made it worse, so the &#39;fendas have quite a job to clean lol[/b]
