Lunity encompasses the entire surface of the moon, but primarily exists as a small cluster of city-states and nano-technological super-structures within craters and lava tubes.

An atmosphere-free region with intense gamma radiation, the surface of this region is barren. It possesses immense reserves of heavy elements and rare earth minerals, thanks to the moon&#39;s lack of geological activity and the circumstances of the moon&#39;s formation. Food is primarily produced via a colonies of nano-tech assisted bacteria. Though nutritious, the heavily synthesized meals leave much to be desired in terms of flavor and texture.
