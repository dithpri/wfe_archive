Persia (Iran) is heir to one of the world&#39;s oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200&#150;2800 BC. 
It has since been a key player in history, contributing to advancements in governance, science, architecture, music, arts, religions, philosophy, and gastronomy. 
The genial people of Persia are fiercely patriotic and proud people. Through many invasions they have endured to rise again as greater and more powerful empires, and will do so for as long as humanity exists.
