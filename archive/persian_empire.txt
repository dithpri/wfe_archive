[b][color=green]THE ACHAEMID AND SASSANID REALMS OF IRAN[/color]
[hr]

[color=purple]The Persian Empire swallowed up the Babylonian and Assyrian Empires, and went beyond them! It was the greatest empire civilization had ever known, and its capital was the center of the world!

Iran is far more than a country: it is a place of splendor, where the gods dwell and the ancient heroes still walk the land, where the remote past and the immediate present live side by side! All other lands are disappointing, for the sun does not shine so brightly elsewhere!
