The [region]Persian Empire[/region] is well known for being the home of the [b]Prince of Persia[/b] series of video games and the [b]Persian rug[/b]. It is also the predecessor of present day Iran and the the birthplace of the Zoroastrian religion.

Unfortunately, the empire has fallen into bad times and no number of Jaffars , Magic Carpets or tales from the Arabian Nights can reclaim her lost glory. Perhaps [b]Mahmoud Ahmedinejad[/b] can, if his beard tries hard enough.

Until the glory is returned, please continue to support the Regional Delegate, [nation]Rewqa[/nation].
