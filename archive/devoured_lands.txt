Far to the north, where the lights of Seres dim, and the marvels of the east are unknown, lies a cold and sleepy land, set between two great and deep oceans. It is here that the north wind is born, and that the sun can shine or go unseen for many seasons. A wilderness of tall and ancient trees interrupted here and there by a green river or a tall mountain and on rare occasions, the bones of an old city, where pillars and gates groan and creak from age. No matter what lies there, it is surely covered in moss, and coated in the bitterness of glory past.
