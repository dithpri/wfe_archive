We are one, we are all.
Hello there! We are willing to take any country no matter the people, race, religion, ethnicity, ideology, or actions they have or do.
No matter the size, no matter the strength, we will be together. Always.
Judging by our name, you and we ourselves will expect a mix of nations. This is the reason why I named our Region that way.
We might not make an impact on the world, or make an impact to other regions or nations. But we still stand together.
Join us, we take all.
