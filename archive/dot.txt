No, &quot;Skibidi Toilet&quot; is not considered esoteric. It&#39;s a widely popular meme and internet phenomenon, primarily known for its catchy song and bizarre premise of human-headed toilets fighting beings with cameras, speakers, and TVs.

The series is characterized by its simple, almost childlike animation style and focus on a conflict between these two types of entities.
