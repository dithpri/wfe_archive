Our intentions are good. We don&amp;#39;t want the downfall of our allies or enemies. We want peace amoung the world and more importantly amount the region. If the region comes under fire, nations will be called to fight and will be expected to answer. You&amp;#39;ll not be forced to fight of course. However, those who do fight will be respected and recognized.
