Kentopia has been founded amidst a corrupt, power mongering and colonial world, a world In which some few states such as mine choose to reject, in favour of creating a proud and independent region, one where we shall not succumb to the dictatorship of the mighty, shall not carry or impose any predisposed disposition on governance to any member, and a region in which we shall fight to maintain the integrity of our fellow states.
