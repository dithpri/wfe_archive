The Legion of Doom&amp;#39;s headquarters was the Hall of Doom, a facility most often located in Slaughter Swamp. 
The Hall of Doom was mobile, lowered below or raised above the swamp water&amp;#39;s surface, and often flown through the air via rockets if needed, and was even able to fly through space. 
It could be remotely controlled and sometimes used to help the Legion escape. It also had laser defense weapons and at times was altered to time travel to the past or future. 
It resembled Darth Vader&amp;#39;s helmet.
