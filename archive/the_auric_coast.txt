The Auric Coast is a diverse and dynamic region located in a temperate-to-subtropical zone. While some areas, like the Republic of the Libertarian Free State of Aurelion, are heavily industrialized and environmentally degraded, much of the region remains fertile, green, and suitable for agriculture, forestry, and urban development. The Auric Coast features a mix of coastlines, forests, rivers, and highlands, supporting a wide range of human and ecological activity.
