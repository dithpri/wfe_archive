The East Wind is a region with a rich and complex history, it is the birthplace of hardbass and international socialism. Our men are acknowledged around the world for exporting car crash videos and superb knowledge of improvisation. We pave the way for technologies such as ICBMs and Trash Cannons.
From Tsars and revolutionaries to modern politics, from monarchies, socialists and the chaos of democracies, the East Wind accepts all nations, regardless of ideological views. We are formally a detachment from the region [region]Eastern Europe[/region].
