The [b][i]Underverse[/i][/b] is an extra-dimensional sanctuary for the human species. It is basically a tiny universe with its own isolated space-time-reality. It is hidden deep inside the subspace and armored with subquantum reality-layers. Due to its isolated space-time-reality it is almost impossible to reach the [b][i]Underverse[/b][/i].

The [i][b]Underverse[/i][/b] was  discovered by [i]mankind[/i] thousands of years ago. Since that time the [b][i]Underverse[/b][/i] is controled by [b][i][nation=noflag]the Necromongers-[/nation][/b][/i].
