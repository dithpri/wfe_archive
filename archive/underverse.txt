The [b][i]Underverse[/i][/b] is basically a tiny universe with its own isolated space-time-reality. It is hidden deep inside the subspace and armored with subquantum reality-layers. Due to its isolated space-time-reality it is almost impossible to reach the [b][i]Underverse[/b][/i].

The [i][b]Underverse[/i][/b] was  artificially created by [i]mankind[/i] thousands of years ago. Since that time the [i]human race[/i] is united in [b][i][nation=long]the Underverse[/nation][/i][/b].
