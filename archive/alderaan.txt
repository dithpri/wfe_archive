Alderaan is the latest conquest of the Irken Empire, and seriously, we could go stop that guy who keeps spray painting &amp;quot;Spock Lives&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Keep on Trekin&amp;#39;&amp;quot; on every flat, stationary surface, but the truth is we just can&amp;#39;t be bothered.

But seriously Aldaraan, you have to learn to fight your own battles.  Waaaah!  We were blown up!  Waaaah!  Billions died!  Waaah! The Empire is mean!  You don&amp;#39;t see the D&amp;#39;Bari whining do you?
