It&amp;#39;s the Free Atlantic Ocean, the great big Free Atlantic Ocean, this is where land-crafters apply their skills to forging habitable &amp;quot;Islands&amp;quot; on, or under the Atlantic.

&amp;quot;International Maritime laws apply&amp;quot;...

...BUT otherwise it&amp;#39;s just the great big Free Atlantic Ocean, it&amp;#39;s all up to your people to survive out there. This is NOT an &amp;quot;Alliance&amp;quot;, this is JUST the great big free Ocean, act like responsible leaders, and many of your people should survive, perhaps even prosper.

Good luck, and may the Universe be with you!
