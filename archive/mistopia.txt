[color=purple]Welcome to MIStopia, a region accepting any nations within MIS.[/color] 

The region of MIStopia is pretty small, with only 8 nations. It is bordered between tall mountains to the North, frozen mountains to the South, an open sea to the East and a bamboo forest to the West. The people of MIStopia are kindhearted towards new nations and tend to welcome them with hearty meals and long celebrations. MIStopia is ruled by a council currently made up of 4 members, [nation]Ryhnn[/nation], [nation]Uruk In Avalon[/nation], [nation]Triter[/nation], and [nation]Cavia Islands[/nation].
