[b]The Hong River, also known as the Red River[/b], is a river that flows from Yunnan in Southwest China through northern Vietnam. Downstream from Vi&amp;#7879;t Tr&igrave;, the river and its many distributaries spread out to form the Red River Delta. The Red River flows past the Vietnamese capital Hanoi before emptying into the Gulf of Tonkin.

The reddish-brown heavily silt-laden water gives the river its name. The delta is a major agricultural area of Vietnam with vast area devoted to rice. The land is protected by an elaborate network of dikes and levees.
