The small The Socialist Union of Free Communists is a region spanning across three continents containing multiple nations.

We praise the works of Marx, Engels, Trotsky, and Lenin. And try our hardest to live up to these ideals, but we accept all points of view, but only if political hostility is absolutely ZERO. We will support anyone in need of our help.

The main powerhouses are the North African Union, and The German Communist Union, the other nations trail closely behind. Monthly military parades are held, with every country contributing. Many have tried to fight us, and all have failed.
