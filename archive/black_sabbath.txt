[b][color=purple]Finished with my woman &#39;cause she couldn&#39;t help me with my mind
People think I am insane because I&#39;m frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I&#39;ll lose my mind if I don&#39;t find something to pacify
Can you help me, occupy my brain?

Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can&#39;t find
I can&#39;t see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it&#39;s too late[/color][/b]
