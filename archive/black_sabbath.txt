[b][color=blue]Ozzy was an icon of hard rock music, and one of the founders of heavy metal music through his work with Black Sabbath. He disliked being categorised as metal, stating that while his band &quot;plays heavy&quot;, other bands that are considered metal are &quot;really heavy&quot;. &quot;When you get pigeonholed with a certain [genre], it can be very difficult to do something a bit lighter or an acoustic track or whatever you want to do. Back in the day, it was always just rock music. It&#39;s still just rock music.&quot;
