[color=scarlet][u][i][b]Welcome to[/i] BLACK SABBATH[/b]! [/u][/color]
[color=purple]
Black Sabbath has survived many invasions.
[nation=short]Marilyn Manson Freaks[/nation] was a native of this region a while ago, but defenders did not listen to him, and stopped him from regaining his control  as delegate. This small action made Manson into the raider he is today, and showed him that you needn&#39;t rely on other people. Finally, Black Sabbath is freed on 6/4/17 by Manson and friends.

[i]Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgement, God is calling
On their knees the war pig&#39;s crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh lord yeah! [/color][/i]
