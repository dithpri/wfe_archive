[color=purple]Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgement, God is calling
On their knees the war pig&#39;s crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh lord yeah![/color]
