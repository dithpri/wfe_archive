[i]Deus Vult![/i][hr]Welcome to [b]Terrae Sanctae Christianitatis[/b], a region devoted to Christian-based Holy Empires and other related nations!

[B]Religion policy:[/B] Does your nation have to be Christian, or even related to religion? If we were to roleplay, it would quickly get stale having only Holy Empires on Holy Empires. We need at least [i]some[/i] non-religious nations: thus, we welcome all nations into this region. 

[B]Second nation policy:[/B] You may have [i]one[/i] second nation, if you reveal which nation it is. We recommend having one religious and one non-religious nation for the sake of diversity.

[B]Map policy:[/B] Telegram the founder to be added to the map. Don&#39;t ask for too much territory. Include any name changes, etc. that you want, or they will not be added.
