In Norse cosmology, Muspelheim (in old norse: M&uacute;spellsheimr), also called Muspell (in old norse: M&uacute;spell), is a realm of fire. The etymology of Muspelheim is uncertain, but may come from Mund-spilli, world-destroyers or wreck of the world. Muspelheim is described as a hot and glowing land of fire, home to the fire giants, and guarded by Surtr, with his flaming sword. It is featured in both the creation and destruction stories of Norse myth. According to the Prose Edda, a great time before the earth was made, Niflheim existed. Inside Niflheim was a well called Hvergelmir, from this well flowed numerous streams known as the &Eacute;liv&aacute;gar. Their names were Svol, Gunnthro, Form, Finbul, Thul, Slid and Hrid, Sylg and Ylg, Vid, Leipt and Gjoll.
