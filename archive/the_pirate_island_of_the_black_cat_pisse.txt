Welcome to the island of the black cat.

We are in the middle of the Indian Ocean, near the islands of hard rock and islands of green snakes, we are a lot of pirates, mercenaries against bandits, thieves, crooks, drunks

We are not invaders, we are pirates, pirates who love a good adventure, we accept all their money, and something more. We do not go for a walk

We spend the days drinking, playing cards at last come and stay calm just have good fights and everything is solved.

ISLE OF THE URINATED BLACK CAT

&quot;Think before you enter because your flag will be passed from here on, only pirate flags here&quot;
