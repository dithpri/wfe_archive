[b][u]-~The Lone Rangers~-[/u][/b]

[i]Welcome to The Lone Rangers, where we kick butt and chew tobacco. In other words, we fight raiders... by being raiders I guess. The rules for both the forums and IRC chat are located [url=http://the-lone-rangers.proboards.com/thread/6/rules-read]here[/url]. Yes, we&amp;#39;re still setting up, but we&amp;#39;ll soon be ready, so I ask that you be patient. Until then, please chill out in the IRC chat room below with our comrades.[/i]
