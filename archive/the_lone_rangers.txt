The first region I made...God the nostalgia. Never succeeded, of course. I became a laughing stock and I still haven&amp;#39;t shrugged it off. I am a failure. I can never do anything right. Nobody will ever truly respect me. Nobody will ever actually come to me like I know anything. I will never go down in NS history as anything. I screwed up. Don&amp;#39;t be like me.
