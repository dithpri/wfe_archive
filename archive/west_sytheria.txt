The Northwestern region of the continent of Wethernin, West Sytheria is a nation bound in a loose coalition - nations fight and debate and try to ruin each other, but at the same time, these conflicts strengthen the individual nations, allowing them to survive in the harsh political and wartime climates of Wethernin and the wider world.
