Run by the Nation of Blunker, and filled by it&amp;#39;s colonies. &amp;quot;While we won&amp;#39;t force them to we&amp;#39;d wish our colonies would listen to us,&amp;quot; says Blunker&amp;#39;s President. In fact Blunker exercises almost no control over their colonies at all. For a screwed up nation they&amp;#39;re actually kind of nice.
