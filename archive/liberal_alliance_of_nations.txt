Welcome to the [region]Liberal Alliance of Nations[/region]! Where we believe in freedom for all nations!

[u]Anyone[/u] is welcome to join. We welcome all new nations to stay and enjoy the liberal and democratic experience we offer. Hopefully as new nations join us, we will start the creation of our legislative body and introduction to delegate elections.
