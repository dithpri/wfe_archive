Founder of Balion Victory speech April,4, 176

We&amp;#39;ve just won the war against the confederate states of balion! (more like the confederate state of balion no one else joined) Anyways this victory will not be soon forgotten by either side who lived through the great Balionic civil war in which Brother fought brother and the nation was split by the winds of war. friendships were made, Alliances forged and Loyalties tested as both sides tried to find their way and see if there Region was in its last days or if their region would return from an age of blood and steel to one of gold and silver.
