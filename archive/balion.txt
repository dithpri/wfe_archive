We hold these truths to be self evident that.....You&amp;#39;ve gone mad with power   (that means you specifically)
we dont have much experience in raiding/defending so we try to keep the region isolationist  cause you cant destroy a region if you dont know of that region.
anyone who&amp;#39;s interested in raiding us anyways should invade the region next door instead.
