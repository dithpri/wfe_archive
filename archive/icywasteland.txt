The Icy Wasteland was built on the banks of a carefully crafted harbor and is truly a technological phenomenon. Its uniqueness is matched by the backdrop of monumental waterfalls which have helped shape the city to what it is today.
The trade resources these waterfalls brought were of great importance, but they were also influential when it came to architectural designs as the vast majority of buildings mimic the falling waters of those waterfalls, sometimes by having their own man-made waterfalls.
