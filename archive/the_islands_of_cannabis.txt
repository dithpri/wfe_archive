Imagine it, my dudes. Everywhere you look weed. Weed growing in fields, in the supermarkets, in the drugstores and even in you own mailbox. (Disclaimer, this is not supposed to be serious, I&#39;m just trying to have a little bit of fun in my depressing life.) because of all the marijuana being consumed, all countries in the area have become passive and de-militarized. If you want a laid back chill life while blowing weed smoke into a capybaras face, well this is the region you should join. For the gud kush we fight! For the gud kush we unite!
