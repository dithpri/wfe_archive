The Kalturan Expansion Zone, or KEZ, is a region where the Dominion of Kaltura has annexed land or other nations via military or diplomatic means, this land will be put into the process of colonization by Kaltura and then officially brought into Kalturan territory when the land has been fully colonized and any discrepancies have been removed. All nations within the region are required to change their currency to the Kalt (Kaltura&#39;s official currency) and are also required to change their policies to match Kaltura&#39;s standards.
