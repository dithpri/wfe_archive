[u][b]Welcome to The Whole World: the region for people who don&#39;t want to be part of a region![/b][/u]

Don&#39;t leave a message on the board please. IDK man it&#39;s just kinda rude IMO, the whole point of this is to not be bothered all the time. For the first two messages, you&#39;ll just be warned through telegrams, but for the third, you&#39;ll be kicked.

If you raid this your a jerk. Honestly. I mean, we just want to not get spammed with thousands of comments a day, or get banned without warning because you didn&#39;t endorse the person begging for endorsements, or whatever. Don&#39;t be rude please.

Endorse whoever if you want to I guess. 

The region is named this way because it sounds nice in issues.
