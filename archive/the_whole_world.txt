For people who don&#39;t want to be part of a region.

Endorse whoever if you want to I guess. Don&#39;t leave a message on the board or I&#39;ll ban you or something. IDK man it&#39;s just kinda rude IMO, the whole point of this is to not be bothered all the time. Same goes for advertisements for things.

If you raid this your a jerk. Honestly. I mean, we just want to not get spammed with thousands of comments a day, or get banned without warning because you didn&#39;t endorse the person begging for endorsements, or whatever. Don&#39;t be rude please.

The region is named this way because it sounds nice in issues.
