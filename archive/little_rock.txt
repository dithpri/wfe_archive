[b]Little Rock[/b] is the capital and the most populous city of the U.S. state of Arkansas. It is also the county seat of Pulaski County. It was incorporated on November 7, 1831, on the south bank of the Arkansas River close to the geographic center of the state. The city derives its name from a rock formation along the river, named &quot;le petit rocher&quot; by the French in the 1720s. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
