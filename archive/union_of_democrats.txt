Our valiant liberators have arrived here to overthrow the [i]long-past-their-resignation-date[/i] World Assembly Delegate and establish a new leader [i]chosen by the people![/i] 

Meanwhile, the holy lords of [i][b]D[/b]elegacy [b]U[/b]pdate [b]M[/b]anagement [b]B[/b]allparking[/i] have completely coffee&#39;d up their precious paperwork, resulting in a completely unpredictable time schedule that resulted in us beating the unjustful usurpers to the punch! One can&#39;t create freedom and equality without a bit of luck, after all.[/color][hr]
