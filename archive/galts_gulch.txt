[b]Galts Gulch[/b], mythical paradise of John Galt. 

In its heyday, Galts Gulch had up to 500 nations.  Somehow, our fallen comrades, [i]Tatara and Welchyland[/i], still hold the delegate records of two of the six Warzone Regions, [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=warzone_sandbox]Sandbox[/url] and [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=warzone_africa]Africa[/url].  And our old enemies, The URAP, are still around, which is frustrating as I&#39;d really hoped those aryan d*cks had died off by now.

[u]Anyway, come join Galts Gulch, we could use a few more nations: the land where hard work is king and we still use 1990s regional flags that try to imagine what GG would actually look like.[/u]
