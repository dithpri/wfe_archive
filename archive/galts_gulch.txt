[b]Galts Gulch, mythical paradise of John Galt.[/b]

In its heyday, Galts Gulch had up to 500 nations. Somehow, our fallen comrade, Tatara, still hold the delegate record of one of the six Warzone Regions, Sandbox. And our old enemies, The URAP, are still around, which is frustrating as I&#39;d really hoped those aryan d*cks had died off by now. [UPDATE: Holy crap the MT Army finally overthrew them! 11 years of undercover ops and The URAP was finally destroyed. Woo!]

[u]Anyway, come join Galts Gulch, we could use a few more nations: the land where hard work is king and we still use 1990s regional flags that try to imagine what GG would actually look like.[/u]
