A rather minuscule corner of NationStates reality, and by extension a very, very, [b]VERY[/b] inconsequential part of the multiverse as a whole. For now is composed of a two nations, [nation]The Infant Island[/nation], the Founder, and [nation]Metaversal Asylum[/nation], a newly formed puppet nation. There may probably be more puppets of The Infant Island added in the near future. If by an unlikely but not negligible chance you want to contribute something to this region, feel free to let me, Mothra of [nation]The Infant Island[/nation], know by lodging a message on the Message Board. Any visitors are welcome and may enjoy their stay as they please.


Unless they are agents from a raider region. They can bug off (haha pun related to the leader of [nation]The Infant Island[/nation]).


Embassy requests will be accepted.
