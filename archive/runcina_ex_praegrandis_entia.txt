A rather minuscule corner of NationStates reality. For now, it is composed of the following nations:

-[nation]The Infant Island[/nation], the founding nation. A massive local economic hyperpower with a deep cultural heritage and an enigmatic leader.
-[nation]Metaversal Asylum[/nation], a melting pot of races who fled from tyranny from across the multiverse. Overseen by an equally diverse and mysterious Council, which includes lego characters, a spherical physical manifestation of the Republic of Poland, and a shark idol.
-[nation]Infant Island[/nation], a relatively young and liberal puppet/colony. It&#39;s here because of funny activities by the Founder involving parallel worlds.
-[nation]Bean[/nation], Bean, Bean, Bean, Bean, Bean.
