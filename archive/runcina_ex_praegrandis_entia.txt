A rather minuscule corner of NationStates reality. For now, it is composed of the following nations:

-[nation]The Infant Island[/nation], a massive economic hyperpower with an enigmatic history and leader.
-[nation]Metaversal Asylum[/nation], a melting pot of races who fled from tyranny from across the multiverse. Overseen by an equally diverse Council, which includes lego characters, a spherical physical manifestation of the Republic of Poland, a Shinto shrine-maiden turned a goddess, and a shark idol.
-[nation]Watermelons of America[/nation], a fruit-themed puppet ruled by a fruit-themed moe cyborg.
-[nation]Infant Island[/nation], a colony of the founder, achieved by crossing dimensions.
-[nation]Bean[/nation], composed of beans.
