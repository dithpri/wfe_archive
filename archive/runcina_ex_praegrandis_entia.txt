A rather minuscule corner of NationStates reality. For now, it is composed of the following nations:

-[nation]The Infant Island[/nation], a massive economic hyperpower with an enigmatic history and leader.
-[nation]Metaversal Asylum[/nation], a melting pot of races who fled from tyranny from across the multiverse. Overseen by an equally diverse Council, which includes lego characters, a spherical physical manifestation of the Republic of Poland, and a shark idol.
-[nation]Watermelons of America[/nation], a newly reclaimed fruit-themed puppet.
-[nation]Infant Island[/nation], a colony with extensive civil rights. It&#39;s here because of funny activities by the Founder involving parallel worlds.
-[nation]Bean[/nation], composed of beans.
-[nation]SupremeDrip[/nation], a fledging nation of saiyans.
