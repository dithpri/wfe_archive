Through blood and iron, the Karevieans rose from their six states with over 180,000 dead. They began to rebuild after the revolution, and started an alliance.
The Republic of Hepvonia&#39;s beginning is currently classified by their government, but joined the alliance.

They began to march through hell, through mud, and through everything you can think of. Three nations joined them.
The Federated States of Siconya, the nation Kareviea revolted against, repaired relations and joined.
The Anarchic state of Istanbahd joined in, and then Reviglia.

They continue to fight, and will never stop.
