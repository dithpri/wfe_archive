The World Order, or simply the Order, founded on April 25th, 2020, is a specific region with few nations. It&#39;s main purpose is to establish a secure and peaceful alliance between the sovereign states inside the Order, and help build economies based off each other&#39;s natural resources and largest industries. It&#39;s main goal is to prevent mass globalization, using regionization to combat it. 

The Order will secure each other in wars, and will support other members when necessary.
