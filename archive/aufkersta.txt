Aufkersta is a region dedicated on helping too develop startup nations. I myself, Fannir, am a relatively new nation. But after my old region lost its leader and WA Delagate, I seeked out to make a new region to help new nations. if your looking to grow with tips, go to the board. if you are planning on staying for longer than until you hit around 250,000 population, you are very welcome to do so. Thank you for your time, and consider joining, even if your a large nation!
