[b]Welcome to United Erin.[/b]

[color=green]United Erin[/color] was founded on the [b]29th of May, 2016[/b] and aims to bring nations together through peaceful means. 
We [b]accept all nations[/b] regardless of ideologies or differences of opinion. 

We [b]welcome any region[/b] that wishes to establish formal ties through the opening of embassies. We currently have [b]30[/b] completed embassies and [b]1[/b] embassies under construction
[b]We welcome all nations[/b] of the thirty regions that have embassies with us to engage in open discussion through our open message board, polls etc.

Currently the region is in a &#39;limbo&#39; - the founder appears to have moved on, as have other members. If you have any ideas how to increase activity in this region please share and bring as many nations as you can.
