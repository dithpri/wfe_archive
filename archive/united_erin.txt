Welcome to United Erin.
The United Erin founded on the 29th of May, 2016 and aims to bring nations together through peaceful means. 
We accept all countries for who they are from communists, fascists, liberals etc.
If you don&#39;t like a nation&#39;s political positions the best way to change or understand their positions is by communication, not by force. This is way we see it is important all members have their own viewpoint on issues.
