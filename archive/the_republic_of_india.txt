India is the motherland of our race, and Sanskrit the mother of Europe&amp;#39;s languages: she is the mother of our philosophy; mother, through the Arabs, of much of our mathematics; mother, through the Buddha, of the ideals embodied in Christianity; mother, through the village community, of self-government and democracy. Mother India is in many ways the mother of us all.
