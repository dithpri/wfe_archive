Funen is a unaligned non-political region. On 2 April 2016, the ownership of Funen returned to the player behind the original founder (Charlotte Ryberg) in the aftermath of the Predator script controversy. Apart from a short-lived era as a raider region in 2015, the region has always been laid-back.
