Welcome to the Coalition of Galactic Civilizations, a relaxed FT role playing Region where citizens are not only a part of the community but help to create and improve it. Here every opinion, question suggestion and idea is valid and should be given. I will do my utmost best to make sure everyone enjoys their time here and that you all have fun and are treated fairly and justly in all matters regardless of the situation. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done and a lot that is still missing but I hope to get a lot done soon and to make a lot of progress
