The Tides of Europe has shifted once more as the Armies of the Id&eacute;aliste-Axe stand over a burnt continent. Brought to the brink by Ideological and Ethnic Tensions, the continent erupted in war once more, now after 8 Years of bloody conflict, the French, Ukrainians, Hungarians and Czechs stand above the Pan-Europa Accords. But there is still chaos among the world. Despite being battered from years of suffering, the resistances of the Central Balkans and West Germany fight on, with the Italians and Bulgarians in the South playing their own dangerous game with what&#39;s left of the Id&eacute;aliste-Axe
