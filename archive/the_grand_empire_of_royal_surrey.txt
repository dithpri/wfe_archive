[color=green][b]Long live the utterly magnificent and grand Surrey empire[/color][/b]


[color=purple]While we [b]will not[/b] denounce the fact that we are bias towards the right side of politics, you are [b]welcome[/b] to join no matter what your political views may be, as long as they don&amp;#39;t offend anyone or are overly extreme.

Please join the [b]World Assembly[/b] and endorse the founder, [nation=short]The Royal Land of Surrey[/nation] and enjoy your time chatting away with the truly grand citizens of this wonderful (and hopefully one day very successful) empire.

I implore you to upload the histories, policies and geographies of your various countries/colonies etc. and keep the spirit of the game alive.[/color]
