All six islands surrounding the Kingdom of Gadalland and Aspern are a part of the Sertian Union, a single economic market with extensive free movement laws. All countries must abide by the Sertian Domex (c. 1221) whilst they are members of the SU in order to maintain a requisite level of human rights.
