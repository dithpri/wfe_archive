The region of Aloreh is dominated by dense thick pine forests that are usually covered in a soft blanket of snow. It is surrounded by mountain ranges and its coasts are brimming with oil and sea life. The soil in the more inland locations has proven fertile, and the mountain ranges are teeming with minerals and precious metals. The central continent of Imperium is surrounded by multiple islands, and new lands continue to be discovered. Its local inhabitants must ward off extreme colds, dry weather, and each other.
