A region founded by Jewish Norwegian explorers in the 1400s south of modern day Argentina, close to the South Pole. The region has a climate similar to that of Norway with very defined seasons and a harsh winter, when Aurora Australis (or Southern Lights) are visible. Some of the animals and vegetarian of the region were brought over the centuries in navigations!
