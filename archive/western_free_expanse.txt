In this region your nation can be of any political persuasion you want. Along as you don&#39;t want to bend other unwilling nations to your whims, you can do whatever you want. You will, for the vast majority of the time, be left alone. Unless this region is invaded by foreign force, or you find it within your heart to be generous, you will not have to volunteer any resources to a common goal. This is a work in progress and could greatly benefit your participation to make it better. No rules or laws are yet set in stone other than one tenet: You must follow the NAP and stay out the personal/financial affairs of other nations (unless invited to do so). -March 15 2020
