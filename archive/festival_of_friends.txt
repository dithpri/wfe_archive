This region has been set up for the Festival RP - a time travel extravaganza! We&#39;ll be running short scenarios throughout this weekend.

Post a character introduction in the RMB to sign up! Tell us all about the time traveller that will be representing your nation and making the ultimate decision - to save the timeline, or change it?
