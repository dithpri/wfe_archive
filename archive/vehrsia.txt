Vehrsia is a continent located in the north central tritosphere of the planet K-G4 - the planet itself is known by numerous names locally, including Stauria, Nyrhelm, Lapsus Terra, and others. 
Vehrsia is bordered to the north by the Arctic, to the east by the Arcadian Ocean, to the south by the Cobalt Sea and the Tayneer Passage, and to the west by the Strident Ocean. 

It is home to the Coalition of the Eastern Strident (CTES), which consists of [nation]Ontarra[/nation], [nation]Vankaar[/nation], [nation]Novadiem[/nation], and [nation]Kaldrfjall[/nation] locally, and other nations worldwide.  

Overall, this region is for myself and my friends, however requests to join can be directed at [nation=long]Ontarra[/nation] if desired, and will be considered on a case by case basis after a thorough review.
