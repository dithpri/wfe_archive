I have two nations, both created for my fictional character to have a home &quot;country&quot; (aka: Heaven and Hell for the angels and demons) a political system, and to develop a social structure. I will NOT be accepting any interactions between this region and others, I opt out of every interaction as long as I can. If you&#39;d like to read a little bit about the two nations (at least what I have on my private database) I have offsite links. Some information on said links will have come from here since I use this to help me flesh out such topics because I am not smart.

[color=#5bc0de]Now, I&#39;d be happy to just be left to my own devices. See you.[/color]
