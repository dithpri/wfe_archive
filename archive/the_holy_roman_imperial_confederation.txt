You will see Sarkjintian vassal states here as well as actual member states. It is important to note that only [i]THESE[/i] countries can vote in elections for the king of the UKSU, and only [i]MEMBER STATES[/i] can vote for the WA delegate. I will be sending the relevant telegrams at the appropriate times. Check back monthly.

I&#39;m also working on a Discord server for the region so look out for that soon!
