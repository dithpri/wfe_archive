this is the seven seas alliance here in this alliance we stand by this philosophy &quot;we shall neither conquer nor allow ourselfs to be conquered... that is the way of the seven seas alliance&quot; we reserve the right of all kingdoms to rule themselves as they see fit but to force your rule upon another kingdom is intolerable if you come at us trying to force your rule upon us weither you are from this earth or not we will strike back at you with all the force we have.
