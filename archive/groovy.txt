Welcome to Groovy, fittingly the grooviest region in all of NationStates! Groovy was founded on 6 August 2018 by [nation]60s music[/nation] and is a safe haven for anything and everything having to do with 1960s and early 1970s music and popular culture (although posting stuff from the 1980s is fine too, as a lot of the best music comes from then too). It&#39;s time to dig out your bell bottoms and your tie-dye T-shirts, take those psychedelic records off the shelf, and chill out, man!

This region was raided on 5 January 2020 and 13 January 2020.
