The Imperial Oyster Union has explored many stars in several different galaxies. When a terrestrial world is discovered, providing that they are not too close to a star (you can always add more layers-but you can only take so many off), terraforming of the atmosphere starts.

Sometimes, not many people move in and there is not much industry. Those colonies are practically forgotten about when no crime is going on. Link to my sci-fi forum is soon to come...
