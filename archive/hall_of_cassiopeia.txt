[color=#00008B]On the edge of the universe there lies a great hall, with countless doors leading to a variety of worlds. Through the hall, these worlds may communicate with each other, trade goods, and take part in building something greater. All who find this place are welcome to claim a door, to settle peacefully and to make a name for themselves.
