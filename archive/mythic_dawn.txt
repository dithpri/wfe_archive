Welcome, traveler. The [u]Order of the Mythic Dawn[/u] is devoted to Mehrunes Dagon: the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Change, Revolution, Energy, and Ambition.[/b]

We follow the word of Dagon as written in the Mysterium Xarxes, and are led by our Master, who speaks for him.

[b][color=E0AE08][i]&quot;When I will walk the earth again, the Faithful among you shall receive your reward: to be set above all other mortals forever. As for the rest: the weak shall be winnowed: the timid shall be cast down: the mighty shall tremble at my feet and pray for pardon.&quot;[/i][/color][/b]
