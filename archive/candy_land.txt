[b]Candy Land[/b] was once the respected temporary homeland of the original inhabitants of [region]Whitereach[/region] after the Great Purge. When Whitereach was raided and refounded by a non-Whitereachian, Candy Land became the homeland of the inhabitants of Whitereach. Candy Land has been through a lot, from being the temporary capital of the Whitereach Empire, to being a puppet storage, to being a colony of [region]Romana[/region]. Once Candy Land was reclaimed, it became a puppet storage region that houses the &amp;quot;honorable mention puppets&amp;quot; made by Whitereach.

Please note that our homeland is [region]Whitereach[/region], our empire is [region]The Whitereach Empire[/region], and [region]Blackreach[/region] is our other puppet storage region.
