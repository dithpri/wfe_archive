Welcome to [b]Candy Land[/b]!

This region was once called home by many, but it was seemingly abandoned when all the inhabitants moved to [region]Nilbog[/region]. However, they did not abandon their former home, and they came back to it. Currently, Nilbog is in possession of Candy Land.

The region is unstable at the moment. Pseudo-defenders and raiders are attempting to cease the WA delegate position. They are trying to overthrow and oust the rightful government. These insurrectionists and revolutionaries must be put down. Reactionaries and loyalists to [region]Nilbog[/region] are ordered to endorse [nation]the spinny chair in my room[/nation]. This will continue Nilbog&amp;#39;s ownership of the region.

Forward, reactionaries and loyalists! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRLdhFVzqt4
