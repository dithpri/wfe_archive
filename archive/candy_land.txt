Welcome to [b]Candy Land[/b]!

This region was once called home by many, but it was seemingly abandoned when all the inhabitants moved to [region]Nilbog[/region]. However, they did not abandon their former home, and they came back to it. Later, [region]Nilbog[/region]&amp;#39;s influence waned and last surviving native WA member [nation]Manifold Jesus[/nation] with help from [nation]Shojani[/nation] of the region [region]Shojan[/region] took control to ensure the prosperity of Candy Land and the accuracy of its WFE. Please endorse [nation]Manifold Jesus[/nation].

All Hail the King [nation]Manifold Jesus[/nation]!
Long live [nation]Shojani[/nation]!
