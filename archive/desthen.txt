Desthen is a new region that welcomes all with open arms and a spot in administration. Anyone who joins will be given a spot as a minister until there are enough people (10 nations) to vote in elections, which are held every month. Alternate accounts are allowed but you are only allowed 1 account to vote in elections. When 3 nations join, a regional Discord server will be made.
