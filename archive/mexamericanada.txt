The region of MexAmeriCanada is the future design of the United States. Composed of multiple nations, the region is a parody of a true conglomeration of nations since none of them really care to cooperate with one another. In fact, the region cares little for the rest of world affairs since global resolutions are &amp;quot;all-fixed&amp;quot; anyway. Envisioned by the visionary Mr. Shea, the region holds a festival every year for its founding by rounding up and killing an unsuspecting hobo in his honor.
