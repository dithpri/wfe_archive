Welcome to the Gallic Entente, traveler,

This region is RP driven, and both large RP&#39;s and smaller RPs will be happening, sometimes with both at the same time.

[i]Now some context for RP[/i]
-The equipment used by soldiers during the conflict will be Cold War equipment to modern equipment, that means things plausible in our own world.

-Nations are [u]recommended [/u] to be of Latin origin, but this does not mean you must be.


Nations are recommended to endorse both nations in the Co-Imperium these being [nation]Vlamms Statt[/nation] and our WA representative, [nation]Alpes a Septentrionali Imperium[/nation]


For any members of the Entente, or ambassadors who wish, here is our discord.
