Now working with the so called &quot;Tyrants&quot; that conquered us we are next to unstoppable. Maybe despite our ideological differences we can all get along. It is not like we should all be separated by beliefs, Wether Rebuildist, Unificationist, Capitalist, Communist or Annaist we can all get along. Our race, ideology, language, etc. should not split us all a part. Think of what we can do together!
