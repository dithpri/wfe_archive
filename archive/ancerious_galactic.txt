[b]Group Biography[/b][u][/u]

Ancerious is a Sci-Fi RP group dedicated to space-based and character-based RP and home to a constructive and varied community. We have a wide array of players, from nations all around the world, all generating their own original content and establishing their own story lines. The plot is 7 years old and is constantly progressing due to players&#39; own actions while maintaining independence from their individual source canons.

We are a predominantly Discord based RP group that also uses Deviant Art as a hosting site. Our group promotes original works and encourages art and writing improvement in our players. If you wish to join please contact the region founder.
