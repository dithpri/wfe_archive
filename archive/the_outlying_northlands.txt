[u][b][i]THE OUTLYING NORTHLANDS[/i][/b][/u]

A region ravaged by war, corruption, and backstabbing, the Northlands are a hostile land filled with a hostile people. A committee was formed after a few brutal civil wars with the intention of drafting laws and regulating the superpowers of the region, although rumors fly about Universe Core&#39;s involvement. Vastria, in the meanwhile, has taken up the flag as the main opposition to the underhanded tactics of the Gladar. Secrets abound and the northern winds of change blow hard.
