A land with a history of both freedom and oppression, Magnolia has seen some of the bloodiest wars and the most beautiful art in the world. Barren wastelands, and green lush jungles, this region has it all.

With new nations rising from the ashes of the old world, only time will tell whether or not Magnolia will become a pillar of freedom and peace, or of war and oppression.
