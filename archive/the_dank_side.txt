Idiots, ghandi, weaboos, the Slavic people. Long ago, the stupid nations lived in harmony. But that all changed, when the indian nation attacked. Only the slavs, master of all vodka, could stop them. But when the world needed them most, they vanished. A hundred years passed, and my waifu and I discovered the new strelok, a bandit named nimble. And although his stalking skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he begins to save anyone. But I believe that nimble can save the world.
