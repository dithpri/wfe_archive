&amp;#8206;Welcome to the Realm of Westeros, a land of power, intrigue, and ancient rivalries. From the icy winds of the North to the sun-drenched shores of Dorne, Westeros is a place where noble houses vie for control of the Iron Throne, and the fate of kingdoms rests in the hands of a few. Here, honor and betrayal walk hand in hand, and the politics of the realm can be as deadly as any battle.
