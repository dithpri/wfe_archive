[B]Welcome to the Baltic States, a region where the people from the trio of nations can feel at home.[/B]
[i]
The Baltic States consist of 3 countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Their capitals are Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius respectively. Latvians and Lithuanians belong to the Baltic group of people, while Estonians are a Finnic people. Although their history is different, they share a similar fate of being occupied by foreign powers in the later half of the 20th century. Nowadays, the countries work closely together to promote prosperity and safety from threats.
