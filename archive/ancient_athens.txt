Hello [b]Traveler[/b], who has come from faraway lands! I would like to personally welcome you to our region, [region]Ancient Athens[/region]. Come by, and stay awhile, and leave whenever you&#39;d like. We appreciate and value all political and religious views, and do not condone harassing others for what they believe in. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the founder, [nation=short]Flawless Nation Name[/nation]!

[color=blue][b] Apparently, it&#39;s Autism awareness month, so we would like to support whatever it is [region]The West Pacific[/region] is doing, because it seems highly inspirational.[/b][/color] [/spoiler]


[i][color=gray]Together, we are strong, separate, we are weak.
