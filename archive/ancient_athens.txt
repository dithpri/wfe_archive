[b][color=blue]Hello Traveler[/color][/b], [i]who has come from faraway lands![/i] I would like to personally welcome you to our region, [region]Ancient Athens[/region]. Come by, stay awhile, and give us a chance! We are democratic and we appreciate and value all political and religious views, so we do not condone harassing others for what they believe in. If you have any questions, feel free to ask the founder, [nation=short]Flawless Nation Name[/nation], or Fluffiest Chief Adviser, [nation=short]Carencroft[/nation]!
