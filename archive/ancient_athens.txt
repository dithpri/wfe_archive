Ancient Athens was a flourishing city-state. It created democracy, contributed to art and theatre dramatically and it&amp;#39;s laws were compiled into one of the first-ever constitutions. 
This new region is special. 

Our legislative assembly is the Ecclesia (Assembly), which all members are invited to attend when it sits.
There is also a Council of Elders appointed by the founder to ensure a check on motions passed by the founder.
