     The Union of Ametterran Capitalist States is a union which acts to ensure a healthy world and a safe environment for fiscal and social conservatism to flourish. This union supports free markets and personal responsibility. Each individual works in this society with the incentive of building a successful career and life; therefore, principles such as socialism, communism, and fascism have no place here. Each and every state in the Union of Ametterran Capitalist States is a territory of the Christian Republic of Ametterra, required to abide by it&#39;s laws.
