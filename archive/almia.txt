The region of Almia was once home to many natives Almians, however due to immense amount of foreign colonization and oppression, this has led many of the natives to be taken away from their lands to be used as slaves while others had integrated themselves into the colonial rule. Many nations existing in Almia were once subjects of major colonial powers. Due to revolution or simply mismanagement of funds, many of the subjects of these powers have gained their independence and have established their own sovereign nations.
