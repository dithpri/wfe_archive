In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries &#150; both left- and right-wing), as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country&#39;s defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles.  Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.
