Welcome to BACIN III. Over the years our predecessors tried to create a Region which would function properly as a democracy. This, the third installment of their labors, Is the best so far. The Government is run co-equally by the President and WA Delegate, is organized and spread over almost all the nations. We are a accepting Region however we encourage the principles of Capitalism, Conservatism, and Christianity. Our National Religion is Christianity, and our national Animal is the Striped Cucumber Beetle. The WA delegate is appointed by the WA members of the region, however the President is elected in a poll after being a president for 2 weeks.
