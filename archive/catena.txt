Welcome to [b]Catena[/b] - where lands are united by the links they forge in the chain of history. We are a region that uses an extensive regional history and backstory as the fuel for well-thought-out, realistic and player-driven roleplay. We are an open region that welcomes anyone who shares that goal.

[b]Rules of the road:[/b] All Catena residents are [b]strongly urged[/b] to register on our offsite forum (using their NS nation name) in order to participate in roleplay and regional governance. All WA members are also [b]required[/b] to endorse the Delegate.
