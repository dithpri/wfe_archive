Welcome to [b]Catena[/b] - where lands are united by the links they forge in the chain of history. We use an extensive regional history and backstory as the fuel for well-thought-out, realistic and player-driven roleplay. We are an open region that welcomes anyone who shares the desire to build such a community.

[b][color=red]Please note:[/color][/b] Most regional activity takes place on our offsite forum linked below. Catena residents are [b][color=red]very strongly urged[/color][/b] to register and participate on the offsite forum, in order to be involved in both roleplaying and regional governance.
