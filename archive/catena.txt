Welcome to [b][color=blue]Catena[/color][/b] - where lands are united by the links they forge in the chain of history. We use an extensive regional history and backstory as the fuel for well-thought-out, realistic, player-driven roleplay.

Most activity takes place on our [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/catena/index/][u][b][color=blue]offsite forum[/color][/b][/u][/url]. Catena residents are [b][color=red]strongly urged[/color][/b] to register and participate on the forum, in order to be involved in roleplaying and regional governance.

[b][color=blue]What&amp;#39;s going on in Catena?[/color][/b] Current roleplay action includes the wrap-up of the Santosan War, the &amp;quot;cold war&amp;quot; between Valadia and the Commonwealth, a movement towards regional trade led by Alohria, civil war in Pericion, and the queen of Algidea seeking a husband. There&amp;#39;s plenty to jump into!
