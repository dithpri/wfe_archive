This region was sniped after a [b][nation]Alptin Republic[/nation][/b] sent a telegram to [b]region:south_pasific, region:the_south_pacific[/b] on March 26, 2021, with the following text:

[quote=alptin republic;0]Want a good nation want a amazing rights want freedom Then this is the best Republic For You! It is a powerhouse Capitalist Nation Join Us as we keep thriving with freedom![/quote]

At the time, the region &quot;South Pasific&quot; did not exist.

The telegram was later deleted by moderators, possibly due to the fact that it was not marked as recruitment or that it was spammy.

Unfortunately, this region ceased to exist for a period of two days before being refounded by the creator on February 1, 2022.
