The Archipeligo of Greecia was a vast region of islands that stand strong off the coast of a large mountainous land mass. Expeditions into this land mass began and are currently being executed by fleers of the war torn archipelago. The state of Eudaimoniia was the first to call this new and unforgiving landscape home in liue of remaining in the war torn and decimated region of Greecia, but do not let that deter you, for there is plenty of land, unclaimed in this brave new world, and it is for the good of all that it must be shared. Come to new Greecia.
