[color=red]Formerly a fascist colony region, this region is now, as of 9th June 2012, managed by [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region]&#39;s Woodrow Wilson Institute for Regional Self-Determination and Anti-Imperialism, in the name of [/color][color=red]ANTI[/color][color=black]FA![/color]

[color=blue]Protected in memory of the [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] concept, whilst also highlighting the failure of then Nazi [nation]Captain Woodhouse[/nation]. His attempt to infiltrate the [region]Antifa[/region] network failed and over 50 regions were handed over to [region]The MT Army[/region].[/color]
