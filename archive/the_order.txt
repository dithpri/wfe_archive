&amp;quot;The Order&amp;quot; (aka Br&uuml;der Schweigen, &amp;quot;Brothers Keep Silent&amp;quot;) was an American neo-Nazi terrorist group. Its most infamous act was the murder of talkshow radio host Alan Berg (he was Jewish). Its members are considered martyrs among Nazis. One member, David Lane, wrote the notorious &amp;quot;14 words&amp;quot; that can be found everywhere in the Nazi movement today.
