&amp;quot;Marked in blood foulest in stench, coarsest in touch and most acrid in taste, we live.
We march o&amp;#39;er corpses wrestled of dreams, aspirations, and hopes.

What we are, what we believe, what we seek, and what we desire is not our aim.
It is what we leave behind, in this wake, this chaos.

This is the treasure! The treasure of our efforts! And most, natural, we wage war against stagnancy.
That &amp;#39;ere we build a dominion of equal suffering to allow abreast our aim.

Blessed be our lust, unquenchable, inconquerable, and inevitable,
to be as every stone set into the priory.&amp;quot;

Ode of Ermeriel, 17:22
