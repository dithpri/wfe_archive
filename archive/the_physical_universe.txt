We are a moderately new region to the game with values of democracy and integrity. 

We have a civil service to help make the region run smoothly, a directly elected president and Vice President, a regional central cabinet appointed by the president and Vice President who add more diversity and voices to the executive branch, a directly elected parliament who create and remove laws and a complex court system who fairly make sure no member who breaks the law goes unpunished and that justice is always served.
