Welcome to South Eastern Europe, where we make sacrifices to the Dying Sun, prepare rituals for the Living Moon, and pledge allegiance to our Master, the Pr&aelig;ceptor.

We also throw parties sometimes.

Here in our supreme region, we bow down to our Master, the vague yet menacing Pr&aelig;ceptor, who takes the living and breathing form of the Grand Duchy of Schwarzlande, who orders us to honor our lives in memory of the Dying Sun and in monument to the Living Moon.

We look forward to seeing you in South Eastern Europe.
