Welcome to South Eastern Europe, where our vampires try to find alternative beverage options (don&#39;t worry, they won&#39;t bite you if you don&#39;t bite them). Of course, you will only become an [i]important[/i] South Eastern European if your flag gets changed to green, white, and black vertical stripes, with a symbol in the white tab, but that&#39;s just the Pr&aelig;ceptor&#39;s decision.

The Pr&aelig;ceptor is the all-knowing entity who provided us with the First Vampires. And -- TERRIFIC NEWS! The Pr&aelig;ceptor will come to us in a solid form when [nation]Schwarzlande[/nation] reaches 750 citizens! Hooray!

Okay, wrap it up.
