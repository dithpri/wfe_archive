There are good and bad in every religion and I know from all I have learnt that Islam only teaches peace and love.  

All of you who are interested in the peaceful teachings of Islam are welcome. Also, those of you who are frustrated with the dogmatic beliefs of the [region]United Empire of Islam[/region] are also welcome. The UEI is known to discriminate and exclude those nations who hold different views from the region. It has also been purging its members, particularly newcomers without offering a proper explanation; revealing the tyranny of the region. 

The only requirement for membership is to respect the teachings of Islam and a commitment to stopping extremist regions such as [region]United Empire of Islam[/region]. This region is welcome to all faiths and ideologies.
