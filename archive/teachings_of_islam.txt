Former Islamic-fundamentalist region created to spread lies. Refounded in the name of truth.

[b]If Islam is a &amp;quot;religion of peace&amp;quot; like a billion unfortunate people have been brainwashed
into believing, then why, on the flag of Saudi Arabia, the nation central to the Muslim
world, right under where it says &amp;quot;There is No God but God,&amp;quot; [u]why is there a great big [i]sword[/u]?[/i]

Remember: &amp;quot;Islam&amp;quot; is not a race, it&amp;#39;s a philosophy that people choose, and to criticize
a philosophy isn&amp;#39;t racist. Indeed, any philosophy that can&amp;#39;t stand up to criticism
(and indeed orders the death of those who criticize it) should NOT be followed.
