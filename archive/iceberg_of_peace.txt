The world is full with hate and lack of satisfaction, we need a place to rest, this region is the place. This region promotes peace and spirituality, therefore the region was created to remind that anyone can find peace and joy in life.
Nations here simply embrace those two, all while functioning as nations.

&quot;This one moment, now, is the only thing you can never escape from. The one constant factor in your life. No matter what happens. No matter how much your life changes. One thing is certain. Its always now. Since there is no escape from the now, why not welcome it, become friendly with it&quot;.
