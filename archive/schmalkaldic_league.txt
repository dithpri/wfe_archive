The Schmalkaldic League was a defensive alliance during the early 21st century. Although originally started for memey motives soon after the start of the Great Meme War, its members eventually intended for the League to conquer all the liberal nations and replace them with Memesters. While it was not the first alliance of its kind, unlike previous formations, such as the League of Memes, the Schmalkaldic League had a substantial military to defend its keks. It received its name from the town of Schmalkalden, which is located in the present-day Kekeoslovokia.
