[b][region]Fort Proudhon[/region], a region formerly used to attack leftists and affiliated with the imperialist capitalists of [region]REATO[/region], has been refounded by the combined forces of the [region]Korean Peoples Army[/region] and [region]The Red Fleet[/region] to prevent further defamation of Proudhon and anarchist history. 

Capitalist &quot;anarchists&quot; and those who work with them spit on Proudhon&#39;s legacy and the tens of thousands of anarchists who have died in the struggle against capitalism.[/b]
