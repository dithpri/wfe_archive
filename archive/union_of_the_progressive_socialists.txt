[b][u]Welcome to the Union of Progressive Socialists (UPS)[/u][/b]


[I][color=red]&quot;individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another. Furthermore, everything that people produce is in some sense a social product, and everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it. Society as a whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members&quot;[/I][/color]

[b][color=blue]Please have a read of the [I]Guidebook to the UPS[/I] for advice and information now that you have joined the Region. [/color]

[u]Please endorse [nation=long]Scotland II[/nation] to be our World Assembly Delegate [/u][/b]
