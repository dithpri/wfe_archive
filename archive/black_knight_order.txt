Efficiency is key not being efficient means being useless and annoying.
to be a villain usually means to be evil to be evil or to think that you&#39;re evil is meaning that you&#39;re letting others judge you.
It isn&#39;t villainy if you&#39;re right
either maintain order or be useless
anyway this is mainly a chill region do whatever you want except for cussing and that&#39;s really all I don&#39;t care
