[b]Welcome to SECURS![/b]
The Security and Economical Union for Reactionary States is, as the name itself implies, a sort of international organization, more than a true, geographical located region.
Our main goal is to provide an interesting place to play within, with plans for the creation of many different organizations and also a Court of Justice.
All kinds of Reactionary-inspired States are welcome to apply, no matter if they&amp;#39;re officially Republics, Kingdoms or others (Reaction is inside!)
Please abstain if you&amp;#39;re a trivial democracy, and particularly if your State is Communist/Nazi or somewhat Totalitarian inspired.
