The Security and Economical Union of Royalist States wants to be a new home for all governments which inspire their actions and policies to the ideals of the enlightened monarchy (both constitutional or absolute).
In our Assembly, and in the other bodies which compose our organization, royalist-inspired States can finally find a friendly place where to discuss and prosper.
Our strong commitment is to strenghten peaceful relations between royalist states, and to enhance International Law, collaborating in the World Assembly.
All kinds of government (Republics, Monarchies, etc...) are welcome.
