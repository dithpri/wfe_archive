Alternis Mundi means Alternate World in Latin.

This region is dedicated to realistic nation roleplaying. You take control of a nation, and try to navigate your way through modern politics. If that sounds interesting to you, then join this region! 

Rules: 
1. No swearing. 
2. No heated arguments in the RMB. If you have an argument, then telegram each other about it. 
3. Be at least semi-realistic. 
4. Be at least semi-active and try to contribute to the community.
5. I can add new rules whenever I see fit, since I am the founder of this region.
