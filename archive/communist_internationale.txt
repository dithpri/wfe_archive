This region has been closed because communism has proven to be detrimental to the very objectives it seeks to achieve. While capitalism is no doubt a system where the rich ride on the backs of the poor, communism is a system where the the lazy and dim-witted ride on the backs of the hardworking and imaginative. The best cure for the evils and excesses of capitalism isn&#39;t communism, it&#39;s strong labor unions and legislation that actually serves to protect the interests of the working class rather than the owning class. If the proletariat as a class must sell their labor to survive, then the answer isn&#39;t to create a classless society but to create a sellers&#39; market for labor.
