Baubau Czykawauwow (BC) is a small, rugged region for a certain clique of Australian bronies, headed by Emperor Sebastian II of East Thule with an even hoof, and known for its marvellous and futuristic train network, the tasteful and exquisite annual frogs festival, and rampant and uncontrolled public orgies. Its member-states share a commitment to human rights, mateship, diversity, good humour, and ruthlessly mocking cringe. Admission requires membership in the Bronies Australia discord server -- ask for info (response not guaranteed)
