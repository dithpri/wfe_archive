Throdia is a democratic region where all officers are elected. When nations have a proposal they should hand it to the appropriate officer. The officer may then decide to enact or reject the proposal, they must publish this decision a week before enacting it. This decision can be challenged:

1) You challenge a decision by giving one or more proposals of your own.
2) Others can add their own proposals.
3) After a week everyone votes (3 days), rejection of all proposals is also a valid vote. The winning proposal is enacted or all are rejected depending on the outcome.

Each officer has a veto-right, which in turn can be vetoed by a number of officers greater than those who veto. Veto-rights can be stripped when used frivolously.
