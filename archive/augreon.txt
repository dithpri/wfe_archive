Augreon is a roleplay region based around the technology and principles of the 12-1400&#39;s, within the height of the medieval era, with mild fantasy elements. The lands of Augreon are disputed among different cultures and tribes. Combat in the region is treated realistically and is based on factors such as terrain, weather and technology of nations.
