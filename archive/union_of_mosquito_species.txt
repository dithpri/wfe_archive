
We are collectively known as the &quot;blood-sucker&quot; region and our species is Mosquito (more specifically Asian Tiger Mosquito)

I am also accepting of new member nations in this region. We need to defend eachother if any means necessary. I am looking for new members to build up an army of loyal mosquitoes.

If you agree to join our region, you will be sheltered and protected. We could use some regional officers in here.
