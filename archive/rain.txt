The raindrop forms in the maelstrom of its mother&#39;s turbulent dances, thrown around like a toy, torn asunder and reformed misshapen every second. Once in a blissful while, however, it finds itself hurtling towards the incomprehensibly solid, tangible ground, and while it isn&#39;t always perfectly still, in all it&#39;s infinitely more peaceful than from where it came. After a couple days of bliss, however, it&#39;s returned, kicking and screaming, to the everlasting agony of the cloud. It spends its next incomprehensibly terrible days in the cloud, praying for a return to the corporeal. 

As with the raindrop, so with us all.
