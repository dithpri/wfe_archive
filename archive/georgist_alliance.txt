&#147;The great cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership of land. The ownership of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately determines the social, the political, and consequently the intellectual and moral condition of a people.&#148;
- Henry George, Progress and Poverty

Georgism is an economic ideology holding that people should own the value that they produce themselves, while the economic rent derived from land&#151;including from all natural resources, the commons, and urban locations&#151;should belong equally to all members of society. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#39;s dividend.
