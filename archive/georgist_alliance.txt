Georgism is the belief that people should own the value they produce themselves, but that the economic value derived from land (including natural resources) should belong equally to all members of society. Henry George famously argued that a single tax on the unimproved value of land would create a more productive and just society.

&quot;Landlords grow rich in their sleep without working, risking, or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold title.&quot;
