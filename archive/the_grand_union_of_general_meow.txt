Emmy wished on a dragon scale, 
And that&#39;s what started Dragon Tales.
Around the room the dragons flew, 
But Emmy and Max knew what to do.
They climbed on the backs of their dragon friends, 
Now the adventures never end! 

Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales
It&#39;s almost time for Dragon Tales.
Come along, take my hand, 
Let&#39;s all go to Dragon Land.

There&#39;s Ord he&#39;s the biggest, 
Not so brave of heart.
There&#39;s Cassie, 
So shy, also very smart.
There&#39;s Zak and Wheezie and his tales of fun, 
&#39;Cause you know two heads are better than one! 

Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales
It&#39;s almost time for Dragon Tales.
Come along, take my hand, 
Let&#39;s all go to Dragon Land.
