The Land of Whales is a long lost island, sunken in the war of the whales, as the island was the home of the great Poopy Whale race, who succumbed to the brutal tactics of human warfare. The Poopy Whales hid, while the humans sunk the city to the bottom of the ocean. Not much is known about the remaining Poopy Whales, all that is known is that they may exist. A dictatorship was formed, calling itself the Dictatorship of the Poopy Whales. It is unknown whether the Poopy Whales control this dictatorship, but one thing is for sure, it&amp;#39;s human occupants act almost as slaves to the nation.
