It was joever. The exiles had been driven from their first home during the collapse of 1900, and their second had fallen into decline, its people scattering to new lands and new destinies&#151;leaving those who remained as exiles once more.
And yet, they persisted, and by sheer luck, stumbled upon a new land: [b]Aiaha[/b]. Together, they elected to declare the new land theirs and settle it as such.
If only they weren&#39;t a bunch of greedy, power-hungry assholes.
The lush, vast, and diverse lands of Aiaha, technically bound together in Union, were carved into petty fiefdoms. Shifting alliances, pathetic disputes, and territorial clashes are the order of the day. But hey, we&#39;re all in this together.
