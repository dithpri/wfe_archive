The Special Containment Procedures Foundation, also known as the SCP-F is a fictional secret organization documented by the collaborative-writing wiki project of the same name. Within the website&#39;s shared universe, the Foundation is responsible for capturing, containing, and studying various paranormal, supernatural, and other mysterious phenomena unexplained by science (known as &quot;anomalies&quot; or &quot;SCPs&quot;), while also keeping their existence hidden from the rest of human society.
