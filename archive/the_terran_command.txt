This land is a preservation of the former Terran Command by its previous nations, embassies, and Head of Staff Aslantia.

This land was formerly called an &quot;annexed territory of the Pacific Empire,&quot; however this region is purely a preserved historical marker of the command.

Attempts to intervene with this preservation will be discussed in an open manner; this land will be released to its previous founder, The Terran Party, and only him upon return.
