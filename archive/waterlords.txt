Region History:
[nation=Waterlords] Single-handedly conquered this region. Destroyed all infrastructures and slaving its inhabitants. Now, because of his out of this world power (and never-ending charisma), he constructed this region to show the world his power!! I repeat.. HIS POWWEEERRR!!!!!
However, he is so powerful that he entrusted [nation=Waterlord], a newly conquered nation to safeguard the region and he left. 

And as we pay tribute to the greatest and MOST AMAZING ruler, we must all rise and together we shout:
[b]ALL HAIL WATERLORRRRDDSSSSSSS!!![/b]
