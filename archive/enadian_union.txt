[b]Tag go the sailors, tag, tag, tag,
Wide are their bows and their ships move quick,
The Lily looks around and is beaten by a blow,
And curses the old Admiral with the bare-bellied yoe

Blessed be, Grand Admiral Ist and his sailors decided to pay your region a visit today! Come to [region]Europeia[/region] and find out where they came from!
