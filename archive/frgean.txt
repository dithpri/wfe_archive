[colour=black]FRGETO, or The Former Romano-Gothic Empire Allied Nations, are all former colonies and states that survived The Great War and the fall of the Romno-Gothic Empire. We have all come together to form an alliance to insure we all survive, and to continue the great legacy of the Romano-Gothics.[/colour]
