The Strategic and Economic Alliance, SEA for short, is a group of nations aligned to partnership on a global scale, cooperating in many different aspects... and opposed to each other in other aspects. Intrigues and friendships, war and peace, many different things are in the future of the Strategic and Economic Alliance.
