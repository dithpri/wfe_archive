This Region is a Place Where Moderate Rational Ideas Thrive and where all believe that true prosperity comes from a free but regulated business, which will balance economic prosperity and economic equality with heavy taxes to support a expansive welfare system with social benefits so people will be able and willing to take risk to grow the economy knowing that they wont loss everything if they fail. Along with all this we believe in other main stream centre policies.
