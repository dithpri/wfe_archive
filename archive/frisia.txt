Frisia or Friesland is a coastal region along the southeastern corner of the North Sea. Frisia is the traditional homeland of the Frisians, a Germanic people who speak Frisian, a language group closely related to the English language.

Dominated by Castafioria, an idyllic nation renowned for its maritime trade, Frisia has few other constituents. Castafioria&amp;#39;s isolation and supreme goal of self-preservation prohibits any interaction outside of trade.
