The collective of the most beautiful and cheerful women.

Our anthem is:
INNA - Cola Song (feat. J Balvin) | Official Music Video

We got that Coca Cola bottle shape, shape, shape!
We got that sugar, do you wanna taste, taste, taste?
We take it all around the globe,
Baby everywhere we go,
Make it hot when mama arrives,
Shake, shake, shake!
