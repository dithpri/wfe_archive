Vesevia is a high fantasy world in which a long list of fantasy races exist, and in which magic is possible, and quite abundant. The gods walk the mortal plane, and regularly interact with individuals. Dragons fly through the skies, but they&#39;re not to be hunted. Even a demigod is little more than a distraction for their kind.
