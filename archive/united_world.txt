We are Unity, we are one. We are together and together we shall not fall. To those who join, you are apart of the family. To those of you who might want to join, we hope you choose the righ thing and we do not pressure you to join us.
If you&amp;#39;re going to be apart of us, here are a few rules:
-Be respectful and helpful.
-Be mature and try to use good grammar.
-Back yourself up with facts or moral opinion.
-Don&amp;#39;t do anything stupid.
Those are the current rules and some will be added/removed as the region goes along. No rules are permanent and can be voted off as well as voted on.

Our only motto is: &amp;quot;We are united.&amp;quot; 

Etc: If you want anything to be added, send me a telegram/vote on the wall.
