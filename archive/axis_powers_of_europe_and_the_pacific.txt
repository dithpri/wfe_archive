The Axis Powers of Europe and the Pacific are a union of nations dedicated to the complete eradication of Communism and Religious Radicalism. The Axis was founded by [nation]Greater Germanic Reich[/nation] and accepts all nations of Germanic, Italian, Japanese, Romanian, or Bulgarian origin. 

Be warned, the Axis may go to war against openly Communist regions or Theocracies at any time, and will not hesitate to invade regions who condemn our actions. However, we strive to maintain peace between our allies and neutral nations.
