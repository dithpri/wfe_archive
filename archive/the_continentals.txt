On the largest continent on the planet there were and still are many nations, 6 of them formed this alliance and we hope to grow. We run an active space program to find even more nations like many others (How are there supposed to be ~300k nations on one planet when the average national population is over 1B) Founded: May 29, 2022

Here we are a Representative Democracy, that means there will be elections for the representatives and president/prime minister but all major decisions are made by elected officials, you may also be made to follow rules you may not agree with.

There is a very strict no offsite communication policy here, YOU WILL GET BANNED if that is found. There are many onsite alternatives.
