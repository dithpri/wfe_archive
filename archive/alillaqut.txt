We are a [b]closed semi-serious roleplaying region,[/b] with an analog map (that means on paper!). We will eventually provide a digitised version of the map, but until then, telegram [nation]The Northern Reach[/nation], and I will place you on the map.... somewhere. Ja. Land plots are not totally necessary, but highly encouraged.
