We are a [b]closed semi-serious roleplaying region,[/b] with an analog map (that means on paper!). We will eventually provide a digitised version of the map, but until then, telegram [b][nation]The Northern Reach[/nation][/b], and he will place you on the map.... somewhere. Ja. Land plots are not totally necessary, but highly encouraged.
