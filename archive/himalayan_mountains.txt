The Himalayan Mountains are a mountain range in South Asia which separates the Indo-Gangetic Plain from the Tibetan Plateau. This range is home to more than one hundred mountains exceeding 7,200 metres (23,600 ft) in altitude, and all of the planet&amp;#39;s peaks exceeding 8,000 meters, including the highest, Mount Everest. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in both Buddhism and Hinduism.
