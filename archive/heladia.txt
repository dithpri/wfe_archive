Continental Heladia is a large and arid landmass that houses the 2 claimant states to what was formerly the empire of Heladia. The lands have a history of being regal and rich with culture, housing societies that, until recently, were focused on the arts and the luxuries of the lands rather than the more militant and industrial stance they have taken now.
