We at the Game Group will accept anyone and everyone into the region to explain views and help build nations. Also we have will talk about game updates on the games most of the nations play. I love to keep the game fun and take votes for the rules of the [region]Game Group[/region] monthly and also to elect your leader. All nations are required to not be either fascist or communist because to us it means you abuse you people. If you want to be a candidate speak to the admins or the [nation]StormCoders[/nation] about why you want the job. Have a good day :).
