The Confederacy of Nations are a democratic region. We are usually pacifist, but can engage on enemy&#39;s that are posing a threat to us. We are mainly democratic, but we do allow dictatorship&#39;s. The region can, and will eject any nation&#39;s that are to pose threat&#39;s to any nation within the region, or the region itself. We have election&#39;s for the delegate &amp; vice-delegate.
