We rule our nations with a fair hand, even though we are dictators. We are not murderers. We are not monsters. We are not Gods. We are civil, and fair to our people. I will let you rule your people, but if I feel you are turning on them, I will overthrow you. We show the world that Dictators are not all evil. We have done well so far. Join us, and you may see what we can do for you.
