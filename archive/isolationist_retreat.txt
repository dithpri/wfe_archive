Hello. 

No World Assembly Presence.

Isolationist nations only. 

Any conversations threaded will have freedom up to what the main website allows, unless it threatens my isolationist&#39;s paradise - then you get kicked from here and all evidence will be used against you in moderators&#39; investigations. 

My &#39;rules&#39; are simple - I&#39;ll tell you when you break them. 

If you have moderator sway and are simply trolling, you win, I&#39;ll find a website that is more inviting to passive, peaceful people. 
I suggest everyone else do the same, or mob together and kill Frankenstein&#39;s Monster. By this point, I&#39;ll still be gone and won&#39;t care.
