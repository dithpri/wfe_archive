For nations that wish to uphold the values of their own brand of National Socialism - for each people there will be variation.

Key features:
* Respect for the natural world and natural order of things - biology applied to politics
* Reverence of nature
* Ethnic integrity and homogeneity within a given nation - foreign people treated as belonging to other nations (tribes)
* Rejection of both marxism and consumerism in favour of spiritual and familial wealth - healthy economy
* Strong sense of identity - &quot;true diversity&quot;
* Collective sense of duty to kin - family first
* Corporate responsibility - with greater power over the people comes greater responsibility to the people
