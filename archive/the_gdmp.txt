For too long the dictatorships of the world have had to live under the shadow of democracy. So I created this region, where dictatorships are welcome, where dictatorships can work together, where dictatorships can fight together in the name of the safety and security of their people.

Although this region appears to be meant for only full fledged dictatorships, the only requirement is that your country has little to no political rights. However, a strong economy, defence, and law enforcement is preferred.

We look forward to your presence in our region.
