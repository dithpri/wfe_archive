[color=green][b]Vault-Tec[/color][/b], the corporation that ordered the start of Project Safehouse and had it funded by the U.S. Government, saved humanity as we know it with the 122 Vaults built throughout the Commonwealths of America. Nuclear annihilation came and went, but the world lived on into a bloody new chapter of history. But, something survived...

[b][color=crimson]The Wasteland[/b][/color], the scarred remnants of a fallen world, the horrors that lie above are plentiful. The world is in ruin, and the powers that remain, factions formed from the dust and ashes, war for control. The banners have changed, yes, but...war, war never changes. The future is left to the remnants.
