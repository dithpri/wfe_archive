[b]One Corporation Saved the World...[/b]

[b][color=green]Vault-Tec[/color][/b], the corporation that ordered the start of Project Safehouse and had it funded by the United Commonwealths Government, saved humanity with the 122 Vaults built throughout the Commonwealths of America. Nuclear annihilation came and went, the world lived on. The world is unsafe, but [color=crimson][b]the Wasteland[/color][/b] may prove safer than the Vaults...

[b][color=crimson]The Wasteland:[/b][/color] The scarred remnants of a fallen world, the horrors that lie above are plentiful. Humanity sits at the brink, unable to pull itself together. The entities that roam the surface are crazed and evil. The world is in ruin, and only [b][color=#34B6C5]&quot;Unity&quot;[/color][/b] can save it...
