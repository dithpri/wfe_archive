[i]Piscis Austrinus is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. The name is Latin for &quot;the southern fish&quot;, in contrast with the larger constellation Pisces, which represents a pair of fish. Before the 20th century, it was also known as Piscis Notius. Piscis Austrinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The stars of the modern constellation Grus once formed the &quot;tail&quot; of Piscis Austrinus. In 1597 (or 1598), Petrus Plancius carved out a separate constellation and named it after the crane.[/i][b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 04/05/2025.[/b]
