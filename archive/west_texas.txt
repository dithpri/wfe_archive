Oh yah, and if you have a problem with any of this, we have an idea. You can hop on down from that ivory tower of yours an bring your East Coast city-slickin behind on down to the ranch in Crawford where we conduct all government affairs. Then we&#39;ll sort it out under the hot Texas sun like they did in the old days...man to man, mono e mono. You won&#39;t. That&#39;s what I thought.
