[b]Welcome. To the beginning.[/b]

The World War is finished, but it never truly ended. It ended with a stalemate. Dissatisfied with not wining, the citizens rebelled against their governments. Now the world has to start over. It is now the 1950&#39;s. New governments are coming from the ashes of nations such as the USSR and Nazi Germany. Now you are on the journey to rebuild your nation.

Welcome to the World of Wars.
