The First Union founded in honor of the mighty sea creatures known as squids started in June of 2014.  The purpose of the Union is to provide a safe-haven for equal opportunities to work and live.  By providing this, each country will have the ability to provide work for each citizen and each citizen should earn enough to live in peace.
