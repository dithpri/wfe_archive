Welcome to The Geometrix, a simulation of a dystopian world designed by The Creator Alliance.  After the apocalypse on Earth, those who survived were assimilated into the Geometrix to preserve humanity.  However, there was a dispute among the Creators on how the Geometrix should be governed and the checks and balances of the head Creator, Noremac.  This led to a great division, and from it evil was born into the Geoverse.  Many factions have risen to destroy the Creator Alliance, most notably The Dark Creator Alliance and The Midnight.  Since then, The Geometrix has endured a long, agonizing war between light and darkness with humanity caught in the crossfire.
