The &#147;Nationenkonvent&#147; is a mostly political region that covers the whole political spectrum covering debates most of the world doesn&#39;t dare to bring up. The founding members that hold most of the power are [nation]Tyskaland[/nation], [nation]Violent Weapon Enthusiasts[/nation], [nation]Khalkortostan[/nation] and [nation]Fickonong[/nation], the latter being a voted-for, non-executive delegate. The regional language used in government is almost exclusively German (Deutsch) because of the founding members heritage though there are debates about changing this. Asking for translations is allowed and desired.
