[color=purple]Welcome to The Acord your regional defender![/color]
Made to defend regions who can&#39;t defend themselves.
[color=orange]Founded[/color][color=blue] 10/13/25[/color]
Currently, the Acord is changing to a Frontier region. This process will be finished on 10/27/25. However, when the region becomes a fully-fledged Frontier, the new nations will start pouring in! 
To increase regional safety and security, please join the World Assembly and endorse our WA delegate [nation]Seahawk[/nation].
If you have questions, ask [nation]Seahawk[/nation] or [nation]Draski[/nation].

[b][color=red]Endorsement cap for residents is currently 0, but for every 2 endorsements for the Delegate, the endorsement cap will go up 1! 
(this system may change later, it is simply a protective measure for now)[/color][/b]
