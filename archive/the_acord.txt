Welcome to The Acord! A brand-new, growing Frontier!
[color=green]Founded 10/13/25[/color]

Currently, the Acord is changing to a Frontier region. This process will be finished on 10/27/25. However, when the region becomes a fully-fledged Frontier, the new nations will start pouring in! 

[b][color=red]To increase regional safety and security, please join the World Assembly and endorse our WA delegate [nation]Seahawk[/nation].[/color][/b]
If you have questions, ask [nation]Seahawk[/nation] or [nation]Draski[/nation].

[color=orange]Endorsement cap for residents is currently 0, as, for now, there is a small WA population, but as the region grows, the endorsement cap will grow with it! (the current endocap is simply a protective measure while the region is making the shift to a Frontier)[/color]
