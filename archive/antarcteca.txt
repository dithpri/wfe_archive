The Rocky, Flatland, Snowy Region of The Antarctican Continent where fish are plentiful, along with meats, water, plants, and lots and lots of snow! This area was invaded by the once United States of America when the Antarctica Treaty was broken in 2020 AD. They later broke out into a Civil War. Later on when the war was at its height the Antarcticans who lived on the southern continent built a nuclear bomb, they bombed Hawaii and the island was then only mearly an image of your imagination. The one United States separated into the Republic of Antarcteca and The Republic of American. The Republic now lay peacefully and thriving in the Region of Antarcteca hoping for more nations to join them in their glory (2100 AD)!
