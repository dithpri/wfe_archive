[color=#ff0000]Welcome to my debate court. This is a political region anyone can join on the RMB, debating most things I put in the polls. Some help with the region would be quite nice![/color]
[hr][u][color=#2421ff]Most embassies are accepted. This region [b]does not:[/b][/u]
[i]* Debate why bigoted things such as white-hate, sexism, SJWs and Nazis are &quot;ok&quot; (which they are not)
* Try to convert someone&#39;s religion [b](Trying to get someone to change their religion will immediately get you banned)[/b]
* Force opinions or try to teach others to change their views. (Keeping in mind ideological rehabilitation can&#39;t work)[/color][/i][hr][u][color=#45a56a]Keeping in mind this region is run by a centrist, so I am tolerant of both the left and the right as long as they are not radical[/u]. And keep religious views out of debates NOT about religion.[/color]
