Beyond well ridden battlefields, ragged snow capped mountains, hellish ghoul riddled bogs and swamps lies our realm. A land ready and primed to defend our home from invaders and fools who wish to impose cruelty on our lands. We fight for glory and realm but keep to a honored code to protect our own, our pack. Welcome to the realm where all have a crown, let us reign.
