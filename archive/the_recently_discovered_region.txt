[b]PLEASE JOIN[b/]

I have three small nations, but in order to have a well worth it region, I am hoping to gain another 20 by the end of this month. 

Any small nations who need a place to stay where thier vot has a say, please join. Only two members of this region are WA members. I am not one, since I disagree with too many of the passed international laws, and don&amp;#39;t need the benefits of being Delegate, since I am the Founder. I am lookin for Democratic or republic nations that care for the wellbeing of their people.
