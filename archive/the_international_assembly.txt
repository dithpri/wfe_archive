[b]OOC Introduction:[/b]
Welcome, to the International Assembly, a land of Roleplay and...
Yeah, that&amp;#39;s pretty much it. Here in the International Assembly, Even the Delegate position and government of the region are roleplayed. The Concept is that the Cabinet of the Founder and WAD is a sort of United Nations, meaning that everything is roleplayed!
