[b][color=red]Hello and welcome to Austria![/color] - [color=black]Herzlich Willkommen in &Ouml;sterreich![/color][/b]

Austria is a free and friendly region, ready to welcome you in from the snow for a steaming gl&uuml;hwein by the log fire. A region of colourful villages snuggled amongst the high mountains, of cultured cities vibrant under a glorious architectural heritage, of proud cathedrals and wild forests and the racing streams of the mountain rivers. A region of beautiful valleys and chiming cowbells, of glittering lakes under majestic glaciers, and above all the outstretched wings of the soaring eagle. We are also highly accomplished clich&eacute; writers! ;-)

We are eager to make new friends, and we hope you like Austria enough to stay.  Now how about that gl&uuml;hwein?
