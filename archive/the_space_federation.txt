On various planets in many star systems throughout the Milky Way lies the Space Federation.  As a union, its purpose is to maintain law and order throughout the galaxy whilst advocating for the welfare of all the citizens in its many states.  The Space Federation has no bias towards authoritarian or libertarian leadership, nor right or leftist politics.  All are welcome in the Federation if they have the welfare of their people, whatever species, race, or gender they may be in mind.  Many of our leaders are also erepublik players in eJapan (nihonforums.net).
