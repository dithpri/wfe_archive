[b][u]The Unified Reich of Bogdanoff[/u][/b]
We are a proud region that are dedicated to the revival of right-wing politics. However, that does not mean we do not believe in democracy. The people of this nation should be help with the up most respect, as we believe that all should be treated equally when you support this region. Our beliefs range from the &#147;extreme&#148; to just &#147;right leaning&#148;, but of course we welcome all that share our beliefs. We also dedicate our lives to the divine beings that call themselves the &#147;Bogdanoffs&#148; and shun any person that goes by the name of &#147;Alec&#148;. We hope that you stay here as a permanent resident as we are highly active. 

More to come soon...
