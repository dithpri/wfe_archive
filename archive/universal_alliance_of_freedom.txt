Welcome to the Universal Alliance of Freedom! We are so excited to have you!
We have many offices to be created, will you be appointed? We also would love for you to send as many recruitment telegrams as possible! Are you new here? Read our &quot;Rules of the UAF&quot; dispatch. Ask any officer a question! He/She/They would love to help!
We welcome everyone except communists, fascists, and extreme socialists. We also have zero tolerance against any discrimination, with only exceptions that are deemed absolutely necessary by the President.

Please read the dispatch about COVID-19 as soon as possible.

Enjoy your stay!
