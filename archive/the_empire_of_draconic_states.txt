Founded originally in 2000 by former Emperor Maelstrom Vortex, Refounded 2020 by Exarch Sera. The Empire of Draconic states is a region dedicated to the peace, strength, and prosperity of all of Dragon kind in its many forms.

Our Emperor is appointed for life, and is chosen by our governing council which consists of a member representative from every Draconic nation. We bow to no one, not even the human dominated World Assembly. Our way is our own.

Each nation rules itself in complete autonomy, contributing to a collaborative defense force under our Emperor.
