THIS REGION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE SILENCE !!!
http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_silence

We raid for MUTUAL BENEFITS.
Other raiding nations (like http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_black_riders and http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_eternal_knights) raid purely for self-glorification and although defenders stop this, they always leave a region weak and susceptible to more attacks.
region=the_silence raids for both the benefit of themselves and the region being raided. It benefits us through the publicity we get and our flag, which we leave behind, but it also benefits the natives as we refound their region so that it can be NEVER raided again.
