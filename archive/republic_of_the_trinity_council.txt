Contrary to our origins from The Imperial Powers of the Trinity Counsil, the Republic of the Trinity council aims to increase Democratic and Republican interactions between people and nations. A vote is held for every decision made, and everyone has a say. We accept Conservatives, Centrists, and Liberals. We do not accept such radicals as: Fascists, Socialists, Communists, Warmongers, those who support harmful prejudices (systemic prejudice against a class, race, sex, etc.), and so on. We believe in a strict code of freedom and capitalist free-market. Nations have sovereign right over their people, but those with oppressive ideologies will not be tolerated.
