Contrary to our origins from The Imperial Powers of the Trinity Counsil, the Democratic Republic of the Trinity council aims to increase Democratic and Republican interactions between people and nations. A vote is held for every decision made, and everyone has a say. We accept Conservatives, such as Freeland; Centrists, such as Icevale; leftists, such as Wurbalwind... We even welcome anarchists, socialists, communists, radical right-wingers, radical left-wingers, and dictators of any kind.
