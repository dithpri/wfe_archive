[b][color=#000061]Welcome to JAIL[/color]

[color=navy]The warden threw a party in the county jail.
The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin&amp;#39; and the joint began to swing.
You should&amp;#39;ve heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.
Let&amp;#39;s rock, everybody, let&amp;#39;s rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin&amp;#39; to the Jailhouse Rock.[/color]
