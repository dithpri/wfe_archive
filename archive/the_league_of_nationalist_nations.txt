The League of Nationalist Nations&#39; goal is representing the will of the European people and ensuring that European peoples are protected under certain unalienable rights, such as the right to life, self determination, and property. We as a collective are against the seeping presence of Socialism, and Left wing rhetoric which destroys the very foundation of the volk. We hope as a group to challenge that.
