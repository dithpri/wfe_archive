This is [region]SKYRIM[/region] &amp;amp; we are home of the Nords and great nations alike.
We are not the Empire. We are an independent region.

The Elder Council of Skyrim is back in session:

Jarl of [nation=short]Grantsbourg[/nation]
Jarl of [nation=short]pomplamouse[/nation]
Jarl of [nation=short]lexarium[/nation]
Jarl of [nation=short]vegtablack[/nation]
Jarl of [nation=short]Nesrisl[/nation]

This is our revolution.
