Nords are welcome to RP and set up Holds to trade, conquer, or compete games with. Open discussion are encourage, just keep them appropriate and non-raider friendly. Nords are encourage to Endorse the WAD for Security reasons to help protect Skyrim from unfriendly attacks, and to help get Skyrim progressing towards Stability and Glory once again. 

Long Live Skyrim, Long Live the Empire!
