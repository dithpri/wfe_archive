The Kingdom of Skyrim is ruled by the High King (or Queen) and their consort. 

The region of Skyrim is a historical region with vast history and rich with culture.

The region is under reforms and will be protected by allies and the Imperial Legion until the Government is up and stable and some reforms are completed.

Any attempt to replace this native established government for the better of Skyrim, will be banned.
