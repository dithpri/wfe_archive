[b][color=red]British[/color][color=blue] Confederation[/color] | Founded:[/b] 26 February 2017

Welcome to the British Confederation! We are a British themed, roleplaying region based around a series of alternative events that led to the UK becoming a confederation in 1970s. All nations of all ideologies are welcome and we look forward to welcoming you here to participate in roleplaying and discussion and (most importantly) to have fun. If the dominant roleplay is not for you, then don&#39;t worry we have have a regional government that handles non-roleplayin matters.[hr][color=purple][b]Monarch:[/b][/color]
