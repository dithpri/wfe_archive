Far over the Spear Danes Mountains cold
To dungeons deep and regions old
We must raid, ere break of update
To seek our pale enchanted hold

The joint armies of the North Pacific Army and the Independent Joint Command Coalition have taken this region. 

Any attempts to retake these halls will be met with fire from Smaug.
