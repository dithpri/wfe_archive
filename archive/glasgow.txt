[b][region]Glasgow[/region] 
The Scottish city of Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and a port city on the River Clyde in the western Lowlands. Weakened by immigration, Glasgow is only 86.5% European controlled at last estimates and the percentage of Scots are unknown, being classified as &quot;White British&quot;

Glasgow itself was founded by the Christian missionary Saint Mungo in the 6th century, and the city coat of arms and flag bear his design.
