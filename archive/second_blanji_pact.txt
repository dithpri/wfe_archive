Blanjiland, a once high-status haven for the citizens of the world took a dark toll and was annexed by the Swadenians almost a year ago. Eventually, the fallen Oligarchy has successfully managed to obtain an independent Blanjiland. With this, Swaden and all the former republics and empires under the Treaty of the Blanji Pact were put under direct Blanji control. Now, a reformation of the Blanji Pact is reborn, to instill peace in our time.
