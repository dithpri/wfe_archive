The Heavenly Alliance is a group of nations that have survived the nuclear fallout and sun flares by annexing other nations. We will fight for whoever pays the most in war time and have no regrets about it. We welcome any nations that love war and fight for brotherhood and comradeship. We focus mainly on military might. We reside in what was once called Australia, Ocenia, Japan, New Zealand, New Gueinea, Phillipines, India, China, and Southern Asia.
