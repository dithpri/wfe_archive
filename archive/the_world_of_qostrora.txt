The World of Qostrora is a roleplaying, futuristic technology based region, set on an alien planet, hundreds of years from Earth.

There are only two real rules of Qostrora at the moment, and are as follows:
1. Your factbook must coincide with the history of Qostrora. (See the Founder&#39;s factbook)
2. You may not be a member of the World Assembly.
