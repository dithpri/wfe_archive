Formerly an Aedrian sub-colony going by the name of &amp;quot;Aeth&amp;quot;, a rather successful colony, the first generation of Aedrians in this sub-colony engaged in hostile confrontation with a well known Aedrian leader, &amp;quot;Mako Viyata&amp;quot;. Mako then, feeling he had no other choice, exiled colony &amp;quot;Aeth&amp;quot; from the Aedrian Alliance. Since then, they&amp;#39;ve taken the name &amp;quot;True Aedrians&amp;quot;, and they often bicker with the Aedrian Alliance.
