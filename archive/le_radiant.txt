[b]Welcome to the sacrosanct lands of Le Radiant, home to the governors and disciples of Duxlam Dingbat. [/b]

[b]Seven Pillars of Duxlam Dingbat[/b]
If my neighbor is tooting, then I am smelling.
Welcome those unknown with love and teach them Duxlam Dingbat.
Gamble with your possessions.
It is not necessarily a sin to withhold help from those in need and it is a sin to help those who can help themselves.
Forgive your derps and use them to find truth.
Accept Duxlam Dingbat as your spiritual father, or don&#39;t, we aren&#39;t authoritarian...
