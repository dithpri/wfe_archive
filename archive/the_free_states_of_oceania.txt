The Free States of Oceania is a region founded on the belief that world peace is possible through compromise, freedom of the people, and hard work. All nations are encouraged to participate in the WA and refrain from war. However, being free states means that all activity will be tolerated except for the unfair treatment of others based on physical or mental attributes, and instead, their personality and decisions.
