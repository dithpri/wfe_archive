&amp;#129370; Overview: New Chiken is a quirky, chicken-led region where logic takes a backseat to feathers, corn runs the economy, and politics are decided by squawk-offs. Governed by cluckery and pure whimsy, the region celebrates unity through chaos, beak-first diplomacy, and a strict no-nugget policy. Here, every day is a new chance to molt with pride.
