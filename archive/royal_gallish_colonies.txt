The Royal Gallish Colonies consist of all independent outlying countries protected by The United Kingdom of Gadalland and Aspern.
The Colonies are subject to the laws of the World Assembly, and the Constitution of Gadalland and Aspern. Otherwise, all colonies are safe from harm by other countries and have independence in all other ways of life.
