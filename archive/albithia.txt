A small, temperate continent that is best known for its encircling mountain ranges. The mainland experiences near constant rainfall in the spring, fairly warm temperatures in the summer, and a long, cold (but absolutely beautiful) autumn, since the temperatures rarely drop to allow snowfall. The aptly named nation of Albithica is Albithia&amp;#39;s only resident country.
