The International Abdoranian Allies was formed by the three Abdoranian governments at the end of The Great War that had previously separated them. The war had taken its toll on the three nations and some of the surrounding territories, with some areas losing most if not all of it&#39;s population, reducing the once powerful countries to little more than new settlements. The remaining people decided that each individual country was weak, but united, with other nations, they would be strong. Thus came to light, a new region defined by power and general psychosis among its members&#39; governments. Though once very weak, the region has moved up greatly in the world.
