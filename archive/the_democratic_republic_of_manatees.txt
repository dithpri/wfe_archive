We are a region of mixed government forms, some democratic and some not. There is free reign for either socialist and capitalist governments with liberal and conservative people. We hope that you respect your fellow nations at least a little and avidly participate in the message board. [nation]Kolonisatioun[/nation] and [nation]Dructeva[/nation] are the Founder and Co-Founder, respectively. [nation]Zpookikus[/nation] is our World Assembly delegate. Remember to endorse our WA delegate, but also that the position is always up for grabs. Please be respectful in chat but don&#39;t be frightened to share your opinions.
