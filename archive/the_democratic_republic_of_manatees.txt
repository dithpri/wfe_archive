[color=blue]Welcome to the Democratic Republic of Manatees![/color]
[hr]
We are a region of mixed government forms, some democratic and some not. There is free reign for either socialist and capitalist governments or liberal and conservative people. We hope that you respect your fellow nations at least a little and avidly participate in the message board. [nation]Kolonisatioun[/nation] and [nation]Dructeva[/nation] are the Founder and Co-Founder, respectively. [nation]Zpookikus[/nation] is our World Assembly Delegate. This is the newly appointed delegate, but remember, the position is always up for grabs. Please be respectful in chat but don&#39;t be frightened to share your opinions.
