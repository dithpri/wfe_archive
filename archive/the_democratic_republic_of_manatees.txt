[color=blue]Welcome to the Democratic Republic of Manatees![/color]
[hr]
We are a region of mixed government forms, some democratic and some not. There is free reign for either socialist or capitalistic reign and liberal or conservative. We hope that you respect your fellow nations at least a little and avidly participate in the message board. [nation]Kolonisatioun[/nation] and [nation]Dructeva[/nation] are the Founder and Co-Founder. [nation]Whylde[/nation] is our World Assembly Delegate. Although we do really like our current delegate, the position is always up for grabs. Please be respectful in chat but don&#39;t be frightened to share your opinions.
