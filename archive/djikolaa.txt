this ancient region is the land of the (not so) free.  
We praise the ancient huhuhani&#39;opoikio religion, which is the reason for us to flee from the west pacific.  We were forced to worship neenee, yet we still live on in the hope of our saviour, Kui&#39;itio returning.  join us and take away one more country from the uitaki - the region of the west pacific, and join us in daikomai - the region of the free.

Join our land and we will unite.
