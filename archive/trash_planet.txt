On board station Typhus, a group of powerful powerful men watch a globe of rust and metal slowly spin under a dull sun. Their game: televised conflict. They go around the universe snatching up groups of similar species, giving them the bare minimum to survive before leaving them to live and prosper on their new home. Now you must lead your survivors forward in this wasteland, navigating its perils, conducting diplomacy and war, and perhaps one day escaping.
