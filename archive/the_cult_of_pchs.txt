The Cult of PCHS is a place where the students of PCHS can all prosper together.
PCHS STUDENTS ONLY
You have every right to invite any other PCHS student to join this phenomenal alliance.

I&#39;m calling a state of emergency. Yeeter of Gods and The Ranch High Council are going to work to make this election fair. There are way too many people. Some of them are out of our school and some have double nations. I recommend joining the World Assembly to make it easier for you in the next plans of action. ~ Yeeter of Gods

[b]IMPORTANT[/b]: We have too many people, people we don&#39;t know and double nations, everybody has to be apart of the World Assembly. Due to the CV, I will push the deadline to the first Wednesday of school.  ~ Yeeter of Gods.
