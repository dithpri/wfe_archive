Welcome to the Mass Effect Universe, a region based in Mass Effect lore and full of role play experiences and opportunities! Taking place after the events of the Reaper War in 2188, players will operate as one of the many Mass Effect species to shape the future of the Galaxy. Will Peace in our time be established for a lasting commonwealth? Or can war and strife never truly be defeated? The choice, and its consequences, fall completely to us.
