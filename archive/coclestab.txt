Our favourite riverside embassy of the &quot;Old Region&quot; of days passed. We&#39;ve established a new region based out of Ogvame, and the nations of old return once more. Bigger, better, stronger, and eager to achieve, Coclestab will surpass its predecessor and take the reins of power into its own hands.

If you&#39;d like to help out in growing the region, consider endorsing the current W.A. delegate and occasionally posting messages. Everything you do will be appreciated.
