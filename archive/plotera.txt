This region contains a plethora of bears. But that is not what sets us apart from other nations, no, we are a group of well-rounded individuals looking for a bit of fun. We are intelligent, outgoing, humorous, nonconformists, and best of all, we are friends. You see, friends are what make people people. With friends you have the best experiences, you don&amp;#39;t have to fear anything because you are surrounded by people who like you for who you are. So, yeah, we are a unique region.
