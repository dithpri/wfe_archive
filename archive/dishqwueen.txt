Welcome to [color=purple]Dish[/color][color=lightpurple]q[/color][color=pink]wueen[/color], the safe haven where individuals coexist harmoniously! Currently, our region is closed as we curate our initial group of residents. Kindly continue to monitor our status for updates on availability!
Our community abides by straightforward guidelines:

1. Avoid engaging in toxic behavior.

2. Refrain from passing judgment on others based on their national status.

3. Treat all individuals with fairness and respect.


A Discord server will be established in the near future for easier communication and interaction!
