Forlorn Hope is a modest (Australia-sized) continent in the central Pacific Ocean, with the northern part of the continent protruding slightly north of the equator. The terrain is defined by several large and forbidding mountain ranges in the center and east, with lush jungles in the northwest and southeast, and broad plains in the southwest.
