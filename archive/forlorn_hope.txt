Forlorn Hope is an Australia-sized continent located in the central Pacific. The northern third of Forlorn Hope is north of the Equator. The region is a land of extremes- from lush tropical and subtropical natural wonderlands to industrial wastelands; from forbidding mountains to broad coastal grasslands; and from high-tech landscapes to agrarian communities.

Forlorn Hope is a land where only the strong survive, the ruthless flourish, and Capitalism is King.
