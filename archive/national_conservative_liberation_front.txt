Hello. This is meant to be a peaceful region. We are more of a political party. Our core beliefs are:

-Fascism, Nazism, etc. are Far-Left because of their big government systems.

-Islam is not a peaceful religion. It&#39;s founder and Holy Book are full of hate, religious intolerance, rape and murder.

-The Republican/Libertarian Parties are too moderate, and give too many freedoms to criminals and foreign enemies. 

-Key models for Conservatives are John Locke, Samuel Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, Mike Pence, and Trey Goudy.  

This group supports Republican Presidential Candidate: Donald J. Trump.
