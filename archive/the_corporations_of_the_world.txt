While the one NPA team ran a massive Detag, another smaller team led by [nation]Palutenia[/nation] went to do a simple tag raid. Sneaking behind Libcords back, we found a handful of regions. Including this one.

Soldiers:
COL [nation]Palutenia[/nation] (point)
GEN [nation]Rom[/nation]
GEN [nation]Konar[/nation]
PFC [nation]Plembobria[/nation]
