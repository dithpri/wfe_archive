    The Silver Stream is a small area of the base of the Wing of Silver arm of Asmodea.  The Silver Stream is in a lightly-populated section of the galaxy.

   &quot;The Silver Stream&quot; was originally the name of the entire galaxy, given to it by ancient Itascans because of its silvery appearance.  In more modern times, the name has just come to mean the small area surrounding the GCP.
