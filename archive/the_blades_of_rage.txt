The Blades of Rage was founded by [nation]The First Supreme Emperor[/nation] as a way of unity in this chaotic war. An act of war against one member will constitute an act of war against all of us. We enjoy role-playing. Betrayal will result in swift action; traitors will be punished. We shall have a united military, used for the defense of us all.

[b]FEAR OUR RAGE![/b]
