The VOC was an early multinational/transnational corporation in its modern sense. The Company has been often labelled a trading company (a company of merchants) or sometimes a shipping company. However, the VOC was in fact a proto-conglomerate company, diversifying into multiple commercial and industrial activities such as international trade (especially intra-Asian trade), shipbuilding, production and trade of East Indian spices, Formosan sugarcane, and South African wine. The Company was also a transcontinental employer and an early pioneer of outward foreign direct investment at the dawn of modern capitalism
