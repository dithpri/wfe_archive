[color=blue]Hello there wanderers looking for regions.[/color]
I am aware that [region]Bonum Consilio Et Imperium[/region] is a long name, so I will be calling it BCEI. This is a VERY minuscule region. That has positives and negatives. BCEI was created for new players. The password is: newbie. BCEI is latin, and if you are interested you can look it up or ask. English is not necessary, but that is the language I communicate in. Just let me know your preference and I can translate my words. You do not need to be active on NationStates.[b] If you are new (like myself) then please join and feel safe while you build your nation. You are free to leave after you grow! [/b]
Thanks for reading,
- Founder of [region]Bonum Consilio Et Imperum[/region] and Leader of [nation]Genus Imperiosa[/nation]
