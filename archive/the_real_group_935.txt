Group 935 was a scientific research group involved with the creation of most of the Wonder Weapon experiments. Their main facility was located near Breslau, Germany, (now known as Wroclaw, Poland) and was codenamed Der Riese (The Giant), but they had many other facilities throughout the globe. Another main base of operations was Griffin Castle, codenamed &quot;Eagle&#39;s Nest&quot;, where it acted at the launch site for their rockets to their Moon base, Griffin Station.
