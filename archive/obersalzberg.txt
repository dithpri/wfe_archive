[b]Obersalzberg[/b] is a mountainside retreat situated above the market town of Berchtesgaden in [region]Bavaria[/region], Germany, located about 75 miles southeast of Munich, close to the border with Austria. The retreat is best known as the location of Adolf Hitler&#39;s mountain residence, the [region]Berghof[/region] (demolished) with the nearby Mooslahnerkopf Teahouse (likewise), and the more elevated Kehlsteinhaus, popularly known as the &#39;Eagle&#39;s Nest&#39;.

The name of the settlement area derives from the rock salt deposits in the former Berchtesgaden Provostry documented since the 12th century. It was part of the provostry&#39;s Salzberg locality (a so-called Gnotschaft), where the Berchtesgaden salt mine was established in 1517. &#151;Wikipedia
