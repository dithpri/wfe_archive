[Color=333333]Obersalzberg is a mountainside retreat situated above the market town of Berchtesgaden in Bavaria, Germany, located about 75 miles southeast of Munich, close to the border with Austria. The retreat is best known as the location of Adolf Hitler&amp;#39;s mountain residence, the Berghof (demolished) with the nearby Mooslahnerkopf Teahouse (likewise), and the more elevated Kehlsteinhaus, popularly known as the &amp;#39;Eagle&amp;#39;s Nest&amp;#39;.

The name of the settlement area derives from the rock salt deposits in the former Berchtesgaden Provostry documented since the 12th century. It was part of the provostry&amp;#39;s Salzberg locality (a so-called Gnotschaft), where the Berchtesgaden salt mine was established in 1517.[/color]
