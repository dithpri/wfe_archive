We are socialists!

For those who don&#146;t know socialism is:an economic and political system where the workers or the government own the buildings and tools that make goods and services like farms and factories. This can be achieved through decentralized and direct worker-ownership, or through centralized state-ownership of the means of production.

There are a few rules
1:You must have the socialist symbol on your flag
2:No abuse of power
3:be kind

Break them once and you will be kicked, break them TWICE and you will be banned.
