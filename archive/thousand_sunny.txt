Thousand Sunny is home to beautiful and ethical regions who hold their civil rights very dearly. Amongst the regions here, you will find citizens of compassion and intelligence who are also primarily atheist and choose not to distribute their tax to areas such as religion and spirituality. Alongside the distain shown towards religion, it has also been noted that nations amongst Thousand Sunny also dislike cheese and children, some of which use their nation&amp;#39;s insubordinate children as national currency.
