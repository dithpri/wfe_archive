The Aison Collaboration formed by annexing lands from their rivals in the mid 1800s. Having dull growth for nearly two centuries, the discovery of rare mineral deposits have brought forth a wave of mining and industrialization to the region. With the nations beginning to move forward and prosper, they have formed an alliance. While members of the region are sometimes suspicious of one another, their leaders still get together weekly to play a rousing game of Bocce Ball.
