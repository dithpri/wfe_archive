Aequora is a nation founded on the principles of socialism and communism, created by and exclusively for those who share these ideals. Established by Bludozo on February 15, 2025, Aequora derives its name from the Latin words &quot;aequus&quot; (equal) and &quot;ora&quot; (land), symbolizing a commitment to equality and shared ownership of resources. 

We do ask of you to adopt the Aequoran Ruble, doing so facilitates seamless trade and economic cooperation, enabling residents to easily purchase goods and services across all nations within Aequora. This voluntary system is designed to strengthen economic ties and promote unity among the member states, while respecting your, and their, individual preferences.
