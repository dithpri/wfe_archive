The Council of Totalitarian states is a proud region where democratically elected rulers freely exercise their rights to absolute authority for the greater good. Unlike the filthy capitalist nations of other regions, all countries in the C.T.S. focus on doing what is right. Whether you&#39;re fascist, communist, or just another dictatorship, you are welcome in the Council of Totalitarian States.
