The Council of Totalitarian States is a region open solely to dictatorships, empires, monarchies, and all other nations where the government has absolute power. Its reason for existence? WORLD DOMINATION. The Council may not be very influential yet, but that will change, and one day we will rule the world, so why not join the winning team?
Rules:
1. All nations must have low Civil Rights and Political Freedoms. If a nation&#39;s rights or freedoms become good and are not lowered, it will be ejected.

2. If a nation is inactive for 2 weeks, it will be ejected. If it returns to the region and continues inactivity for one more week, it will be banned. If the nation has an admin position, then it will be stripped of that rank if inactive for 2 weeks.
