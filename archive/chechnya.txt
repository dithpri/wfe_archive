Chechens constitute the largest native ethnic group originating in the North Caucasus region. They refer to themselves as Nox&ccedil;i, which comes from the name of a large Chechen tribe, the Nox&ccedil;mexkaxoy, and their homeland.

The isolated mountain terrain of the Caucasus and the strategic value outsiders have placed on the areas settled by Chechens has contributed much to the Chechen community ethos and helped shape a unique national character.
