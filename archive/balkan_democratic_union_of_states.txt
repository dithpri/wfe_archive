The BDU is a group of Democratic nations who want to preserve democratic values. Liberal, Centrist, Libertarian, Conservative, and Socialist Nations are all Welcome. All Government Positions will be up for election on every Sunday. Polls are open from 08:00 until 08:00 GMT Monday, and Elections will always be free and fair. Anyone who wants to run just has to fill out a google form located in the forum. I will admit that at the start most of the nations are created by me. However, this is not out of dishonesty. It is just to get things started up. Anyone who joins may join with multiple accounts. If everyone does it will all even out. Country names must be balkan-related please, and no Mass-Joining.
