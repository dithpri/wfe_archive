The Island of Afronteon is located in the far South Atlantic Ocean. It is home to sizable amounts of forest, deltas, and river connections, making it a very fertile island. Climate is rather cold during the Winter months, but is a comfortable temperature during the summer.

Afronteon was first settled by the first settlers of Veilona in the year 200 CE in the settlement of &#39;Veilont&#39;, a name that still holds to the modern day. The Regional Council, meeting every quarter of the year, is also based in Veilont and handles regional law mainly, but also has oversights in trade, labor, and international affiliations.
