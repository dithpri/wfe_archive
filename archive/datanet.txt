You are encouraged to endorse [nation]GAIAD[/nation] and the WA Delegate but it&#39;s not required. The WA Delegate is elected through the most endorsements. [b]Please don&#39;t violate any of Nation states rules or either one of the executives find and kick you first or an admin is going to nuke us.[/b][i][u][/u][/i] I really don&#39;t care otherwise about what you do on the board.

[color=orange][b]Elections are held every month for new Officers[/b][/color]

Don&#39;t be mean and ruin other peoples time. If you want me to give you Executive authority or any position of your liking, make an statement/argument and telegram me.
Changing appearance is for officers only, if you have a specific request telegram them or me.
