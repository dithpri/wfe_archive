You are encouraged to endorse [nation]GAIAD[/nation] but it&#39;s not required, the WA Delegate is elected through the most endorsements. 

Please don&#39;t violate any of Nation states rules or either one of the executives find and kick you first or an admin is going to nuke us. I really don&#39;t care otherwise about what you do on the board.

If you suspect any raiders and such please telegram me. Don&#39;t be mean and ruin other peoples time. 

If you want me to give you Executive authority or any position of your liking, make an statement/argument and telegram me.

This is our national anthem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWMPVn1kgIQ
