The Nation of Reatnia is a small, but growing Nation aimed toward&#39;s an Authoritarian Government rather than a fair. With this, crime&#39;s are rarely committed despite the small population due to the heavy fund&#39;s put into the Police Force. It is heavily punishable if citizen&#39;s leave, and farmer&#39;s are forced to give more than half of their crop&#39;s to the government.
