Hello!  Welcome to Weave Holders&#153;.  This region is like many other regions, we simply negotiate with rival regions, as well as recruit and bond with people without a region.  
Not understanding what a weave is, or what &quot;Hold my weave&quot; means?  I got you covered.

weave (n)
1. a hairstyle created by weaving pieces of real or artificial hair into a person&#39;s existing hair, typically in order to increase its length or thickness.

&quot;hold my weave&quot; 
1. expression made by a ratchet persona before getting into a really pointless, but very violent, fight.  

I really hope you enjoy your time in Weave Holders!
