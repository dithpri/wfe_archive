[hr][list][i]The Federation of Kievan Rus was once a medieval polity, extending in size from mid-western Russia to the Eastern border of Europe today. In the early 1000s, and under the pressure of the Mongol hordes to the east, the empire collapsed. We are the remnants of that empire, the Rus. History turned it&#39;s back on us, and we may sometimes go down, but never out.
