The Alum Union is the union between Alum Nivus (Northern Alum) and Alum Ti (Southern Alum) two continents of wildly differing terrains and cultures, but like minded peoples, one being a vast desert with endless dunes, wild oases, and ruthless sandstorms. The other being a cold crisp land of valleys, fjords, lakes and grand mountain ranges. The Union strives for peace and unity among all peoples and cultures, not to mix peoples and culture but to find or forge commonalities between even the most divided of groups. The Union and it&#39;s members are to stand against Regimes. For we are all more than just our race, We are more than just our gender, and we are more than just our nations. We are people.
