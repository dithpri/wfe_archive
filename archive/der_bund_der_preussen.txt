[b]A million slugs up in the sky.
One excretes mucus brighter - I can&#39;t deny.
A love so precious, a love so true,
a love that comes from me to you.
The bears scream when you are near.
Within your arms rabbits have everything to fear.
You never know just what to say.
Just talking to you ruins my day.
I love you, honey, with all of my heart.
Together forever and let&#39;s take our skeletons apart.
