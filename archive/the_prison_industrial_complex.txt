Welcome to the prison-industrial complex.
Please remain standing three feet behind the yellow line, or the invisible turrets will turn your insides into a fine crimson mist.

Empty your pockets, remove all piercings and jewellery, and take your horse emetics.

After twenty four hours in separate holding cells, you may enter the front desk.

Have a nice day! &amp;#128522;
