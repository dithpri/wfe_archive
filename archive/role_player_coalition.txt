[B][color=blue] Here in the RPC, we have a great Constitution and a really cool World Map for Roleplay! However, it is a requirement that you need to be on the Map in order to RP, so make sure you telegram [nation]The_Bavarian_State[/nation] ASAP to be on the Map! The process of being put on the map takes some time so please be patient. :)[/B][/color]
