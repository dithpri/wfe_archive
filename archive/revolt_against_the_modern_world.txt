A region for traditionalists of all stripes: Fascists, Monarchists, National Socialists, Anarcho-Primitivists, or just plain reactionaries, all who oppose the degeneracy of the modern world and wish to see a brighter future are free to join. However, do not join if you are in support of socially liberal concepts, such as feminism, progressivism, gay rights, etc., or if you embrace nihilistic concepts such as consumerism as &quot;healthy&quot; and/or &quot;normal.&quot;
