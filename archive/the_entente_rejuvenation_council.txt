[u][i][b]The Entente Rejuvenation Council (E.R.C)[/b][/i][/u]

[i]The E.R.C. is the governing body of the 1st Entente&#39;s planned renaissance. Several Administrative decisions will be taken in this place to lead the Entente to a brighter path. Everything decided here will be compiled in a factbook which will become the new constitution of the Entente, as well as its supreme law. We will emerge stronger and united, ready to face whatever odds the future brings onto us.

&quot;Progress in every age results only from the fact that there are people who refuse to believe that what they knew to be right cannot be done.&#148;
