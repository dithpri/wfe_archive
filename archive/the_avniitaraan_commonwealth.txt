Spanning five planets across the Avniitaraan solar system, the Commonwealth was born to bring upon an era of peace and exploration.

Peace in the solar system remains unstable, but through cooperation, there many peoples have learned to unite for the greater good and to look beyond their differences. 

The five planets are: Xervia, Linouxa, Trinatra, Kaiyasko and Maikuana, all represented in the flag.
Xervia is mainly controlled by Raivyara and Novaria. Fei-Linouxa ruled by V&eacute;rsi. Trinatra and Kaiyasko are both incredibly fractured and destabilized planets. Finally, there is Maikuana, the only peacefully united planet.

Some of the major nations of the solar system are: Memekraftia, V&eacute;rsi, Raivyara, Novaria, Lucidius, Maikuana, and Kesikeland.
