The Union of Eldian States is an alliance between the 6 nations that emerged out of the Eldian civil war back in 1800. The Eldian Empire was a vast empire across the eastern continent, when the Emperor was assassinated in the year 1799 and the Imperial Family died out since the Emperor had no surviving male-line descendants, the nations saw this as an opportunity to become independent, so a civil war started between the 70 states, 6 emerging victors.
