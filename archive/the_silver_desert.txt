[i]The Silver Desert is a vast, dry desert full of shining silver sands, and dotted by lush little oases. The shifting silver sands can blind and daze unwary travellers, though a nomadic nation has made the desert their own, and know where to find each and every oasis in the vast expanse. Desert animals abound, if you know where to look.[/i]
