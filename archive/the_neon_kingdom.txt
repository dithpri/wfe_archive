Neon is a [color=red]c[/color][color=green]o[/color][color=blue]l[/color][color=black]o[/color][color=orange]r[/color][color=pink]l[/color][color=yellow]e[/color][color=grey]s[/color][color=brown]s[/color] and odorless gas, and that sure does translate, although I do smell a stench coming from the pits of this region (I slapped my neon that one). The [color=red]Europeian[/color] [color=blue]Republican[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color] ([color=red]E[/color][color=blue]R[/color][color=green]N[/color]) has come to bring color back into this region and taint it in an odor it simply cannot escape! It&#39;s time for the ERN to put its [i]neon[/i] history by beating neon once-and-for-all.

For some good old-fashioned fun, come check out [region]Europeia[/region]. We have many colors visible, but certainly not neon.
