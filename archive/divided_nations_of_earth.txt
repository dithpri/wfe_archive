Raiders now have access to the region, and it must be evacuated by N-day, February 25th, 2023.
Loyal citizens please evacuate to [region]The Praetorium Province[/region]. Do not delay. Late nations will likely be sent to the Rejected Realms.
[region]The Praetorium Province[/region] is the safe house for the Divided Nations at the moment. Please stand by while a multi-regional government is set by which the Divided Nations will operate.

Good day,
Your WA Delegate, [nation=long]United Anarchists of Earth[/nation]
