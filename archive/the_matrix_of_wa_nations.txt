[b]Dear leaders,[/b] 

Who wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be in a region where they can hold a powerful position. 
As the region grows, the powerful positions will grow as well and not one dictating founder 
or WA delegate keeping all the power to himself. 
You are in charge of your own Nation and can become a strong Nation within in the region, 
or even Represent The Matrix of WA Nations.

For the greater good of the Matrix, where all stand as one and all stand for their Nation.

Yours sincerely,

Ykcirius Sirius, Emperor of Ykceria, Trustee of TMWAN.
