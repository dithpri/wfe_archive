[b]&amp;#10014; Welcome to [region]The Confessional[/region] &amp;#10014;[/b]
[hr]We are a friendly region where you can publicly confess your sins. We welcome people from all religions to confess their sins. Even if you do not have any sins to confess, there are other things you may confess, such as mistakes and failures, or what you should have or should not have done. If you do not wish to publicly confess your sins, you may telegram me it, and I will bring comfort to you. This region is a wonderful way for you to get anything off of your chest. I only wish to comfort you so you can live a life sin-free. Have a wonderful day.
[hr][b][i]&#147;Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.&#148;[/i]
