[b][color=green]Green Africa[/color][/b], Father of the G.I. Revolution, is in (blissfully happy) exile in [b][region]Enadia[/region] [/b] as their Minister of Culture. He may return one day, so be aware that this region will most likely be refounded and, in that case, you may be getting another embassy request. Sorry for any inconvenience. That will of course be a looooong time from now!

This will, upon re-refounding, be a Semi-Direct Democracy based on the [b][url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vvHtifT1Ggu4rXUOppK8nQu4M7L9WlFziQ_9UFqMi8o/edit?usp=sharing]Green African Constitution[/url][/b].
