[u][b][color=#9e8406]Hey guys,[/color][/b][/u]

I&#146;m too busy to keep up with a region on NS. I&#39;ll still be on here, but region building has become an afterthought.

You can stay if you like but I&#39;d recommend finding a different (meaning not dying) region if you have not done so.

Thanks - GA
