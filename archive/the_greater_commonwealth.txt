[b]Welcome to [u]The Greater Commonwealth![/b][/u]

The aim of this faction is to grow it&#39;s might and dominance by invading and subduing other regions
through [u]raids[/u]. This goal and ability makes this region, regardless of it&#39;s current size, one of the
most powerful in the game. There are however others who will try to challenge our might, so look out, everybody could be an enemy.

Since [b]colonization[/b] of other regions is our goal, you are required to be a member of the [b]Word Assembly[/b] (WA) and endorse our leader [nation]Alpica[/nation].

Raid status: There are no raids currently planned, feel free to suggest a region that you would be interested in colonizing in the RMB or tell our leader  [nation]Alpica[/nation] through a telegram.
