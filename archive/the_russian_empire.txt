[b][color=red][region]The Russian Empire[/region], a region that glorified Imperialism, ceased to exist, and [i]was[/i] refounded by [region]Nazi Europe[/region] as a &amp;#39;satellite&amp;#39; of theirs to be used as a platform for hate.

[region]The Russian Empire[/region] has now been liberated from being a platform to spew hate for either the Imperialists or the Fascists in the name of anti-fascism and anti-imperialism by The Revolution of [nation=short]Red October[/nation] of [region]Antifa[/region], and is now an anti-imperialist and anti-fascist region.

The Red Banner of the Hammer and Sickle fly over the liberated remains of The Russian Empire, beginning in October. Historically fitting perhaps.[/b]
