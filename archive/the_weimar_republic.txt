[b][color=red]The Nazi &amp;#39;[nation=short]Madel koniggratzer[/nation]&amp;#39; also known as &amp;#39;[nation=short]Koniggratzer[/nation]&amp;#39; once occupied [region]The Weimar Republic[/region] on behalf of the Nazi region &amp;#39;[region]The Greater German Reich[/region]&amp;#39;.

But then he left, and the region ceased to exist.[/color][/b]

[b][region]The Internationale[/region] was happy to leave it at that, but then &amp;#39;[nation=short]Koniggratzer[/nation]&amp;#39; via a puppet spammed [region]The Internationale[/region]&amp;#39;s RMB,  and then wished to advise us while spam telegramming that we should be more active, and we thought &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right!&amp;quot;[/b]

[b][color=red]So [region]The Weimar Republic[/region] has been liberated from the Nazis and refounded, and will no longer be a place for Nazis to preach hate.[/color][/b]

[b]Thanks for the advice &amp;#39;[nation=short]Koniggratzer[/nation]&amp;#39;! *Thumbs up*[/b]
