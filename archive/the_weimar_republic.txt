The Nazi &amp;#39;Madel koniggratzer&amp;#39; also known as &amp;#39;Koniggratzer&amp;#39; once occupied The Weimar Republic on behalf of the Nazi region &amp;#39;The Greater German Reich&amp;#39;.

But then he left, and the region ceased to exist.

The Internationale was happy to leave it at that, but then &amp;#39;Koniggratzer&amp;#39; via a puppet spammed The Internationale&amp;#39;s RMB, and then wished to advise us while spam telegramming that we should be more active, and we thought &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right!&amp;quot;

So The Weimar Republic has been liberated from the Nazis and refounded, and will no longer be a place for Nazis to preach hate.

Thanks for the advice &amp;#39;Koniggratzer&amp;#39;! *Thumbs up*

Comrades! Forwards! And no forgetting! Solidarit&auml;tslied!
