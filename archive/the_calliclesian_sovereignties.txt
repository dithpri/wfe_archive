A new region, founded by men and women who feel that they are entitled to the sweat of their own brow, who feel that they may reap the benefits of their achievements, and who wish not to be bound by the shackles of Slave Morality and parasites. The teachings of Callicles, Smith, Nietzsche, and Rand are held dearly, and the only agreed-upon &amp;quot;deity&amp;quot; by the region is the Invisible Hand that guides the market and The Great Chain.  Beyond this, there are no gods or kings, only man.  
The nations of the region accept all, but frown upon fascist, communist, socialist, and religious governments, as well as social conservatism.
