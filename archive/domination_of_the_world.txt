One of three historical regions that merged into Invaders on the night of June 14, 2004. It was founded by Domination6, who would become a very prominent raider commander and diplomat, eventually being admitted to the Raider Hall of Fame in 2018.

[i][b]The Cause[/b]: Doing what is best for invading/raiding no matter of rank, region, or faction. This can apply to aiding another region when we are not on a mission or just recruiting to help spread the movement. In short, Do what is RIGHT for raiding, not for POWER or EGO.[/i]
