We are the Coalition of Ordered Governments, COG for short. We aim, as a region and individual nations, to be strong and powerful. What is said is the rule that every nation that enters here, until/if they leave, that all will follow. 

No dictatorships allowed.

All will be written in due time.

- Naviwind, Founder of the COG
