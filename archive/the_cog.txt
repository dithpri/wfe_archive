1) During times of crisis, it is imperative that you help your fellow allies in the region. Such as helping in case of nuclear war, a zombie outbreak, and the such. In a nation chooses not to help, then help they shall not receive next time. That nation will be left to fight for itself to show that they should, and must, help a fellow ally in this region. So that the next time when they have the chance to redeem themselves, they will be forgive if they do. If not, they shall be not be helped either.

This is one of many things that The Coalition of Ordered Governments shall follow. These are the rules of the lands that all will follow, there may be some leniency with some rules that may be written later.
