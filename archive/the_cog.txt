We are the Coalition of Ordered Governments. We know no fear because War, War is all we know. Those who dare infringe on our sovereignty shall, and will be punished with acts of War. No one will ever force their ideas on us, we will fight back until nothing is left. Even then we will continue to fight until our enemies are destroyed, or we are destroyed ourselves. We will not sit in silence any longer, it is our time to rise. It is time for others to fall. We recognize the sovereignty of the region called The Black Hawks as an aggressive and expansive state that we, the C.O.G, shall fight back.
