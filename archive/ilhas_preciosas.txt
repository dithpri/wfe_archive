In the South Atlantic, near the north-part of Brazil, the Preciosas Archipelago can be found. Composed of 3 main islands and 4 tiny others, they all have been part of the Portuguese colonial empire before gaining independence, giving birth to different little nations with some problem to live along one and other.
Primarily inhabited by descendants from Africans massively brought for slavery and varied little ethnic natives groups and Portuguese descendent.
