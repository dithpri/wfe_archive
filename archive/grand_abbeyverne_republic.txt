[color=red][b]Welcome to the Grand Abbeyverne Republic, NationStates&#39; premiere conservative haven![/b][/color]

Founded on April 22, 2021, we are devoted to small government and conservative values! We are active and, as a new region, are looking for those who will help us become the top region on NS! We hold frequent sporting events and other roleplays, and are currently forming our government. This means we are able to provide the option of government positions to new members!

We are holding elections for Prime Minister! Don&#39;t forget to vote! Please do not vote with puppets, or you may be removed from the region.

Also, we will be holding elections on the draft constitution, connected to our website (pinned below), immediately after PM elections.
