[b]About Our Region:[/b]

Founded on April 22, 2021, we are devoted to small government and conservative values! We are active and, as a new region, are looking for those who will help us become the top region on NS! We hold frequent sporting events and other roleplays, and are currently forming our government. This means we are able to provide the option of government positions to new members! Also, we don&#39;t require you to join offsite anything!

LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC!
