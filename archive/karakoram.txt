[color=black][b]Your region was an unfortunate victim of the fatal blades of [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region] and Hawks from the most feared [region]The Black Hawks[/region], After finishing off your local guardsmen in a nifty ambush out in the wilderness, we welcomed ourselves into the walls of your quaint regions and removed the foul leadership guiding you.
