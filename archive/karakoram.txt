A long time ago, there was a region called commuria, named after it&#39;s founder. this region grew quickly, and soon had a large population, but then, he dissapeared. he dissapeared leaving a Whole region. they soon made a new region, called alleghany, based on the virtues of democracy and republics. this group were great friends, and soon grew, as quickly as before, and was a mighty power. but then commuria came back. and we all went there, but something was forming, cracks. he left once more, and we were left alone, nomadic. but I saw this. and I want it to change. you can change this. just by joining us, you can bring us, a second generation of our group. thank you. thank you so, so much for even reading this. it truly makes my day. :)
