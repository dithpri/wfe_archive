The Isles of Garf are the area of the Middle Pacific ocean surrounding the Island of Garf, where the Democratic Republic of the Garfieldites exists peacefully. Founded in 2016 in a push for more sovereignty for the Garfieldites, as the people have become anxious to control as much of their lives as they can after years under the power of many other nations.
