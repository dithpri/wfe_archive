[b]It had been a quiet day in [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]the Nest[/url] until the Hawks heard some squeaking coming from the briefing room. After investigating, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] discovered that the rat [nation]Malphe[/nation] was chewing on all of Terra&#39;s files! The Hawks chased the rat, their chase taking them into different regions, before catching him and making the rat [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-4f_f_8h08]do a dance[/url] in order to regain his freedom.
