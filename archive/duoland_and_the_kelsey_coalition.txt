This is a region created for a family and their pet owl, but anyone and everyone is welcome to join, keeping in mind we are maintaining a family-friendly environment. Fans of Duo (the owl) and language learners are especially welcome to https://www.nationstates.net/region=duoland_and_the_kelsey_coalition. Its members will not be super active, and thus will (hopefully) create/foster a laid-back atmosphere. I hope you consider joining!
