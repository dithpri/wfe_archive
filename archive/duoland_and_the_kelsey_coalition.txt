This is a region created for a family and their pet owl, but anyone and everyone is welcome to join, keeping in mind we are maintaining a family-friendly environment. Fans of Duo (the owl) and language learners are especially welcome to [region]Duoland and the Kelsey Coalition[/region] Its members will not be super active, and thus will (hopefully) create/foster a laid-back atmosphere. I hope you consider joining!
