[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Captured: 12.08.14[/I]

[color=red]This formally fascist supporting region, whom had an alliance and embassy with [region]The Greater German Reich[/region], has been taken out of order by [region]The MT Army[/region].

It now serves as a living museum against hate. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
