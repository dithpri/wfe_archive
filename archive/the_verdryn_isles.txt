(Started by Democlesia)
A secluded but large series of islands, surrounded by endless ocean. The region has a long history of bloodshed between powerful civilizations and tribes. Due to separation from the rest of the world, technology has developed differently based on each nation. Example: Some nations prefer tank-like armors with swords, as opposed to traditional tanks and artillery.

(Every Nation possesses their own island within the Verdryn Isles.)
The Verdryn Isles contain examples of most biomes, but are known for mostly being covered in forests and jungles.
