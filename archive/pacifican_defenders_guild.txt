The [B]Pacifican Defenders Guild[/B] is the military group of [region]Pacifica[/region], temporarily housed in [region]Free Pacifica[/region]. 

We are a society of Defenders headed by our Grand Master. Currently [nation=short]Nessie[/nation] serves this role. The Guild is somewhat independent from the regional government, it was formed to carry out the foreign policy of the Free Republic of Pacifica, but its day to day operations, leadership, and structure are beyond the reach of the regional government. 

The Guild will be developed further in the future. 

If you have any questions address them to the acting Grand Master [nation=short]Nessie[/nation].
