Life is mysterious, you shall always seek the truth: 

 &#147;Whatever we are, whatever we make of ourselves, is all we will ever have&#151;and that, in its profound simplicity, is the meaning of life.&#148; &amp;#8213;Philip Appleman

&#147;Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can&#146;t help them, at least don&#146;t hurt them.&#148; &amp;#8213;The Dalai Lama

&#147;The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.&#148; &amp;#8213;Arnold Schwarzenegger

&#147;The ultimate aim of the human mind, in all its efforts, is to become acquainted with truth.&#148; &amp;#8213;Eliza Farnham

&#147;The man who is born with a talent which he is meant to use, finds his greatest happiness in using it.&#148; &amp;#8213;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
