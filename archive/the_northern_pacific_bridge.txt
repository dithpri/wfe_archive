Between the northernmost parts of Russia, stretching across the North of the Pacific Ocean, as well as some parts of the the Arctic, this frozen, rocky, and war-torn region was once the center of Communism in the World. Now, only few nations remain.

The Dictatorship of the People&amp;#39;s Republic of Imperialus is the largest of these nations, taking up half the area. It&amp;#39;s neighbor, Russia, often supports it in many of its agendas.

To the North-East is Khalvania, a new nation created in the sixties by Khalvish refugees. These two countries have had a blood-thirsty conflict, resulting in the loss of many lives on both parts.
