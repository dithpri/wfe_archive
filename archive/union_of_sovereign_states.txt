The Union of Sovereign States was created by the Socialist Union &amp;amp; regulated by the [color=steelblue]Northern/Southern Riders[/color] to unite sovereign nations who support liberty and freedom for their people. The Group of sovereign states aims to improve trade and communication between all member states. All members are considered sovereign and independent states within the [color=applered]Werewolves of the Flame[/color] mercenary corps, and the union will not infringe on state sovereignty. Any nation state is welcome. In Memory of [nation=short]Oflium[/nation]
