[color=#ff69b4]NPA Lieutenants [nation]9003[/nation] and [nation]Nimarya[/nation] heard rumors of an ancient and evil force lurking somewhere among the innocent regions of NationStates. Whispers tell that this dark power seizes regions and curses them to bear dull and dreary World Factbook Entries! Our heroes could not allow this to stand, so LTN [nation]9003[/nation] devised a cunning plan to sneak into each captive region under the cover of darkness in order to free them of their curse. LTN [nation]Nimarya[/nation] aided him in this plan, and together they repainted the dismal WFE&#146;s they came across, freeing 16 regions in total before daylight came.
