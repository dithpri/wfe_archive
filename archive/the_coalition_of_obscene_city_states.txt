Welcome, fellow City States. 

Do you feel oppressed by other states? Angry that they get many cities and you get just one? Did some jerk invade your land and leave you with only 66 million people? You are not alone.

City states are an under represented  bunch. We&amp;#39;re too small to defend ourselves, have no resources to offer and are easy to overthrow when your neighbours finally decide they&amp;#39;ve had enough of you running a nudist dictatorship. But if we band together, if we pool our populations, we might not be anything to sniff at.

So, let us band together and crush our enemies. Let us take back what is rightfully ours! Let us do to our populations what we wish whenever we want!
