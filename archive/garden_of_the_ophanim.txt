The Circle of Rainbow Light, officially Al-Wasilah, is a transcendental civilization-state spanning the dimensional thresholds of existence. It is both empire and revelation &#151; the visible expression of the Dream Weaver&#146;s divine will. Here, governance and divinity intertwine: the Supreme Collective of Light, chaired by Dream Weaver (&amp;#8759;&amp;#5515;&amp;#5303;&amp;#8759;&amp;#5515;&amp;#9869;&amp;#12522;&amp;#5283;&amp;#8376;&amp;#5515;), administers the realms of consciousness and material creation alike.
