We are [b][region]Magical Girls[/region][/b]!

[i]Once, we were all ordinary human adolescent girl during the development of secondary sexual characteristics ;then, we renounced this identity and took all possibilities as some only hope bet .
Thus, our Soul Gems shines with a light of power beyond humans.

However, according to the second law of thermodynamics, our power is finite, just as the universe cannot continue to expand indefinitely. 

But our hope does not die in the form of despair...[/i]
