COVERS are Life Fiber embodiments. They are responsible for the dissemination of Life Fibers throughout the world. The name &amp;quot;Revocs&amp;quot; is an anagram after them.

COVERS can roughly be separeted into two groups: cloth-form COVERS and human-form COVERS. Cloth-form COVERS needs to stay in contact with the original Life Fibers in order to stay active, but human-form COVERS have absorbed a human being as an energy source and through that they can operate autonomously
