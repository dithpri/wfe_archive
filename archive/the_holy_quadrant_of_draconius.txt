Being a sect of space that&amp;#39;s isolated from most other regions in space, the Holy Quadrant is a sect of planets and moons undergoing an experimental procedure known as Terraforming, or restructuring a planet to suit the needs of it&amp;#39;s people. As the Holy Empire of Almainite is dominant in this region, it attempts to uplift any people that wish to join in its ranks. We allow any nation to outside of the region join, and we encourage role play between nations and their heads. As we are new, currently, Interstellar Warfare is not permitted, and any other kind of warfare is currently not allowed. Skirmishes between nations is allowed, along with sports playing, and other things are encouraged.
