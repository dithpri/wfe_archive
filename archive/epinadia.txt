Bringing back the dead, one step at a time.

For some context, Epinadia was an old region created by followers (including I) of Cresium Mapping&#39;s History of Epinadia series. Even Cresium was there. Then a large war rocked the region, and caused it to collapse. New Epinadia was formed out of the remnants of the region, but I decided to form Epinadia again with the old name. Long Live Queen Cresium! Long Live Epinadia!
