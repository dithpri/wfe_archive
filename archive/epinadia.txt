Epinadia was a region based upon the mapping series &quot;History of Epinadia&quot; by small-time Croatian creator &quot;Cresium Mapping,&quot; of which the series is no longer in use. Originally the region was ran by Cresium themself, but over time Cresium became bored of NationStates and left, leading to the founding of [region]New Epinadia[/region]. The new region prospered until the end of 2020, in which it entered stagnation and subsequently died. This region had a long, fruitful history that while many may consider short by NationStates time, still left a lasting impact on my ([nation]Mardatan[/nation]) view of NationStates.
