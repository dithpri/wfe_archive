The Yonderlands are a large region in the literal middle of no where. It is formally defined as being the combined territory of all the Yonderlandic nations. A Yonderlandic nation is defined as being a nation within the Yonderlands. So it&amp;#39;s shaped like itself, basically.

Be noted that this is not one of your kindergarten regions where everone cooperates with no trouble. In our region, it&amp;#39;s like 19th century Europe.  Everyone hates each other and alliances are made of sand.
