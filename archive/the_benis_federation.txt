[region]The Benis Federation[/region] is a sovereign state operating out of it&#39;s capital, La Paz. Led by it&#39;s fierce leader, The Crown Benite, the staunch Catholic Federal Consitutional Monarchy increases it&#39;s reach around the world as new colonies are founded daily. The push to find these new lands has been spearheaded by the first Supreme Lord Chancellor, Melvar, and his colony of [nation]Leoxing[/nation]. With it&#39;s sucess the Crown Benite appropriated funds and the lands that would become [nation]Wycome[/nation] were found.

People native to these colonies have the chance to become full fledged Benites, citizens of the Federation, and participate fully in the government. The colonies themselves are currently ruled by govenors appointed by The Crown Benite. Our National currency is The Fug.
