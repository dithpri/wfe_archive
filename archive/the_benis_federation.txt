[region]The Benis Federation[/region] is a sovereign state operating out of its capital, La Paz. Led by The Crown Benite, the powerful nation increases it&#39;s reach around the world as new colonies are founded daily. The push to find these new lands has been spearheaded by the first Supreme Lord Chancellor, Melvar, and his colony of [nation]Leoxing[/nation]. With it&#39;s success the crown appropriated funds and the colony of [nation]Wycome[/nation] was founded.
