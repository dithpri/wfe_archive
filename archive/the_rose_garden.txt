Welcome to The Rose Garden, a serene backdrop for international and international discussion.  To participate all you need is for your region to have an embassy with us, or to move into the region to become a flower of the Garden.  All Embassy Requests are accepted, though be warned, if the nations of your region constantly cause trouble in the garden your embassy may be taken down.
