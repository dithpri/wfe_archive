We are the home of NationState&amp;#39;s first Interregional Message Board (IRMB) where nations from across the world may engage in casual coversation and have fun without worries of staying on topic or having to sign up on a third party forum.  All that is required to participate is that your home region have an embassy with us, and all embassy requests will be accepted.

Does your home region already have an embassy with us?  Then find a comfortable part of the garden, and feel free to get in on the conversation!

[i]Have an idea for this factbook?  Then post it on the IRMB or telegram [nation=short]the lady of roses[/nation] and it will be considered.[/i]
