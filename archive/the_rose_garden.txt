With beautiful and fragrant roses, as far as the eye can see, the rose garden is considered one of the most tranquil regions in the world.  While roses are the most popular plant here, all sorts of plants are welcome, and add to the beauty of the garden.

Come, and enjoy the roses.  Perhaps say hi on the regional message board.  We don&amp;#39;t take ourselves too serious here, but we love the company.
