[b][color=purple]What&amp;#39;s [i]up[/i], Fash? :D
Here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s up.[/color]

[color=darkred]The GGR&amp;#39;s [nation=short]Aryan Shield Command[/nation] (the brother of Brooke Shields?) refounded[/color] [region]New China Politburo[/region] [color=darkred]and claimed it was now a GGR colony.[/color][/b]

[b][color=green]That lasted all of 28 days, because it&amp;#39;s one thing to refound a region Fash, it&amp;#39;s quite another to hold on to it.[/color][/b]

[b][color=blue]How [i]very[/i] inept. &amp;#39;The Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&amp;#39; just got shot [i]down.[/i]
[/color][/b]

[b][color=gold]The Fash got caught with their lederhosen down. [i]again.[/i][/color][/b]

[b][color=black]Seriously, you could only hold this region for 28 days? ;)[/color]
