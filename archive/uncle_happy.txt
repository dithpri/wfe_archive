Uncle Happy started off in 2004 as a radical experiment by scientist Dylan Pukeman to create a self-sufficient city built on a floating platform. Together with his assistants, they raised the first &quot;batch&quot; of workers to perform maintenance functions for the city, and expanded the platform to accommodate the workers. As the new nation gained more citizens, the Happy Patrol was created to keep them in line. Finally, Uncle Happy opened its doors to foreign investors and tourists, resulting in massive technological advancement and revenue. What was a small population experiment is now the Happiest Place in the Universe.
