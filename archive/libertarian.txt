[b][color=red][region]Libertarian[/region] has been liberated by [region]The Founderless Regions Alliance[/region] and various allies.[/color][/b]

It is my intent to transition power to a new delegate after a period of transition.

Per our agreement it is my intent, during the transition period, to:
1) allow all embassies withdrawn by [nation]Vlad Farewell[/nation] to expire before sending any further embassy requests.
2) not cancel embassies under construction during [nation]Vlad Farewell[/nation]&amp;#39;s tenure.
3) not make any embassy requests to regions which are known members of [region]REATO[/region].

In order to better defend our region, I ask those nations that are able and willing to join the WA, and those that can&amp;#39;t but still want to help, move to [region]Libertarian Capitalist Zone 716[/region].
