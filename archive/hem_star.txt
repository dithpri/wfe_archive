A short time ago, in a region far, far away....

It is a period of civil war. Rebel
spaceships, striking from a hidden
base, have won their first victory
against the evil Anumian Empire.

During the battle, rebel spies managed
to steal secret plans to the Empire&amp;#39;s
ultimate weapon, the HEM Star, an
armored space station with enough
red tape to destroy fun forever.

Pursued by the Empire&amp;#39;s sinister agents,
Princess Lethen races home aboard her
starship, custodian of the stolen plans
that can save her people and restore
nonsense to the galaxy...
