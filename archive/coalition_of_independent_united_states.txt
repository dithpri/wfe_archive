As great powers arise so do great allies. The Coalition of Independent United States (CIUS) was founded on the ideal that those who wished to remain powerful must combine what they have to defend against those that are more powerful than they are. Every member of this coalition are expected to uphold a strong state of military readiness, economic fortitude, and higher thought.
