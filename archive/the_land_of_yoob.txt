Listen here! If you oppose the council you will meet a swift demise. If you oppose our nations you will meet a world of pain. And if you oppose our region, you will witness everything you love and once loved be reduced to atoms.

We are bound together with the same force that bonds titanium and tungsten. breaking that bond would require the force of a million men.

Steel forged and tempered in the blazing fires of war and hardened in the cold of winter.

We are a region of steel with no impurities. We will fight back! challenge at your own risk ...
