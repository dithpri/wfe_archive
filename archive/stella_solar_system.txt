Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only five planets and seventeen moons governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Tired of the cold, feeling let down because your homeland uses the shackles of oppression so much that you want to escape, or just want to explore your wildest fantasies, then look no further than here because we&#39;re in tourism season now! We are currently accepting refugee and new arrivals near and far from October 15 to November 30 at 12AM EST.
