Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: I should remind whatever is left of that hostile multiverse of theirs every day that I am still active and strong.

We are now back down even further to [color=orange]Condition Orange.[/color] The Lucian government is now seeking demilitarization but is on standby for any future on-call emergencies, as the government shutdown is now over.
