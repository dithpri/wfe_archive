Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: Somehow, it looks like as if this region is going to fall under international pressure as we&#39;re about to go into the deepest pit of misery as all current RPs have been halted including the provincial elections until it goes away. We&#39;re down to [color=red]Condition Red[/color], but with one exception is that we are uniting all anime species against the issue and in response all funding goes to military with haste.
