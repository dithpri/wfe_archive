Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: 100th Anniversary of Lucia is today, we survived! However, the pollution interferes our ability to do a proper celebration, so instead we&#39;ll just put the music blaring on radios instead. Still in [color=red]Condition Red[/color] though.
