Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Condition Red is in effect until further notice.
