Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: I should remind whatever is left of that hostile multiverse of theirs every day that I am still active and strong.

We are now back down to [color=red]Condition Red.[/color] Lucia is now recovering from the recent major losses, having achieved maximum attrition and thus can no longer fight. Miya Konohana wishes to demilitarize the whole force as I have fulfilled her predecessor&#39;s promise she wants.
