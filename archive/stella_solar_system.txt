Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

We are now in [color=red]Condition Red.[/color] The Chasers are back, no time for further explanation of what they want from us, it is time to push them to extinction. All allies of SSS, this is the final push.
