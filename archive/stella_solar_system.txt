Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: I should remind whatever is left of that hostile multiverse of theirs every day that I am still active and strong.

We are now under a [color=tan]Condition Yellow.[/color] The Lucian government is currently demilitarizing the force and diverting its funds very slowly away from the military branches into rebuilding efforts.
