Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: Conventional tactics and logistics is thrown out of the window, THIS IS NOT A DRILL! ALL ALLIES OF STELLA, TO BATTLESTATIONS! We&#39;re in [color=magenta]Condition Magenta![/color]
