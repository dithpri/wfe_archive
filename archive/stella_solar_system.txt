Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only five planets and seventeen moons governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Empress Miya Konohana: [i]&quot;We have shocking news to all citizens of Stella; the Scarlet Dominion has been defeated by the rebels before we even have time to mobilize! We can now oversee the trial that should result in a death penalty. Excellent work thanks to [nation]Makai Nature Daughter Flora[/nation]. All military branches stand down! I repeat, stand down!&quot;[/i]

As part of [nation]Anime North America[/nation]&#39;s favor, the Lucians are defending the planet against [region]ISIL[/region].
