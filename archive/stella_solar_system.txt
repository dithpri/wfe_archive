Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

We are now in Condition Orange. Our military is still on high alert for any future intruders, will not engage until being noticed further by the Department of Internal Defense Agency. The pursuit is called off for now, but we are mounting the reinforcements.
