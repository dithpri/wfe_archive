Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: We&#39;re still in [color=red]Condition Red[/color], please be on the lookout for raider and Touhou affiliated nations on sight. We are still feeling very tense with our common enemies around.
