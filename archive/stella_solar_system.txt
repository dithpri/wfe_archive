Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: We&#39;re still in [color=magenta]Condition Magenta[/color] even as we are just starting our provincial elections, so don&#39;t try spying or sabotaging our emissary campaigns while we&#39;re at it. All allies of Stella, remain [i]extremely[/i] vigilant until further notice. Miya should expect a friendly welcoming from one of Erica&#39;s new acquaintances.
