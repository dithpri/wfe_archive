Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only five planets and seventeen moons governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

As part of [nation]Anime North America[/nation]&#39;s favor, the Lucians are defending the planet against [region]ISIL[/region].
