Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: We&#39;re down to a [color=magenta]Condition Magenta[/color] since we&#39;re now focusing back on Scarlet, raiders are not welcome in our region starting today and we will start hindering their infiltration efforts within our embassies to be on high alert for them.
