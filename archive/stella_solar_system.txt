Welcome to our humble homeworld, known as the Stella Solar System, or &quot;SSS&quot; for short. Here, we are located 200 light years from our NS Earth, set in a distant future timeline. There are only three planets and just one moon governed by our star Lua, a small yellowish star.

Notice: The insurgency attempt by [nation]Lyretano[/nation] has finally stopped, quelled, and contained by L.I.T.E. forces, and with no further threats towards our planet or the region itself, Demura Isono has lowered the alert level system down to a [color=Red]Condition Red[/color]. However, there are still spies in our embassies, so we may have to send a small L.I.T.E. squadron to tackle this problem one by one.
