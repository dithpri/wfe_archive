[color=black]This holy region is tended by Sufi devotees. 
We ask only love and compassion for all humanity.

The subject tonight is Love.

It happens all the time in heaven,
And some day it will begin to happen again on earth -[/color]

[url=https://youtu.be/MIUlEo9XxuI][color=black]That men and women who are married,
And men and men who are Lovers,
And women and women
Who give each other Light,

Often will get down on their knees
And while so tenderly 
Holding their lover&#39;s hand,
With tears in their eyes,
Will sincerely speak, saying,[/color][/url]

How can I be more loving to you;
How can I be more kind?[/color][/url]
