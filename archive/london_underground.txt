&amp;quot;There is a good service on all London Underground lines.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Hello, I am the captain of your train, and we will be departing shortly, we will be cruising at an altitude of approximately zero feet, and our scheduled arrival time in Aldgate is 3:15pm. The temperature in Aldgate is approximately 15 degrees celsius, and Aldgate is in the same time zone as Amersham, so there&amp;#39;s no need to adjust your watches.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;When departing the train may I remind you to take your rubbish with you. Despite the fact that you are in something that is metal, fairly round, filthy and smells, this is a tube train for public transport and not a bin on wheels.&amp;quot;
