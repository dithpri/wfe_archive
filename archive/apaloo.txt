apaloo a region for the people of the horse and their allies. a region friendly to the great horse nomads but city dwellers and capitalists and destroyers of all thing good ant true are forewarned. lustful greedy destruction will be stomped out. we laugh at those who try to oppose the wind by trying to anchor down and not be blown away. why cause needles pain and suffering on yourself when you can ride the wind. 
those who oppress the needy the weak and innocent, those who destroy mythical creatures and horses for no reason hear you will meat your destruction
