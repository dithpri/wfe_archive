Apaloo is a beutiful region, home to many kinds of equine animals. The horse who&amp;#39;s will cannot be broken. the pegasus sores freely, who&amp;#39;s spirit can not be tamed. the unicorn pure and wild a formidable foe. these are the three gardians of apaloo. We welcome the fellow nomads solong as they come in peace and good will. but if you come to ravage and kill, wether you an industrialest of a rider, we will fight and we will be victorius! and to those who are riders and attack the heard you shal be cast out. so take head.

. Rapachi: pegasus: warrior
. B.R. Preussen: unicorn: religion
