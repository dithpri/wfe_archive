We are a union for the people, by the people, and of the people. You may be intrigued by the name, but this is named for our leader, [nation]Seconde[/nation]. We respect every ideology &amp; [i]anyone[/i] can run for office or create a political party. We are one, &amp; we are all.
P.S. The Union was created by puppets, which show our push to democracy. Also, we like you to keep your civil rights average &amp; above,, but you can choose. It is discouraged though.
