How many of you like that game series Fallout? Well I do and I bet some of you do too. This region is bassicly going to be Roleplaying without dumb old offsite fourms. I think that this would be a fun region  if people joined it. I have been trying to find a active Fallout region for quite some time and finnaly made my own. If you join this region I would like it if you asked people to join this region or send recruiting messages. But their are rules. No godmoding. No trolling. No throwing tauntrums. Be respectful. And have fun!
