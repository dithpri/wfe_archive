[b]Hello and Welcome to the great land of Cethoris![/b] This is a new region and it is currently not that big. We here at Cethoris like to have fun, you can roleplay and be very serious, or just play the game and be silly. If you think you can become an officer, then please telegram [nation]Tern Wehausnan[/nation]. If you have any suggestions for this region, please type it in the RMB! Also remember to endorse [nation]Gurvanea[/nation] because it is the founder&#39;s other account, to maintain and observe the region. 

[u]NOTE: Please follow basic rules such as no bullying, no slurs, no toxicity, no harassment, and etc. you get it. [/u]

So enjoy your stay here at [b]CETHORIS! [/b]
