[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

Another holding of the now dead ally [region]IMPERIAL EARTH[/region] that I decided I would save from the clutches of evil. The name of the region refers to a socialist newspaper which was the official party paper of the East German government during The Cold War, yuck. This region was a holding of that evil-doer [nation]Freien[/nation] before [region]IMPERIAL EARTH[/region] acquired it, all the more reason to hold onto this! MT Army and others beware!
