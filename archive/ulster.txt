[color=yellow]Ulster and Northern Ireland[/color]

[color=red]Northern Ireland is in the northern part of the island of Ireland, being six of the nine counties of Ulster. It is politically separate from its southern neighbor, the Republic of Ireland which includes the other three counties of Ulster. 
The citizens of Northern Ireland have always wished to stay part of the UK, not wishing to join the Catholic Republic of Ireland. [/color]
[color=blue]Ulster is now peaceful, in part thanks to the rock group &quot;The Cranberries&quot; and the song &quot;Zombie&quot; which is credited with waking both sides up to the never ending foolishness of their fighting.[/color]
