[b][color=red]Hello. We are the People&#39;s Revolutionary Air Force. [i]You may have heard of us.[/i][/color] [color=purple]We&#39;re joined by the Royal Kantrian Army on this very special guest episode of [i][u]FASH BASH![/u][/i][/color][/b]

[b][i]Your association with, and praise of, fascists has been noted. This region will be appropriated into more deserving hands. 
Whether you learn the lesson, or are taught it by force, it will remain potent as ever: [u]bigots don&#39;t get frontiers.[/u][/i][/b][hr]Please endorse the Delegate ([nation]MKH Gyrfalcon Squadron[/nation]), and [b][u]ALL[/u][/b] regional officers, or you will politely be asked to leave this rightful territory of the Republic of Ireland. The fate of this region is currently being deliberated behind closed doors, but rest assured: [i]the previous occupants won&#39;t get it.[/i]
