[b][color=red]Ulster - Northern Ireland[/color][/b]

[color=red][i]Northern Ireland is the northern part of the island of Ireland, politically separate and largely ethnically and religiously separate from its southern neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. The citizens of Northern Ireland have always wished to stay part of the UK, not wishing to join the Republic of Ireland. After the Troubles, a bloody conflict fought between Nationalists, Loyalists and the British Army, resentment still runs high, especially along religious lines, but the land of Ulster is now peaceful, under careful Westminster guidance, with IRA terrorists no longer tolerated.
