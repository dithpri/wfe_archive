[color=greem][b]Welcome to the youngboy region[/b][/color] 
[hr]
Shortly after the arrest of NBA youngboy on march 23rd 2021, there was unrest among youngboy fans. Many of them went into grieving while some went to make a new society, hoping that surrounding themself with likeminded people would ease their pain. They found this area of unclaimed land. After some discussion they dubbed it the &quot;youngboy region&quot; which is still under debate today. With lush green forests, fresh water from lakes and nice beaches this was the perfect place to make a society. With many debates the youngboy region has now been opened to outsiders and non youngboy fans because many thought this great area should be shared with all.
