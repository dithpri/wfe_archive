[b][color=blue]Welcome to Densetsu no Kuraen[/color][/b]


Taking its naming cue from its founder [nation]Da-arkphyre[/nation], Densetsu no Kuraen can be translated to &amp;#39;Legend of Dark Flame&amp;#39;.  Founded on October 17, 2011, Kuraen -as the region is commonly referred to- is a safehaven for dragons.

Other dragon-loving nations are welcomed with open arms...provided they first seek approval from either [nation=short+noflag]Da-arkphyre[/nation] or [nation=short+noflag]Firewing[/nation] and agree to do everything they say.
