The Anglo-Atlantic Assembly is a group of islands to the West of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.
In the northern lands belonging to Algoraxia, northern lights can be glanced upon in the dead of winter, while in the southern lands owned primarily by RobinMask, Spanish summers often roast the nation, and make for excellent holiday destinations.
Boring is a word that can hardly be used for the Anglo-Atlantic Assembly, with a vivid history and rich culture and weather which can change as quickly as the tide, the Anglo-Atlantic Assembly may be the place for you to visit next.
