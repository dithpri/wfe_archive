Situated in the North Atlantic ocean, and influenced very much by Britain and its culture, the Anglo-Atlantic Assembly is a group of relatively small countries, seeing many weather changes throughout the year, from a Nordic Winter to a Spanish Summer and all seasons between. However, the region&amp;#39;s environmental beauty and breathtaking night skies are unparalleled.
Founded by Stillemark, a nation renowned for peace and reconciliation, the Anglo-Atlantic Assembly prides itself on striving for world peace, and sees each country as their friend and brother.
