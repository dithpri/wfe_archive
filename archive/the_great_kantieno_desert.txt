A sprawling desert that is home to only the strongest of nations. Vietrosha lies in the heart of The Great Kantieno Desert within the Gentile Oasis. Although being the first to find and claim the oasis Vietroshians have only claimed a fraction of the giant oasis. Living on the border of the oasis Vietroshians have built there society and are willing to share land with other nations, for a price. The heavily guarded parameter is a death trap to foes who think they can take on the the Vietroshian military, or the Demons of the Desert. Only those who follow Vietroshian law may enter and live within the borders. Send a telegram to the Vietroshians if you think your an able bodied nation and want to join the Vietroshian alliance.
