[b]Skaia[/b] is the world that the players of [i]Sburb[/i] must build toward in order to win the game. It resides at the core of [b][region]The Incipisphere[/region][/b], sort of like its &amp;#39;sun&amp;#39;.

At its center is a region known as [b]The Battlefield[/b], and it is here that the war between the [b][color=#ffae00]Army of Light[/color][/b] and the [b][color=#850097]Army of Darkness[/color][/b] takes place. While [b][color=#850097]Derse[/color][/b] seeks to destroy Skaia, the armies of [b][color=#ffae00]Prospit[/color][/b] hope to preserve it.
