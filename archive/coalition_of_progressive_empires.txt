The Coalition of Progressive Empires (COPE) is an organization of imperial nations with similar laws and ideology. Members of COPE must abide by twelve charters outlined [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lkbKJ1tOZRsVIhtsk_7_cIFUcaU2lTuXH8a_1nFoAcI/edit]here[/url]

Here&amp;#39;s our [url=http://copelegislature.freeforums.net/index.cgi]House of Delegates Forum[/url] where we debate and vote on proposed legislation. 

Members not abiding by the charters will be held before the House. A decision to ban must be decided by a two thirds majority. That being said, all are welcome. Join us!
