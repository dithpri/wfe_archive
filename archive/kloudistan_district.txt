This is a small region dedicated to the mentally stable members of the PartlyKloudy community. The overlord of the entire region is called &quot;host&quot;, and there are several factions, including the Fartlys, who are currently in charge of the Theocracy of Kloudia, and the capital city of Partly Rome.
