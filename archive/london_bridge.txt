London Bridge is one of the most famous bridges over the Thames in London. Fame stems from the fact that it is the oldest river crossing in the city and that it occurs in a well-known English nursery rhyme (&amp;quot;London Bridge is falling down&amp;quot;). The bridge is often confused with the Tower Bridge, which indeed looks much more impressive. The current London Bridge is a simple, modern bridge built in 1973.
