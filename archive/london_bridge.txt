[color=#a62232]When you are crossing a bridge that goes to another region, there are some important things to remember.[/color]
[color=#B92638]Always be sure there are no raiders under your bridge. If there is, approach with caution because raiders are devious creatures.[/color]
[color=#c03b4b]Don&#39;t forget to check if your bridge is safe to cross. If it is not safe to cross, you will end up in the Rejected Realms.[/color]
[color=#c7515f]After you are certain that your bridge is safe to cross and has no raiders under it, you may cross the bridge.[/color]
