Greetings, travellers, here is a glimpse of the quiet corner known as Garchetts Marsh. In it resides a small fleet of nations known for general peace and prosperity. 

Nothing much happens here, so your stay if requested shall only be brief. 

Remember, do not try and look back upon memories, for they are only bitter. Peace is stored in the here and now. 

Goodnight.
