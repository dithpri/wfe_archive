Welcome to The Northern Outskirts. This is a region that welcomes all nation types&#151;even stupid ones&#151;and doesn&#39;t pressure them to get involved in anything. We expect nothing of you but outward civility and the occasional dozen donuts.

This is meant to be something of an RP region, but if you want to just park your nation here and do nothing but login once every 27 days, that&#39;s fine too.

Offsite forums can be found [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Northern_Outskirts]here[/url]. However, participation in the forums is entirely unnecessary to participate in important regional matters.

And finally, we can into space.
