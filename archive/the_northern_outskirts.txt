[color=#2f2f4f][b][i]THE NORTHERN OUTSKIRTS[/i][/b][/color] [color=#0a0a0a][b][i]~ Cold tundra, hot donuts[/i][/b][/color]

[color=grey][i]In a mysterious land, covered in frost, only the strong survive. Many nations have risen, trying to subdue the wilderness. Many have fallen.[/i][/color]

For real though, this region is basically an artifact of younger, edgier days. You&#39;re welcome to stay and help yourself to the donuts. You could even build a community here, if you felt so inclined.

[i][color=dimgrey]We have a Discord. It is very dead. TG the founder if you want in anyway.[/color][/i]
