Welcome to The Northern Outskirts. This is a region that welcomes all nation types&#151;even stupid ones. We expect nothing of you but outward civility and the occasional dozen donuts.

This is meant to be something of an RP region, but participation should by no means be considered necessary.

And we can into space.
