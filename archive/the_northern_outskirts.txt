[color=grey][i]In a mysterious land, covered in frost, only the strong survive. Many nations have risen, trying to subdue the wilderness. Many have fallen.

Welcome to The Northern Outskirts. We do things. Mostly we eat donuts.
A meritocratic and still very much developing region, we are always looking for newcomers who are willing to dedicate their time and talents to the region. Join today and get involved, and you just might find yourself wielding some power...
