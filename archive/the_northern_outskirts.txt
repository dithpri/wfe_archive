Welcome to the Northern Outskirts, home of a bunch of laid-back players who just want to play the game and eat donuts. In our isolated existence, the...&quot;curious&quot; members of the community thrive. 

The Outskirts has zero expectations and few rules, as detailed in the dispatch below. We have an offsite forum, but we don&#39;t care if you join. The moment you click &quot;Move &amp;lt;nation&amp;gt; to The Northern Outskirts&quot;, you are a full member of the region. (Which honestly doesn&#39;t do much since the founder is a dictator. c:)
