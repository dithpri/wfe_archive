A special region for fans of WA resolutions and regional polls everywhere!

Residence is not required to vote in our poll, but if you wanna park a puppet here anyway, that would be cool. All votes are public and will be carefully scrutinized. To prevent cheating, [u]only votes from WA nations will be counted[/u].

TRUE democracy comes to the WA but once a year! Don&#39;t waste your chance. Vote and be heard! End communication.
