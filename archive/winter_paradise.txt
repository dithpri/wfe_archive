This region is a semi-democratic region that is run by the Dictatorship of Osieana and the Democratic Republic of Shamolia. Elections are only held when someone puts forward a vote of no confidence and elections are held for two days and after the elections no one can challenge that person for one month. The flag that is in the corner has ten gold stars. Each star represents each position that controls the region. The blue represents valor, the red represents strength, the white represents purity and the gold of the stars represents bravery. The region in the center is Winter Paradise
