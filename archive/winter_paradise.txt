This region is a semi-democratic region that is run by the Dictatorship of Osieana and the Democratic Republic of Shamolia. Elections are only held when someone puts forward a vote of no confidence and elections are held for two days and after the elections no one can challenge that person for one month. The flag that is in the corner has twelve stars. Each star represents each position that controls the region. The black represents strength, the red represents valor, and the gold of the stars represents bravery.
