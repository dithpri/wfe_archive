Before the existence of Time and the Universe its self was Terry. Terry did not exist in the form of any living being. He was like a spirit, indescribable in the words of any language of the race of mortal Men. Terry&#39;s first creation was the Sun and his wife the Moon. They were the first of the Gods. They were the eldest and greatest of the Gods, save Lord Terry himself. The Sun and Moon created a child, the Earth. The Earth created its wife the Oceans. They had many children, the most important being the Elder Three. The Great Tree, the Chief Wolf, and the First Man.
