The United States of Liberty Nations is a cultured nation, renowned for its rights to vote, civil rights , public floggings, and keen interest in strengthening our nations to become one. The hard-nosed, hard-working, democratic, devout population define our nations.Liberty&#39;s national animal is the rattlesnake(used to strike fear into the British during the United States revolutionary war). We are a group of nations founded by a simple act of liberty and those that uphold its glory. Never forget the national motto, non sibi sed patriae(meaning not for self but country). May liberty always strive in the hearts of our nations.
