For a study group in politics.

Outsiders: Please don&#146;t telegram anyone inside the region. Do not attempt to enter the region if I don&#146;t let you. If someone in this group provides you the password, telegram [nation]The new region[/nation] and it will be handled.

Insiders: We will be doing something on here once a week at the least, but this will fluctuate as we move throughout the course. Please do not leave the region, provide its password to anyone, or change things without permission. You may browse the forums, but if you get in trouble with moderation, that privilege will be restricted. We will not be interacting with the World Assembly directly, though its resolutions will be apart of some units.
