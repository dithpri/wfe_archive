United States of Democratic Freedom. 

As one region full of nations, we are here to allow freedom in all aspects of life. You can live how you want without being judged, you can speak without being put down by a harsh government, you vote without being ridiculed. You can simply do what you want as long as it obeys the rules of the region and the rules of the World Assembly.

So, enjoy life and live here.
