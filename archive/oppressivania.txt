This is a grand land famed for the corrupt, overlarge, oppressive governments that rule each land. The massive and foreboding walls between each nation keep the people from escaping from the hands of one grand dictator to the clutches of the next. In this nation, everyone wins, as long as you are in power. If you aren&#39;t, prepare for the a long, grueling life with all of your benefits belonging to your leader.
