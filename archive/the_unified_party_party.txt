One Party. One huge, freakin party.
We at the Unified Party Party are all about peace, love, and understanding. We let the people decide what they think the best coats of action is, and have no armed forces. Our security system is top notch, though. The only drugs allowed are black drugs (coffee), as you don&amp;#39;t need them to have a good time. Parties are fun. Unified Party Parties are more fun.
