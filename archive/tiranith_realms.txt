The Tiranith Realms is a region of small Continents and islands right off the coast of the SimTropican mainland created by the SimTropican titans to be a place for like minded nations seeking full self governance and nationalist sovereignty. This Region of dimensional space is open for nations seeking to get away from oppressive and autocratic globalism where self governance is protected.
