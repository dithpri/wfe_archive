The [region]Assemblee des Messires[/region] was founded in 2021 following the establishment of the very democratic and socialist constitution of its member nations. On April 21, a delegation of Messires arrived at the Chateau. They came to request Charles to accept the title of monarch of the Assembly. The Assembl&eacute;e des Messires was founded and became one of the very first Monarcho-Socialist region.
