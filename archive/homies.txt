It&#146;s in theater now...coming this summer:

Two brothers, in a van,
And then a meteor hits,
And they ran as fast as they could from giant cat monsters,
And then a giant tornado came and that&#146;s when things got knocked into 12th gear.
A Mexican armada shows up with weapons made from tomatoes.
And you&#39;d better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business.
In: ALIEN INVASION TOMATO MONSTER MEXICAN ARMADA BROTHERS WHO ARE JUST REGULAR BROTHERS RUNNING IN A VAN FROM AN ASTEROID AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS THE MOVIE.

It&#146;s two brothers and it&#133;and..and they&#146;re gonna&#133;it&#146;s called TWO BROTHERS. It&#39;s just called Two Brothers&#133;
