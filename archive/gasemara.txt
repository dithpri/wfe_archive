A tiny region in the Western Hemisphere, this region is struggling to recover from a major conflict that led to the region nearly descending into anarchy 15 years ago. The region is rich in oil, steel, coal, and other resources, but the major regional power, the Commonwealth of Norilova, is reluctant to export or import any products outside Gasemara, or have any contact with nations outside the region, for fear of instability stemming from such contact.
