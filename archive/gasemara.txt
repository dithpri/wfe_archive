A tiny region in the Western Hemisphere, this region, especially the Democratic Republic of Norilova, has recovered quite well from a major civil war involving nuclear weapons that led to the region nearly descending into anarchy 15 years ago. The region is rich in oil, steel, coal, and other resources, but the new major regional power, the Democratic Republic of Norilova, is very much isolationist, preferring instead to build up the military so as to enforce its will over the region.
