&amp;quot;Vincit qui patitur&amp;quot; - Persius. 
This house as a mere look is a normal house, but courage and determination of the soldiers that entrenched inside made it a fortress ( the German did marked this place -Pavlov&amp;#39;s House- in their map as a fortress). We gather here because we will fight to the last gasp, no matter the odds, no matter the shortage of supplies, no matter the casualties as long as the enemies are attacking us, we shall neither surrender nor give up this place, because  &amp;quot;For us there was no land beyond (the) Volga&amp;quot; - comrade Vasily Zaitsev.
