G&#39;day! This is a region, that houses a planned casual roleplay. Currently it&#39;s under the works of only one person and is planned to be set during the early years of the Victorian Era (possibly starting in the year 1850).

Currently, the region is password protected, as this is only a casual rp and is not expected to take off. But, if interest arises and if people wish to join, there will be a discussion into making this a proper roleplay community.
