Hello! This is a new roleplay region set in the Victorian Era. We have run a similar rp, but circumstances... &quot;forced&quot; us to move and found a new region. So here it is! Crown of Victoria, a roleplay set in the Victorian Era. Feel free to join if you like chatting and roleplaying!

The roleplay is already up and running so feel free to join! We also have a discord server, where you can meet most, if not, all of the current players as well as the mods! We also host game nights if anyone is interested in some casual gameplay.
