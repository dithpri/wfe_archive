[hr][hr][color=#8c2328]In order to rise from its own ashes, a phoenix first must burn. After the downfall of [region]Northern Redlands[/region] on Christmas Day of 2018, the very Redlandians who have initially discovered the region return to uphold and bolster the region&#39;s once proud legacy. [region]New Northern Redlands[/region] continues the freedom, liberty, and creativity that the first Northern Redlands first built. Today, [region]Redlandia[/region] serves as a puppet storage region.[/color]
