[b]The Hawks and EPSAns soared through Chinese skies today, as the smog was so incredibly thick that it slowed time to 50% speed! The poor birds returned home after a bout of raiding, with a newfound sympathy for the Top G as they find several tumors in their lungs from the polluted air. May their recovery be as quick as their mental decay during this operation! Mashallah!
