[b]This region was founded on the 24th of April 2018.

We stand for hope, trust, environmental awareness, civil rights, and political freedom. Our close knit society lives of of each others opinions, and nothing is a compromise. Whoever you might be, you are welcomed to our Paradise.
If you plan on joining this region, thank you. We are always in need of new opinions and fresh minds. We are a broad-minded community, and any suggestions or votes you have will be valued to the utmost degree, and we will always listen. Our region may be a small one, but what we lack in size, we make up for in hope, trust, and we consider everyone an equal.
