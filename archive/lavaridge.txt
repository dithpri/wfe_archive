Lavaridge is a tiny island off the coast of Japan straddling the Pacific Ring of Fire. Mount Chimney, towering high over the island provides wealth from its ash. Like a blanket, volcanic ash lightly covers the islands north.

At Mount Chimney&#39;s southern foot sits Lavaridge Town. Founded near the islands famous hot springs, they are a popular tourist destination particularly among the elderly. According to legend, the hot springs calm tension, relieve muscle ache, solve romantic problems, and can cure any ailment.
