[color=yellow][b][u][i]D&aelig;sin[/i][/u][/b][/color] is the region for those who dwell upon the brink of war. The region has been scarred permanently by the use of technology, magic, nature and greed. With this damage many species have died or evolved, resulting in the creation of a highly aggressive ecosystem few try to colonize. At the heart are the four main areas,
the Realms of the Faithful (humanoid and industrial), the Rift (demonic and disordered), the Woldbarrens (nomadic people, Ravaged desolate plains), and the Moonveil (beasts, nature lovers).
