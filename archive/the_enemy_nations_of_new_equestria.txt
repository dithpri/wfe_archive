The Enemy Nations of New Equestria houses the three nations of New Equestria, [nation]Applejackian Equestria[/nation], [nation]Dashian Cloudsdale[/nation], and [nation]Rarityville[/nation], as well as the lawless wasteland of [nation]The Equestrian Wasteland[/nation]. These three nations are all that remains of the civilized society after The Great Equestrian Schism.

The Great Equestrian Schism resulted in the disbandment of the Mane Six&amp;#39;s friendship, and three of them created their own countries in what became known as &amp;quot;New Equestria&amp;quot;.
