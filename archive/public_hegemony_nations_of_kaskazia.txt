If you Are New to this region, there are the things you can do:
Endorse (optional): You Can Endorse WA Members &quot;If you are a WA Member Too&quot;, go to the NationStates Forum or anything so u can learn what a endorse is

Try Become a WA Delegate: you should be an WA Member to become a WA delegate, the WA Member with the most endorses can be elected the WA Delegate of the region, this gives the power of Central Executive Permissions on The Region
