The Weastern Pacific is a land where tyrannical countries come together to rebel against anyone who says Weast isn&#39;t a direction. Before The Weastern Pacific, the land was ran by Democratic Capitalists who only feed on the taxes and wages from the unfortunate. The unfortunates, or what we call Weasterns today, suffered everyday, hoping for a new life/big change. However, on October 23rd, 2077, the day the bombs dropped, all hell broke loose throughout the nation. Although it may seem the country was at its end, it marked the beginning of the new region known as The Weastern Pacific. Join if you want change for once! Join if you want power for once! Join, for freedom.
