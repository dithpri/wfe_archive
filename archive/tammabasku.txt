The Alien world of Tammabasku, home to an ancient race of beings, who have shut themselves out to the universe, to look inwards. What they have found is mystical. The secluded species has opened, albeit, only so as to establish communication with other near systems. They trade their technology, and spread their teachings through means of data transference via superluminal communications and vessels which glide across the expanses of space, bristling with astonishing feats of engineering, manned by robotic drones, and sapient, loyal artificial intelligences. The sudden shock of their appearance within the Orion arm, and their reluctance to reveal themselves, or anything of their history, is a mystery truly waiting to be unraveled.
