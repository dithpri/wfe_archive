[i] &#147;The last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope.&#148;[/i] 
-Karl Marx

The world has thrown out money. No capitalist nation remains. Now, the world is guided by an entirely different set of morals, understood with the simple lack of currency. There exists no national currency. How does the world begin to function?

Welcome to an alt-history where the world has no money! There is one particular rule which each state must have:
-Economy must be low (&amp;lt;20%) on creation. 

Only new nations accepted!
