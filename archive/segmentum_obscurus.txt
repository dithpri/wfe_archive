&quot;And henceforth be it known that the Imperium shall be divided into five fleet zones to be known as the Segmentae Majoris. These shall each have a Segment Fortress, from whence the orders of his glorious magnificence, the Emperor, shall be enacted. Imperialis Command Decoriatum shall reside in each and with just duty be issued over the realms within their boundaries.&quot;

The Segmentum Obscurus is the galactic north of Imperial space, containing the Eye of Terror, and the Fortress World of Cadia.
