We are a region devoted to preserving the rights of our people and refugees.  You are only welcome here if you believe in democratic ideals (no fascists or communists).  Non-aligned countries are welcome, but we highly recommend becoming more democratic because you can only become a prominent member of society here if you are democratic.
