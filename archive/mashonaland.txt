An environmentally stunning region, we cordially welcome all nations of any political stance (except fascism) to Mashonaland. Mashonaland rose out of the ashes of the former region Sprachtol. We have an emphasis on the defense of our region, but are not aggressors and do not continually seek out war with other regions and nations. The governing body of Mashonaland does expect it&amp;#39;s member nations to defend the region in times of need, but we do not force you to do so. Welcome to Mashonaland!

[i]LONG LIVE MASHONALAND! REMEMBER SPRACHTOL! DOWN WITH FASCISM![/i]
