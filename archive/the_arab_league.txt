The Arab League is one of the many congregations of Arab Nations, serving as a superstate to coordinate the affairs of its member countries and foster international cooperation. Operating loosely and generally without a singular power, The Arab League seeks to bring together Arab nations, so that they may govern themselves under a strong and united federal government.
