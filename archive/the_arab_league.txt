[color=green]THE ARAB LEAGUE[/color]
An economic and social union of Arab states united by common ideals of regional defense, freedom, and Arab self-determination. We welcome Arab states as comrades and brothers and Non-Arabs as mentors for a bright future. We are currently recovering from a cowardly invasion by [region]Nazi Europa[/region]. But with the help of Defender regions and nations we have driven them back to their miserable little swastika covered hovel. 
Thanks to:
The [region]The League of Conservative Nations[/region] Military
[nation]Cormactopia II[/nation] For authoring our Liberation
[nation]McStooley[/nation]
Nazi Europa for succumbing to our resistance! :)
[region]Unity[/region]
And all who assisted with our liberation! Including all those who voted for liberation!
