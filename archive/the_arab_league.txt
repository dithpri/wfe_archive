[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by! 

[color=red]Another successful raid for the UIAF and more specifically the Somerset Guard! Hoorah hoorah for the Somerset Guard. We did get some help from others eventually though at first they were away with the fairies....[/color]

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

With thanks to the member from [region]Albion[/region].[/b]
