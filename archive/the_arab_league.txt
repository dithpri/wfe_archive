The Arab League is a Federal Superstate of Arab Nations. It coordinates the affairs of its member countries under a Federal Government which is elected through universal suffrage. The Arab League&amp;#39;s main purpose is to bring together all the Arab nations of Nationstates, so that they will be able to govern themselves under one strong and united federal government. The region also has an active role-play community.

The region is now under new management. Great Prophet of the Sun Ali Baktar will bring honour and prosperity to The Arab League! DEATH TO ISRAEL AND GLORY TO ALLAH!
