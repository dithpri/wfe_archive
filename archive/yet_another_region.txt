Welcome to [b]Yet Another Region[/b]!

The main goal of this region is to influence the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url] by collaborating on creating and voting on proposals for the General Assembly and Security Council.

If you want to &quot;mold the world to your vision&quot;, this is the place to be!

[b]Regional Rules:[/b]
[list][*]All nations in this region must be WA members. If it&#39;s been one week since you joined and you&#39;re still not in the WA, you will be ejected.
[*]You cannot join with any alts, the nation you join with must be your main.[/list]

Now, this isn&#39;t a rule, but it&#39;d be cool if you endorsed [nation]New Perfectistan[/nation].
