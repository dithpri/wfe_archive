Welcome to the FSPU! 

Here at the FSPU we aim to protect the rights of fascist nations, we give you protection from invasion by other fascist nation and non-fascist nations. 

You don&amp;#39;t have to be a fascist nation to join the Fascist State Protection Alliance, but once a part of the FSPU, you will be prohibited to invade or declare war on a fascist nation. 

FSPU Government: 
The FSPU has it&amp;#39;s own government system that is separate from the World Assembly Delegate, to give the FSPU members full control of their laws and regulations. 

The government has very little power over each individual nation, but is there to make recommendations for protection purposes.
