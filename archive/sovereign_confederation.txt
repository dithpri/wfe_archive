[b]Welcome to the Sovereign Confederation![/b]
 
Sovereign Confederation is an organization created by a group of regions dissatisfied with the status quo. We insist that regions can and should work together based on mutual interests rather than absolute ideologies, on mutual benefits rather than sacrifices. We believe that a new paradigm for interregional politics will benefit our member regions as well as many others across the NationStates world.
