[b]Welcome to the Sovereign Confederation![/b]

Sovereign Confederation was an organization created on 02 March 2013 by a group of regions dissatisfied with the status quo. They insisted that regions can and should work together based on mutual interests rather than absolute ideologies, on mutual benefits rather than sacrifices. They believed that a new paradigm for interregional politics would benefit their member regions as well as many others across the NationStates world.

Sovereign Confederation was disbanded on 02 June 2013. May Sovereign Confederation rest in peace, but may its ideals endure.
