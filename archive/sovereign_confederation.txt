[b]Welcome to the Sovereign Confederation![/b]

Sovereign Confederation was an organization created on March 02, 2013 by a group of regions dissatisfied with the status quo. They insisted that regions can and should work together based on mutual interests rather than absolute ideologies, on mutual benefits rather than sacrifices. They believed that a new paradigm for interregional politics would benefit their member regions as well as many others across the NationStates world.

Sovereign Confederation was disbanded on June 02, 2013. This region is maintained for safe keeping and historical purposes. May Sovereign Confederation rest in peace, but may its ideals endure.
