We are all synners...
You have synned and I have synned, even the glorious aluminum G-d who rules over our precious aluminum has synned...
But you can be saved, your despicable little life can be made better, and all you need to do is everything we tell you, without arguments, without hesitation, just do as we say.
You will be rewarded my dear synners, with basslines and aluminum! Glory be to aluminum!
Join now, or suffer the fate of all those who syn without redemption...
