I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I&#39;m not very well looking for all that fancy stuff that all these regions are offering! I just want a calm place to make friends and socialize, and maybe have some friendly roleplay here and there! This region is open to ALL! No judgement of any kind toward other members will be tolerated. I just want to create a region for everyone to relax and enjoy themselves without worrying about all that fancy stuff about region maps and everyone voting on a delegate and armed forces and citizenship and all that other junk. So come in and enjoy yourself!
