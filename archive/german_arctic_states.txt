 [b][u]The German Arctic States[/b][/u]
A German outpost in the Arctic, the German Arctic States are full of hard-working Germans who are patriotic for their Paterland.
While colder than Germany, the colonists make their region reminiscent of their fatherland in its architecture, culture, and diet of beer and bratwursts.
The German Arctic States are protected by the military of the German Empire. Their proximity to northern Russia makes attacks by Communists a threat, but they stand resolute against anyone who wants to take their land away.
