[color=blue]We are a democratic society built upon intelligence, scientific progress, and ducks. The Duck Isles are located South of The Othana Isles in the Pacific Ocean and West of the Islands of Chuuk. Our many islands are home to excellent beaches, exotic wildlife and great people. Our national airline is Duck Air which links the many islands together along with flights to the Othana Isles, Bhutan, Chuuk and New Zealand.[/color]

[color=orange]Most decisions will be made through the polls. Land can&#39;t be swapped or changed. You shall be given an island in the atolls. Contact [nation]Quackerduck[/nation] to submit an official flag or if you have any questions or complaints.[/color]
