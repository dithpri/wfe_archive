The United Nations of Vardos was formed when the founder of Vardos, Asdew, gained independence from The Union of Soviet States of Solidarity. Although Asdew gained its independence peacefully, both sides had economic problems and made the secession difficult than it should have been in the first place.

Vardos prioritizes on education and welfare of its citizens and promises peace for all.
