[color=blue]The Dragon Ridge is a volcanic mountain range, whose jagged peaks bite into the sky like the fangs of the beasts from which the mountains draw their name. The surfaces of the mountains are riddled with caves - which are warmed by the molten stone flowing behind their walls - in which dragons, the fearsome monsters of legend, dwell. The fertile lands beneath the range, as well as the valleys between the mountains, are home to numerous other creatures and beings.[/color]
