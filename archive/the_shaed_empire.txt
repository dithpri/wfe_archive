The Shaed Empire is the vast regions in the South, over which Shadowvael rules. All members are vassals of Lord Shaed Blackhold, and his line. It is a region of prosperity, and war. Any may enter the region, to find sanctuary from the world if they desire it, to build their great country, but the rules must be followed, or they will become the target of the next Shadow Crusade. The Shaed Empire is aggressive, if they find land they desire, they rally the armies and march forth in a Shadow Crusade. In the event the Shaed Empire is invaded, all members, even those not part of the military are required to rise up and defend the great land in which they live, but when not at war, all may rest, and prosper.
