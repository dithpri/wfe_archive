Lodoss, located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean (some days), was founded shortly after Founders became available in 2003. Political uprisings, feuding gods, catgirls, spies, military operations, and tawdry sex seem to be the norm. Come to our personal RPing board at [url=http://www.cursedlodoss.com]http://www.cursedlodoss.com[/url] to find out what we are all about.

After a bit of nagging, I am putting in some notes:
-CursedLodoss.com is defunct. We technically have our old BBoy board, but I&#39;m not going to link it. It sucks and spambots ate it.
-We don&#39;t do WA, so don&#39;t bother. We&#39;re not going to make you a delegate and you wouldn&#39;t have any power anyway.
-We still live! We&#39;re just lazy. Get off our lawn!
