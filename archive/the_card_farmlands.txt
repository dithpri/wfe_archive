Welcome to the [region]Card Farmlands[/region]!
Here at the farmlands, we most definitely don&#39;t use slave labor, and everything is perfect.

Our king is the great nation [nation]Zapiron[/nation].
He totally isn&#39;t stealing our hard-earned cards.

NO EMBASSIES, nobody must discover what what we&#39;re doing here.

If you see a dissenting worker, call 1-839-748-DEATH, and we&#39;ll retire them...permanently
