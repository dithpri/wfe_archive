Troryk is a region made up of several islands. It is located in the Atlantic Ocean, southwest of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and it is the most westerly region in Europe.
The islands, being towards the centre of a tectonic plate rather than the edge, don&amp;#39;t tend to encounter any volcanic activity and any earthquakes are rare and unnoticeable.
The isles are known to be beaten by the wind and waves, however, but the storms pass quickly and leave little damage 9 times out of 10.
The sunsets and sunrises from the islands are simply wonderful and the grassland and forestry that laces Troryk is teaming with wildlife. It truly is a beautiful, but strong region.
