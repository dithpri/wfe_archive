Countries all over the world have waged wars to gain their own interests, sacrificing innocent lives and walking on the path of self-destruction. The survivors created their own state, claimed their sovereignty, and plunged back into a new war. In the Middle East, all life was destroyed, and in Europe, there was a terrible plague. In Asia, warlords are constantly at odds, and in America, surviving capitalists and wealthy communists are enjoying themselves. And in Eurasia, a dictator appears and he has brutal rule.
