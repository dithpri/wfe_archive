Created by the Rogue Nation of Clopstoggle, the region of Calamity&amp;#39;s Graveyard is a beautiful paradise with the unfortunate issue of being plagued by every natural disaster known to man. Luckily, these infrequent dangers rarely cause any longterm problems for the locals, and are a long celebrated quirk of this whimsical region. 

The population of Clopstoggle strive to maintain Calamity&amp;#39;s Graveyard&amp;#39;s appeal and welcomes all so long as they respect its ideals and endeavour to do the same. 

Some say the leader of Clopstoggle has godlike powers and creates the perils that afflict its inhabitants to prepare them for any problem they may face. Others say he is insane, but nontheless a benevolent man who is harmless and affectionate to the people
