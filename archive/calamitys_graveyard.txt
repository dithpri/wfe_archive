Colonised by Clopstoggle, Calamity&amp;#39;s Graveyard is a diverse, archipelagic paradise with the unfortunate issue of being plagued by every natural disaster known to man. Luckily, these infrequent dangers are a long celebrated quirk of this whimsical region as they rarely cause any longterm problems for the locals and have earnt it the name &amp;#39;The plaything of the gods&amp;#39;.

Some say the leader of Clopstoggle creates the perils that afflict its inhabitants to prepare them for any problem they may face. Others say he is insane, but nontheless a benevolent man who is harmless and affectionate to the people. The locals strive to maintain Calamity&amp;#39;s Graveyard&amp;#39;s appeal and welcome all so long as they respect their ideals and endeavour to protect it too.
