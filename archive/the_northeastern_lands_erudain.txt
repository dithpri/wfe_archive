The Northeastern Lands Erudain is a relatively new region. Our goal is to nurture a peaceful, friendly environment and we therefore dissaprove of warfare of any kind and prefer to take up matters of dissagreement diplomatically. A discord server is available for the use of members but you can also simply engage in the Regional Message Board (elsewhere: RMB). Don&#39;t be discouraged if there&#39;s not much action on the RMB. As our population begins to grow, we will establish more frequent communication. We also may suffer from time differences leading people to be awake at different times.
