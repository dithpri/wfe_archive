The Northeastern Lands of Erudain is a fairly new region, founded by the Republic of Crenolos. Being new, we are still small, but we will grow. We wish for peace in our region and hope that all nations who would join us think likewise.

We think the wellbeing of the people&#39;s of our nations come before all else and will not accept nations who are particularly nasty or violent in their ways. (Please ignore our awkward but long-standing relationship with the Grand Duchy of South Crenolos)

We have a discord server for our conversations and roleplay. So do join so that you can be in on the fun. (The address is in your welcome telegram)
