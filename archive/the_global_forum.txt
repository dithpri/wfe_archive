&amp;#127760; Welcome to The Global Forum! &amp;#127760;

We&#146;re excited to open our brand-new NationStates region &#151; a space built on fun, creativity, and roleplay. Here, nations can step into the roles of world leaders, forge alliances, and craft stories together

What we&#146;re about:

- A warm welcome for newcomers of all experience levels
- Roleplay and creative diplomacy encouraged &#151; bring your nation&#146;s voice!
