A Tribe of Zealots bound together by a single faith whereby the only will that matters is the will of God alone. The Individual has been reduced to an archaic word within their texts. The Chief of this Tribe is regarded to represent the Most High himself. To safeguard the purity of their holy faith, isolationism has been the standard practice regarding diplomatic relations. Outsiders unwilling to yield absolute submission to their God and their Prophet are branded as Heathens unfit to abide in their Holy Land.
