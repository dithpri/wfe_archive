[b]Welcome to La nova Terra![/b]

[b]Here on [color=#0404B4]La nova Terra[/color], we belive that [color=#01DF01]life[/color] itself is reflected on the pace of a day,
first comes [color=#FFFF00]The Morning[/color] representing Birth, then The Afternoon representing Life and then at the end, The Night as Death.
But after The Night, [color=#FFFF00]The Morning[/color] comes... What does that mean? Well, just as when Liam saw a dying deer mother give birth to fawn, a new life after a death, The Night come to give space for a new Afternoon through becoming [color=#FFFF00]The Morning[/color].[/b]

This is a WFE in progress...

We are currently planning to reform the region, bringing in new lore (in cooperation with [region]The Order of The Afternoon[/region]) and &quot;updating&quot; WFE in a attempt to try revive La nova Terra since it has been decaying since a few months.
