[b]Welcome to La nova Terra![/b]

[hr]

[b]Here on [color=#0404B4]La nova Terra[/color], we belive that [color=#01DF01]life[/color] itself is reflected on the pace of a day,
first comes [color=#FFFF00]The Morning[/color] representing Birth, then The Afternoon representing [color=#01DF01]Life[/color] and then at the end, The Night as Death.
But after The Night, [color=#FFFF00]The Morning[/color] comes... What does that mean? Well, just as when Liam saw a dying deer mother give birth to fawn, a new life after a death, The Night come to give space for a new Afternoon through becoming [color=#FFFF00]The Morning[/color].[/b]

For further Information, telegram [nation]The Latinamerican Federation[/nation] or [nation]Athena-Helios[/nation] (until a dispatch is made...)
