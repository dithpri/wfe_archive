[b]Welcome to La nova Terra![/b]

Here on La nova Terra, we belive that life itself is reflected on the pace of a day,
first comes The Morning representing Birth, then The Afternoon representing Life and then at the end, The Night as Death.
But after The Night, The Morning comes... What does that mean? Well, just as when Liam saw a dying deer mother give birth to fawn, a new life after a death, The Night come to give space for a new Afternoon through becoming The Morning.

This is a WFE in progress...

We are currently planning to reform the region, bringing in new lore (in cooperation with [region]The Order of The Afternoon[/region]) and &quot;updating&quot; WFE in a attempt to try revive La nova Terra since it has been decaying since a few months.
