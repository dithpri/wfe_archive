[b]The Region of WA Catholicism-Conservatism is a pro-Theocracy Catholic region which attempts to make the world more Catholic and Conservative through World Assembly Proposals/Legislation and political influence.
If you would like to join, you must be a WA member or else I will telegram you and ask that you become a WA member, if you do not, then you will be kicked out of this region.
