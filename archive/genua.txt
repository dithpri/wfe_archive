The phoenix rises from it&#39;s ashes...

[b] Nazi [color=blue]Genua[/color]  [/b] stands for conservatism and our eternal right to wage crusades against the usurpers of our Churches and cities
We shall continue to crusade for liberation of all regions and lands dear to our Lord and take forward the banner raised by [b]ERoGC[/b].

Long live the [b]Nazi Genuan Empire[/b], built to demolish [color=green][b]Islamic Jihadi Sharia terror[/b][/color] and the [color=red][b]red monster of Communism[/b][/color].  Both are two sides of the same coin. 

We demand the return of:

[i][region]Elite Region of Global Command[/region]*****[region]Nysa[/region]***[region]The Phantom Knights[/region], which are rightfully and historically ours.[/i]
