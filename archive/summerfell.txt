The Summerfell is the name given to the realm that controls most of the continent of America and numerous offshore islands, ruled by the King of the Droyds and  First Men from the Red Keep in the city of the Shire. Its name dates back to the time prior to the War of Conquest, during which hundreds of independent kingdoms existed in the continent.
