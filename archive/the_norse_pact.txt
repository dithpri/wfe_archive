[color=red] Founded by the esteemed [nation]Holy NorseFire Regime[/nation]

&amp;quot;Norse in name and in spirit,
Fire spewing warriors,
Our might knows no limits,
We will be victorious!
Hoo Rah! Hoo Rah! Hoo Rah!

We sail the seas with conquest in mind,
But make no mistake, we&amp;#39;ll be kind,
When trade arrives, we will find the time,
We will always shine,

Pact of the Norse,
Heroes in soul,
The mightiest force,
Your screams are but a gentle lull to US!&amp;quot;

A lush nation, formed by the distant ancestors of the current members, living by the Warrior Code, with conquest always in mind.
