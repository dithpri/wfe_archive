One.

One. One must rule.

The Nuzloc Pact follows this rule, and so must all else.

The Nuzloc Pact is a collection of subjects that the &quot;One&quot; in this region controls. If you are in the Nuzloc Pact, you are under control of the &quot;One&quot;.
The &quot;One&quot; in this region is Apacina. Ruler of them all, &quot;One&quot; has supreme authority over all their subjects until the celestial bodies fade.

If you are here, reading these terms for the Nuzloc Pact, please consider becoming a subject of the &quot;One&quot;. You will start small, but eventually we will grow into a powerhouse like none other. To request subject-hood, please send a telegram to the &quot;One&quot; for the password of this region. You will be guided once you join.
