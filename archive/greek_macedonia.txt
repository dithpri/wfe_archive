We, the 2.5 million Greek Makedones of [b][color=blue]Greek Macedonia[/color][/b], demand that our government exercise its right to prevent the accession of FYROM to the European Union and NATO, until such time as FYROM consents to a mutually acceptable name.

Greece and her people and especially we, the Makedones of Greek Macedonia, strongly object to the usurpation of our cultural heritage, the violation of our human right to retain our own identity and our dignity.
