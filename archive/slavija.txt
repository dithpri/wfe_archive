[color=blue][b]WELCOME[/color] TO [color=red]SLAVIJA![/b][/color]

[b][i]Slavija is a Slavic region open to anyone regardless of race, sex, gender, orientation, ethnicity, ideology, nationality, or religion! It was forged out of the fire of Pan-Slavism, the idea of unity between the Slavic peoples, and so long as there are Pan-Slavists on NationStates, there will be Slavija! URA![/i][/b]
