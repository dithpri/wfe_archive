[b]Welcome to Northern Europe[/b]

A small region that enjoys having several rare species of Pine trees. Seasons in Northern Europe are mild, with temperatures hardly breaking 27C. Players here do not need to interact much, as this is a very quiet region.

[i]World Assembly Members[/i]
While all nations are welcome in Northern Europe, you are requested to refrain from endorsing other WA member nations - Northern Europe neither wants nor needs a World Assembly Delegate.
