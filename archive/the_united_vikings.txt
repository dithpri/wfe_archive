Hail and well met, traveler! Thou hast crossed wind and wave, fire and frost, to stand now upon the threshold of our great hall. Be not a stranger, for all who bear honor in their hearts and strength in their bones are welcome here. Sit by the hearth where the mead flows like rivers of gold, and tales of glory echo through timbered beams. Lay down thy sword, raise thy horn, and join us in feast and fellowship&#151;for in this hall, valor is sung, kinship is sacred, and the spirit of the North burns ever bright!
