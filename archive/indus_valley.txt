Consisting of the land that constitutes the Kyrgyz Fascist Sovereign Territory, The Mongol Empire, India, The Afghan Emirate and old Pakistan (now part of the Askotian Empire), this region is a thriving economic and military power. It has its own alliance group called the &amp;#39;Indus Union,&amp;#39; with all previously mentioned countries (except for Askotia). Feel free to join this fledgling, beautiful union. 

*Note: All countries can keep their currency but can change to the world&amp;#39;s reserve, the Askotian Lake, if they wish.
