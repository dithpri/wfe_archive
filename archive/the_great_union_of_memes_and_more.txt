[b]General information[/b]
Our region is based around memes and other stuff. If you like memes, you are more than welcome to join. We apprecieate every dank meme and seek to find the Dankest Meme. Our politics isn&#39;t complicated like in some regions. Demanding a democratization may be considered a crime. We support authoritarian regions discriminated by the democratic ones.
