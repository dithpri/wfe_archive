[b]General information[/b]
We are a region based around memes. We apprecieate every dank meme and seek to find the Dankest Meme. Our political system is centralised around The Founder, government and the Supreme Judge. Everyone publicly demanding a democratization may be considered a foreign agent from a democratic region. We are concerned about condemning authoritarian regions only for not being democratic. 
Ruling party: Dank Memes Party
Our WA Delegate (endorse): [nation]Trash Cans and Butter[/nation]
