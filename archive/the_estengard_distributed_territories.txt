This region is designated for those wishing to serve in a coalition comprised of democratic countries and republics. This system of government is preferred, as we believe strongly in non-oppressive governments. Political dispute within the region page or on the region board will not be tolerated. [b]All nations are required to have a laurel wreath on their banner (see region flag) to symbolize the triumph that we strive for in the EDT, and to signify their membership in the region. [/b]
