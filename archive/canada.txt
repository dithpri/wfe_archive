[color=red]Bienvenue au Canada - the non-crappy Region![/color]

We are a constitutional democracy.
All decisions on how Canada is run [u]including embassy requests[/u] are made on the [URL=https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nationstates_canada]Canadian Forum[/URL].                           

Residents can register as citizens on the forum. Citizens may run for delegate by declaring there, and agreeing to uphold our constitution. All others should keep below 50% of the delegate&#39;s endo count.

Please note that we are a neutral region. All are welcome on a peaceful basis, but please do not use Canada for military operations.

[b]Please endorse the Delegate.[/b]
