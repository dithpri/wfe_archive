[color=red]Bienvenue au Canada - the non-crappy Region![/color]

We are a constitutional democracy.
All decisions on how Canada is run are made on the [URL=https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nationstates_canada/index.php]Canadian Forum,[/URL] including embassy requests.

Residents can register as citizens on the forum. Citizens may run for delegate by declaring there, and agreeing to uphold our constitution. All others should keep below 50% of the delegate&#39;s endo count.

If you are a raider or defender, please note that we are a neutral region. All are welcome on a peaceful basis, but please do not use Canada as a base or staging post for military operations.

[b]Please endorse the Delegate.[/b]
