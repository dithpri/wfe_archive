[color=red]Bienvenue au Canada - the non-crappy Region![/color]

We are a true constitutional democracy.
All decisions on how Canada is run are made on the [url=http://z8.invisionfree.com/NationStates_Canada]Canadian forum[/url]

Residents can register as citizens on the forum. Citizens may run for delegate by declaring there, and agreeing to uphold our constitution. All others should keep below 50% of the delegate&amp;#39;s endo count.

[b]Please endorse the Delegate.[/b]
