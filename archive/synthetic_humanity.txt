This region is going to be the library of stories, sagas, tales, where you can develop your own timeline for your nation. Now you can do that anywhere but here, I envision a community where everyone has a timeline that is networked.
All you should know about the base lore, is that millions of years later, after Humans and Robots from the 21st-22nd century cooperated on developing a bio-engineered human. A nuclear war happened which destroyed the majority of humans and destroyed all AI systems leaving only a couple synthetic humans, left to roam the earth. 10 million years later, they evolved civilization. Which will you lead?
