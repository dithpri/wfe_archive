The Eternal Land of Mo Hall is a diverse land governed by tired college students. We are primarily left-leaning with our focus directed toward Civil Rights and Political Freedoms, though a few of our dear nations prefer their people to have no Political Freedoms at all. The Eternal Land of Mo Hall is ranked 55th in WA endorsements as of 10/16/18 and 980th in Most Nations. 

100% of our leaders are [u]Truman State University[/u] students. If you&#39;re a fellow TSU Bulldog, please say hello!
