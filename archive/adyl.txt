Adyl was formed on March 5, 2011. 

It is a region of nations dedicated to strong political and civil liberties that work to ensure equal opportunity to all.

Adyl serves as a community for those that are simply interested in having fun and hanging out while on NS and are not incredibly indebted in the tiny details of the game.
