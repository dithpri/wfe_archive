The pirate does travel south from the shore,
Greedy for gold, gems, silver and more.
Little does he know that under his ship,
Lies a foe that is dangerous and quick.
The great scourge on the seven seas,
A monster that can capsize a ship with ease.
Up from the north this monster does come,
What is its name to which many have succumbed?
