We are a region of mixed political and economic beliefs. We are not tantrum-filled Neo-Nazis nor are we Commie believers. Both the Right and Left have good points and interesting beliefs both politically and economically, however, do not think us petty centrists. Overall, we welcome Fascist and Nationalist Nations, as long as they understand their own ideologies and don&#39;t display blunt racism and try to start drama. Many other nation types can join as well, if they follow previously mentioned rules. You can openly debate or express concerns about the region or the way we run things, we appreciate feedback from newcomers.
