   Come together and to unite behind a single banner and spread the message of unity and Inclusion. To band together and change the world ensuring that the Red will Spread. So that we may bid Good Night to the Right Side. 
    We welcome all queer nations, anarchist leaning and strong arm states of communism, socialist and liberal havens, Utopias and Dictatorships alike are welcome. What&#146;s not welcome are the Fascist, the Theocracy, The Monarchies of Capitalism and exploitation.
