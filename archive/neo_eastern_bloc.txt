Greetings comrade!

This is for now a placeholder, there will probably be a better factbook entry later.
For now, this is all you have to know:
Things we like:
- Communism
- Socialism
- &quot;Democracy&quot;

Things we don&#39;t really like:
- Capitalism
- Monarchies
- Religion
- Actual non-corrupt democracy

If you agree with the above, then I suggest that you join this region.
Or not.
It&#39;s your decision.
