After a recent rediscovery, a vibrant land was found in between a large circle of mountains surrounded by a strange forest within a mysterious mist. A closer look at the earth revealed the bloody, war-torn history this land had. It was unlivable for many centuries. A volcano had erupted and ended all life in this region. With the volcano extinct, this region has had time to grow back and has made life sustainable again. Any kind of government is accepted here.
