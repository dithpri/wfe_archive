The Bolshevik Union is a new, growing region dedicated to the Marxist-Leninist thought. The region was founded to counter reactionary influence in other regions across the world and to preserve the Marxist-Leninist ideals so that other nations can be liberated from the bourgeoisie-led governments and have a region that is tolerant, just and disciplined.
