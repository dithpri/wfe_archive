The Bolshevik Union is a growing region dedicated to anti-revisionist Marxism-Leninism. The region was founded to counter reactionary, petty bourgeois and revisionist influence in other regions across the world. Our members will preserve the Marxist-Leninist ideals so that other nations can be liberated from their bourgeoisie-led governments and have a region that is tolerant, just and disciplined.
