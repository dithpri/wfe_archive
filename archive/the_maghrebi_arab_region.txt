undefinedMaghrebi Arabs (Arabic: :&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1576; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1594;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1577; al-&#145;Arab al-Maghariba) or North African Arabs (Arabic: &amp;#1593;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1576; &amp;#1588;&amp;#1605;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1604; &amp;#1571;&amp;#1601;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1602;&amp;#1610;&amp;#1575; &#145;Arab Shamal Ifriqiya) are the inhabitants of the North African Maghreb region whose native language is Arabic and identify as Arab.[1][2][3][4][5][6] This ethnic identity is a product of the Arab conquest of North Africa during the Arab&#150;Byzantine wars and the spread of Islam to Africa.[7] The migration of Arabs to North Africa in the 11th century was a major factor in the ethnical, linguistic and cultural Arabization of the Maghreb region.

The descendants of the original Arab settlers who continue to speak Arabic as a first language currently form the single largest population group in North Africa.[8]
