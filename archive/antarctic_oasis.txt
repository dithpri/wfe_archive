So, you&#39;ve finally settled your country down in its new home; you&#39;ve even rounded up some local penguins for your national zoo...and they start randomly exploding on you. You reach out to your neighbors to establish diplomatic ties, but they&#39;re too busy pointing missiles at you to be your friends. You hire a stripper to entertain your leader, but she ties him to a chair and starts pressing him for sensitive intel. You come across a band of gnomes, but instead of sneakily trying to change your laws, they shake you down for rent money. If you thought this was a normal peaceful region, you were way off!

WA Members, please endorse the delegate. Failure to do so will get you the boot. Thank you.
