Welcome to [b]AO&#153;[/b], your one-stop source for exploding penguins, Stripper Commandos, gnomish warbands, foul-mouthed dolphins, and all other manner of tools and tactics for inciting terror and malice on an unsuspecting and fearful world. Our shimmering polar metropolis is a haven for dictators and warlords seeking sanctuary from international tribunals and weapons inspectors. (Because really, who&amp;#39;s going to risk freezing their nuts off in the punishing Antarctic winter just to arrest a war criminal?)
