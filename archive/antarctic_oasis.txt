Welcome to [b]the Oasis[/b], your one-stop source for inspiring hope and change in a dreary and downbeaten world. Our shimmering polar utopia is a haven for lovers of freedom and democracy seeking sanctuary from really bad people, like rogue states, war criminals and terrorists (because you&amp;#39;re not gonna find any of them in [i]this[/i] region, nosiree!) So rev up those drum circles, tie-dye those T-shirts, occupy those town squares, and tremble in fear, all you one-percenters hellbent on destroying us! Our cries for justice will not go unheard! [b][i]Equality[/i][/b] is coming to NationStates...and it is coming from Antarctic Oasis.
