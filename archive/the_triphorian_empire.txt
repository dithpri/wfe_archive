&#147;Those who know me in this age call me the Heretic Prophet. Those in the time long after mine will address me with the same title. I have foreseen the transformation of this world. A great conflict shall arise in the latter millennium. It shall spill out upon the worlds beyond this one and it will continue until the day when the Goddess herself unveils the heavens and strikes down those who have committed malice towards one another. The Era of the Triforce will mark the end of this war; and with it, the dawn of a new Empire will rise.&#148; &#150; Book of Tal Rane 77:1-7
