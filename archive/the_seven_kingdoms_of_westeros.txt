I welcome all nations, willing to sacrifice themselves for the preservation of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros!

We shall unite ourselves in one leader,  to be chosen by Kingsmoot/Queensmoot!

Each new nation should present itself as Noble House or Lower House or Bannermen to a Royal House.
Please post this on the Regional Message Board down below as soon as you come in.
We only accept real houses as mentioned in A Song of Ice and Fire by GRRM
