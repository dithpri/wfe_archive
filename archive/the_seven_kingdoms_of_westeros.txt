[region]The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros[/region] has announced the Zombie Apocalypse Protocol, otherwise known as Project Z-EXT.
Our Borders have been closed. No one gets in, no one goes out. WE FIGHT BACK.

It is of GREATEST IMPORTANCE that EVERYONE start RESEARCHING CURE to exterminate these zombies and revive our infected.
WHAT YOU MUST DO:

1) RESEARCH CURE

2) Go to a region fellow member&amp;#39;s nation and strike as many cure missiles until their Zombie Count Drops at least 20%

3) If we do this quickly and effective, we can cure everyone in time and SURVIVE.
