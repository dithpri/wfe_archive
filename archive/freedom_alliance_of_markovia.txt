We are a capitalist region and only submit people with economys that are thriving or above. People are welcome to all civil rights and must obey the Supreme Chancellor of St Gabriel. The senate of the region has no regional control. Free market in this region is a paramount. Nations are welcome to grow and thrive into huge pro market business zones. I hope you grow and thrive in my region.

Yours in freedom,

Supreme Chancellor of St Gabriel
