The Chernobyl Incident. April 26, 1986. NEVER FORGET!

Welcome,

Welcome to the Chernobyl Union comrade! We are a relatively new nation who are looking for anyone with good Civil Rights and a stable Economy. We are looking for new members and welcome all that favor Communism. Note however, if you do not comply with our operations and guidelines, your nation will be dealt with, severely.

Sincerely,
Mikhail (Michael)
Union Overseer
