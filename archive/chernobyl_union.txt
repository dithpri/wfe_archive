The Chernobyl Incident. April 26, 1986. NEVER FORGET!

Welcome,

Welcome to the Chernobyl Union comrade! We are a relatively new nation who are looking for anyone with good Civil Rights and a stable Economy. We are looking for new members and welcome all that favor Communism. Capitalism is Outlawed and only Few Political Freedoms are allowed. We hope that you join our nation!

Sincerely,
Mikhail (Michael)
Nations Leader
