---===--Laws Of The F.N.--===---         &#149;Each person may have 2 nations maximum.                                            &#149;You may choose only 1 of your nations to collaborate in polls (that is their only restriction of interaction though).                               &#149;A nation new to the region must have connection to at least one current regional nation to join, or else you will be removed.                                          &#149;When using the regional board, use double brackets surrounding the text to indicate non RP. Ex: ((how was today))
