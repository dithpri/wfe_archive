We are a collection of unexpectedly synergistic nations.  Putting aside our great ideological differences we strive to succeed and create great states that will stand the test of time.  We are also composed of two alliances who have had trying relations in the past but have made their way to peace, prosperity, and progression.  One alliance lead by the Holy, wise, and just Dictatorship of the Realm of God trying to lead people to salvation and innovation.  The second alliance is lead by the advanced, socially progressive, peaceful democratic state of Navus, lead by an AI prototype that has allowed this great nation to explore science as a way not of harm but salvation for the future!
