We are a collection of unexpectedly synergistic nations.  Putting aside our great ideological differences we strive to succeed and create great states that will stand the test of time.  Our nations have had trying relations in the past but have made their way to peace, prosperity, and progression.  With the dissolve of any form of alliance (in pre war circumstances), and the soon possibility of mass weapons disarm, the priority of peace is kept at heart.
