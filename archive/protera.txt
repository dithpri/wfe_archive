[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region],  [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region].

With speed and precision, no region is safe for the imperialist juggernaut.  All shall tremble in fear at the sight of wings and talons!

Alas this was a training mission for some but still we could not be stopped. Where are the fendas?

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor! Glory to the King!

With thanks to [region]Europeia[/region] for their help.[/b]
