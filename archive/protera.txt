The [b][color=green]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=blue]Navy[/color][/b] has come with the holy Mother Nature at our side, who speaks wisdom in our ears. She is begging us to dump all of our trash from our ninth anniversary celebration in [region]Europeia[/region], and there is no way we can deny her any longer. All of the alcohol must go somewhere.

This is no longer a place to be Earth positive, be Earth [b]negative[/b]! Listen to the holy Mother Nature and her whim: dump your trash outside to make the world grim.
