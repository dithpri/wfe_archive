Politics:
We accept any political views accept fascist and communists. The region has a free trade agreement.


Military alliance:
Currently no larger military alliance. But in the future we will have a alliance that is offering peace keeping missions. We are not a aggressor, but we may help other regions if military assistans is requested. This region prepares for the worst.

Right now we offer the first five nations to join the possibility to get a seat as either Homeland Officer, Security Officer, Communications Officer, Diplomacy Officer and Reserch Officer.
