&quot;Founded&quot; by a Bunch of Wasters, when they got confused about which country they live in, The Collective Union of NationTerritories is more a mutual exchange of good booze, than any real political assembly.
Delegates from Zantonnia are ceremoniously invited to the Bunch of Wasters parliamentary body for a feast each Tuesday, and welcomed back for the following week, in what has become the only patriotic tradition of a Bunch of Wasters.
