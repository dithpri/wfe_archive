Welcome all! This is a new region where anyone who joins will have a voice. My hope is to create a fair region where everyone is respected, has a say in the government, has an equal chance to become a chairmen, and most importantly everyone is happy. Alas, every good region needs some guidelines to follow: (Except in an Anarchy I suppose haha)
1. Profanity is by all means allowed
2. Flaming is not tolerated at all
3. It is asked that you respect your region-mates.
4. Please use appropriate spelling and grammar (this is not forced, but encouraged)
