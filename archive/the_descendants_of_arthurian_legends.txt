The Descendants of Arthurian Legends are only but a few chosen leaders destined to have a spot as a descendant. to be a descendant, you must have a pure heart. A descendant has to be one of the bravest persons in the world. a descendant must obey by The Chivalry Code. only then will that person be a descendant of Arthurian Legends.
A descendant must not attack without reason, unless that descendant was attacked or threatened first. A descendant also mustn&#39;t turn their back on their comrades when they are in dire need of help. If that happens, then they are removed from being a descendant and is the enemy from then on, unless they move to an allied region.
