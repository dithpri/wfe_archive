We welcome all nations and nation creators to the Colonies of the Arctic Circle. Our little region  developed in the unoccupied islands in the northernmost parts of the world. Joining us is easy. Just bring some food, a few friends, and plant your flag anywhere that has not been claimed, even an iceberg. Conquering the world has never been more fun!
