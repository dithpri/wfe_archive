National Anthem

This is an island,
In an ocean...
This is our nation,
First in the world!

Let it be, evergreen,
Let it be, evergreen.

This is an island,
In an ocean...
This is our world,
Third from the sun!

Turtles and Liberty,
Horses in the evergreen!
I lay my shell,
Down to thee!

The Agenda:

1. We need a name for the Union currency
2. We need a national anthem.
3. We need a national flag.
