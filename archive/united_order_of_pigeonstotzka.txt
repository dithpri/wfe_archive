[b][color=003153]Per our commission, the Privateers of [region]The Democratic Republic[/region] have set forth in a warlike manner to, by force of arms, attack, subdue, seize, and take all founderless regions with whom we do not have diplomatic relations and to subject them to the force of authority that is the Consul. With this we hope to bring the rule of law and governance that is the Democratic Republic to all lawless, broken, and defenseless regions that lay scattered throughout NationStates.[/color]
