The Individualist People of the Region, (IPR), is a new region founded on the ideas of Individualism, Anti-Collectvism, and Individualist Anarchism. The IPR is Atheistic in nature and does not tolerate Organized Religion. The Leader of Travidohviha founded this new region to help formulate a congregate group of people with Individualistic ideals into one Regime, in order to spark a new revolution against tyranny, oppression, and any other forms which hold the standards against the only true philosophy of the world; Individualism. Individualism works, it&amp;#39;s the only philosophy that protects freedom and liberty, and it safeguards against Nations and other Governments that violate an Individuals right to Personal Property.
