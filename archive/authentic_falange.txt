[b][color=red]After the Falangist Fascists lost their platform of hate [region]The Falange Movement[/region], it&amp;#39;s Founder[/color] National Syndicalism/Phalanx Front [color=red]was [i]very[/i] impolite and sent very silly and naughty abusive telegrams to the [region]Antifa[/region].[/color][/b]

[b]Dear [color=red]National Syndicalism/Phalanx Front[/color], perhaps you considered we may report you to the mods, but instead our response shall be one of action, and for you crushing and humiliating defeat yet again, a lesson you should have learnt after we smashed your platform of hate [region]The Falange Movement[/region].[/b]

[b][color=red]Now wave Goodbye also to [region]PHALANX INTERNATIONAL[/region] and [region]Authentic Falange[/region].[/color][/b]

[b]You said you were coming for us. We said &amp;#39;boo!&amp;#39; and you ran away and left your Fascist regions to be smashed to pieces again.[/b]

[B][color=red]ANTI[/color]FA![/b]
