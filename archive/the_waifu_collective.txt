The Waifu Collective is a cultured region for those who have truly devoted themselves to their chosen waifu! Relationships? What&#39;re those? It sounds miserable, what with all the anger and betrayal and whatnot! Your waifu will never crash your car or burn your childhood possessions! Go get a waifu today!

Note: This region is isolationist: residency is by invitation only, and for those whom Greater Sarvente knows personally IRL. No exceptions!
