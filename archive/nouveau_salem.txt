Salem was a place where strong women were once burned. Nouveau Salem is founded on the belief that all are equal, that we all matter, and that we will never let the ignorant burn us again.

We welcome everyone, and all debate, and points of view are welcome, so long as everyone is treated with respect. 

This place is new, and I hope that if you&#146;re reading this you&#146;ll stop and help build something great.
