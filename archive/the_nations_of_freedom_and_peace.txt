The Nations of Freedom and Peace welcome all nations which preserve the ideals of Peace, Freedom, and Strength for their citizens. We believe in Freedom and Peace, and we feel that we must protect these values for ourselves because in this age, we cannot trust other regions to do so for us. To maintain freedom and maintain peace, requires strength, and we can achieve this strong and free peace together. All you have to do to make a difference is join us.
