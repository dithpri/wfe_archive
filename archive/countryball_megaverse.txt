Emerging from a time of uncertainty and transition, the CBMV seeks to offer members a space of lore building, advanced technology, and political systems. It invites enthusiasts, strategists, and authors to forge their own futures amidst the stars, overcoming the challenges of interstellar war, diplomacy, and exploration.
