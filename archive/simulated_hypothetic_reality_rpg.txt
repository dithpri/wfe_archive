With everything going on, while it all remains figuratively hypothetical, let&#39;s roleplay how the world would be if it does actually happen. Of course, we must go along with the site&#39;s ToS, and if we can all find some common ground, even our own quid pro quos, but aside from that it&#39;s a free-for-all rp region (not a jump point, that&#39;s why we have a password) and if things go smoothly than a Discord might even be made some point in the future.
