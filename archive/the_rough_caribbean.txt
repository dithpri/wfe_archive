Impoverished nations of the Caribbean with histories of exploitation by imperialists and giant banana corporations.  Think of Haiti, Jamaica, or Honduras.  Nations recovering from bauxite mining and soil abuse.  Nations reliant on off-shore casinos and secret bank accounts more than tourism.  

Role play can be casual or silly and is largely not-required. However, if you envision your nation as non-Caribbean, please consider other regions.  Thank you!
