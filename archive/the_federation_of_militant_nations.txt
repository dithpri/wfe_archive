[U][b]WELCOME TO [region]The Federation of Militant Nations[/region][/B][/U]

We are a fledgling region that is focused on invading and conquering other regions.  We plan to start with a small, but coordinated community of 5-15 nations, but we have plans to eventually grow into a much larger and much more influential international power.  If you are interested in raiding regions, but you are not sure how it works, joining this region will be a great opportunity to learn the ropes of inter-regional conquest in NationStates.

Once we have grown in population to about 20-30 nations, we will have an offsite forum, and we will install a meritocratic regional government.  For now, please review the rules of conduct below.
