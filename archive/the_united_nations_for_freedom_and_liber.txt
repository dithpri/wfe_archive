The United Nations for Freedom and Liberties was founded for those nations whose goals are to preserve freedom, but also keep with the ideas of their leaders. People have the right to Democracy, and the right to self-government. The Kingdom of Tarnowski founded this region because the people found that no other was right for them. The people of this region recognize that strong militaries to defend, keep peace, and preserve the freedom of the worlds are essential. Let freedom ring!
