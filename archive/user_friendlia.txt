Remember, the keys to the Orbital LART are to be returned after use.

Note, the orbital LART is in the northern hemisphere for this week seeking out special targets.  The secondary lart system takes a bit more time to get into position.  Cars and trucks only can go so fast, depending on road (or lack thereof) conditions.  We have now added more trucks, and a hovercraft to the secondary LART system.  Also, the closet has been refilled with clue-bats.  We have added a Kerbal launch assist system as well.
