Welcome to the Roma Confederacy! When you&amp;#39;re here, you&amp;#39;re family!

Any communication with the Roma Confederacy during peacetime must go through the Director of Foreign Affairs, The Dictatorship of Wall Village.

The Holy Empire of Prachtvolles is our warhead and Delegate.

The Empire of Shadar is our founder, and will not make any embassies without consulting his cabinet above, as well as the rest of the Confederacy.

Have fun!
