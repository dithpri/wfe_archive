The Roma Confederacy started as simply a few villages in the sweltering desert banding together in order to insure each other&amp;#39;s survival. Later on, the shamans of each village went their separate ways with the promise of alliance later on. 

While now seen as nations by the world, we are still weak, and very much like the villages of our roots. In this we will accept other fledgling nations as they try to survive in this new era of powerful nations. But together, we will be able to face any danger. Together, we will grow faster and stronger than any of us can grow alone. Together, we are the Roma Confederacy.
