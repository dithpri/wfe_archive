Hello friend! Welcome to the Roma Confederacy!

Picture this:

We are all that lonely person by ourselves, and the giant regions around us, clamoring for our attention and support, are the looming trees staring at us from above. Its hard to know what to do sometimes, and that&amp;#39;s where we come in. As of right now we don&amp;#39;t have any agenda; our goal is simply to thrive. To band together as a force for justice and tacos. You have a choice between pills; red or blue? Grab your sonic screwdriver, find a Portal Stone, and punch an orc on the way. When the day is done, rest your hooves by the fire and buck an apple from the toffee tree.

Welcome to adventure. We will be your guide.
