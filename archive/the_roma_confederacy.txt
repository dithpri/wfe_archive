We need you. Go through the TARDIS into Narnia and help us fight against Alduin&amp;#39;s horde of Shadowspawn. Take Excalibur and charge foward alongside your trusty pony to protect the One Ring. You see, this is elementary. With great power comes great responsibilty, and we fall so we can learn to get back up again. Prepare yourself, and may the odds be ever in our favor.
