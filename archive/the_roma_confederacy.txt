Hello friend! Welcome to the Roma Confederacy!

Picture this:

A person, alone and lost, stumbling along in a dark forest, where trees loom around him (or her), staring down at him (or her), wondering whether or not to eat him (or her).

We are all that lonely person by ourselves, and the giant regions around us, clamoring for our attention and support, are the trees. Its hard to know what to do sometimes, and that&amp;#39;s where we come in. As of right now we don&amp;#39;t have any agenda; our goal is simply to thrive. To band together as a force for justice and tacos. You have a choice between pills; red or blue? Grab your sonic screwdriver, find a Portal Stone, and punch an orc on the way.

Welcome to adventure. We will be your guide.
