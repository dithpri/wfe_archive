The Roma Confederacy is a medium sized region. All nations are welcome, regardless of viewpoint. As of October 5th 2013, we are neutral in our view of the World Assembly and the Security Council. However, we stand by our allies and individual nations and will defend our honor and our lands by any means possible.
