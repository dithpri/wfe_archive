The Roma Confederacy aims to spread our anti-WA sentiment. We are tired of its corrupt treatment of nations and its obsolete laws. We shall spread the light of our enlightenment to other nations in any means necessary.

[region]The Crusaders of The Roma Confederacy[/region] is where we hold our military force. They have bravely volunteered to both stand against regions who threaten the continuation of this revolution as well as spreading the light in the darkness, and we who stand in protest commend them.

We welcome all nations who wish to stand with us, whether it be in our region or through an embassy. However, if you currently hold an embassy with us but support the WA, you need not worry.

MAY THE RESISTANCE LIVE ON.
