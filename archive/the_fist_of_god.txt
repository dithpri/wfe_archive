[region]The Fist of God[/region] is a region under strife--- forever battling [b]Conservatism[/b], [u]Liberalism[/u], and [i]Moderation[/i].

The [color=red]Fist of God Conservatives[/color] protect the region, under God, indivisible while the [color=blue]Liberals[/color] attempt to bring in &amp;quot;new ideals&amp;quot; which threaten the very fabric of the space-time continuum!

The [color=yellow]Moderates[/color] govern their countries the best they can and to survive whether liberalism or conservatism prevail.

Ideas and government reign supreme.
War and Peace are in the balance.
Stability is unknown...
