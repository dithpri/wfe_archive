[color=darkred][region]Thera[/region] is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km southeast of Greece&#39;s mainland, named for the volcano which famously erupted on the island in the middle Bronze Age and covered Akrotiri, the most important settlement, in pumice and volcanic ash, thereby perfectly preserving the Bronze Age town.
