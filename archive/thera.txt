[color=blue]Welcome to Thera![/color]

This is actually a whole anther world, separate from Earth, and a collaborative effort on the the part of all nations in it. We welcome all kinds, we only have one requirement. Be as dedicated to detail, roleplay, and realism as we are. The founder is just the recruiting office for the region, the nations within this region wield as much power as they usurp for themselves via roleplay. Below are some links to things about our region you may like. Also, we are currently working on a NSWiki page, and hope to have it all up soon. Please look over our region, and join if you&amp;#39;re interested.
