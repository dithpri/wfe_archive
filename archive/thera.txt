Thanks for giving us a look. I want to start with a Regional War, against a handful of nations I will puppet. Currently, I&amp;#39;m mainly looking for 2 other nations to act as other regional powers (in addition to Glanodel). I have password locked the region until I find them. This region will be ROLEPLAY HEAVY and detail will be crucial! I plan to make an NSWiki and the [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Elrion/index/]Offsite Forum[/url] is up and running. Check us out, and Join if it&amp;#39;s for you! :-)

NOTE: If you want to play the opposing nations in this war, that&amp;#39;s fine. Just understand the point is to defeat you. This war is the reason a regional gov. is formed. After the war, you are welcome to play out your nation&amp;#39;s attempts at atonement.
