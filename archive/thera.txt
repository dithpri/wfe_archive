[color=blue]Welcome to Thera![/color]

So Thera is a work in progress at the moment, and we are mostly looking for people to help in the construction. We are looking only for hardcore role-players! And not in the sexy way! We strive for depth, realism, a butt-load of detail, and we want people who are motivated to join, be active, and stay active (taking the unexpected into account). We already have an offsite, maps, and we are working on the [url=http://www.nswiki.net/]NSWiki[/url]. If you are passionate about role-playing, please join!
