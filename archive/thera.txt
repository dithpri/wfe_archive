Thanks for giving us a look. I want to start with a Regional War, against a handful of nations I will puppet. Currently, I&amp;#39;m mainly looking for 1 other nations to act as 3rd regional powers. I have password locked the region until I find them. This region will be ROLEPLAY HEAVY and detail will be crucial! I plan to make an NSWiki and the [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Elrion/index/]Offsite Forum[/url] is up and running. Check us out, and join if it&amp;#39;s for you! :-)

If you&amp;#39;re interested we are set in an alternate reality, not Earth. So free reign on most things. It is also post modern.
