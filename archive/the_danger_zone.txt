&amp;quot;Danger Zone&amp;quot;

Revvin&amp;#39; up your engine
Listen to her howlin&amp;#39; roar
Metal under tension
Beggin&amp;#39; you to touch and go

Highway to the Danger Zone
Ride into the Danger Zone

Headin&amp;#39; into twilight
Spreadin&amp;#39; out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin&amp;#39; off the deck
And shovin&amp;#39; into overdrive

Highway to the Danger Zone
I&amp;#39;ll take you
Right into the Danger Zone

They never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You&amp;#39;ll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Out along the edge
Is always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the Danger Zone
I&amp;#39;m gonna take you
Right into the Danger Zone
Highway to the Danger Zone
Right into the Danger Zone
