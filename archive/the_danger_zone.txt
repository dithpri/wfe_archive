A wild, untamed region with explosions, monster trucks and flying sharks.  The Danger Zone is an independent, rugged region and very few are resilient enough to survive here.  It was first unified by our eternal leader, Joseph Stalin, whose will is interpreted by our current leader.  We make our own decisions and don&#39;t abide by any sort of international court.  Screw that.  The Danger Zone is a completely self-sufficient, and we don&#39;t need no man.
