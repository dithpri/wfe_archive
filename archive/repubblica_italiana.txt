[b][region]Repubblica Italiana[/region]
By the first century BC, the Roman Empire ([region]Imperium Romanum[/region]) emerged as the dominant power in the Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and religious center, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than 200 years during which Italy&#39;s law, technology, economy, art, and literature developed. Italy remained the homeland of the Romans and the metropole of the empire, whose legacy can also be observed in the global distribution of culture, governments, Christianity and the Latin script. Italy became a republic after a referendum held on 2 June 1946, a day celebrated since as Republic Day.
