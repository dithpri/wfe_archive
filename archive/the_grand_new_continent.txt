The Grand New Continent is a huge, newly terraformed, landmass in the middle of the ocean.  

It was created to be a libertarian&#39;s paradise, or at least in the libertarian spirit. You can do whatever you want here. If you&#39;re a horribly corrupt dictator, go ahead and oppress your citizens all you like. If you&#39;re a left wing flower child, good on ya, give your citizens all the free love and mind expanding drugs until their third eye sees that truth of the universe lies in microwave burritos. We take all comers. 

On the forum, flame wars are acceptable (within reason, we don&#39;t want to draw the ire of the World Assembly), as are intelligent debates. This region will be as a cornucopia of humanity and world leaders.
