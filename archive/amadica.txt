my name is elliot the g and i believe in parsimony
a member of the north american tribe: shoshone
we hate anyone who is a phoney

as a side on our rigatoni
in our homes made of adobe
which provide protection when it gets snowy

holy moly. minestrone.

who speaks a Finnic language spoken by Finnish people living in the Ural Mountains in russia called Komi.
