Amadica is a minuscule region, inhabited by four nations.
Denizens of the Amadica are poorly educated, with rampant illiteracy. Criminality is rife within the region, with law enforcement struggling to cope.  Denizens have small defense forces. Public transport is an afterthought, with only -1% of total government budgets in the region being devoted to it.
Governments in Amadica find themselves in a constant state of disarray, with very little co-ordination, only -1% on average of government budgets being devoted to Administration. 
Social inequality is rife amongst the nations within Amadica. The environments of the nations in the region are almost universally appalling.
