The Sovereignty is controlled by several Departments, each taking its own place to govern the country. The Department of Human Resources manages citizens and ensures a healthy work environment for all! The Department of Ideas is in charge of monitoring content and other things that citizens create. The Department of Engineering runs the region&#39;s infrastructure. The Department of Economics monitors and controls the economy, making sure it is stable and fair.
The Sovereignty&#39;s primary export is our famed bottlecaps, and other plastic products. In total, these exports make up a total of 30% of our economy, and is the pride of our nation!
We hope you join us in our plastic prosperity.
