[i][color=crimson][b]Of Carbon, Silicone, and Sulfur, the Enigmata Spiral rears all.[/b][/color][/i]
[hr]
The Enigmata Spiral is a spiral galaxy bearing three irregulars in an orbit around it. It and Its neighbors are uncharted and certainly unpredictable. Any sort of humanic or xenosentient entities could lie out there, [i]anything.[/i] All are welcome, whether you&#39;ve had years of RP experience marked or you are just starting, the Spiral welcomes all! Build your nation into anything you want, from deep-sea creatures to biochemical bizarreness.
