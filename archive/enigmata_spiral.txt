[color=bronze][b]Greetings, Traveler! Your current location is the [region]Enigmata[/region] Spiral![/b][/color]
[hr]
[i]The Enigmata Spiral is an untamed, uncontrolled, and most certainly unexplored galaxy. The stoking of starfire has given heat to the cold, laying way for various alien lifeforms. You are among these alien creatures who seek to establish themselves in a raw galactic landscape. The stars burn as one, will you struggle as one, or die as many?[/i]
