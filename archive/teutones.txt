The Teutons (Latin: Teutones, Teutoni) were a Germanic tribe mentioned by Greek and Roman authors, notably Strabo and Marcus Velleius Paterculus. According to a map by Ptolemy, they originally lived in Jutland, which is in agreement with Pomponius Mela, who placed them in Scandinavia (Codanonia), although there was disagreement by these scholars whether or not they were related to the Celts.
