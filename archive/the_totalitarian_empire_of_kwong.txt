The Totalitarian Empire of Kwong is run by The Mighty Chong Kwong, who runs it from the administrative sector known as The Dominion of Mighty Chong Kwong.

To join, nations must:

- Be oppressive to citizens, spying on them and keeping them in order.
- Marginalise the poor as they are worthless.
- Focus on hard work to bring money to the Empire.
- Hold large corporations in high esteem as they yield attractive sums of money to the powers of the Empire.

Nations in the Empire will be direct representatives of Chong Kwong and must dictate according to these values.
