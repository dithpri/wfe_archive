[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] set forth into temple, where they ventured forth, only to be confronted by angry skeleton regions! The Hawks triumphantly destroyed their foes and claimed them as their own. They encountered firelions, airpods, and ran from a large rock.They reached the end, when a gargoyle water buffalo asked them a riddle. The Hawks stood there, puzzled then the answer came to Varax, and she triumphantly proclaimed &quot;ATLA&quot; and the vault swung open...leading the Hawks to their prize.
