If you plan to attack, be aware that we are currently working on a Manticore/Langolier hybrid, that, so long as they don&#39;t consume our population(s) before we can train them, will make excellent &quot;warhounds&quot;. All joking aside, we are two people with very different ideas about politics, who happen to agree on a few random things. SO, call this a kind of experiment if you will. We try not to argue politics at home, so we figured we&#39;d give it a go here. So far, I (the esteemed and all powerful dictator of VanDennys) am winning. Scoreboard to be updated periodically.
