The plateau slopes towards the extreme southern plain with some irregularity, but its limits east and west are less abrupt.To the east descends in a sharp fault, by vertical steps of 1,000 to 2,000 feet (300 to 600 meters).This Cliff, called The Great Cliff or the Angavo Cliff, is often unreachable and itself bordered by Betsimisaraka Escarpment, another lower cliff to the east which overhangs the coast.Hinter scarp are the remains of ancient lakes, including the Alaotra one To the south the two steep gradients meets and form Mahafaly and the Androy plateaus that encircle the sea with steep slopes.The descent to the west is made in series of stairs.
