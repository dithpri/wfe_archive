The Federal States of North America is a role play region focused on running states within the country of the FSA, which at this moment encompasses the United States and Canada. Players in who join the region will have the control to shape the nation&#39;s identity and it&#39;s laws. The goal is to create a rich RP experience that will see characters rise from state leaders to a force on the national stage.
