This region will act as a continuation of the [region]Lesothobourg Union[/region]. As Lesothobourg, the founder of [region]Lesothobourg Union[/region], was DEATed, I am taking over the region. We will continue the same Regional Map, we will try to acquire the same embassies, and continue everything from [region]Lesothobourg Union[/region].
