Follow the instructions in the dispatch to claim land. Map is [url=http://postimg.org/image/6w5pd7sd7/full/]here[/url]! or zoomed out, but with lower quality [url=http://postimg.org/image/6w5pd7sd7/]here[/url]!

Anything I update on NS (except the map), things updated in the most recent update will be [color=red]red[/color] incase you want to see new things. Anything recent will be in [color=darkblue]dark blue[/color], so that it isn&amp;#39;t annoying, but is still noticeable.
