Anything I update on NS (except the map), things updated in the most recent update will be [color=red]red[/color] incase you want to see new things. Anything recent will be in [color=darkblue]dark blue[/color], so that it isn&amp;#39;t annoying, but is still noticeable.

Re-starting the GLR, see if we get any steam this time!
