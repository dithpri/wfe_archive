[color=darkgrey][u][b]The German Colonial Empire[/b][/u][/color]
[i][color=grey]The German Colonial Empire consisted of the overseas colonies, protectorates, and territories of the German Empire. Initially, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck opposed colonial expansion, but the Scramble for Africa in 1884 made it necessary to compete with other powers.

The empire stretched from Africa to Oceania, including territories in China. Most colonies were lost during the Great War, though German East Africa resisted until the war&#146;s end. The Treaty of Versailles in 1918 officially transferred control to the victors, and the empire was dissolved by 1920.[/color][/i]
