Welcome to the [b][color=#ba1215]Universal House of Justice.[/color][/b][hr]The Universal House of Justice is based off of the real word Baha&#39;i Universal House of Justice. Its goal is to be a large center of community for people, regardless of faith.

We accept all embassies except with regions that prove to be problematic and dangerous. We also work to support Baha&#39;i communities anywhere and minister to the Baha&#39;i community. We hope to support spreading the word of Baha&#39;u&#39;llah.

(Work in progress. Feel free to apply for embassies!)
