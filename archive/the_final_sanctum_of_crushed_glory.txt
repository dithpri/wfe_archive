 [U][B][COLOR=Maroon]The Final Sanctum of Crushed Glory[/COLOR][/B][/U]
 
[I] Since being a fledgling nation we have risen above to become different from the rest.  Our only purpose is to be the most powerful region imaginable.  We won&#39;t stop striving to be the best and you won&#39;t be able to make us stop either.  If you try to stop us we will crush you like the maggot you are.  Our troops only have one job.  Don&#39;t stop working or we&#39;ll get you out in order to eliminate all the slackers.   Move along now or join.  Your choice.[/I]
