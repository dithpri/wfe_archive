
The Greek Orthodox Church, or Greek Orthodoxy, is the body of several churches within the larger communion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity whose liturgy is or was traditionally conducted in Koine Greek.

The history, traditions, and theology of Greek Orthodox Christianity are rooted in the early Church Fathers and the culture of the Byzantine Empire, which was heavily Greek. The church traditionally places great emphasis and value to monasticism and asceticism, which are rooted in early Christian practices in the Near East and Byzantine Anatolia.

The Greek Orthodox Church is not restricted to ethnic Greeks or the Greek language.
