This Grand Union of Nations exists in the name of the Supreme Species, the Llama (and the Alpaca). Proudly does this Grand Union bear the animal upon its banner, for no animal deserves more respect than the llama (except of course, each country&#39;s individual national animals, which are held in equal regard).

[region]The Grand Union of the Supreme Llama[/region] hereby pledges itself to the preservation and adoration of the Llama, and declares itself a proudly independent region.
