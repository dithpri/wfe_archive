This is, as you know from the region name, The Graveyard of Heroes. This is a place created so that I may come and rest, away from the rest of NationStates, among the graves of those who have fallen.

I imagine here to be an overgrown graveyard, with massive, imposing statues of warriors dotting the area. I imagine sitting in their shadows, on a carpet of moss, while birds sing in the trees above. The graveyard is quite large, and beyond it sit miles and miles of forest and grassy plains, with rivers intertwining between it all.

This is a place for peace, amongst mighty men now dead but forever alive. This is a place where worry and violence, harm and sorrow do not enter, can not enter.
