Hymn:

They&#39;ve kept us silent
They&#39;ve kept us down
They&#39;ve kept us waiting
And now they will pay
We will stand in hope
We will stand in strength
We will stand against the hate
We will stand until death
Hope of the republic,
Hope of the revolution,
Hope of the righteous,
Hope of the free
