Never Surrender!

Welcome! Stop by and vacation with our crazy Wandering Ninjas. We serve lemonade and margaritas, entrails, and other delights! No uniform required.

Okay, so we&amp;#39;re not all ninjas but we do like the occasional walk on the wild side. ;] No reservations necessary.

End note: We remain neutral towards any defenders or raiders who are traveling through the region.

Founded in May 2004.

Refounded September 2010 (Last Founder: Boolari)
