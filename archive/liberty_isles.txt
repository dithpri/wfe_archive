[color=red]This region is now closed[/color]

We are a region of likeminded individual regions. Civil, personal, and economic freedoms are all important to each nation within our region. Before joining however, we supplied a short list of rules:

1. Although voting is not mandatory, it is strongly recommended. We have plenty of votes and elections, and
participation in polls is the best way to be an active member.

2. Votes and elections only last two weeks, so all nations within the region should receive a telegram when a vote or election begins. The vote or election can be found at the bottom of the region&#39;s page.

3. Alternate Nations may not vote or hold office, as long as their primary accounts are in the region also.

Thank you for joining Liberty Isles.
