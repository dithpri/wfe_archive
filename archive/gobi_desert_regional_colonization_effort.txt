A alternate world above the Gobi Desert where instead of the mongol empire it&amp;#39;s the Merespian Empire. A nation that took Japan, China, Most of the HRE, and where Sweden would be today. Though after the great king Ignus Romanus died in 1098 A.D. (who had never named an heir) the country crumbled. But a long lost heir was found right before (an alternate) World War 1 (which in this timeline, eventually set World War 1 in motion). Many people rebelized to take what china said was theirs (where Mongolia would be) and recreated the Merespian Empire. Now most of the population lives above the Gobi desert (Though rumors have stated they&amp;#39;re making ways to inhabit the hot desert).
