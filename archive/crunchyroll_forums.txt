The Crunchyroll Forums are a tropical wetland inhabited by numerous exotic beasts. Within this region exist a multitude of nations struggling to survive and thrive within it -- each of them possessing a unique culture and society as well as varying economies, forms of government, etc. It&#39;s said that the countries which inhabit the region were once united by a common love of anime, but for unknown reasons they split apart and became their own sovereign nations.
