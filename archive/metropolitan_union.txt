[u]Four city-states: Sernet, Belmore, Woodsmere and Moreham. 
Many, many colonies.
One Metropolitan Union.[/u]

[region]Metropolitan Union[/region] is a region of four city-states and their colonies, as well as Senatus Island, an island which does not belong to one of the city-states, but all of them; it is home to the MetUnion Senate House. That is a brief summary of the Union as nationstates won&#39;t let me type up a whole essay.

Oh yes I forgot to mention [b]WE LOVE RAILWAYS![/b]

Our embassy policy is as follows: we will accept any embassy request unless the region is nazi or gives me a genuine cause for concern.
