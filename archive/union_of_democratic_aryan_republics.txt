The Union of Democratic Aryan Republics welcomes member nations who wish to join our sacred movement which is dedicated to providing a secure and prosperous democratic socialist homeland for the Aryan peoples. 

Today, we begin our Union with but a single state, founded by Aryan settlers from across the globe and from many walks of life. From humble beginnings, we grow day by day in the firm conviction that through the power of the united will of our people we shall one day achieve the greatest aspirations of the Aryan spirit. 

Long Live the Aryans!
