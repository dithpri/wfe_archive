[color=red]I have no desire for a homeland and have no fixed residence.I do not experience the initial suffering of partiality of thinking of &amp;#39;this is my land and that place isn&amp;#39;t.&amp;#39;  I do not experience the intermediate suffering of yearning for my land.  And I do not experience the ultimate suffering of having to fight for my land.  Therefore I do not have a fixed abode.[/color]
