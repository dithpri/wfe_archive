The People&amp;#39;s Military District is a district that is very diverse, creating a situation that is very interesting. Inner-Region Wars occur, and things are always changing. From Dictatorships to Democracy, this is similar to the real world. Some countries are pro-nuclear, others are world peace. Alliances are forged, resource importing and exporting is common. Each country has its pros and cons. Only fate will tell if these nations can put differences aside to help their people.
