To fight communism is an act of honor. An act which will prevent the decay of society and it&amp;#39;s fall into a dark abysss. Communism aims to disregard hierarchy, to disband the state, to equalise the unequal... it is inhuman to do so. We fight not just because of joy, but, because we must guard humanity from this plague.
