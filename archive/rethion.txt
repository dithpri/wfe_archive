[color=gold][b]Rethion is an annoying little planet with a cool name, home to militant vegans, hipsters and musicians which care for the environment.[/b] It could also be your new home, if you so choose! Trust us, we have a friendly community, a nice little world map in construction (will be finished soon, promises much), weekly community-based Polandball art dispatches and fun and games![/color]

[color=grey]Please do not endorse your WA Delegate, instead write in the RMB your favourite song! It&#39;s much easier and more fun than you&#39;d expect. If our World Factbook Entry hasn&#39;t convinced you, then feel free to TG Thyvor, the departed founder of Rethion, who will talk you through the major mechanics and fun things to do in the community.
