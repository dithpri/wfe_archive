We are the legions of the Latin (meaning the old language from Rome) Hell. We&amp;#39;re into domination, autocracy, complete control over citizens, and we&amp;#39;re big on making sure crime is non-existent. (At least concerning the citizens.) If you don&amp;#39;t have an [i]incredibly invasive[/i], controlling country, don&amp;#39;t join. We&amp;#39;re not afraid to wage war or take over regions! We are few, but AWESOME. We control our citizens with an iron fist and we shall DOMINATE! FEAR US! 
[b][u]SEMPER NOS SUMUS MALI!!!![/u][/b]
P.S. We do give some basic rights. We&amp;#39;re into allowing the citizens to go along with their own lives...as long as they don&amp;#39;t slip up.
