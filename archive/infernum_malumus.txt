We are the legions of the Latin (meaning the old language from Rome) Hell. We&amp;#39;re into domination, autocracy, complete control over citizens, and we&amp;#39;re big on making sure crime is non-existent. (At least concerning the citizens.) We are AWESOME. We control our citizens with an iron fist (but they live fairly freely) and we shall DOMINATE! FEAR US!

P.S. We do give some basic rights. We&amp;#39;re into allowing the citizens to go along with their own lives...as long as they don&amp;#39;t slip up.
