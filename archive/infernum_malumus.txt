We are the legions of the Latin (meaning the old language from Rome) Hell. We&amp;#39;re into domination, autocracy, complete control over citizens, and we&amp;#39;re big on making sure crime is non-existent. (At least concerning the citizens.) If you don&amp;#39;t have an [i]incredibly invasive[/i], controlling country, don&amp;#39;t join. We&amp;#39;re not afraid to wage war or take over regions! We are few, but AWESOME. We control our citizens with an iron fist and we shall DOMINATE! FEAR US! SEMPER NOS SUMUS MALI!!!!
