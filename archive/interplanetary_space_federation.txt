Welcome to our interplanetary federation! Just before the fall of Reynoldistan, her people found a way to travel faster than the speed of light. These warp drives allowed ships to warp the space around them and thus move through it very quickly. However, this was not commercialized as Reynoldistan tore itself apart in a civil war. A small group of survivors fled on these ships and aimed to start a new civilization among the stars. They hope that some day, other nations will follow and create a community in the final frontier.
