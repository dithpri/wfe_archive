[b][color=blue]Welcome to the Anglosphere![/color][/b]!
The Anglosphere is an alliance, or union, of the principle Anglo, or Anglo-influenced nations. The Anglosphere generally includes:
[b][color=blue]The United States[/color]
[color=pink]Canada[/color]
[color=red]The United Kingdom[/color]
[color=yellow]Australia[/color]
[color=green]Ireland[/color]
New Zealand[/b]

Sometimes, [b][color=orange]South Africa[/color][/b] and [b][color=brown]India[/color][/b] are thrown in, depending on who you ask. Why an Anglosphere, you may ask? Well, it is quite obvious to see that these aforementioned countries share common laws, a common language, a common culture, and are all very close military allies. So, Yanks, Brits, Canucks, Aussies, and Kiwis, this is your place. This is place where Americans, Canadians, Britons, Australians, Irish, and New Zealanders can all get along!
