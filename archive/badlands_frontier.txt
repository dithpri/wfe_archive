[b]Welcome to the Wasteland![/b]
A region of lawless villainy, Imperialist conquerors, and roaming alien invaders, the [region]Badlands Frontier[/region] is a region on the edge of the world, renowned for it&#146;s pervasive slave trade, primarily scavenging based economy, and absolute dictators, the Badlands is an utterly awful place to live - yet, it continues to have a massive civilian population, of numerous species - primarily humans, with some exceptions.

In other words, a medium-sized RP region.
