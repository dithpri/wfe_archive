[i][b]Welcome to Unclear!

[color=grey]On the other side of Planet Ilanda from [region]The Majestia[/region], Unclear is super foggy. Foggier than any other region in Ilanda&#146;s star system.[/color]

[color=#AAAAAA]Many have gone missing in the extreme fogs of Unclear. Its guardian, Anna Simona, houses the only known surviving organisms in this region.[/color][/b][/i]
