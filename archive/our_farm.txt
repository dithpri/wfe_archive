Welcome to Our Farm

A pleasant countryside abode where the sun (which appears a minimum of twice a day to meet new regulations) is hot, the springs (which run through the occaisonal manufactured gully) are cool, and explosions are sometimes seen over the ridge (behind which we all know the RSA (Regional Security Agency) hold their daily target practice).
