[i]Embrace that which the Balance hath weighed, let a path be made for the Osiris in the Great Valley, and let the Osiris have light to guide him on his way.
He hath reconciled the Two Fighters (Horus and Set), the guardians of life.
Break the immovable yoke that we may sleep.
That silence may reign and we may sleep.[/i]
