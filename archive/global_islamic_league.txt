We are here to create the most powerful Islamic league in Nation-states. Our principles are:
Collective Defence: An attack on one of us is an attack on ALL of us.
Annexation: All are allowed to annex others outside our league.
NOTE: Annexation must be justified in order to prevent condemnation by others. Justified condemnation will lead to EJECTION.
Economic Development: We will assist our fellow nations when they are faced with economic ruin.
NOTE:
As I have said already,
Any unjustified attack will result in expulsion from the league.
