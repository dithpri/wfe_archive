[b][color=red][region]Neo Communism[/region] had been invaded by the Invader region [region]The Shadow of Mordor[/region] and is listed among their conquests, but [url=http://ns-comintern.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=fleetinfo][u]The Red Fleet[/u][/url] has now freed [region]Neo Communism[/region] from their grasp and it will now once more be a left-wing region open to Comrades and travellers.[/color][/b]

[b]Dear [region]The Shadow of Mordor[/region], do you remember [region]The Internationale[/region]? A couple of months ago some of you went there and spammed it&amp;#39;s RMB in order to impress your friends [region]The Greater German Reich[/region].[/b]

[b][color=red][region]The Internationale[/region] now has a message for you as if the liberation of [region]Neo Communism[/region] from your weak grasp does not speak loudly enough for you.[/color][/b]
