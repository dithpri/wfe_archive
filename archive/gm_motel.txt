Good morning!
Welcome to the Good Morning Motel!
The GM Motel offers a great happy place to stay if you need puppet storage, or you haven&amp;#39;t decided on a permanent region as a home, or if you are hiding out before you raid a region, or if you were just raided, or if you are recruiting.
Whatever the case, welcome!

Our Motel Manager is Zetya!
Say hi to the Room Service Manager, Poptropicaland!
And this is the Front Desk Clerk, Mehmeh!
Plus, meet the Head Bellhop, [nation=Angrywing]!
