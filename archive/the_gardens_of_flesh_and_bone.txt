A lone gravemarker stands among the blackened leaves of the flora and fauna of the Gardens, the home of Heras Savaer. Emblazoned upon that gravemarker glow the following:
[i][color=red]Embittered call of war, bloodstained tears,
Sanguine memories dot the sky, let go your life and be at my side,
Swallow your soul, cease your pride,
An ember sparks, and a storm shall preside

The firestorm dies in ashes blown,
a cold, damp air sets into the snow,
bones blackened, heat begone,
Cold, dark arms embracing the stone[/i][/color]

The air has become still, the dark one no longer stirs.
