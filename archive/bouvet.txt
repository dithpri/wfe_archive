Bouvet is a remote island in the South Atlantic ocean. Being so far south, it is permanently covered in snow. The nearest landmass to it is Antarctica, and the next nearest is Tristan da Cunha. Its location means that it is an important place for penguins to rest and raise their young. Currently, it is claimed by Norway despite its desolate location, but in the nationstates dimension, it is currently controlled by the puppet family of [nation]Qawe[/nation] as a nature reserve. For now, we only seek to observe the penguins from a distance, but in the future, with impending changes to the universe, it may see another use as a strategic location.
