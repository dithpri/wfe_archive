Cyberia is a fractured near-future world shaped by collapsing governments, megacities rising over decaying rural zones, climate instability, and rapid technological evolution.

The year is 2049.

Old powers faded. New regimes; democratic, authoritarian, corporate, technocratic, militarized, or anarchic - struggle to define the future.

Cybernetics, drones, urban surveillance, private militaries, and high-density habitat towers are common.
Global politics are unstable.
Borders shift.
Alliances rise and fall.

Every nation in Cyberia writes its own destiny.
