[Region]Eastern Solar System of Andromeda[/region] has been Deleted

And we hereby chant our regional anthem:

In Mondas Fields the Cybermen grow
Between the Daleks, row on row
They blow up your face, and in the sky
The Daleks, seeking death, fly
Still heard, amid the guns below

EXTERMINATE, All day you know
We went, saw Clom, saw death and gore
And now we will, regenerate,
In Mondas Fields
