Open to all like minded nations.
A confederation to ensure independence!
Really nothing else important to say (yet!)

Official:

Independent from the WA and its rulings, the CPC government is divided into four branches. The CPC government maintains the purpose to not meddle in the affairs of Commonwealth nations, yet defend core civil rights in the Commonwealth through investigations as well as defend the Commonwealth from other regions.

Core civil rights, AKA the Three Civil Commandments AKA the CCRs:
-Do not Steal
-Do not Harm
-Do not Kill

It is also Recognised that Those who Break the CCRs are not Protected by Them
