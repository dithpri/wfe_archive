The Bond of Alliance of Conservative Independent Nation II or BACIN II is region within the nation states. It will have no relationship with the leftist assembly or the World Assembly. It is completely masculine, conservative, capitalist, consumerist and independent of other nations and the leftist assembly. The national animal is the Bald Eagle. Canadian Burgers and Bacon are the national food with a side of french fries and Poutine. Steak is the leading cause of death. We are a Capitalistic/Conservative Nation where freedom of thought is important, but where communism along with feminism are forbidden.
