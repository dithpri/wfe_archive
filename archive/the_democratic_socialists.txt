We, The Democratic Socialists, believe that there are benefits of having a free market but if unregulated monopolies and corruption will happen. 
We also believe in socialist programs such as: public school, welfare, government involvement with the market, ie: regulations and a livable minimum wage.
We believe humans have basic free rights such as religion, marriage etc... But We will not allow religion to be oppressed on people.
Our goal is to make the world a better place through peaceful movements. 
While we are a relatively small region at our current moment, we still need people as we plan on becoming even larger. YOU can make the difference!
