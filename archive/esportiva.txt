Welcome to the region of Esportiva, the youngest of the three big sporting regions. We are a friendly region who are big fans of sports, and new nations, of course, are always welcome. There are a few trophies in our cabinet (not counting the Campionato), but we&#39;re always looking for some additional silverware.
