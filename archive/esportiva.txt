Greetings,

Welcome to the new-ish formed region of Esportiva. We are a friendly region who are big fans of sports, and new nations are of course, always welcome. We don&amp;#39;t have any titles to our name at the moment, but we hope to grow and prosper. 

Esportiva itself is two continents, surrounded by other, smaller islands of and seas. We are looking for nations to inhabit our new land.

Once again, Greetings
