We the [b]Confederate Nations[/b], come together to protect our [u]Regional Sovereignty[/u] and [u]Civil Liberties[/u] from any Rogue Region/Nation! We take pride in our heritage and stride to improve our way of life. As a [b][u]Republic[/b][/u], supreme power is held by the Nations and is exercised by Representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them. That power will never be infringed by the Head of State, WA Delegate, or the [region]Confederate Army[/region] itself!!!
