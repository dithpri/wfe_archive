[b]Greetings!

Your region was once a pool of miscellaneous grossness for white supremacists.

No more! Together, [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_south_pacific][color=#109AED]the South Pacific Special Forces[/color][/url] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific][color=#1F833B]East Pacific Sovereign Army[/color][/url] have decided to give this region a little clean up. We thank our friends from [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=thaecia][color=#0d5eaf]Thaecia[/color][/url], [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_union_of_democratic_states][color=#367524]The Union of Democratic States[/color][/url], [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_free_nations_region]The Free Nations Region[/url], and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_north_pacific]The North Pacific[/url] for their assistance.

We&#39;ll be here camped out for a little bit first. As you arrive, please endorse the WA Delegate [nation]Killer Song[/nation] and treasured friendo [nation]Tretrid001[/nation].[/b]
