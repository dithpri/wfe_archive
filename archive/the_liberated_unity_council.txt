Welcome to the Liberated Unity Council, the successor region to the former Unity Council! We welcome all nations and ask refugees from the former Unity Council to come here. The Liberated Unity Council wants to build an active region with a nice community or RP. All puppets must be registered, and if you join but plan to be inactive, please tell the RA. We will work at rebuilding what was formerly the Unity Council and make it better!
