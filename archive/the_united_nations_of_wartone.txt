A coalition of nations united by the idea that all ideologies can be accepted. Race, ideologies does not matter to us the only thing that matters is the ability to work as one. This coalition was founded after the fall of the Armed Nations of Wartone, a organization that believed too much in war. We believe that everyone should have a voice no matter their political beliefs.
