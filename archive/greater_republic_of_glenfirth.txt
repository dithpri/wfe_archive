A diverse region occupying a gargantuan caldeira and the mountain range surrounding it, the Greater Republic of Glenfirth is spread into several smaller administrative districts, with the Republic of Glenfirth proper and the Greater Republic&#39;s capital city of Aldburg occupying the very centre of the crater. Sheer surfaces obstruct entrance by land. The sea feeds through a tunnel in the northern cliff-face into the sprawling network of canals that run parallel to the region&#39;s roads and highways. It drains into the Firth of Glen through a tunnel in the south-east of the caldeira, with a major highway running alongside it, to provide a lifeline for the region.
