We are a group of chill dudes who play NationStates casually. No website, no discord, no social media page; just the regional chat and telegrams. Keeping it simple.

Some regions want all of their member nations to conform to their standards of political freedom and civil rights. In the Crunk Confederation, as long as you&#39;re a chill dude, you can have whatever kind of nation you want.

That goes for the regional chat too. Anyone can talk about anything they want. Nothing is off limits. 

Gabe the CrunkLord the chillest dude of them all, so message him with any inquiries.
