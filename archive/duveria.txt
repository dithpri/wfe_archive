[b][u]Overview[/u][/b]
Duveria is a massive land mass comprising of multiple races, ethnicities, cultures, governmental structures, and diverse physical and artificial topography. Duveria is not governed by any single entity; it&amp;#39;s a constant struggle of power between various sovereign states for sole control of Duveria. Duveria&amp;#39;s complex cultures and political trends have lead to increases of conflict, trade, and some limited eras of peace and prosperity among the states competing for supremacy.
