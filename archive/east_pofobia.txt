East Pofobia was created to offer shelter to members being ejected or seeking shelter from tyranny in PoFostan. There is a firm policy against ejections and persecution in East Pofobia. Since that time of trouble, East Pofobia has become an attractive retreat for those seeking peace and tranquility. ALL PoFos are welcome, regardless of their past actions or affiliations (even moderators). This region is under control of the founder, elected delgates will not have regional control. Please post a greeting message when entering and give your PoFo posting ID.
