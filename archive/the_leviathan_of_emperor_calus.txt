Emperor Calus has extended his hand to you, accepting you into his hallowed halls of Opulence aboard the Leviathan. If you should accept, he will grant you the means to true power, so you may grow fat from strength.

&quot;Nothing pleases me more than to see you fight. 

You know now that I am Calus, the last and greatest emperor of the Cabal. You know that I am Chief Gift-Giver, the Good Host with the Generous Banquet, the Prince of Mirth, and the Lord of Laughter. My plans are always bounteous, my orders delightful to obey. And though the seats at my table are prized beyond measure, the bold and passionate will never fail to earn a place in my hall.&quot; - Emperor Calus
