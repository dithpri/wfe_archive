The green Sea is mainly an inland Sea, only a small Strait leads into the Pacific. While being mostly in the continental Climate Zone the green Sea also features many different Climate Zones which even contain desert Climates.

Mostly uninhabited and without any disturbance by the World Powers this Region only got interesting in the more recent Time where Nations started to claim Territory at the green Sea or Rise from the Indigenous People of the green Sea.

Mostly an Roleplaying Region at the Fictional green Sea. Please Respect that. 
To get Access to the Region just write to me. Every quite realistic Nation Concept is possible!
