In the name of Allah, The Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful. 
All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. 
The Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful; Sovereign of the Day of Judgment. 
Thee do we worship, And from thee we seek help. 
Show us the straight Path, The Path of those who fear Allah and on whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings. 
Not of those committing wrongs deliberately On whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray. Amen

AMEN BROTHERS
