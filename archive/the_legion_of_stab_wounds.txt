this is a region just for fun and should not be taken too seriously so here are the rules

1. There is going to be ZERO interactions between our region and the WA if you don&amp;#39;t like it then leave.
2. There is going to be NO discrimination over race,religion,sexual orientation,nationality ETC. you can enforce any laws you want in your country. But don&amp;#39;t fight over which one is right or wrong.
3. Just be friendly and have fun.
