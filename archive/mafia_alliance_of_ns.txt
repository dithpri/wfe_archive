Mafia is a social deduction game that has been my main focus on NS for the last 10 years, and I believe there is a lot of untapped potential in the broader NS community. The basic premise is that there are two factions: the mafia and the town. The mafia all know each other whereas the town doesn&#39;t know who is town or who is mafia, and their job is to find and vote out all the mafia before the mafia can reach parity with the town. The mafia can also perform night kills to take one townie out of the game. The game is very similar to Town of Salem and also known as Werewolf. Shoutout to Wintreath and 10 000 Islands for setting me on this path.
