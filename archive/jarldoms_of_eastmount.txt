[B]T[/B]he [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=jarldoms_of_eastmount][b]J[/b]arldoms of [b]E[/b]astmount[/url] are Nordic realms, centered around the traditions and common laws laid down by the All Father Odin and his Godly Ilk. In the Jarldoms every Nordsman is a Karl and Freeman, forging their own path to Jarldom by the eloquency of their speech, the brawn of their swordarm, and the keenness of their mind. No Freeman can become Jarl without the support of his followers, and no Jarl can become King without the support of their fellow Jarls.
