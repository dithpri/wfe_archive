This region has been freed from it&#39;s spammy masters by TWPAF with a HUGE amount of help from Hydra and The Black Devils.  It will be refounded, if the natives would like it to be so.  Or it will be erased.

It will not be kept as a trophy.  Mostly because I&#39;m lazy, but let&#39;s pretend it&#39;s because of some ethical stand against such things.

Special thanks to Tom for being the most patient player in IRC.

An added Welcome and o/ to our Comrades from [region]the Pacific[/region]!
