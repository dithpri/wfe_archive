[color=#81BEF7]A lowly puppet did win! That is me - [nation]Wooden Puppet 11[/nation]

All other competitors were too chicken to pass the Democracy Test. Anyone want a medal? Or a Knighthood? Or a big piece of juicy slice of land? I can give them you. As I rule to be cool. 

Please be nice to everyone. 

The losers what an embarrassment, beaten by a stupid wooden puppet with no allies or any cheating. 

I thought the game was COOL but needs some improving. Especially some decent competitors, as the last bunch just ran home crying in confusion!![/color]

[color=red]PUPPETS RULE!! 4 EVER.[/color]
