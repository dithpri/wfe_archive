[b]After a long, exciting session of naval training, it seemed like we were finally done. I cleaned up Joshua&#39;s desk. When I was done, he said to me, &quot;Tomorrow we will continue your invasion, and I&#39;ll be sure to bring some sailors to reinforce.&quot; He left the room as I stood there in amazement. &quot;What an amazing Grand Admiral&quot;, I muttered to myself, and I couldn&#39;t wait for tomorrow.
