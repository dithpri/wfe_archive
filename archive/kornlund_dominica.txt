A place of all mighty power. No matter your politics,
Or your beliefs, you are welcome here. The galaxy creaks under the weight of the hand of Dominica. May Kornlund Stay Pure as it has been, and the world it inhabits stay unburned. One day, the Stars allowed us to be Titans, only for us to slightly drift apart. Yet, we survived this. However, nothing stays perfect forever.
 A Titan has split into many others, a struggling group of people on the radioactive surface of Earth, and Colossal re-awoken war Machines amongst the crumbling asteroids of Titan itself, thirsty for violence and full of foolishness.
