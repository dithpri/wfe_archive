A place of all mighty power. No matter your politics,
Or your beliefs, you are welcome here. The world creaks under the weight of the hand of Dominica. May Kornlund Stay Pure as it has been, and the world it inhabits stay unburned. One day, the Stars allowed us to be Titans, only for us to slightly drift apart. Yet, we are still one.

Soon, we shall be gods!


A SINGULAR TITAN&amp;#39;S BLADE HAS BEEN LOST TO THE AGES, AS IT HAS SHATTERED. 
THE FRAGMENTS REBUILD THEMSELVES IN SOLITUDE.
