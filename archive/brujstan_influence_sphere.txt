This is basically a roleplay region to &quot;expand&quot; my game experience with other nations, territories, organizations, ecc..., for example I (should) only have one WA and most if not every nation should have &quot;Brujstan&quot; written somewhere in their name.
Please, I do not think, but if you are an admin or a expert player let me know if what I&#39;m doing is against the rules and I will modify or disband the whole thing.
