Welcome to the Xiriq Galaxy, a diverse group of star systems, planets, and other celestial bodies. It is a free, open, and vast area in space where you, the person reading this, should begin to make your claim on the galaxy. 

Please introduce yourself on the regional RMB, enjoy your stay(however long it may be), and have fun.

If anyone would like, we can open regional rp on the RMB.

All embassy offers welcome.
