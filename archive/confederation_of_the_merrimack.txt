The Confederation of the Merrimack is, as the name says, a confederation of nations along the Merrimack river. The regional ideals are based around conservatism and nationalism. To join the confederation, simply join the region. In regards to embassies, we do not accept embassies from communist or fascist regions, so if you fit in one of those categories, we won&#39;t accept. We will, however, accept embassies with nationalist, conservative, libertarian, and monarchist regions.

The first regional elections will be held once we have at least 10 members.
