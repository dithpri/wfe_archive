[color=scarlet]This is a unique region that likes to mix socialism and nationalism, with the intention of encouraging an inwardly democratic and fair society yet outwardly maintain the social-Darwinist attitude that had enabled its members to maintain their autonomy in centuries that they have existed (after all, it&amp;#39;s not like the Kings of the Dark Ages used trade embargoes and protests to overthrow their rivals ;-)[/color]

[color=gray]Although serious knowledge in nationalism and/or socialism is encouraged to fully enjoy the region&amp;#39;s unique characteristics, it&amp;#39;s not an immediate requirement.[/color]

[color=blue](people simply wanting to know more about these seeming contradictory ideas are welcome, or those with a creative role-play persona (0).(0) )
