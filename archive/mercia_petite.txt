Mercia Petite is a relatively large island located in the Pacific Ocean. It used to be a part of the French Empire, but eventually the island declared independence. Nowadays Mercia Petite turned into a heaven for the gambling business, becoming &quot;the Las Vegas of the Pacific&quot;. The administration takes care of all the unimportant stuff, like international relations and defence. The casinos themselves are, however, left mostly to themselves. The various families of Mercia Petite manage the economic growth of the island, as well as... ahem... side deals.
