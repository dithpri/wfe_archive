The new order pact is a political alliance between nations that want to see the world changed for the better. We believe in the freedom of the common citizens who&#39;s rights and property must be up kept for the sake of liberty and freedom. We welcome anyone who can agree to these policies:
~ People should have the right to say what they please as long as it doesn&#39;t infringe on the rights of another citizen
~ People should be allowed to Own property (I&#39;m no saying Types of socialists aren&#39;t allowed )
If you can agree to both of these than your our prime candidate/audiance
