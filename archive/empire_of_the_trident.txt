The [region]Empire of the Trident[/region] has returned to Nationstates. This region was set up by Cody of Alternate History Hub on Youtube and was very active for a year and a half before it quietly died out.

This region is there in order to preserve its legacy in the form of logbooks and factbooks.

Sadly, the forum will be forever lost.
