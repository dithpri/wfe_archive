Before you enter we wish to first welcome you and then let you know that Cody is very inactive and will probably not take your suggestions for videos as 
A. He has Patreon for that.
&amp;
B. He is barely active, he is a busy man. 
 
This is a very tight-knit community and there is a lot of banter and messing around (we are not an offensive region in our eyes) but if you are very easily offended by crudity, swear words etc. then this region might not be for you. 
But on a happier note we are very accepting of newcomers who take part in RMB discussions and RP (mainly world building and such, not much wars).
