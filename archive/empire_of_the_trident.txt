Remember the past to seek the future,

This region has had a tremulous past. However, in its lifetime it had one of the most active members in all of nationstates. That is why I find it important to remember this legacy of ours and protect and maintain this region until no longer deemed worthy. That is why I reclaim this region for Emperor Cody IV, owner of the great Alternate History Hub. Might it never fall in the hands of fiendish fools again.

One final message,

Prime-Minister
