Welcome to the [region]Empire of the Trident[/region], a region made by Cody From Alternate History Hub, Cody is extremely inactive and probably won&#39;t take any video suggestions as:

A. He has Patreon for that.
&amp;
B. He is barely active, he is a busy man.
 
[color=red][B]DON&#39;T TAKE ANYTHING WE DO ON HERE SERIOUSLY. IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED PLEASE DON&#39;T LOOK AT OUR RMB. WE OFTEN MAKE JOKES THAT MIGHT OFFEND SOME PEOPLE. ALL OF US ARE FRIENDS.
[/B][/color]
But on a happier note we are a very accepting community and take part in RMB discussions and RP&#39;s.[hr]
