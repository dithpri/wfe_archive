Welcome to the Empire of the Trident, a region made by [b]TONY BAMANABONI, YES?[/b] from Alternate History Hub, Just to let you know that Cody is very inactive and probably not take any video suggestions as:  

A. He has Patreon for that.
&amp;
B. He is barely active, he is a busy man. 
 
This is a very tight-knit community and there is a lot of banter and messing around, but if you are very easily offended by crudity, profanity, memes etc. then this region might not be for you. 

But on a happier note we are a very accepting community and take part in RMB discussions and RP&#39;s.[hr]
