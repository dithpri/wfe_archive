[b][color=red]This region has been conquered by [region]Firehelm[/region]![/color][/b]

Totally deserved it. What kind of region asks for its own destruction? By [i]Nazis[/i]? Hey, you can choose if you die, but you don&#39;t get to pick your executioner. For the raiders who helped this was a raid, for the fenders who helped, this was a strike against the raiders who originally would have raided this region.

Anyway, it was a great raid, so thanks to all the Firehelm people. And also all the other wonderful people who helped without being Firehelm, because this was through the effort of a lot of people, and I individually love every single one of you, and cherish you, and you&#39;re cool.

This is a really good WFE now! Youre welcome :)
