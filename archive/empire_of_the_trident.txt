The Trident guides us upon a path of unity and salvation. Independent we are weak, and left to the horrors of barbarian raiders and heathens from distant lands. However the Trident gives us a path of power and together we can accomplish any task. Our Imperial System has spread throughout the continents and welcomed many new nations who have embraced the Trident. In our lands, any persons and nationality is accepted, for we are all equal under the Trident&#39;s guiding wisdom.[hr]
