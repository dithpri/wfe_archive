[b]Considering[/b] the colonial empires have long left this continent and have thus left us free, independent and lacking in economic power.

[b]Aware[/b] of the challenges faced by the continent as a whole and especially the island-nations pertaining to it due to the current economic constraints.

We unite under one banner; that of the free and independent confederation of associated African islands. Our people shall retain their independence and rightful sovereignty; the confederacy will only mediate between member-nations while striving for further co-operations between allied nations in this fraternity of states.
