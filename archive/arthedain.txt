The Arthedain (Sindarin for Edain of the Realm) were the D&uacute;nedain of the old Kingdom of Arthedain. They were the purest-blooded descendants of the N&uacute;men&oacute;reans among the D&uacute;nedain of Arnor. Arthedain also came to an end and its lands remained mostly empty (except for the Shire) and its people became Rangers. Rangers of the North, or simply the Rangers, were the northern wandering people of Eriador, the last remnant of the D&uacute;nedain of Arnor.
