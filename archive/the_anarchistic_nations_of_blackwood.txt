The Anarchistic Nations Of BlackWood is founded off of one simple principle. 
No rules.
Well that *AND* treat your fellow nations with respect.
But I&amp;#39;m getting distracted.
We allow all sorts of nations, with any type of background,political viewpoints,and creeds to join but strongly encourage anarchy&amp;#39;s as they are amazing.
