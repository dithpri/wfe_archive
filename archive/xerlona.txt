[b]Xerlona,[/b] a vast  and stunning region, home to large and small nations.

Xerlona has a council that has 2 members from each nation as ambassadors. The council has temporarily suspended it&amp;#39;s meetings as war is on the horizon. 

With peace only lasting a few months, Xerlona is in another conflict. This time it isn&amp;#39;t a outside force like Zelon. The region is in a state of distress. The future is looking bleak at the moment.
