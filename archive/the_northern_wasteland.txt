While most of The Northern Wasteland contains destroyed land, soil that is poor at best, and raiding tribes, The Oasis miraculously held fertile soil after The Great End. In this land, The Sanctuary was formed, composed of former slaves, exterminated races, and merchants, they all worked together for a peaceful society. With nearby settlements having grown and worked together with The Sanctuary, they formed what was known as The Incorporated States of The Oasis Sanctuary, where they hope to prosper as one. It is hoped that one day The Northern Wasteland can be made truly livable one day, but this is likely just a fever dream.
