New Scandinavia is a bastion of democracy and safety in a broken world. After the evil Shmeckstaine bombarded most of the earth in what is collectively known as &quot;The Purge&quot;, only the northernmost nations remain.

As of yet, the might of the Crater has paid them little mind, due to their lack of resources and free-thinking populace. But it is only a matter of time.
