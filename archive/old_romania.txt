Welcome to [b][color=blue]Old Romania![/color][/b] [url=http://bloochat.com/kor]Regional Chatroom[/url] [url=http://oldromania.freeforums.org/index.php]Regional Forums[/url] 
We are a collection of nations under a Semi - Constitutional Monarchy that share quite the Interest for some of history&amp;#39;s greatest: The Romans/Thracians! 

We would like to inform you of this week&amp;#39;s update: September 30th, 2265! The NU has bribed the [region=Heroes Rise] region into betraying us. So much for their honour, If you come into contact with any Hero Nation then obliterate them on sight! We did it to [nation=short]Lucar[/nation] &amp;amp; we&amp;#39;ll do it again! Sons &amp;amp; Daughters of Old Romania, Ready to Arms &amp;amp; Fight/Die for your homeland!
