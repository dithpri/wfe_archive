[b][color=brightred] -Official Ruined Earth- [/color][/b]
After [region]Ruined Earth[/region] was taken over by some wannabe Ravengers, this new region was born.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This region will be used to tell my story on a fictional setting based on Fallout, Last of Us, and overall nuclear devastation.
Mostly involves dystopian societies, barely-thriving colonies, and hostile raiders.
Rest of Factbook is [b][color=neonyellow]TBD[/color][/b], still fixing some inconsistencies but stay tuned!
Feel free to check out [nation]Sector 18[/nation] to learn more about both Ruined Earth and Sector 18 itself!
