[b]Welcome To Davvi![/b] 

Davvi (Sami: The North), is located in the far off sections of the NS Universe. It was founded on the idea of a world, a world very similar to ours, dominated by Sami- and 
Samoyedic-like cultures. A world where other cultures have gained less attention and spotlight.

Davvi is a region heavily built upon the principles of worldbuilding and roleplaying. R/D gameplay is strictly prohibited (we don&#39;t like those).
