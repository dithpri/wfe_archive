-Prime Minister-                     [nation]Viviatopia[/nation]
-Minister of Defense-              [nation]Whitestone[/nation] 
-Minister of Justice-               [nation]Dollarsigndom[/nation]
-Minister of Foreign Affairs-    [nation]Augmentis[/nation]
-Minister of Education-          [nation]The Grand Duchy of Orkney[/nation]  
-Minister of Propaganda-        [nation]The Big Mama Republic[/nation]
-Minister of Finance-            [nation]Ayyubid Caliphate[/nation]
 
I&amp;#39;m going to declare [nation]Augmentis[/nation] the winner because of the unfair voting. Remember, only ONE nation may vote in election polls, otherwise, it is unfair. 
Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
