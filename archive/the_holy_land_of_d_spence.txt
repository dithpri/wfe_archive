Hail our overlord, the mighty D-Spence, creator of all that is good, and defender against all evils!

If you are not in the World Assembly, apply to join, and then endorse whomever you think would be best to represent the region as regional delegate.

[b][u]Do Not under any circumstances give the password to anyone in the game unless you know who they are in real life.[/b][/u]

Upon joining, send a telegram to either [nation]Lutrinity[/nation] or [nation]David Freaking Bowie[/nation] with your name.

And seriously.  Join the World Assembly already. Don&amp;#39;t share your names, part of the fun and politics of the game is not knowing. It ruins the mystery.
