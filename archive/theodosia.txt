The city was founded as Theodosia (&amp;#920;&amp;#949;&amp;#959;&amp;#948;&amp;#959;&amp;#963;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;) by Greek colonists from Miletos in the 6th century BC. Noted for its rich agricultural lands, on which its trade depended, the city was destroyed by the Huns in the 4th century AD.

Theodosia remained a minor village for much of the next nine hundred years. It was at times part of the sphere of influence of the Khazars (excavations have revealed Khazar artifacts dating back to the 9th century) and of the Byzantine Empire.
