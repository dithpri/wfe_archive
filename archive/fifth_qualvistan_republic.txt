Once again, for the fifth time, the Qualvistan Republic is reborn from the ashes.

In the absence of a WA Delegate, the Royal World Estate assumes de facto delegate authority, being the only Republic WA member.

The Republic is run democratically by the Imperial Republic Council, which meets weekly to conduct business.
