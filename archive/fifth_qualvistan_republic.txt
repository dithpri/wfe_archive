Once again, for the fifth time, the Qualvistan Republic is reborn from the ashes. Long live the Republic and her peoples!

The Fifth Qualvistan Republic is a regional grouping of member states historically associated to [nation]Qualvista[/nation]. The region was originally established as the Qualvistan Empire, but has been refounded several times in various incarnations. The Republic is run democratically by the Imperial Republic Council, which meets weekly to conduct business. In the absence of a WA Delegate, the Royal World Estate assumes de facto delegate authority, being the only Republic WA member.

The Republic is currently closed to new member applications. Thank you for your interest.
