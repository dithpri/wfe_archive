The United Socialist Defence Pact is formed of volunteers from leftist regions across NS. Its primary goals are the defence of its member regions from foreign aggression, the upholding of those regions governments against coups, and the preservation of these regions across NS. We are not an interventionist group and will not attack any region unless we have been provoked and there is no other alternative. Major descisions are still under the control of the Pacts member regions. Participation in any operation undertaken by the group is purely voluntary and not mandatory for its members. Please do not enter the region unless you have TG&amp;#39;d the founder first.
