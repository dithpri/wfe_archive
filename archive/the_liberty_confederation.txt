[b][u]The Liberty Confederation[/u][/b]
A new region seeking members. We are dedicated to liberty and democracy, come join us!
Rules: Not much. Don&#39;t spam the RMB, don&#39;t harass people, etc. Common sense, basically. Because delegate doesn&#39;t have executive authority, you&#39;re aloud to fight for it.
We have elections coming up in June! Any resident may feel free to run.
