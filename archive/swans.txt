A tribute region to the legendary experimental rock outfit, and (described as me as) the greatest band ever, Swans. With a career spanning some 40 years, led by frontman and mastermind Michael Gira, they have revolutionized genres from gothic rock to post-punk, from noise rock to sound collages, from experimental rock to post-rock. With 17 albums under their belt and still continuing to make music, the 71 year old Gira shows no signs of slowing down.
