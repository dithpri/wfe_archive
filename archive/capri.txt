Capri, an island in Italy&#146;s Bay of Naples, is famed throughout time for its rugged landscape, upscale hotels and shopping, from designer fashions to limoncello and handmade leather sandals. One of its best-known natural sites is the Blue Grotto, a dark cavern where the sea glows electric blue, the result of sunlight passing through an underwater cave. In summer, Capri&#39;s dramatic, cove-studded coastline draws many yachts.
