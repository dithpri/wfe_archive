And the lamb lies down on BROADWAY.

Early morning Manhattan,
Ocean winds blow on the land.
The Movie-Palace is now undone,
The all-night watchmen have had their fun.
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show,
It&#39;s the same old ending-time to go.
Get out!
It seems they cannot leave their dream.
There&#39;s something moving in the sidewalk steam,
And the lamb lies down on Broadway.
