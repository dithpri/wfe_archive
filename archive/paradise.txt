Lift your eyes to the rising thane.

My seat at the pinnacle of this paradise.

I shall meet you there, for the unsundering of the sundered.

For the New Dawn of days has come.

In them the adepts shall find our respite, and the abhorrent shall meet their greatest of foes.

We shall see what has lit the way all this time, in timeless dance.
