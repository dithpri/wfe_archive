Hope is a region discovered by desperate explorers trying to escape their dying homeland in 1506. However, you should take &#39;&#39;Discovered&#39;&#39; with a grain of salt, as this region was already inhabited by an estimated 250,000 natives. As soon as these explorers encountered these tribes, they started a nearly century long war resulting in the extermination of nearly all tribes in 1603. Hope had relative peace in the following centuries until the 1972, when rising tension between leaders resulted in The Great war of Hope, a massive war which resulted in millions of dead. The following years, new countries were born and others torn apart in a time of border disputes and civil wars.
