[B][color=scarlet]Once, two nations raided [region]Christmas[/region] under the name &quot;The Black Watch.&quot; They wouldn&#39;t have lasted an update if not for the forces of [region]Sicarius[/region], who visited to keep them in power. For our trouble, we received naught but anger, in messages stating that they &quot;had it under control,&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t need our help,&quot; so we should &quot;leave them alone.&quot;[/color]

[color=purple]Suffice to say, we did not come back next update, and they lost the region.[/color]

[color=goldenrod]Now that Nephmir has linked this recently non-existent region in a proposal, I have founded it as a memorial of sorts, and a lesson. First, if you make an org, [i]found the region for it[/i]. More importantly, don&#39;t bite the hand that feeds you. Unity is amazing to be with, and a pain to be against.[/color]
