Almost heaven, West Virginia 
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River 
Life is old there, older than the trees 
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze 

Country roads, take me home 
To the place I belong 
West Virginia, Mountain Mama 
Take me home, country roads.

West Virginia, the home of the mountaineers, and some of the most beautiful parks in the country. We are an independent region that welcomes all nations. The capital is Charlestown, and our neighbors are Maryland, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
