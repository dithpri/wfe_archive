Slang for &quot;Australia&quot;.

It used to be a dead, desolate, remote place (much like Australia itself). Ceased to Exist 12/15/2024

Occupied by the [region]Workers and Peasants Army[/region] 12/17/2024. Mostly so [region]the Outback[/region] couldn&#39;t have it as they rejected our request for an embassy.

I might open this as a frontier next year :D
