(Burodan: Ethensiani / Burodani) is an island country situated on the second-largest island in Coyphus. It is a constitutional monarchy with a royal family and the prime minister. Ethensia is most commonly known for it&#39;s landscape, rich history, and culture[/i].[hr][color=red][b]THIS REGION IS A JOKE SUCCESSOR TO COYPHUS; ANYTHING SAID HERE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.[/b][/color][b]*[/b]
[quote=ethensia;60247827]Might change the WFE into something more detailed while still keeping the tone of the region.
Just note that this is really just a personal region where random stuff and news go, I don&#39;t plan to make this a big giant influential region. [/quote][sub][b]*[/b]: unless stated otherwise[/sub]
