Pontic Peaks are isolated mountains, where villages, towns and cities are being built on plateaus. The climate is cold and dry. Many rivers form the anomalous topography. At the North, a small and fierce sea is situated in front of the steep mountains with almost beaches. Great igneous bodies are intruding the mountains, many times linked with dead volcanoes.

Because of the geology, copper, lead, zinc, silver and gold are being exploited by the mountain people, mostly via underground mining. Goats are the only livestock that can withstand the harsh environment. A complex train system aids the trasportation of goods and people.
