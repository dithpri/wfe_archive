Rational Powers
The Rational Powers is a cold and unyielding region in NationStates, built on the ironclad belief that humanity must rise above superstition and weakness through absolute reason, order, and control. Unified by a militant rejection of religion and an unrelenting commitment to scientific supremacy, the Rational Powers enforces an extreme, fascist ideology that tolerates no deviation from its rationalist principles.
