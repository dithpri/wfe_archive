[b]OMGHAI RAWR! HAIIIIIIIIIIIII :D

You&amp;#39;ve been overcome by the forces of awesomeness and love and just people liking Rawr! :D

p.s. Mall said you would take this well. I hope he&amp;#39;s right. :)

And now a note from the delegate:

So, Rawr, I know I&amp;#39;ve been a bit of an ass and a faucet lately, so i&amp;#39;ll leave you with these short lines:

Hey there I just tagged you,
and this is crazy,
But here&amp;#39;s my apology,
so hug me maybe.
