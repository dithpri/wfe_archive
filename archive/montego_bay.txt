[color=003366][b]Montego Bay[/b], commonly referred to as MoBay, is the second largest city in the island nation Jamaica, a member of the British Commonwealth. Montego Bay is the capital of St. James Parish, one of the 14 parishes in Jamaica.

Due in part to its location on the island&amp;#39;s north shore, Montego Bay has long since earned the title of &amp;#39;tourist capital of Jamaica. It is a tourist destination known for its duty free shopping, cruise line terminal, and the sheltered Doctor&amp;#39;s Cave beach with clear turquoise waters, which is one of the most famous beaches on the island.[/color] &#151;[url=http://wikitravel.org/en/Montego_Bay][color=6699cc]Montego Bay[/color][/url][hr]
