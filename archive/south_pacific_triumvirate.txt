Welcome to the South Pacific Triumvirate. It is the grand hope to grow into a strong brotherhood of nationstates, with union as our standard, and sovereignty as our motto. Join us, and together, we can build a World Order, of peace, and prosperity. Where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations. Our tribunal is based solely on Commerce.
