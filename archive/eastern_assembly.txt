[B]Biography[/B]
[i]Eastern Assembly is a roleplay region on nationstates aimming to have the maximum fun and provide players with as much realism as possible in order to do so we here at Eastern Assembly have a provided map which each joining nation can join and pick territory to be placed, As we are a realistic roleplaying group we are using modern map of Middle East &amp;amp; Europe which players are able to select territory from unless territory is taken which is normally not as each nation has something new to bring to our friendly roleplaying region and we are happy to serve as a roleplaying region in Nationstates.[/i][hr]
