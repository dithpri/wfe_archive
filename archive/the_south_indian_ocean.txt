The South Indian Ocean, or Southern Indian Ocean, is a term used to denote a region near the European and Asian continents composed almost entirely of islands.

Overall, the nations within the region work fairly independently, though they do share a common coalition known as the United Southern Indian Ocean Association, or USIOA.

The region has only recently began hashing out its place in the world.
