Years ago Eldritch gods awakened to wreck civilization and birth their spawn upon the world. A savior known as &quot;The one&quot; slayed the gods and liberated the remnants of humanity. He is now worshipped. 

150 years later Nations have risen and expanded while also somewhat industrializing and have formed two main alliances across Europe, North Africa , and The Middle East. The Nordic Entente and The Mediterranean Union. The Nordic Entente is made up of more martial and socialistic nations rejecting &quot;The One&quot; in Favour of a more pagan and draconian set of religions. The Mediterranean Union is a more unified economic union accepting The One as the true religion.
