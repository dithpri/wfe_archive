[b]Officially the Federal Republic of the Region of Planerah - this region is a democratic region of nations. 

We were founded after our old region was raided. The remains of our region came together and agreed that we would found new nations (so the raiders could not follow us) and we would found a new region. And so we did.

This region is a mixture of political gameplay and fantasy roleplaying. We have elections every month, and many other programs to help our regional members grow.

Year of the Region: 1000 CE[/b]
