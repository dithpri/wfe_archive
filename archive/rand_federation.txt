The Rand Federation was created out of a need for a quorum of states to organize governments and streamline actions. States that are part of the Rand Federation are required to abide by any and all legislation passed by the quorum. The quorum is made up of delegates appointed by their countries&#146; executives. Each country gets no fewer than 2 and no more than 10 delegates.
