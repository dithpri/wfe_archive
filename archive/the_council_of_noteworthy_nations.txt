[i][b][color=green]Welcome to the greatest CONN you will ever be a part of![/color][/b][/i]

The RMB below contains thousands of posts detailing the trials and tribulations of a fictional world, crafted from casual banter that took on a life of its own. This place is a museum to our childhood; the display case of one of our greatest games of pretend. Read over it if you find the time, and enjoy the memories we made. [i]Some of these posts still smack of the time in which they were written[/i] and of the biases and beliefs of silly children who didn&#39;t yet know any better. We apologize for our past selves and assure you - dear visitor - that there has been significant growth in the interim.
