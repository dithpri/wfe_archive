Welcome to the greatest CONN you will ever be a part of! The Council of Noteworthy Nations boasts a strong, active community of nation builders who are eager to partake in their regional government.

We hope you enjoy your time here and look forward to CONNing you into staying!


The Laws of the CONN are readily available on the [nation]Wintony[/nation] factbook page under the &amp;quot;Legislation&amp;quot; category or on our regional forum.

Oh yeah, by the way, we have a regional forum now. It can be found here: [b][u][url=http://conn.freeforums.org/index.php]Our Forum[/url][/u][/b]
