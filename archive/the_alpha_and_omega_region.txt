The CommonWealth Republic of Gwendilynne Farrar is a massive, efficient nation, notable for its avant-garde cinema. The Faithful, devout population of 2.4 billion Gwendilynne Farrarians are highly spiritual and fiercely conservative, in the sense that they tend to believe that all Evil things should be outlawed. People who have good jobs and work quietly at them are rewarded for their efforts, others are retrained to do something they like to do that is something needed by the whole, which is paid for by the Government in Full.
