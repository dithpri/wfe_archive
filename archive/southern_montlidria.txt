A region of Nations looking for a new home. The people here are looking for an active group of players who are ready to raid and become active members in the region.

Strong economies and militaries are preferred to protect the region from harm, but nevertheless, this is not a requirement. Do not try and take WA Delegate without consulting [color=red]Mionia or Liberty Christians.[/color]

The WA delegate to endorse at the current moment is [nation]Mionia[/nation]
(This [color=teal]may be changed[/color] at a later point in time)

I would recommend to anyone looking to enrich the NS experience to download [color=teal] NationStates++ [/color]
