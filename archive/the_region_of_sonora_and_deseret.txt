The Region of Sonora and Deseret is a large landmass on the North American Continent. The majority of the region is covered by a massive desert, filled with plateaus, canyons and basins. The region is filled with generally isolationist nations, having only banded together to establish a stable currency and to protect their collective interests of self-governance in the World Assembly.
