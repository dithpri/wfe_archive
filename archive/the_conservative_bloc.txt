The Conservative Bloc is a new region.  We are an alternative to regions like [region]The Communist Bloc[/region], and promote right-wing and conservative policies.  

In our region, nations hold the ability to freely elect a representative government with regular elections, and even establish political parties.  Also, you may join our military arm, [region]The Regional Republican Army[/region] and help us crusade against the leftist regions.
