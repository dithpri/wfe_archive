[color=goldenrod]&amp;#9733;[/color] Welcome to the [b][color=#ce1226]People&#39;s Republic of Lazarus[/color][/b] [color=goldenrod]&amp;#9733;[/color]

We think that a powerful and vigorous movement is impossible without differences &#151; &quot;true conformity&quot; is possible only in a cemetery. We were once held to conform by the toxic status quo, but through the grains and fire of the revolution, our movement has led us out of the cemetery and [b][i]onwards in our glorious march to harmony![/i][/b]
