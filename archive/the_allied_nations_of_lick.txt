Welcome Lick-Wilmerding Nations!
This region was designed to be home to all Lick-Wilmerding Nations who would like to join.  We will decide on a constitution and start a forum soon, as well as decide on our place in the World Assembly.  For now, as the founders of this great region, the government will consist of:

Consuls:
[nation]Joelibe[/nation]
[nation]Sogrady[/nation]

I wish you all luck in the progression of your nations!
