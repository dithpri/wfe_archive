Eskos is a region in the North Atlantic known for its cold weather all year round. This region is infamous for its &quot;New Age&quot; conservative policies. These policies include a larger government, more aid for working families, and more government spending based on the needs of the people of the region first. The region is predominately Christian but is open to any religion. This region is based off the belief that no one should be judged by anything but their actions. Eskos is also home to some of the greatest soccer club and international soccer teams in this decade. F.C Malizi and Etan United have won the Winners Cup 6 of the last 7 years.
