This is the Thunder Territory State Department Central. We are the backbone of the embassy system for the Thunder Territory. We review and check every message that is to be sent to the embassies, and we establish a connection with other regions that could become a Thunder Territory embassy in the future. Although our Founder is [nation]Hintret[/nation], our President is [nation]Wonderton[/nation] from the Thunder Territory, also known as the Head of the State Department. 

He is currently in [region]The Western Isles[/region] on an ambassador conference.
