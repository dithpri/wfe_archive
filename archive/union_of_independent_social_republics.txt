The Union of Independent Social Republics (also called the Socialist Union) is an international organisation whose participating countries are the new socialist countries formed during the breakup of Gallia and Germania. Although the UISR has few supranational powers, it is aimed at being more than a purely symbolic organisation, nominally possessing coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security.
