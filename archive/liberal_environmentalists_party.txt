[color=maroon]The Liberal Environmentalists Party (LEP)[/color][color=goldenrod] is an interregional party hoping to extend itself towards all spheres of politics in the NationStates community. We purely believe in the unfortunate lack of environmental-liberal sympathy across the gaming platform particularly from ignorant conservative-populists and hope to unite the game in shared collective spirit![/color]
