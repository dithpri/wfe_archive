[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were wondering how next to train their hawklings. It was then when they found an arts and crafts kit in the nest with [i]RaiderCon[/i] engraved on it. This inspired the hawks to travel across the regions of NationStates (like this one!) to put up posters about RaiderCon 2020. The hawks cut, glew, drew, crashed a few regions, and had a good time as they redecorated this region! If you wanna engage in cool RaiderCon activities and go out on more raids, then [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Come Join Us![/url]
