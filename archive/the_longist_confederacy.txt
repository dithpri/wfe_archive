We stand for the ideals of: The Golden Circle (As in making Florida control all of the Coast of the Gulf of Mexico and Carribean), LOOOOONG Chile, The extending of panhandle borders to be Long, and for all Longists to unite!

We are against the ideals of: Dividing the land into Squares, re-fixing the borders to not have any panhandles
