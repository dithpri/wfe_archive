Welcome to our region, comrades! We are a community of proud Trotskyists, committed to building a society that puts the working class at the center of power. Our vision is one of social and economic justice, where every person has an equal say in how our society is run, and where the economy is democratically controlled by the people who work in it.

We invite all comrades who share our vision to join our region and work with us to build a better world. Together, we can create a society where the needs of the many are prioritized over the profits of the few. Long live the revolution!
