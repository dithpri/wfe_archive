[b]The Union of Allied Idealists is, first and foremost, a democratic region for nations with idealistic leaders.[/b]



But... idealistic is a broad definition, isn&#39;t it? As a famous fictional theocratic dictator once said: [i]&#39;We only wanted to make the world better. But better never means better for everyone, it always means worse for some.&#39;[/i]
We hold this to be true. When it comes to politics, there is no such thing as perfect. There will always be a [i]some[/i]. However, nations in The Union of Allied Idealists have one thing in common - [u]our [i]some[/i] will not be the people[/u]. 

We accept that our members all have different ways of putting this into action.
