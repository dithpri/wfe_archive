[i]Welcome to the limbo.

Home to nations who don&#146;t have a purpose. Who were kicked or replaced from their old position. Who are simply taking a break from the chaos outside.

[spoiler=Old WFE][i]Welcome to Fourteenth Empire, a land of glory, prosperity, and abundance!

With over 10000 years of history, (PLACEHOLDER)&#146;s fourteenth empire will be THE BEST in the history of Luzpacifica!
