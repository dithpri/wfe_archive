[B]&quot;... and so it shall be that He will return again.&quot;[/B][i]- Prophets 1:1[/i]

Following a drift into the void, the great and holy Church of Ainland has been reformed!

Eternal glory and praise to Our Founder Ainland, whose divine will inspired the reformation of this fold most fraternal and egalitarian. 

Praise be! He has returned, according to the prophecy! Let the times of goodness and peace be remembered from these our most auspicious days!

Nations that follow His Divine Will are welcome to join our fold; a simple message to His Left Hand, [nation=short]The Prophet Avaerilon[/nation], and the door shall be opened unto thee.
