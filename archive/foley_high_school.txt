Hello, My name is Jack Daniel, and I am currently a senior class student of Foley High School. After the fall of the original FHSR, I took a year-long hiatus from NS, but I am now returning and refounding the FHSR for FHS students and students in nearby schools to join again, so we can restore the FHSR to its former glory.
