[B][color=orange]Welcome to the PFQ Former Temporary Home - Now a museum made solely to show how life was in the temporary home![/color][/B]
[hr]
[B][color=Red]It all happened in December 27, 2014...

The people had it good in the PFQ, although the population growth rate was slower and slower for every day passing. Nobody knew what would happen hours later.

Then suddenly, Qandaristan ceased to exist and panic took over the PFQ. The WA Delegate, [nation=short]Peachany[/nation], ejected many people that weren&amp;#39;t active. But then, [nation=short]Qandaristan Communist Media[/nation] founded the Temporary Home, [region]PFQ[/region].

It felt like a refugee camp and we discussed for a long time how PFQ would do to regain it&amp;#39;s lost glory and greatness. But after the discussions were done, [nation=short]PFQ_Founder[/nation] founded the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=peoples_federation_of_qandaristan]new PFQ[/url], the bigger and conventist PFQ.[/color][/B]
