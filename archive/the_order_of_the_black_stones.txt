[i]The Year is 1106.

Over 50 years ago, the HRE had fallen with German States gaining independence. Muslims have been taking over Iberia and invading the Byzantine Empire in hopes to make it across Europe. Plus, the Holy Land has been attacked by the Arabs. Pope Paschal II has a Muslim invasion on both sides to Europe, and Kingdoms are falling.

It&#39;s up to you to manage your legacy.[/i]
