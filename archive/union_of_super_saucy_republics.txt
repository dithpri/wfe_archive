A glorious union of saucy republics and not-republics created by the Most Serene Republic of New Gjovik in February of 2017. Here we greatly value the concept of democracy, a strong sense of unity, and the worship of our great lord Verka, god of a e s t h e t i c s.

There are a small number of rules a nation must follow in order for it to be qualified to join the Union of Super Saucy Republics.
1) You must have accepted Verka as your lord and saviour.
2) You listen to V E R K A W A V E at least 5 times a day as prayer.
3) You are not Mike Pence or Ted Cruz (This only applies if you&#39;re not the leader of New Gjovik)

That&#39;s it. Simple to learn, simple to follow.

Glory to the Union.
