A concept I reserved for later. I don&#39;t currently work on this.

Basically, it was going to work like the UN in real life, whole promise was to create the similarly unfair UMN with General Assembly and Security Council structures for roleplay purposes. It suppoused to make &quot;game theory&quot; with &quot;Diplomacy (game)&quot; taste, to create frictions, intrigues and story material for roleplay and story writing.

Although, if you are interested in the name and concept &quot;United Multiversal Nations&quot; you can telegram [nation]Vurk[/nation]. If we are close and we have history it depends what we talk. If not, I may consider selling it not for real money -I have no intention of violating site rules- but for trade cards.
