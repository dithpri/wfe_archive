[b][color=black]This region was originally raided by [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region]. Unfortunately, when the leader of the raid had to respond to RL issues, defenders from [url=www.nationstates.net/region=the_fra]The Fascist Reserve Army[/url], who have a long history of defending fascist regions, decided to intervene to protect the forces of reaction. UNAF were driven away.
Just as in [url=www.nationstates.net/region=league_of_fascist_states]LoFS[/url], though, UNAF waited, and then outwitted the clumsy and complacent collaborators, and took TDGA.

The comrades who took part in this operation are listed on the RMB.
