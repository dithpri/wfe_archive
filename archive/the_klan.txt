[color=#e60000]Light the Crosses and March with [region]Stormlands[/region] for Our Nations and Our Country[/color]

[region]The Klan[/region] lights the cross of Christ to show the way and bring the message of God&#39;s love for all our peoples. True blood Europeans, we the Anglican sons and daughters of the Founders, defend those of our heritage and proclaim White Sovereignty and White Supremacy over America as The People of this Land.
