Once, in a realm where the ethereal mingled with the material, beings known as Ethereals thrived. They wielded extraordinary powers&#151;manipulating elements, communing with spirits, and much more. Initially, they coexisted peacefully with humanity, sharing their wisdom. But fear and mistrust grew, leading to a brutal purge.

Driven into hiding, the scattered Ethereals united in a hidden valley, forming the United Ethereal Nations (U.E.N.). Here, they rebuilt their society, blending ancient traditions with resilience. The U.E.N. became a beacon of unity and hope, fostering knowledge, arts, and defense against persecution.
