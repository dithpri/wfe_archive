A nation that practices Oligarchical Collectivism. There is one supreme leader, Junius Viticus, who controls the only party in Xav, the Xav Party. All &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; books are banned, writing on your own accord is a crime, assembly is prohibited, marriage and family of any kind is illegal, pro-creation is restricted by the party, all citizens are part time soldiers, everything is rationed, money is non-existent and replaced by a point system by which the party gives points based on citizens work. The empire is ever growing. Don&amp;#39;t Fear. Just accept.
