[i]The Law is a huge blunt weapon that does not and will not make distinctions between what you find acceptable and what you don&#39;t. This is how the Law is made. People making art find out where the limits of free expression are by going beyond them and getting into trouble. 

The Law is a blunt instrument. It&#39;s not a scalpel. It&#39;s a club. If there is something you consider indefensible, and there is something you consider defensible, and the same laws can take them both out, you are going to find yourself defending the indefensible.[/i] &#151;Neil Gaiman
