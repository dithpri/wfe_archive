[color=coal][b][u][i]Welcome to the League of Christian AntiLibs.[/i][/u][/b][/color]

[color=coal]This is the region adapted for Christian nations which wish to live in a traditional, antiliberal &amp; antihippie corner.[/color]

[color=coal]This corner of NationStates does not embrace liberal-secular-rational nor politically correct ideas in support for traditional conservative Christian ideas.[/color]

[color=coal][b]You have listened; no liberals, no progressivists, no anarchists, no laicists, no feminists, no queers, no zionists, etc, but, specially, [u]NO &quot;WEAK CHRISTIANS&quot;!!![/u][/b][/color]

[color=coal][b]Only true, proud, traditional, conservative &amp; devout Christians shall pass!!! Or then why does this corner exist?[/b][/color]

[color=coal][b][u]If you have any questions contact the founder [nation]Khojogek[/nation]. You can contact him in [i]English[/i] and [i]Romanian[/i][/u].[/b][/color]
