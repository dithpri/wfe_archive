[colour=green][i] meadows green,forests old
The shores serene, The mountains bold
The sky now clear, The Shadow gone
With naught to fear, Let new age dawn

From ancient tribe, From noble manor
With learned scribe, With courageous banner
To forge a land, To lead a people
Have firm hand, Do not be feable

Meridia!  Meridia!
Thy land is free
The future to come
From lofty peak, To wine-dark sea
Let the strings of destiny be strum[/i][/colour]
