Meridia is a dead region, devastated by a seperation of these four great nations.

Meridia was a great roleplay region, but after Sylva, the founder, left for new frontiers, me and the three other nations abandoned it. I, Erquin, managed to try and hold on to this for as long as I can, but alas, its no use. Meridia is dead, and is free for revival by anyone willing to come here and reclaim it. We have endured 2 raids by the Black Riders, and we survived both, but that is all. 

 I love this region, but I cant keep it forever. I will miss you, Meridia.
