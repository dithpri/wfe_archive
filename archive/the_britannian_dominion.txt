A Collection of splendid states dedicated to the conservation and enlargement of Her Majesty Victoria&amp;#39;s dominion and possessions, and to the possible act of civilising those less fortunate, through violence, if need be. This Collection of States will all accept Her Majesty The Queen as their sovereign, and accept her wise leadership of The United Kingdom of Britannia as a guiding beacon in this cesspool of uncivilised personae. If one wishes to embrace Her Imperial Majesty Victoria as one&amp;#39;s true and only Queen, one is most certainly welcome to do so, but please note that we do not accept Communists, Socialists, Fascists, Libertarians, Liberals, Pacifists, Savages or Frenchmen.
