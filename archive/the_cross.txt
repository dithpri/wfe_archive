This region was created by [region]The Hellfire Club[/region]/[region]The Blackhearts[/region], claiming that religion spreads bigotry.  They used it to display their own anti-religious - particularly anti-Christian - bigotry. Refounded by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=purple]religious freedom[/color][/b].[hr]St. [nation=short]Maximilian Kolbe[/nation] is one of the many examples of men and women carrying their own crosses in the footsteps of Jesus. A Polish Franciscan priest, Kolbe harbored more than 2000 refugees, mostly Jews, during World War II. He ended up in Auschwitz. After three prisoners escaped, the Nazis punished the rest of the inmates by sentencing ten to starvation. One of the ten cried out about his family; Kolbe volunteered to take his place.
