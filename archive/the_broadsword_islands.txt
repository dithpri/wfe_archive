The Broadsword Islands is a small region made up of nations that prefer to stay isolated from the rest of the world and intermingle among themselves.  Founded by the Republic of Barklandia, the Broadsword Islands stick to themselves and do not try to be major players on the world stage. Practoria, on the other hand likes the world stage.
