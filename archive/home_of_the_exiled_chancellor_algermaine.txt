Within this region&#39;s halls lies a man, hitherto one of the most influential persons within his coalition of like-minded and steadily strengthening nationalists, but even far beyond that a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist partisan, undoing what he believed to be an iron stronghold unto rubble more like a house of cards. Enemy of many, traitor to some, yet friend to some of his following, he remains in an indefinite exile determined by himself and the state which he has built up along with his comrades, where he writes essays based on his political beliefs, draws up propaganda for his cause and those of other fronts, and will give public-writing &amp; public-relation advice if poked hard enough via telegram.
