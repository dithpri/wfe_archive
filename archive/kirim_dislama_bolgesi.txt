Welcome to the Crimean Exclusion Zone.
As the name would suggest, there was a nuclear power plant explosion in a town on the borderlands of [nation]Qirim Hanligi[/nation] and [nation]Kirimlilar[/nation], to the west of the Crimean sub-region of the [region]Nubibus Kulleri[/region]. Legally, only Crimean Military and licensed workers are allowed into the Zone. However, Bandits and Salvagers wanting to make a profit enter the region illegally whilst avoiding the military. Escaped Convicts also flee to the region, hoping to escape the police. The exclusion zone is home to a few different mutated species, and a lot of dead animals.
Remember. If you breeki before you cheeki, you&#39;re going to have a bad time!
