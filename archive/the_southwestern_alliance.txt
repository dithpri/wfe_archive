
   On behalf of the [region]The Southwestern Alliance[/region], I welcome you to what is not only a region, but a hub for friendship, cooperation, and equality that seeks the favour of all nations, be they large or small, established or not. [region]The Southwestern Alliance[/region] prides itself in being among the most accepting, peaceful, democratic, and ideologically free regions of Nationstates. We are a beacon of light in a dark world.
Accomplished World Assembly representative [nation]Rhotoni[/nation] started what is now a thriving region as a venture to improve the culture of Nationstates.
