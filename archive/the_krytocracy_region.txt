The Krytocracy Region is dedicated to those nations who may espouse Krytocracy as their national apparatus or ideology.

Krytocracy is defined as a system of government in which the head of state is the head of the Judiciary. This is as opposed to a Parliamentary system, where the head of state is head of the Legislature, or a Presidential system, in which the head of state is head of a separate Executive Branch.

This region is also open to those nations who see themselves as dedicated to human rights, equality, and justice.
