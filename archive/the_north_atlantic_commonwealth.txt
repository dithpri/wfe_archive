The North Atlantic Commonwealth, also known as the NAC, is a commonwealth of democratic and capitalist countries. We also are highly religious (Christian.) We are willing to build up a military to defend ourselves, for peacekeeping roles, to enforce justice, and eliminate tyranical regimes. The NAC encourages the use of the NAC credit for all nations in the commonwealth and free trade.
