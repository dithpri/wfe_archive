The thriving region of Esseath contains nations of all peoples and political affiliations. As neighbors on a dangerous world stage, they hold an uneasy alliance as the core of their regional beliefs. The region was founded on the smoldering remnants of The Genius Squad, the former home of such nations as The Benzopolis Empire, Marviania, The Toxic Dead Lands, and returning Leader of The Genius Squad who went down with the ship in 2015: Alagasagia.
