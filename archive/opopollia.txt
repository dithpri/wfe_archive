Founded by the disposed President of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis; Opopollia was once a unified country.  It was initially composed of indigenous tribes, who were taken charge of by Davis.  Influenced by right-wing views, Opopollia was an Authoritarian State.

After his death, (in true Confederate Style,) areas of the region declared independence, and seceded to form their own countries.
Despite this show of disunion, today, all of the countries within Opopollia are on excellent political terms with one another.
