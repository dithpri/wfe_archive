[b][color=blue]Reciprocal League of Collaborative Nations[/color][/b]

This is a region of nations who seek diplomacy and political measures before military action. We believe anything can be solved with sitting down and talking before firing 25mm shells at each other. All races, themes, and era nations are acceptable here so far. &amp;quot;Chief don&amp;#39;t judge!&amp;quot;

[i]OOC Note: This region will play a role play theme between two alliances forming with volunteering nations in the future.[/i]
