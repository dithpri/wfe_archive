The Nether World is that part of existence the Universe and the Multiverse which has No defined dimensions to it ,there is no Rule Regulation or Structure to it.
THE ONLY THING CERTAIN IS UNCERTAINITY
sane and the dwellers of defined space and Worlds have called it by many names
twillight zone,dreamland,shadow world
but no one really knows anything about it except that once you travel into it sanity and insanity have no more difference .
