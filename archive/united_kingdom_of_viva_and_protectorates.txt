The United Kingdom of Viva and Protectorates

We are a closed, highly-functional, innovative and forward-thinking region consisting of Protectorate States governed by the Principality of Vivamuss. 

Each Protectorate is separately administered by its own governing bodies under different political systems. Protectorates are not sovereign and must remain unified and loyal to the crown and its laws. 

Membership for this region is limited to those States affiliated to the Commonwealth of our Kingdom.
