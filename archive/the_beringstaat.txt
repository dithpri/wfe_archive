The frozen, irradiated wastes of the Beringstaat are kind to no man, but the PCPE does not concern itself with kindness. The only heat comes from the oil pipelines and incineration towers dotting the landscape. 

(The Beringstaat is a region specifically for nations who will do anything in their power to simply stay alive. Technocracy, communism/socialism, surveillance states - anything to stay standing. Anyone is welcome to join, but remember - all is seen under the iron gaze of the PCPE.)
