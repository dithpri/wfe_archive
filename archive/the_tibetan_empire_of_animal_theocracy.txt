The Tibetan Empire of Animal Theocracy is the only region that worships animals as divine beings of immense power. We have very powerful allies that will come to our aid if attacked. Our military strength may be miniscule compared to that of many other regions, but we will fight to the last man. Plus, we&amp;#39;re working on creating animal-human hybrids to spy behind enemy lines for us.
