Have you ever wondered what would happen if a chunk of land decided to pack its bags and set sail for adventure? Look no further than the curious case of Northern Banten! Formerly a beloved province of Indonesia, Northern Banten mysteriously upped and floated away from Java Island, leaving bewildered cartographers scrambling to update their maps!

Now nestled near the freezing Antarctica (though the penguins seem none too pleased about these tropical houseguests), Northern Banten is a land of extraordinary oddity. This continent, cobbled together from the original Banten province, has inexplicably transformed into a mosaic of independent nations! How Convenient!
