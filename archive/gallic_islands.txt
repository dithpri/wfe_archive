Up there in Europe, there is a nice, warm, welcome region that is called the Gallic Islands. Ireland is one of them and it is also the biggest and home to The Republic of Gallic states. Join, and you get an island (in english or gallic, your pick.). You also get a random (RP) export. This information will be sent in a telegram. 

This region does a lot of roleplay, like you can make a history and make up a war that happened. Help is compulsory is someone asks for it. Come to me with any questions
