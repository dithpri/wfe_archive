This is a great region. We are forming embassies in other regions to promote regional ties as well as gain members. Soon, this region will be large and strong and promoting most forms of government (Nazi Regimes will [b]most likely[/b] be rejected).

[b]Peace[/b] is the main key to our success. We try to keep the peace while also preserving individuality and supporting the countries we have here.

[b]Democracy[/b] is not the most important form of government, however the more democracy the better.

With [b]Super Rajah[/b], aka [b]King Arthur[/b] as the leader,
    [b]Vibroonium[/b], aka [b]Lancelot[/b] as the Delegate (and technical second in command), and
    [b]GamingLegenc420[/b], aka [b]Galahad[/b] as the Vice-Delegate, the region is guaranteed to thrive and continue until the end of time.
