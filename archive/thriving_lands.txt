Lush forests, rolling grass fields, and thunderous waterfalls. These are the Thriving Lands, a continent and group of islands somewhere near the equator. These lands are the home to many unique and never before seen species that are not found anywhere else in the world. At the northern end of the Thriving Lands is the proud nation of Zollanda, led by a man who calls himself The Creator.
