A simple collection of independent islands. They generally favor isolation, and all obey the Queen of Yoky, who is said to have the ability to manipulate glass and ice. Sailors used to believe these islands were the last landmasses before dropping off the flat Earth. It was once said this place is between fantasy and reality, on the glass edge.
