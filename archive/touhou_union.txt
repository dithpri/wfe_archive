The [b][color=red]Touhou Union[/color] (TU)[/b] was created with the help of [b][color=teal]Chancellor Marcelino Ezmorales[/color][/b] of [b][nation]Aqua Regia[/nation][/b] and the rest of the [b][color=purple]Flower Four[/color][/b] members with their geomancy skills, similar to how [b][region]Aizengard[/region][/b] was formed. The endeavor was initially undertaken in order to expand the commercial capacity of [b][color=blue]Aizengard[/color][/b] and its allies. The [b]TU[/b] also serves as a collection of provinces governed by prominent leaders and influential people of [b][region]Gensokyo[/region][/b]. This region also benefits from the conditions set by [b][color=blue]Aizengard[/color][/b]&amp;#39;s [b][color=crimson]Treaty of Ratatouille-Hidango[/color][/b].
