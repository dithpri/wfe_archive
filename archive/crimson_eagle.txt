[color=crimson][i][b]Welcome to Crimson Eagle, the official jump point of the new raider organization, the [region]Crimson Crusaders[/region]![/i]
[hr]

If your delegate has changed and their endorsers came from this region, it means the Crimson Crusaders raided your region. Sorry, not sorry.

If you see a lot of nations here, we&#39;re about to raid someone. If you want to be on your good side, don&#39;t interfere.

Thank the Shadows and Durm for finding this jump point and giving it to us. We really appreciate you.[/color][/b]
