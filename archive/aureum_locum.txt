[b]Atten-[color=purple]HUT![/color][hr]Some assassins from [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region] have stormed into your region, put up some barbed wire and a shooting range, and commandeered the area for use in Malicious Boot Camp! And a good thing we set up a training ground, because these recruits mean [i]business[/i]. Now salute the Overseer, drop, and give me 20!
