We welcome you warmly to Bible Believers, a gathering of Christians who uphold the Bible as the only authority for what we believe and practise. This position ([i]Sola Scriptura[/i]) is one of the core values of the Protestant Reformation.

We welcome and encourage discussion of all manner of topics, but please observe proper etiquette and Christian values. We would like this to be a friendly region.

Our region was founded on Sunday, March 11, 2018 by two real-life friends, [nation]Sugiraia[/nation] and [nation]Thestika[/nation]. All are most welcome to join us!
