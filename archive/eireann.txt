Welcome to [color=green][b]Eireann[/b][/color], an Irish region. Any and all are welcome to join so long as they follow the rules.
We aim towards unity among the Irish nations and regions of NS. However, they have remained divided just like Ireland itself. We still strive nonetheless.

As for conflicts, we try to remain as neutral as possible. Please do not drag us into ideological conflicts or assume that us having an embassy with a region means that we condone everything they say or do. 

Lastly, the constitution of the region is pinned below and is available for your reading pleasure.
