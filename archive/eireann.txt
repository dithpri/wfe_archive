[color=#3CB371][b]Come to beautiful Eireann! Here, you can experience our unique culture, have fun with your friends around town, see the sights and have a great time. 

Just ignore the raider hordes from [Region]The Kingdom of Great Britain[/region] to your left. Oh... and the [region]Hellenic Empire[/region] on your right. And uh... [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]The West Pacific[/region], [region]The East Pacific[/region], [region]Augustin Alliance[/region], [region]Exodus[/region] and [region]Europeia[/region] behind you. 

There is no raid! Please remain calm and help us repel invaders by endorsing [nation=short]Maxiarys Demorl[/nation] and all Regional Officers... [i]or else![/i][/b][/color]
