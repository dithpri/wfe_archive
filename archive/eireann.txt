Welcome to [color=green][b]Eireann[/b][/color], an Irish region. Any and all are welcome to join so long as they follow the rules.

Regarding conflicts, we try to remain as neutral as possible. Please do not drag us into ideological conflicts or assume that us having an embassy with a region means that we condone everything they say or do. 

The constitution of the region will be pinned below and for your reading pleasure.
