[color=maroon][B]Zombocalypse Directions:[/B][/color]
For the duration of the unrest, anyone who chooses to side with the undead will be temporarily relocated.
All nations are requested to assist with the search for the cure. 
If the situation worsens, we will seal ourselves off by closing the borders.

A region divided cannot stand. Together, we will succeed.
