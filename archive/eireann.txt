There is only one acceptable answer. Finding a cure. Any nation caught siding with the undead may face ejection. Regional Officers are &amp;quot;Section Leaders&amp;quot;, responsible for clearing a portion of the region. Either the RMB and WFE will be used to coordinate targets for cure missiles, or each Section Leader will have a pinned dispatch indicating their current target. Sections will be determined later. This WFE will be updated as more information is made available.
