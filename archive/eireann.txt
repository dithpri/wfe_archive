[B][u]Zombocalypse IV Update:[/u][/B]

There is only one acceptable answer. Finding a cure. Any nation caught siding with the undead may face ejection. Both the RMB and WFE will be used to coordinate targets for cure missiles. This WFE will be updated as more information is made available.

The plague is well under control. We have entered the final mopping up stage. In the future, we might reopen our borders to those desperate for a cure. Keep up the good work.
