The Wild Band of Woodland Raiders is lead by High-Chieftain Carroll X.
Though we may be civilized, we are also slightly barbaric.
Holler-Town Raiders must be trained in the combat uses of a sickle-staff to some extent.
Holler-Town Raiders must own at least one knife.
Holler-Town Raiders must never question the authority of our generous High-Chieftain.
Holler-Town Political-System:
1. The people vote.
2. The private Chief Council takes their votes into consideration to make a decision.
3. The High-Chieftain then makes a decision he deems appropriate for the situation after considering the votes of the Chief Council.
