The [b]Pacific Northwes[/b]t (in the United States, commonly abbreviated as PNW), is a geographic region and megaregion in western North America bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and loosely, by the Rocky Mountains on the east. Though no agreed boundary exists, a common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington and the Canadian province of British Columbia. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
