The DSR was founded to push for social freedom and safety from corporate corruption to the peoples of its member nations. Nations who fail to abide by certain rules will be ejected. 

Nations are to allow people with an acceptable amount of social rights and freedom while still maintaining control and protecting the citizens. Countries&#39; decisions and membership in the region will be reviewed by other member states. Nations will regulate their nation&#39;s corporations, preventing them from infringing on the rights of the populace. All nations of the DSR are to be democratic governments.
