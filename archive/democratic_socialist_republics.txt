The DSR was founded to push for social freedom and safety from corporate corruption to the peoples of its member nations. Nations who fail to abide by certain rules will be ejected. 

Nations are to allow people with an acceptable amount of social rights and freedom that will be decided by trusted member states. Nations will regulate their nation&#39;s corporations, preventing them from infringing on the rights of the populace. All nations of the DSR are to be democratic governments.
