This small continent was once halved. The north was controlled by a series of independent city-states, the largest being Trinopolis. The south was a powerful but oppressive monarchy. Trinopolis was conquered by barbarians and reborn New Quernica, while the monarchy was overthrown by a sinister cult. New Quernica allied with rogue nation Escapera to beat back Duumatria to a small Southeast corner. They surrive through their alliance with Moranis, a corporate sponsored city-state alliance. Now all 4 nations vie for control.
