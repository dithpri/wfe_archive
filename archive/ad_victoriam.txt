The embassies that this region holds (or is currently building), all told, comprise a full and complete list of every single military colony held by the [b][region=Union of Liberal Nations][/b], with the exclusion of [region=The City of the Sun] and the [region=Supreme Administrative Court].

(To borrow a turn of phrase from the Guardian&#39;s [i]Fiver[/i] football e-newsletter, we also hold embassies with &quot;Big Region&quot;. Which is its own place, obviously.)
