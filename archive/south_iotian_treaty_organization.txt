The South-Iotian Treaty Organization (SITO) is an intergovernmental political alliance proposed by [nation]kyodaar[/nation] to encourage international cooperation and attempt to prevent armed conflict on the Iotian continent. SITO was originally founded to unify the many smaller nation-states in the southern region of Iotus, and to resist possible imperial conquest threatened by [nation]deus iotus[/nation].

Entire nations disappear to duplicate planets, leaving only shadows in their wake, and other nations suddenly pop into existence with no warning.
