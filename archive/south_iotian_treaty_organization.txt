The South-Iotian Treaty Organization (SITO) is an intergovernmental political alliance proposed by [nation]kyodaar[/nation] to encourage international cooperation and attempt to prevent armed conflict on the Iotian continent. SITO was originally founded to unify the many smaller nation-states in the southern region of Iotus, and to resist possible imperial conquest threatened by [nation]deus iotus[/nation].

While many of the nations within SITO have exceptional human rights records, others have been deemed oppressive or in violation of these rights by the international community. However, representatives from those regions are permitted to sit on peace talks to further allay tension.
