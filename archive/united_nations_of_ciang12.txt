This region takes all the political ideas I believe in: Free speech, no forced decisions, and voting. UNC think that personal views are important and anyone who joins us is free to give us some ideas. I hope that you will want to join this region and become part of our community. We are pro-WA, pro-alliances and pro-peace. Theres just one condition: all nations who join the UNC must change there currency to the Peuro.
