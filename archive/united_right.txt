[b]Founded by[/b]-Holy Empire of Ursean 

[b]History[/b]-Forged in the fires of war with communist threats outside the region. From there we gained a incredible hatred for all Leftism. We forged a Brotherhood in the war lead by Ursean, but fought with the blood of Terrans and Anglo Americans, and the technology of the Republic of Lydris. Ours is a Brotherhood forged in war, forged from the tools which we fought, and in the blood we spilt.
