Established in 2025, [colour=#B9D9EB][b]This region stands with its people rooted in tradition, firm on sovereignty, and guided by common sense. We will defend our conservative region against out-of-touch elites who dismiss our values and silence our voices. We protect local communities, uphold strong and secure borders, and return power to where it belongs: the people. Together, we will build a proud, strong, and secure future founded on order, responsibility, and national unity.[/b][/colour][hr]
