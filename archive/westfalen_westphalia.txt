[b]Westphalia[/b] is and will forever be held within the hearts of The people. Through [b]Emperor Westphalian Reich of House of Petain[/b] the original Motherland region was founded. Through time there have been splits and fights amongst the sibling Westphalians. I seek to bear the will of the Chosen Heir of Petain, We as Westphalians work together in order to become whole once more. 

[i]May We all seek Einheit (unity), to become whole once again.[/i] 

Westphalia is home to the Spirit of Westphalia. Forevermore shall the Westphalian Empire stand in solidarity. It matters not where We live, for we carry Westphalia and her ambitions in all of our hearts. 

WIR SIND WESTFALEN!

[b]Acolyte of Emperor Raelagen An&#39;Den von Nouvelle Quebec[/b]
