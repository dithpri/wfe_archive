[b]Westphalia[/b] is and will forever be held within the hearts of The people. Through [b]Emperor Westphalian Reich of House of Petain[/b] the original Motherland region was founded. Through time there have been splits and fights amongst the sibling Westphalians. I seek to bear the will of the Chosen Heir of Petain, We as Westphalians work together in order to become whole once more. 

[i]May We all seek Einheit (unity), to become whole once again.[/i] 

The river Rhine shall always flow through these lands.
