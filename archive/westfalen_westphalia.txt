[b]Some raiders from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were scouting some future regions and found one that looked perfect. They asked the sneak master himself, Drexlore, on how to proceed unnoticed. He then produced a giant cardboard box that the Hawks hid under unnoticed on their way into the region. After a bit the rest of the Hawks asked Drex what to do next. He didn&#39;t know and suggested they fall asleep. After a nice rest, the Hawks woke up and realized that they had taken the region!
