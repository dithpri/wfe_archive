We&amp;#39;ll be singing when we&amp;#39;re winning.- Martin Van Buren.   The Alliance of Tubthumping is a hardy and most peculiar region. Our founder, the questionably sane Martin Van Buren XXIV, is an advocate of Religious Law and wishes all to unite under one God. Also, he enjoys That 70&amp;#39;s Show, but only the episodes prior to Eric&amp;#39;s trip to Africa. You may ask, &amp;quot;What beef do you have with the later episodes of That&amp;#39;s 70&amp;#39;s Show?&amp;quot; To which Martin Van Buren XXIV would give you reasons: 1. Without Eric living in the house, why do they still hang out in his basement? 2. Martin Van Buren XXIV was not too keen on Fez&amp;#39;s and Jackie&amp;#39;s new relationship. And 3. Randy. Oh how we all despise Randy&amp;#39;s replacement of Eric.
