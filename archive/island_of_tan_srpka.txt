The island of Tan Srpka is a place faraway from the rest of its world which keeps its distance from the great powers of the planet and the universe. The Tan Srpkans are a proud people who keep their way of life in utmost importance. Located near the South Pole of its world, it is very much barren and untouched for the most part, keeping its natural beauty intact.
