The island of Tan Srpka is an island almost completely cut off from the rest of the world. The local population has built themselves a main hub, fittingly called Srpka, serving as the home of the government of the island as well as the home for a good chunk of the population. The island is home to 5 million people and several strange varieties of creatures such as the winged cat, their national animal. Due to the island&#146;s small population, the wildlife and environment has remained largely unchanged, serving to bring in tourists and keep the island healthy. The island lacks much of a military due to their isolationism. Due to lack of external stress, the government and people can focus on keeping their island maintained.
