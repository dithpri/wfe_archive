We only accept the most free nations in the world. Any socialist policies will not be tolerated here. We intend to build a strong region to spread the beautiful ideals of capitalism.
If you join you will be accepted into the Free Capitalist Trade Pact, which intends to spread capitalism throughout the region through the sale and trade of cheap quality goods!
