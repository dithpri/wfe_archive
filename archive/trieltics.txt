[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr]

Once upon a time, [region]Trieltics[/region] temporarily raided and defaced one of my regions, [region]Ass[/region]. It is so satisfying and ironic that I am the one who seizes this region at long last. On that note, I get to finally say this little line; [i]&quot;Total number of stars brought down: 1 ([region]Trieltics[/region])[/i]&quot;
