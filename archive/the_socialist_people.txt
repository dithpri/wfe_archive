Welcome to The Socialist People Region! 
[u]&quot;Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.&quot;[/u]
-Friedrich Engels
-----------------------------------------------
Here you can talk about socialism and basically anything political.
Just dont talk about capitalism &amp;gt;:(
This Region is gonna be mostly chill, problably just arguments and ect.
There are just three simple rules:
Be decently nice to others.
Do not harass anybody.
Have fun!
I hope you will enjoy this server.
