[quote=the_free_republic_of_people;15204187]This might not be a memorable day for the world, but for the few individuals that now has a chance to significantly alter the course of history, this has extraordinary means.[/quote]
[quote=wenglia;15204211]Today is a great day for us all!
We have banded together in a (hopefully) lasting alliance, for our own safety, as well as a hope for diplomatic interactions with other lands.
The world might not remember this day, but it is indeed a glorious memorable day for our Alliance![/quote]
