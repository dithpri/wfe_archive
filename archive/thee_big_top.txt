        Thee Big Top is a semi-tropical region home to some of strangest flora and fauna in the world. The trade of exotic monsters from these dense jungles makes this place worthy of note in many foreign ports. These anomalies of nature are often featured in theaters and circuses across the world. Thee Great Capitol Tent of Big Top, the central city of Thee Big Top, is a corrupt though colorful metropolis sharing borders with all the silly and depraved nations that reside in this region. A den of vice, The Great Capitol is a jumble of shantytowns and sprawling marketplaces built in a series of deep craggy valleys.
