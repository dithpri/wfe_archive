A mostly unheard of, large landmass dubbed &quot;New Antium&quot;, a multitude of nations call it home, each with unique ideologies. Fairly diversified, the continent is host to one of the globe&#39;s largest mountain ranges, several lush forests, and a fairly inhospitable desert. Though still small, this region has become more and more well known thorughout the years, and only continues to expand it&#39;s territorial claims.
