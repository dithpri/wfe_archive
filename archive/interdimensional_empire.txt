A frightening behemoth is rising up from the depths of the multiverse. Like a vast and monstrous silicon octopus, it is stretching forth its ominous and threatening high tech tentacles.

The people could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening.

Multitudes of unsuspecting, helpless victims will very soon be encircled and crushed by hostile forces from unknown dimensions

Who among us can possibly escape from the electronic cages now being prepared for all mankind?

No one.

Revel in your time, because it is running out.
