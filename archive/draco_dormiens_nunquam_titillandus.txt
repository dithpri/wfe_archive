This region is open to all views of ruling, but reminds all that a communistic nation cannot exist since that is utopia and fascism will never break your fall. 
A land where the traditions appeared and died down, the land soaked in blood of our predecessors. We stand mighty and proud, but History lowers our heads to remember the fallen. From the Ural Mountains to the high volcanos of the North-East, this land lays forgotten and empty, but it&#39;s past remains, it&#39;s nature flourishes and the unknown is still here. 
Explore. Magic?
