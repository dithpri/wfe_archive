We will pursue a hardline Communist position derived from the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Mao. We oppose imperialism, capitalism and exploitation. 

We will use the World Assembly to fight against imperialism, oppression and exploitation, liberate the masses, and undermine the powers of the bourgeoisie elite.

Plus, we have a cool name.

Note: we have no issue with any other leftist regions, quite the contrary, we seek friendly relations with all leftist regions, and if this group is not to your taste, we encourage you join them.
