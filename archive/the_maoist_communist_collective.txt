The Maoist Communist Collective Constitution:

1) We will pursue a hardline Communist position derived from the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Mao. We oppose imperialism, capitalism and exploitation in all their forms. 

2) We will use the power of the World Assembly to liberate the masses, and undermine the powers of the bourgeoisie elite.

3) We will seek to antagonise and destabilise all fascist and far-right regions.

4) We will seek to be friendly with non-Maoist leftist groups, whilst also encouraging them to become more radical.
