The Comoros is a volcanic archipelago off Africa&#146;s east coast, in the warm Indian Ocean waters of the Mozambique Channel. The nation state&#146;s largest island, Grande Comore (Ngazidja) is ringed by beaches and old lava from active Mt. Karthala volcano. Clustered around the port in the capital, Moroni, carved doors and the white colonnaded Ancienne Mosqu&eacute;e du Vendredi recall the islands&#146; Arab heritage.
