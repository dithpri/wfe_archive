In 1990 revolution swept the Kingdom of Cissaria, overthrowing the royal family and installing what was to have been a free democratic state. However that dream is no more, the government fell apart and now the nation lays divided between North Cissaria and South Cissaria. These two states with conflicting ideologies one a Fascist totalitarian state and the other a so called workers paradise have clashed for utter domination of the nation and both claim to be the sole representative of the Cissarian people. To add the Cissarian War of 1990-1997 has left the two ever bitter and ever armed. Now as border tensions increase and an arms buildup rages both states ready for a final all out conflict for supreme leadership of Cissaria.
