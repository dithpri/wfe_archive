[color=blue]Welcome, honored guest, to our humble abode, somewhere south of paradise.  Our pleasant, safe region welcomes all kinds of nations who wish to join. This region is a merged region between Durganorma and The Land of Blue Chicken. Give us a ring (or TG!) if we&amp;#39;re ever on the featured region page :)

We&amp;#39;re currently updating our constitution, which can be seen here: http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;amp;t=133066.[/color]
