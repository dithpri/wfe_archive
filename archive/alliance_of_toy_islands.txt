[color=blue]&amp;quot;Equality, Unity, Peacefully, Happily&amp;quot;[/color]

[color=blue]Welcome, honored guest, to our humble abode, somewhere south of paradise. We strive to establish justice, equality, peace, in the hope to create a happier world for everyone. Our pleasant, safe region welcomes all kinds of nations who wish to join. This region is a merged region between Durganorma and The Land of Blue Chicken. Give us a ring (or TG!) if we&amp;#39;re ever on the featured region page :)

Our constitution is here: http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;amp;t=133066. You are expected to know the rules.[/color]
