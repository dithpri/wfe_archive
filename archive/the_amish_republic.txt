[b][color=orange]Congratulations![/color][/b] You&#39;ve stumbled across the democratic haven of The Amish Republic! This astonishing land has existed for less than 100 days, undergoing numerous changes and rebrandings, yet is preparing to emerge on the other side with its values intact. So come, wander down our palm tree-lined streets, take a sip of our smooth, world-reknowned tea or perhaps sample a taste of our key lime pie! Whatever your taste, we accommodate for all!
