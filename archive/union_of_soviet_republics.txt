Originally communist, possibly under [region]Antifa[/region] protection, this region was occupied by [region]The American Fascist League[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinism[/color][/b]. Leading members of the Russian National Socialist Party, Russian National Unity, National Socialist Society, National Bolsheviks, Movement Against Illegal Immigration, and Communist Party of the Russian Federation are in custody and await charges of crimes against humanity.

The area has mostly been de-militarized and residents relocated, but in response to signs of fascist invasion, a small but powerful force will remain here until further notice.
