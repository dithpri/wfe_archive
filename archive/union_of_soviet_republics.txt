Originally communist, possibly under [region]Antifa[/region] protection, this region was occupied by [region]The American Fascist League[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinism[/color][/b].

Its remaining occupants are now being evacuated by international relief services and the FJA military. Fascists, if you want the land back, you will have to wait until around January 18th, by which time the innocent people of Union of Soviet Republics will be safe and the resources salvaged.

Until then, this region stands as an exhibition for one of the coolest Soviet Socialist Republics flags :P
