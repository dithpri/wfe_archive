   Nalterra is a secured Earth-like region in which no nation is allowed to enter. Any nation attempting to settle here will hereby be trespassing and will be swiftly declared war on, so don&#39;t expect to be here. At all.
   As for the description of the region, the region has landmasses which are virtually identical to Earth&#39;s in shape. Because of this, many people mistake this for Earth, which is not. The landscapes are also very nice and varied with biomes such as rainforests and deserts sprawled across the spans and distances of the land. It is home to a couple of nations, all of which have close ties with each other.
