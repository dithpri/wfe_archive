Nalterra is a secured Earth-like region in which permitted nations are only allowed to enter. Any nation attempting to settle here without permission will herby be trespassing and will be swiftly declared war on. Permission requires the notification of the founder of the region, The United Countries of America. However, permission is not guaranteed and almost all of the requests will be possibly ignored or rejected, so don&amp;#39;t expect to be here. At all.
