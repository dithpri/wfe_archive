The Valley of International Debates was founded in the year of 1815. The region builds upon an old constitution, in which four of the original countrys, after a devistating and lastloning war, agreed to solve their differences through debate. It was decided that a neutral piece of land should contain a council with deligates from each of the four countries. In hier, politics, science, ideology and beliefs are discussed, but the concils most importen function is the department named the security council.

The region is a neutral region in which two of the founding regions are leading an almost violent ideological war against each other. This is due to the fact that they each represent the far right wing and the far left wing.
