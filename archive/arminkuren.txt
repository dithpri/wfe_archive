[region]Arminkuren[/region] is a region devoted to Dictatorships and Socialist Nations. Our goal is to grow and take a greater part in the NS world. We will be establishing Embassies, electing a WA delegate, and building an Armed Forces as we go. Positions will be available and put to a vote amongst the representatives of each nation in our region. Despite what you may think when you first see that we are comprised mostly of Dictatorships we do not condone slavery, or acts that are unnecessarily harmful to citizens of a nation or region. Nor do we condone racism or the oppression of minorities. All citizens will be equally oppressed... for their own good of course.
