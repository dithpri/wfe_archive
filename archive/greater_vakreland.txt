Founded in 2013, Vakreland began as a vivacious society.  However, after a promising ascent, the civilization underwent a sudden decline in productivity. The area was found to have been affected by a mishap involving G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate pollution in the atmosphere, which was promptly remedied.
Recently, a plucky group of progressive reformers has stepped up to restore Vakreland.  With unbridled optimism and steely resolve, a strong corps of leadership has pledged to lift the nation it beyond the height of its former glory, and reestablish it as a beacon of hope and greatness in the region.
