[b]&quot;I find beautiful-bearded and tranquil-faced young Muslims, doing prayers and prostrating, and with them are their guns. Ask them: &#39;Are you really fighters in the way of Allah?&#39; It grieves my heart unpleasantly, knowing that they did not raise the banner of Islam. Rather, they raised the banner of Putin. Subhanallah! Do they, the Muslim youths, go fight and spoil their blood for a wicked, defiant orthodox christian man, the one who is waging war against Allah and His messenger? Where are your minds? Where are your minds? Where are the minds of the young of Muslims?&quot;[/b][hr][b]- Abdullah al-Muhaysini[/b]
