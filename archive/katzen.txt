[b]ATTENTION![/b] The Katzen discord server was destroyed. We were the subject of a brutal raid that deleted months of messages and kicked almost everybody off of the server. We are now in the process of rebuilding the server. If you would like to help or rejoin, then please do. Katzen has not yet been lost.
