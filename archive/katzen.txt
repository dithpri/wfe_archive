[b][color=purple]KATZEN[/b][/color] is an historic region that peaked just prior to [b][color=green]COVID-19[/b][/color] but fell into [color=red][b]ABANDONMENT[/b][/color] shortly thereafter. As a result, [b][color=pink]RAIDER GROUP[/b][/color] [region]Lily[/region] was able to seize and take control of the region. Thankfully, the [b][color=navy]ALLIED REGION[/b][/color] of [region]Tarkin[/region] was able to counter invade and overpower the [color=red][b]RAIDERS[/b][/color], clean the region, and return control to [color=purple][b]KATZEN NATIVE[/b][/color], [nation]Free Katzen[/nation].

As a token of [b][color=gold]GRATITUDE[/b][/color], Katzen is now a member of the [b][color=maroon]TARKIN COMMONWEALTH[/b][/color]
