     Welcome, to the Global Assembly. We are an assembly of nations from all across the globe, with different ideologies and desires. The objective of this organisation is to collect representatives and delegates from all nations and states of the globe to lay fundamental principles that can be agreed upon, as well as to dispute territorial claims between nations. Admission of new states into the Assembly will be voted upon by all standing members of the Assembly, and after approval territorial claims and diplomatic relationships will be negotiated with the newly recognized territory, as well as the neighboring nations.
