The Federation of Unified Communities was formed as a means for nations to work in some international levels of unity, while still maintaining their own federal and state governments.  The FUC recognizes the values of each individual nation as their culture and way of life, and this federation was formed in order to protect the values of its member nations.  Through pan-nation diplomacy with minor regulations regarding international issues, the FUC protects the nation&#146;s independence, promotes regional trade for mutual benefit, as well as guarantees each nation&#146;s participation in deterring or defending against regional threats.
