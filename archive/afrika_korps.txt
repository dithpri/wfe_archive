This region was part of the network currently known as [region]Nationalsozialistische Volksstaaten[/region]. [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region] took over on behalf of its fellow neo-Nazis. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

The [i]Deutsche Afrikakorps[/i], under the leadership of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (the &amp;quot;Desert Fox&amp;quot;), was one of the few Nazi German forces not charged with war crimes.[hr][nation=short]Rommel and his Afrikakorps[/nation] have surrendered to FJA forces. Nazi loyalists are being weeded out. The bulk of the Afrika Korp will be re-painted and deployed in future antifascist missions, while the remainder will focus on reconstruction and relief efforts.
