[color=663300][b]The German Africa Corps[/b] was the German expeditionary force in Africa during the North African Campaign of World War II. The term &amp;quot;Afrika Korps&amp;quot; is derived from the original German name and is properly written as one word. Strictly speaking, the term refers to the original formation, the Deutsches Afrikakorps (DAK), which became incorporated into the Axis command of the German and Italian forces in North Africa. However, it was often used by the news media and Allied soldiers as a name for all German units in North Africa. The reputation of the Afrika Korps is tied with that of its first commander, Erwin Rommel.[/color] [color=666666]&#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
