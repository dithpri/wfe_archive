This region (And/Or Pact) is named after the City of Scovoin (Quick History: The City of Scovoin used to be the Capital city of Austria, Vienna. But After some revolt in the province of Tyrol, All of Austria was no longer Austria. It&#39;s now The Rogue Nation of Siberlin.) and basically a rip-off of the Warsaw Pact... No matter, we work things differently around here. Think of this as an &quot;Alliance&quot;.
