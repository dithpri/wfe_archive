Welcome to Hailikon - continent engulfed in the flames of war. Here the peaceful democracies border bloodthirsty dictatorships just waiting for their smallest mistake to conquer them. Land where peace flourishes and where war erupts with fury nobody else seen before. In this continent stands your nation: The choice what to do... is yours.
