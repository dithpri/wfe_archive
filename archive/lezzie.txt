&amp;#9819;: [color=grey]Okay, [i]you can stay if you want[/i], but I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;d want to stay in a puppet region (unless you&#39;re storing puppets lol)[/color]

[b]&amp;#10017;&amp;#10017;[/b] Feel free to store your puppets here if you want, I don&#39;t mind at all, but I wouldn&#39;t expect much conversation... [b]&amp;#10017;&amp;#10017;[/b]
