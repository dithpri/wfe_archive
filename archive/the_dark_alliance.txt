Poll Results:
5 Voted for less dictatorship. You may now experience that in the [region]Rejected Realms[/region]
1 Voted for turkey slabs (option for chow). Amazingly, it was not chow who voted for turkey slabs, but [nation=short+noflag]THe Mounted Aerwhales[/nation]
But the winner overall was to make the protestors &amp;quot;vanish&amp;quot;! with 6 votes.
The reduction in region funds is just a coincidence, and the fact that those 6 voters came out with some more funds is another coincidence.
