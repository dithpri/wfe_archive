Mr Scrivener and Mr Gifford today have demolished 3/4 of Sydney Boys High and all of The Kings School. Mr Scrivener used a giant T-Square marked with [b]Australian Standards[/b], while Mr Gifford was reported to be using his trusty old bandsaw. When asked about the wanton destruction, Mr Scrivener merely commented: &amp;quot;Not up to Australian Standards.&amp;quot;, while Mr Gifford was too busy Bandsawing all the desks in Sydney Grammar School to comment.
On another note, Mr Dowdell has allegedly blown up all the trains in an attempt to (Imitate Louis Ye)issue detentions to every student.
