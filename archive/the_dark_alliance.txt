This school year I have some important questions for you
Would you:
A) Get hit by a car, run over by a train and eat Mr Dowdell
B) Sit for 14 hours straight in Berringer&amp;#39;s Class
Would you:
A) Miss the train, be late to school and report to Dowdell at Recess
B) Try to open the train door, jam your hand in and break your arm
Would you:
A) Take time to search your bag for your train ticket, be late to school and report to Dowdell at Recess
B) Vault over the ticket gate, be tackled by a police officer, and face a $200 fine

Pick wisely this school year, Dowdell&amp;#39;s wrath is 150% more red
