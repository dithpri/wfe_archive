[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] did their best to navigate a laggy update today. Despite their best efforts they did lose it a bit it during the long waits, with Holor calling a STOP command, Jo forgetting there were other numbers between 6 and 14, and Ursus trying to start the raid on the 19th target. All in all, a weird update, but a successful one.
