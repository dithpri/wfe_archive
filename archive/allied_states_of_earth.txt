The &quot;Allied States of Earth&quot; is an alliance of nation states that share the Western World&#39;s ideals and values such as democracy, free speech and individual rights. Each nation-state will have the ability to vote on polls linked to the current World Assembly resolutions. The World Assembly delegates will then issue their vote on behalf of those who voted in the regional polls.

To democracy, freedom and prosperity!
