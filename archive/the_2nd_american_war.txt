The 2nd American War started in late March of 2017, when Black Lives Matter activists declared a secession in California, New York, New Mexico and Michigan. However, they had no real claim, therefore President Trump and the U.S government ignored the activists. In mid April BLM attacked U.S bases throughout the country. Success in California and New York gave BLM a real footing. The U.S split into two sides. The Federalist States of America and the Socialist Republic of America. The two sides fight now, police and federal forces vs Black Lives Matter and Left-Wing Rebels.
