Welcome to The Wild NS! Whether you be a settler nation, a bandit nation, a nomadic cowboy nation, an American Indian nation, a post-apocalyptic nation, or any other matter of estranged peoples wanting a new life out west, I welcome you with open arms. This region is a region for nations taking place in, or inspired by, the Wild West, Native Americans, or the Government trying to civilize these lands. Please note this is a western-themed region and while other nations are allowed, they might not fit in too well with the aesthetics of the region.
