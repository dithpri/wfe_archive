Goooooood Morning!
In Thneedville, It&#39;s a brand new dawn.
With brand new cars, and houses and lawns.
Here in got-all-that-we-need-ville.
In Thneedville, we manufacture our trees.
Each one is made in factories.
And uses 96 batteries!
In Thneedville, the air is not so clean.
So we buy it fresh.
IT COMES OUT THIS MACHINE!
It&#39;s Satisfactions-guaranteed-ville!
In Thneedville, we don&#39;t want to know
Where the smog and trash, and chemicals go.
I JUST WENT SWIMMING, AND NOW I GLOW!
In Thneedville we have fun year-round;
We surf and snowboard right in town.
We thank the Lord for all we&#39;ve got,
Including this brand new parking lot!
PARKING LOT! Paaaarking lot!
