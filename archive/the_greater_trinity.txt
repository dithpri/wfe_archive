(OoC: This is Where the Royal Kingdom and her closest allies are located)

Temporary entry. The trinity refers to the three nations that were once part of the Greater Holy Empire. After a civil war, the Royal Kingdom of Elipida and the Commonwealth of Dai Shihai seceded from the Empire and formed their own nations. However as the three nations grew larger, tensions between the Empire and its neighbours. As a result, several armed conflicts arose between the three nations.
