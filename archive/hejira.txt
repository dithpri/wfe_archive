&iexcl;Oye, compatriota! Join [url=http://hejira.forumotion.com/]the forums[/url] and register an account!

&iexcl;Bienvenidos al Reino de Hejira (roughly pronounced heh-GEE-rah)! There&amp;#39;s not much going on right now, but with your help, compliance, and donation of bodily fluids, we can make Hejira into something awesome.

As advertised above (and very bluntly), you should join the forums to gain access to the Constitutional Convention, a roleplay section, and general discussion with your fellow nations. You know you want to.

The current King of Hejira (Rey de Hejira) is Ysidro Rend&oacute;n, or Hejira. Contact him if you have any questions.
