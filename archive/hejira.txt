[i]&iexcl;Bienvenidos al Reino de Hejira (roughly pronounced heh-GEE-rah)![/i] There&amp;#39;s not much going on right now, but with your help, compliance, and donation of bodily fluids, we can make Hejira into something [b]awesome[/b].

As advertised above (and very bluntly), you should [b]join the forums[/b] to gain access to the Constitutional Convention, a roleplay section, and general discussion with your fellow nations. You know you want to.

The current [b]King of Hejira[/b] ([i]Rey de Hejira[/i]) is [b]Ysidro Rend&oacute;n[/b], or [nation]Hejira[/nation]. Contact him if you have any questions.
