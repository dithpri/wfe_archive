[b][u]WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL STUDENT-RUN CARLMONT APCG NATIONSTATES REGION[/b][/u]
The goal of this region is to unite the various countries currently under the jurisdiction of [nation=short]Harrison-Land[/nation]. Together we shall put into practice all we have learned throughout this year of International Relations in Carlmont. 
Since the pseudo-authoritarian beginning of the region, we have successfully transitioned into a republic. We have a strong constitution that fairly governs the people of this land. All who are part of Carlmont and somehow find out about Nationstate are welcome.
