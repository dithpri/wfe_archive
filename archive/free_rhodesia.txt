[b][i]Here&#39;s the story of Rhodesia...[/b][/I]

[u]Rhodesia was a British colony until 1964, when it unilaterally declared independence. The people saw what happened to the Congo when it was decolonized, and thus resisted British demands for immediate majority rule. In Rhodesia, terrs engaged in unspeakable horror against both whites and blacks. By the late 70s, all restrictions on rights between whites and blacks were abolished and the country&#39;s first black Prime Minister was elected. Still, it wasn&#39;t enough for a west that demanded future despot Robert Mugabe. &quot;Elections&quot; were held in 1979. Mugabe&#39;s ZANU party was allowed to intimidate and suppress during the election period. That was the end of Rhodesia, but she lives on in our hearts.[/u]
