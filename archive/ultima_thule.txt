[color=blue][b]A conquest of the [region]Nordic Lands[/region] and part of the[/color][color=green] Nordic Empire.[/b][/color]

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named Night,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule &#151;
From a wild weird clime, that lieth, sublime,
Out of Space &#151; out of Time.
