We are a region for the Cossacks for whom have been oppressed and suppressed for so long. Upon our founding on Thursday, January 11, 2018 we were a client region of the [b][region]German Federation[/region][/b], but in February 9, 2018 we became a Protectorate. Just because we are a Protectorate doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t join.

The Bundeswehr needs [b]YOU[/b]! Join the Cossack Corps today!
