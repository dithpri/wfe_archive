We are a region for the Cossacks for whom have been oppressed and suppressed for so long. Upon our founding on Thursday, January 11, 2018 we were a client region of the [b][region]German Federation[/region][/b]. On the 14th, the Federation unified, and we became a Client Region of [b][region]The Second Kingdom of Germany[/region][/b]. Just because we are a client region does not mean you can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t join. Long live the Cossacks and the Kingdom!
