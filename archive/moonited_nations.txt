[b]A little communist joke for your day:[/b]

[color=red]Three workers find themselves locked up, and they ask each other what they&#146;re in for. The first man says: &#147;I was always ten minutes late to work, so I was accused of sabotage.&#148; The second man says: &#147;I was always ten minutes early to work, so I was accused of espionage.&#148; The third man says: &#147;I always got to work on time, so I was accused of having a Western watch.&#148;[/color]
