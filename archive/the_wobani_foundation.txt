The Wobani Foundation is a region founded by students on the 16th of October 2018.

Here we have a kind and caring community. Please don&#39;t be toxic, or spam, otherwise you will receive a temporary ban. If there are any subsequent offences, you will receive a week-long ban. On your third offence, you will be kicked from the region. You are also not allowed to use any racial slurs, or talk about anyone&#39;s Mother in a bad way (lol).

Hope you&#39;re not intimidated by all the rules...

Have a nice time in The Wobani Foundation!

Please contact any of the nations right below this if you need any help.

P.S. Discord Server is in the Works
