[b][color=red]Welcome to the Interregional Death Association![/color][/b]
[i]Basic Information:[/i]
We are a branch of the Regional Death Association. Our goal is to spread like a plague to every region in nationstates. When we have succeeded at this we intend to destroy every region until there is nothing left but a large collection of dead regions. Members who take over a region are permitted to do as they please with them as long as they abide by our core principles.
