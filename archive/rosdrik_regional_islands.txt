A group of islands in the middle of the ocean between Australia, Africa, and Asia, the Rosdrik Regional Islands make up a very historical region, from the Great Rosdrik Empire to the simple Democratic Republic of Rosdrik today. Of course, many other inhabited islands, yet to create a stable and effective government make up the entire region as a whole.
