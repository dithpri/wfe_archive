Apocalyptia is a region built on relatively large island surrounded by ocean. 
It has scattered &amp;#39;dead zones&amp;#39; that are inhabited by 2 types of supernatural beings, Sasquatch and Chupacabra. While both beasts are fearsome, they generally don&amp;#39;t wander out of their habitat&amp;#39;s, due to fear of humans.
Apocalyptia has a dormant Volcano, Mt. Ragnorok. While it is categorised as dormant, this volcano is still widely feared.
Apocalyptia has but only one deity that they revere. The less popular and quite clumsy &amp;#39;Fifth Horseman&amp;#39; - Tragedy.
The citizen&amp;#39;s of Apocalyptia are an outgoing people that enjoy the annual lollipop smashing festival, in honour of their deity.
They also enjoy hunting the ever growing population of Sasquatch and Chupacabra
