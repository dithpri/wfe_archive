Saint Derevo is a resilient and multifaceted nation, marked by a cyclical history of rise, fall, and rebirth. Born from the vision of a protector who built a village around the Sacred Tree, it evolved from an isolated fortress to a semi-independent state in the Rhineland, going through wars, chaos, and reconstructions. The region of Saint Derevo originated from a decision by the Emperor to grant autonomy to all states, while still having all of them as part of the Empire.
