The LUSW, a region welcoming those dedicated to tolerance and improving the welfare of all peoples.

We stand for all that is right: equality, justice, and liberty for all. We never enforce our will on others, but will fight to liberate other like-minded people should their government oppress them. None should be punished for exercising their freewill so long as it does no harm to others, that is our cause, our truth, our rallying cry.

Join us in the quest for liberty!
