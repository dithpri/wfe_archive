Initium Novum is a region based on the following ideals:

-No one person, race, or nation shall have total power of the lands

-All shall have the right to choose the delegate they want, or not to vote at all

-All shall be free to speak within reason, as long as no offense has occurred

-All who wish to leave are free to do so, without consequence

-All are free to lay claim to unclaimed lands, provided that ample space is left for others to have equal room


Long live Initium Novum!
