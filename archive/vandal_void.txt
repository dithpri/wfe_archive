Onto Vurdesian soil a tear, a tear of the universe itself was made.The Vandal Void. It was made from the 1488th dimension by the God Emperors Sacco and Vanzetti Vandal in order to bleach the world white by the awesome power of Right Wing Death Squads led by Vandal White Space Marines to introduce and Emily White Sharia onto the world; and Vurdesia is the instrument and custodian. The only earthly access to the Vandal Void is through the temple of Kek by a sacrifice of communists, thots, and mud people.
