Gabriella: Why are you whispering?

Troy: What? Oh, uh... well my friends know about the snowboarding. Um, I haven&#39;t quite told them about the singing thing.

Student: (to Troy) Hey, what&#39;s up?

Troy: Hey.

Gabriella: Too much for them to handle?

Troy: No, it was cool. But, you know, my friends, it&#39;s uh... it&#39;s not what I do. That was, like,a different person.

{Gabriella suddenly turns and goes down a hallway as Troy finishes his sentence}

Troy: So, uh... anyway, welcome to East High. Oh, now that you&#39;ve met Miss Darbus, I bet you just can&#39;t wait to sign up for that.
{Troy points at the winter musical sign-up sheet tacked on the bulletin board}
