Welcome all Whisps new and old. In the Arouras, you will be greeted with nothing, Yea um, sorry about that. I&#39;m not experienced with greetings. Otherwise we are all about rp-ing in our region and rp-ing together as a community. For starters, slurs are not allowed, I don&#39;t think they are allowed anyways, but just making sure. For second, we expect honest and realistic ro-playing as you can&#39;t just join and say &quot;I will bomb everyone&quot;, then tries to proceed to bomb everyone. Last, I want you to enjoy yourself here and make yourself a piece of what makes up the new generation of the Arouras. 

Are you with me?
