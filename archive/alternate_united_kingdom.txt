Alternate United Kingdom is a region based on an alternate-history modern world, in which all nations are connected to the actual United Kingdom but have different points of Divergence. The regional members may be located anywhere IC, but are united under one constitution that sets up an international federation government, in which all may take part -- though members can still administer their internal affairs, diplomacy, defense, trade, and so on, subject to a few limits imposed by the Alternate United Kingdom&amp;#39;s representatives. Our WA candidate will be elected by popular vote which will appear on this page every month. PS we also welcome any other nation into our region.
