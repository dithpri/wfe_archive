Hello ya baggers.... 

I&#39;d like to clarify that we are a devote region for optimistic views and we are neutral and recruiter friendly... We love to have any nation foolish enough to come here and LET THEM STAY!!!

We strongly advised you ask Our glorious Founder [nation]Ooey[/nation] the founder of our regional branch The Guardians of 6 questions related to the region. The Guardians of 6 is the Founding government of our region it opposes communism and fascism and is strongly neutral and isolated for this reason no embassy request will be sent and all other embassies will be denied here.

And you give support to

Guardians
