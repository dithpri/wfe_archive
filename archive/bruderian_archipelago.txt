The history of the colonization of the regions today associated with Bruderia began in the 16th century, during the invasion of the Americas by the Spanish and Portuguese empires. However, there were contributions from various parts of Europe, mainly the Germans of the Holy Roman Empire under Charles V, whose crown ruled over both Austria, which was the seat of the Holy Roman crown, and the Spanish throne. Later on, nordic participation in the colonization effort rose to prominence as well.
