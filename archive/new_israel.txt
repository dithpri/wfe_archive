[color=#19AF19]Shalom and welcome to New Israel.[/color]

We are a small but diverse region that is home to a fascinating array of cultures. New Israel supports the spread of Jewish heritage, traditions, history and the Hebrew Language as part of the Jewish Nationalism. Jews, Christians, Muslims and all others are welcome here, and you must respect the beliefs of the inhabitants. Understand, however, that this is a Zionist region.

All ideologies are welcomed, but you cannot be Anti-Zionist, or Anti-Semitic. Tyranny and abuse of power are also prohibited.
