-Hello

-If you are reading this entry you have proven yourself worthy

-Worthy of what you might ask

-Worthy of eliminating the ones that call themselves &quot;Invaders&quot;

-Worthy of covertly infiltrating into their midst, befriending them, learning from them, and eventually betraying them

-That is the task &quot;The Founder&quot; wants us to do

-To covertly infiltrate and execute whatever task and enemy the World Assembly wishes us

-In a silent and unseen manner

-So what do you say? Are you up for the challenge? Cause we are.
