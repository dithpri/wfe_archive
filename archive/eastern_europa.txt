Welcome to East Europe; the other half of Europe..., East Europe was once under the thumb of the USSR aside few nations who managed to remain neutral or join NATO. Now it is independent of Soviet control... and is now under EU control ... at least most of them are; some things never change eh?

East Europe has four specific areas; the Balkans, the Baltics, Central East Europe, and Russia. Each region has its own cultures, history, and stories.

Join us in crafting more history, and more cultures into the bright future!
