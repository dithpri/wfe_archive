I have seen the Fascist movement sweeping through the land, I have seen the capitalist band together and steal from the people...How long shall we wallow in oppression ? We are the people! We shall not be taken advantage of any longer.. it is time to spring forth and launch the red revolution ! its time to follow in the footsteps of Marx, and Lenin, and Now we shall forge our own path...The Petrine Revolution !
