Hello! Welcome to the Open Wheel Racing Championship! This is a roleplay region, where anyone that wishes to enter, will have the ability to either create and manage their own racing team in the competitive world of the Open Wheel Racing Championship, or even be a news reported, that will report on the results of each race and be tasked of interviewing drivers and team owners and report news stories about them.

This region is an attempt at creating a Formula One-style roleplay region! If you are a fan of Formula One or motorsport in general, why not have a look around?
