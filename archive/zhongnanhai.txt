Zhongnanhai is a former imperial garden in the Imperial City, Beijing, adjacent to the Forbidden City; it serves as the central headquarters for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the State Council (Central government) of China. Zhongnanhai houses the office of the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (paramount leader) and Premier of the People&#39;s Republic of China. The term Zhongnanhai is closely linked with the central government and senior Communist Party officials. It is often used as a metonym for the Chinese leadership at large (in the same sense that the term &quot;White House&quot; refers to the U.S. executive branch).
