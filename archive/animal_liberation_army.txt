[b]This region was taken by the [region]The United Imperialist Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region]!

No region is safe from our awesome might, tremble in fear as we march by!

All hail the Kaiserin! Long live the emperor!

We like to thank our imperialist friends and allies from [region]Kantrias[/region][/b]

P.S: This was lead by Edward Leben with help from his wonderful friends!
