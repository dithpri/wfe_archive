The Theme of this Group is Fiction and a multiverse of it. If You join and start editing our World Factbook entry fine that&#39;s cool. And yes we are an LGBTQIA+ Group. That doesn&#39;t make our banner and flag one particular groups. You might find our flag a little tacky but contains Fiction ( the chief element of this multiverse ) and Trans, Lesbian, Ace, and Pan representation. If you have a nicer design that gets both fiction and LGBTQIA+ across upload it but don&#39;t focus on your specific section of the spectrum we&#39;re all a family. This factbook isn&#39;t for picking witchy coven fights or what not. What you post in this Factbook represents us all.
