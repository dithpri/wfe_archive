Welcome, Fair and Democratic Nations of the world!

You are all welcome in the People&#39;s Democratic Mavillkushi Empire! We are a small region looking to expand.

[b]RULES:[/b]

- Political freedoms and civil rights must be &quot;Unheard of&quot; or lower. Strong economies are allowed.
- Currency must be changed to the People&#39;s dollar, as we are also a monetary union. Think EU for dictatorships.
- There are no guidelines as to how your flag is designed, but we recommend that you redesign your flag to include some design elements from the Mavillkushi flag.
- All nations [b][u]MUST[/u][/b] praise Dear Leader as their God. If desired, name your national religion after the nation&#39;s leader.
- Last but not least, [i]Have Fun![/i]
