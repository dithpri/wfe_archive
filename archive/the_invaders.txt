[spoiler=What is Raiding?] Raiding is how regions are taken over. By joining the World Assembly, you can endorse a nation. The nation with the most endorsements in a region is the delegate. The delegate has the power to kick nations from a region. Raiding is when nations try to take over a region, by having the most endorsements. However the number of endorsements a nation has are only calculated twice a day, at noon and at midnight on the East Coast of the USA.  For Europeans the time is early morning and early evening.
