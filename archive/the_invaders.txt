[spoiler=What to do in this Region?] We&#39;re all about raiding. Raiding is when nations move into a region to try to take it over. By joining the World Assembly, you can endorse a nation. The nation with the most endorsements in a region is the delegate. The delegate has the power to kick nations from a region. However the number of endorsements a nation has are only calculated twice a day, during the major and minor update which lasts about 1 hr.[/spoiler]
