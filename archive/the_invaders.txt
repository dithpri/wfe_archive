[spoiler=What is Raiding?] Raiding is when a group people [RAIDERS] join the World Assembly, endorse a particular nation [POINT], and then move into another region [TARGET].  The goal is to for the POINT to have more WA endorsements that the delegate of the TARGET, when the RAIDERS move into the TARGET. If at an UPDATE the POINT has more endorsements than the native delegate, the RAIDERS take over and can wreck the TARGET.[/spoiler]
