I hereby create a region where Libertarian Nations can come together and have an official say in the World Assembly. This region is a non-interventionist region where we only engage in foreign entanglements when attacked. We do not support raiders and will fight against them. We support espionage as a means of defense. We welcome disgruntled raiders to come and help us be a Raider-free Utopia!
