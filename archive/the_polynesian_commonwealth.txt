[b]The Polynesian Commonwealth[/b], also referred to as Poly-Com, is an intergovernmental organization of nations who share a common Polynesian heritage. Each member nation is independent, with their own constitutional government. 

All member nations abide the Commonwealth&amp;#39;s Declaration of Core Principles. These include the promotion of democracy, human rights, good governance, the rule of law, individual liberty, egalitarianism, free trade, multilateralism, and world peace. The Commonwealth is not a political union, but an intergovernmental organization through which countries with diverse social, political, and economic backgrounds are regarded as equal in status.
