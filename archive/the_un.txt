This region is home to a simulation of the countries that are part of the United Nations.

Telegram [nation=short]Freeland Newworldia[/nation] in order to be part of this simulation!

Here are three important rules:

1. In answering issues for a nation, you must look up that nation&#39;s real-life policies and answer or dismiss the issue following those policies. 

2. You should not take any nation which has a name ending in &quot;UN&quot; or &quot;United Nations&quot; out of the region. 

3. If the nation you want to simulate is not in the region yet, telegram [nation=short]Freeland Newworldia[/nation] and they will create it for you.
