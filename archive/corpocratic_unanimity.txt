Welcome to the Corpocratic Unanimity! We are a region united not just geologically, but ideologically, by a single idea which we hope to propagate throughout the world, and make it the great focus of the World Assembly: Corpocracy. We at the Unanimity believe that there is a fundamental need in human beings to exist in a society where the private sector is not just dominant, but supreme, and lead by those who know its workings best. We therefore create here a union between corporate dominated nations who wish to spread this enlightened way of life throughout the globe, whether the globe likes it or not.
