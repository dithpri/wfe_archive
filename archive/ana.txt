This region, aka the Anti Nazi Alliance, was an ally of [region]The Mt Army[/region]. Long after it had ceased to exist, [region]Nationalsozialistische Volksstaaten[/region] dug it up and occupied it. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

In memory of all those who died fighting or fleeing Nazism.
