Emerald Beach is a NationStates getaway hotspot. Retire from your ministerial positions, hang ten and relax on our dark-green, warm, sandy beaches while dining on our world famous lobster tails and crab. Emerald Beach is a great way to get away from your hectic region. Avoid being raided and stay as long as you want. We try to stay private so we can stay safe as possible. Enjoy your stay! Any nation visiting from a noted Raider region will be ejected on sight. This is a safe haven.
