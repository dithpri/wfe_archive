Pereli is a vast, varying landscape, adorned with mountainous regions and plains alike, and scattered throughout reside thriving, prosperous nations, ready to take on the difficulties of today, and the challenges of tomorrow. The area is filled with rare and common resources, each exploited for its value while keeping the environment closely in mind, providing the region with a steadfast and sizeable economy, and friendly, light-hearted trade relations with fellow nations, both within and abroad.
