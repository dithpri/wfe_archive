Texico was founded in 1849 by Luiz and Julio Yayo as a union of rogue countries and states in the newly independent country of Wallaceburg due to a political agreement between the President of New Texaz, the Governer of Yayoville and the Chancellor of Wallaceburg. After finding common views and a common history they signed a treaty while passing a peace pipe where all three countries borders meet also known as The Green Mile. The Green Mile is now the location of the all meetings and assemblies regarding regional matters. The power in Texico is shared equally amongst members of the region.
