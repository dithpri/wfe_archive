The IDS are a regime of mutants lead by the Invem leader Goez that plan on taking over the galaxy. The SDF will crush the mutant&#39;s evil plans and protect its allies from a similar fate.

Our main mode of defense is the Metal Attacker (MA) Mobile Tank Unit. MA are very versatile and incredibly powerful, some have on their own liberated entire star systems from the IDS.
