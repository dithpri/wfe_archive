A massive world currently dominated by The Empire of Tel&amp;#39;Avos, Strife IV boasts an incredible amount of resources, land and plenty. Of course, human nature dictates that even born into every privilege, the ambitious will always want more...

Strife is aptly named; As long as there are two nations on the surface of the planet, someone is going to want someone&amp;#39;s power. It is a perilous game of wars, manipulation, betrayal and scheming. The only ally you&amp;#39;ll have at the end of the day, when dusk falls and hope wanes, is the one you&amp;#39;ve bound by necessity.

[This region might just be my nest. It might have my friends, maybe even one day I&amp;#39;ll open it to invitation. Time tells. Time tells.]
