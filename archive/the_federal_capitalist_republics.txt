Founded by Silas W. Reed, the leader and absolute authority over the UCU (United Capitalist Unions), the Federal Capitalist Republics are a group of independent nations that share a common goal and that is creating a true Laissez-faire economy that ultimately benefits the people that live within their nations. While some regulation is needed it is heavily encouraged to let the economy run itself and have the government strictly focus on allocating funding to departments and the sort.
