The Order of the Eastern West is all that remains of the old Order which was taken over in a political feud, today the Orders inhabitants still remain optimistic and always look forward to a day when the golden times could be relived once again.Today the members embark on perilous journeys to nations across the seas in order to meet its new neighbours and bring gifts to there inhabitants.
So the people of the Order have become great travellers visiting regions far and wide, offering peace and friendship, and they pledged to continue exploring the far lands.
