The Adeptus Terra, also known as the Clergy of Earth, is the central organization of the Imperium, and most of the other official departments of the imperial government are just its divisions. Only the Ecclesiarchies, the Adeptus Mechanicus and the Inquisition are not part of the Adeptus Terra, and the Space Marine is indirectly connected with this organization.
