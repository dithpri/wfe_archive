Welcome to [b]The Catholic Church[/b]
Ordained, 18th January, Anno Domini Nostri Iesu Christi 2015.

[i]TCC hopes to be the new seat of the Catholic religion in the NS world, and is a separate organization to the VRCC, but nevertheless would like to maintain cordial relations with the latter organization. TCC seeks to evangelize the people and nations of the world by spreading the good news of the Lord Jesus Christ, and foster cordial relations with those not in communion with the Faith.[/i]
