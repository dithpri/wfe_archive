The Collective Regional Association (aka CRA) is a community of nation-states dedicated to mutual economic and social prosperity achieved through political cooperation.  We have a capitalist economic system, although some nations are more so than others.  
The CRA is very new and is growing fast, so if you want to make a difference in your region&amp;#39;s politics, the CRA is an excellent choice.  Almost all embassy requests will be accepted&amp;#39;. Unlike in huge regions, your nation&amp;#39;s voice will actually be heard.  For a casual, fun Nation States experience, choose the CRA!
