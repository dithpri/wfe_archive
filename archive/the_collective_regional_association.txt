The Collective Regional Association (aka CRA) is a community of nation-states dedicated to mutual economic and social prosperity achieved through political cooperation.  We have a casual and friendly environment and a capitalist economic system.  The CRA is very new and is growing fast, so if you want to make a difference in your region&amp;#39;s politics, the CRA is an excellent choice.
