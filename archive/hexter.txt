Hexter is one of several countries in the continent of Bersia. Many orc- ogre tribes reside in Hexter, including the mighty Darokha Tribe, the strongest of all the orc- ogre tribes. Hexter used to be a barren desert wasteland many centuries ago, when orcs and ogres first colonised it. However, environmental changes have led to many areas of Hexter becoming rich, plentiful land. With this has come the rapid growth of many tribes in Hexter. So far the country has been going from strength to strength.
