Simply being in the region counts as a possible addition to the setting. Team worldbuilding is fun.
Share factbooks, polls, and have RMB chat. Like cards? Link to trades &amp; stuff.
Ask good questions and you can be promoted to set polls too.
Embassy requests will be accepted if our regions are similar enough.

The rule is to be nice. Go at your own pace, no pressure.
