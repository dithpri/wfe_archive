ic: Welcome! Aria Extended is half of the world. Our Earth is twice your planet&#39;s size, and the nations you know [i]do[/i] exist, just on the other half. ... Regional government? Vortex basically controls everything, doesn&#39;t it?

ooc:
- Mainly factbook sharing, with some RP.
- Discussions are normal, but take debates to NSG.
- Embassy requests will be accepted if our regions are similar enough.
The rule is to be nice. Have fun!
