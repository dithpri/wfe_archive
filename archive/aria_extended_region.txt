Welcome to half of the world! Our Earth is twice your planet&#39;s size, and the nations you know [i]do[/i] exist, just on the other half. We have nations with different kinds of economic systems, governments, etc.

Technology advances fast and year old machines are outshined by recent developments.

- Mainly factbook sharing and some RP. Go at your own pace, no pressure.

- Embassy requests will be accepted if our regions are similar enough.

The rule is to be nice. Have fun!
