The OLCT was founded by Carto-Geography in Rome, after Italy tried to remove the sovereignty of Vatican City. Gradually it spread over Italy, turning liberated lands into Theocracies that brought Europe back to its spiritual roots. Lately the OLCT has finished annexing the Mediterranean Basin and is looking forward to the conquest of Saudi Arabia.
