After the unlikely victory for the confederates in 1879 after a long and bloody civil war, America splits in two; in the north, The Glorious Union of America, led by a withering Abe Lincoln; a Liberal democracy embracing &amp;#39;Murican values, and in the South, The Confederacy of the glorious deep south, led by Robert E Lee himself (who was risen from the dead after the victory and rules as a zombie).This nation is a crazy conservative slave state, with few civil rights. Tension is constant between the two countries.
