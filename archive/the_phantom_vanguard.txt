[b][color=purple]Keep your friends close...[/color][hr]And your enemies closer. 

This region was once a den of so-called &quot;defenders&quot; who had made a name for themselves by attempting to protect fascist regions from well-deserved fash-bashes. Unfortunately for them, their governor failed to learn the most important defense lesson of them all; if you turn your back on an assassin, they might sink a blade into it...
Let the ashes of this region stand as a lesson to fascists and their allies: There is no safe haven from the Brotherhood. There is no respite to be found from our daggers. There is only Malice.

This region will cease to operate as a defender organization indefinitely, and is now a trophy of [nation]Volstrostia[/nation] and therefore [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region]. Praise the Overseer!
