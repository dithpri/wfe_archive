[quote=ile_de_la_loutre;27869627] The island of Ile de la Loutre is quiet, as there is nothing alive to keep it&#39;s sound alive. All of its citizens, its culture, its outer beauty, are all gone. The only thing left on this island is the civilization that once stood, and the history of the people who stand no more.

Ile de la Loutre has no more citizens as they were all killed off by the evil hands of Brundium.[/quote]
