The Iberincelistan region encompasses the western edge of the European continent, spanning parts of the Iberian Peninsula and extending into small offshore islands and peninsulas in the surrounding seas. Known for its rugged coastlines, patchwork historical identities, and a cultural tendency toward philosophical skepticism, Iberincelistan has long been a crossroads between maritime trade routes and continental migration paths.
