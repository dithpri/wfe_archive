&quot;We pray for hope, embrace curses and protect you from the dark. We&#39;re magical girls. We traded our souls for our powers in a destiny of battle. A destiny that ends in oblivion. For the only way to escape our despair is to vanish from this world. The end will come for all of us. So we continue our fight and wait for the law of cycles to come and lead us away. In this broken world; doomed to repeat it&#39;s tragedies and hatred, I dreamed of someone I knew and saw her familiar smile again.&quot;
