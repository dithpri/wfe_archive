Astrion is a new region founded for those who want to stake a claim on land for their country and have an interconnected community. In these early stages, the region will be welcoming to many nations who wish to join us. We do not mind joke nations, so long as they work fairly well with us. As things get going, we will set up a governing structure with some kind of Global Astrionian Council with multiple positions for the different facets of life.
