The United Nations of Earth is an open and friendly region. We welcome nations of every kind as long as they agree to respect and follow the ideals of the region. First, we do not discriminate nations because their government type or their attitude. Second, we help and assist each other in times of trouble no matter the issues going on. Finally, we stand together against any who would force us to join or change the way we run things.
