Palm Island is a peaceful island in the East Pacific. It is surrounded with endless turtles who use Palm Island as a resting place. It is extremely safe and tranquil as any antisocial behaviour isn&#39;t tolerated. States are welcome to join and develop Palm Island but islands are also wanted to surround the coast.
