Here is the grand hall of all like-minded nations that are Pavonistadian protectorates, adhere to Pavonistadian ideals, or are in any way affiliated with the grand Pavonistadian States. From the whacky lands of the two Noob Colonies to the inverse Edatsinovap and Noncanon Pavonistade to the anti-poll rigging combines of the Chromsters, this region is a wonder of all affiliates united under a common and modern... everything Pavonistadian!

All Pavonistadian affiliates are proud members of the [b]United States of Pavonistade[/b], 9001 times better than the United States of America.
