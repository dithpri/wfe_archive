[color=purple][u][b]Welcome to the Global Union of Terra[/b][/u][/color]

The Global Union of Terra expounds policies grounded in the progressive ideals of Radical Eco-Technocracy, with a forward-looking attitude of tolerance and peaceful coexistence between all peoples of good will. Similarly, the Global Union is fiercely protective of both the sovereignty of its constituent member states and the inherent equality between nations.

While it is currently in its initial stages of planning and expansion, and much organization is still yet to be completed, the Global Union offers many opportunities for ambitious, well-to-do nation-states intrepid enough to take part.
