We are the Boopists. After centuries of hiding, we have come out into the light. We are run by King Ricky and Queen Holyleaf, our glorious and fair rulers. There are a three conditions to join. 

1. You must like vegetables (health is important to us).
2. You must treat animals well (animal hating is a sign of insanity).
3. You must be able to take a joke (humorless people are annoying).

We meet our allies with open arms and our enemies with arms full of weapons. Have a lovely day, to all.
