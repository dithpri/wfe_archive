  At first glance, the name suggests a union of nations, joined for a common security, increased political power,and promotion of trade between states. The reality is far different. Across this land of arid, dusty steppes, rugged red-rock plateaus and grim, grey, thickly-forested mountains, the sound of conflict rings out as factions clash for control. The few states that exist work to impose thier control over constantly shifting borders, struggling against warlords, drug-cartels and each other for dominance in the dry, unforgiving desert. Peace is an impossible ideal, unity a farce, and trade a myth.
