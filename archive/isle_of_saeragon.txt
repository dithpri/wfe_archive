The Isle of Saeragon is located slightly northeast of the Faroe Islands and is rarely visited by outsiders. Saeragon is the only place where real dragons exist, but the outside world doesn&amp;#39;t know about that due to the fact the outsiders rarely even make it to the Isle. Despite this many Saeragonians have traveled to the outside world.
