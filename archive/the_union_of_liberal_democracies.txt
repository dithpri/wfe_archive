The Union of Liberal Democracies (ULD) is committed to promoting liberalism and democracy the world over. We believe that human rights are inherent, that government&#39;s only duty is to protect them, and that only rule by the people is legitimate. Member-states will be given representation in an elected Union Congress (UC) and a Union Senate (US), and select their World Assembly Delegate. The UC will have Legislative Authority. Proxy-Executive Authority will be vested in the US. The US will also appoint a Union Judiciary (UJ). Member-states participation is conditional on following just UC Laws and upholding liberal democracy.
