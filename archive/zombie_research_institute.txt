[color=red]Welcome to the [b]Zombie Research Institute[/b][/color]!
[sub]&amp;#9763; Based in Svalbard for Quarantine purposes. &amp;#9763;[/sub][hr][color=green]Whilst the World continually suffers through zombie apocalypses; [i]strangely[/i] coinciding with the holy day of 
All Hallows Eve, this region exists as an island of tranquility; 
a barricaded fortress of research into the [/color][color=darkgreen][b]dark[/b][/color][color=green] and [i]eldritch[/i] Sciences in those [/color][color=grey][i]&quot;grey areas&quot;[/i][/color][color=green] beyond the limits of reason, 
logic, and ethics - Pushing the boundaries of  knowledge and wisdom to breaking point, into the unknown, and insane... 

[sub][i]*Slightly unhinged laughter*[/i][/sub]

Feel free to visit, conduct &quot;research&quot;, mutate into an unholy life form, dine on raw brains, get kicked into an alternate dimension, become our next meal, and have a good time!
