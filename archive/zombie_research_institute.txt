Welcome to the [color=red][b]Zombie Research Institute[/b][/color]!
- based in Svalbard for Quarantine purposes.

Whilst the [color=green]World[/color] suffers annually through a Zombie Apocalypse; [i]strangely[/i] always coinciding with the Holy Day of All Hallows Eve, this region exists as an island of tranquillity - A barricaded fortress of Research into the [i]dark[/i] &amp; [i]eldritch[/i] Sciences in those [color=grey][i]&quot;grey areas&quot;[/i][/color] bordering Science and pseudo-Science; the accepted and unacceptable; the ethical and unethical - Pushing the boundaries of knowledge and wisdom to breaking point into the unknown and insane...

Feel free to hang out, conduct &quot;research&quot;, mutate into an unholy life form, dine on raw brains, get kicked into an alternate dimension, become our next meal, and have a good time all around!
