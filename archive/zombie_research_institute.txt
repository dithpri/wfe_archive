&amp;#9763;[color=red]Welcome to the [b]Zombie Research Institute[/b][/color]!&amp;#9763;
[sub]- based in Svalbard for Quarantine purposes.[/sub][hr][color=green]Whilst the World suffers annually through a Zombie Apocalypse; [i]strangely[/i] coinciding with the Holy Day of All Hallows Eve, this region exists as an island of tranquility - A barricaded fortress of research into the [/color][color=darkgreen][b]dark[/b][/color][color=green] and [i]eldritch[/i] Sciences in those [/color][color=grey][i]&quot;grey areas&quot;[/i][/color][color=green] beyond the limits of reason, logic, and ethics - Pushing the boundaries of knowledge and wisdom to breaking point into the unknown, and insane...

Feel free to hang out, conduct &quot;research&quot;, mutate into an unholy life form, dine on raw brains, get kicked into an alternate dimension, become our next meal, and have a good time!
