[nation]Kanta Hame[/nation] is a gargantuan, efficient nation, ruled by General Kotonen with an even hand, and renowned for its museums and concert halls, keen interest in outer space, and punitive income tax rates. The hard-working population of 19.351 billion Kanta Hameans have some civil rights, but not too many, enjoy the freedom to spend their money however they like, to a point, and take part in free and open elections, although not too often.
