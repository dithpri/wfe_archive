This is a democratic region dedicated to advancing the Kingdom of Christ in the NS world and the one we live in.  In order to be a pure democratic region I, as the founder, have disabled my permanent access to Region Control and have allowed the WA Delegate, whoever it may be, to run the region.  I believe this to be as democratic as it gets and I know in the future it will allow the people to choose their leader and not give me the ability to say otherwise.  I wish all of you luck in this region and I hope God will show you mercy when you finally meet him face to face.
