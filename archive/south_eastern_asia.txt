Adorned with tropical rainforests, deciduous trees, and hot and humid weather. this region is a melting pot of cultures. Be it l&amp;#39;Inde, the land of a million colours - or even l&amp;#39;Asir&ouml; (Asirland), the land of a thousand tons of fun!

Whatever it be, enjoy your time in this region, full of free nations which develop rapidly, and maybe even one of the least troubled nations in the world! We do NOT want to conquer the world, so it is just us and our solitude you want to join, contact the administration of l&amp;#39;Asir&ouml; immediately.
