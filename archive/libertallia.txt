I mean, like what exactly do I put here? This region has lots of beer and vodka production, so that&#39;s cool if ur into that. My country makes good cheese. We have an even split of centrist democracies and psychotic dictatorships so you can always count on something going down at one point or another until we all inevitably get bored of nation-states as a whole and we all slowly leave it so in a few months this region will be nothing but a husk of its former self, utterly void of all attention. An endless mass of words and data being held on an internet forum until the end of time. I make good cheese.
