Welcome to the Middle East, birthplace of all the monotheistic faiths and of historically famous civilizations.

The Middle East is part of a broader inter-regional role playing community which has been active since 2002 when the Middle East was founded. Our community is primarily based on our off-site forum which you can access by clicking [url=http://s3.zetaboards.com/nationstates/index]here[/url]. There you will find not only forums dedicated to the Middle East but also the rest of our broader community which includes nations of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
