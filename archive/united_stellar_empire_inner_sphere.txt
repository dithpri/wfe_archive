The U.S.E. was founded in 2263 with the First Expansion Endeavor which resulted in the first successful colonizations of extra-solar planets. In just under two hundred years, the empire expanded to include at least 170 other celestial bodies, but growing unrest between the more developed inner sphere and the developing outer colonies pushes the U.S.E. to the brink of war.
