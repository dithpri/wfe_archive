[color=blue]Description[/color]:We are socialist, anarchist, and democratic nations. We give the people freedom, rights, and welfare. We are greatly against dictatorships and do not allow them here. We will do whatever it takes to keep our citizens happy and safe.

We welcome nations that aren&amp;#39;t spies or invaders with open arms!

[color=red]Warning[/color]: Any nation that is a dictatorship will be ejected and possibly banned. DO NOT come here if you are a dictatorship!
