[color=Army][u][i][b]The enemy is not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him. The devil is not so terrible as he is painted. Who can deny that our Red Army has more than once put the vaunted enemy troops to panic flight? If one judges, not by the boastful assertions of the enemy propagandists, but by the actual position of the enemy, it will not be difficult to understand that the enemy invaders are facing disaster. 

For the complete destruction of the invaders!

FOR THE RED ORDER!

Death to the  invaders!

Long live our glorious Motherland, her liberty and her independence!


Under the banner of Lenin, forward to victory![/b][/i][/u][/color]
