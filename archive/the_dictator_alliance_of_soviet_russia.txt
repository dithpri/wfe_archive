[color=red]The Arkturians are not so strong as some frightened little intellectuals picture him. The devil([nation]GDE[/nation]) is not so terrible as he is painted. Who can deny that our Red Army has more than once put the vaunted Arkturian troops to panic flight? If one judges, not by the boastful assertions of the Arkturian propagandists, but by the actual position of the Arkturians, it will not be difficult to understand that the Arkturian invaders are facing disaster.

Under the banner of Lenin, forward to victory![/b][/i][/u][/color]
