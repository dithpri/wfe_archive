Les &Icirc;les de Ceura are a series of beautiful islands. In the center of the mainland island, frigid rugged peaks scrape the dome of the sky. Within the mountains, one finds themselves surrounded by an abundancy of  thick forests, blanketing the mountains under soft green plantlife. Bordering these fierce highlands, lies a long grassland, where wheat and grain are harvested among the golden reeds. To the north, a large bay stretches out, where mermaids frolic. The island is bordered by beautiful beaches, notable for the white sands that carpet the earth. We welcome you to Les &Icirc;les de Ceura, and hope you find this region a happy and welcoming place to stay!
