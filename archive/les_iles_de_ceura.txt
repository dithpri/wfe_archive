Les Illes de Ceura are a series of beautiful islands, flourishing with an abundancy of geographical features. In the center of the mainland island, frigid rugged peaks scrape the dome of the sky. Within the mountains, one finds themselves surrounded by an abundancy of vegetation. Thick forests grow and prosper, leaving the rocky mountains blanketed under soft green plantlife. Past the center of the island, bordering these fierce highlands, lies a long grassland, where wheat and grain are harvested among the golden reeds. To the north, a large bay stretches out, where mermaids frolic. The island is bordered by beautiful beaches, notable for the white sands that carpet the earth.
