Sleep heavily and know that I am here with you now. The past is gone and cannot harm you anymore, and while the future is fast coming for you, it always flinches first and settles in as the gentle present. This is now, this is us. It will all be over soon, and then, something else will take it&amp;#39;s place. Like waves, says the common metaphor.  From dust to dust says a simplified version of a complicated philosophy. mmmzzzzzzmmm says the big bang, still echoing quietly through everything it created.
