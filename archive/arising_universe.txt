[u][B]Welcome to the AU![/B][/u]

Arising Universe is a role playing region based off of a NS forum role play of the same name. In hopes of resurrecting the role play this region has been established and all are welcome.  Using the extension NS++ is highly recommended, both to improve your own personal NS experience as well as to view the regional activity easier.

The role play is not [i]yet[/i] active and is currently a [u]WIP[/u]. An off-site forum will soon be set up to meet and discuss all matters pertaining to the region.

We have an IRC channel! If you don&#39;t have NS++ you can connect using [i][url=https://esper.net/publicirc.php]esper.net[/url][/i] and going to the channel [i]ArisingUniverse[/i]
