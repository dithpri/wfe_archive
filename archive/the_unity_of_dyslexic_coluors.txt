Once a united nation, the members of the unity split up over how the nation was spelt. Wight decided that it was spelt Rerhnberh, Grehn accepts Roinbarh, and Blach only knew five letters.
The splitting of the regions was an inconvenience for the member states, hence the reason the unity was formed. There have been attempts at uniting the nations, except someone has to bring up the effing spelling of the united state.
The inhabitants of the nations see nothing out of order with the governing bodies immaturity, as generation after generation have seen laws passed because they are too damn funny.
