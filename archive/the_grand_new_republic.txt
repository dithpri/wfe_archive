&#147;This place is a message... and part of a system of messages... pay attention to it!
Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.
This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here.&#148;

You can save yourself. Do not let yourselves devolve into hatred and bigotry, like the poor souls of this formerly great region have. I used to love this place, but now I only look here with shame. I have come here to finish the job, once and for all.
