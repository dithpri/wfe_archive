The [region]Commonwealth of Free Nations[/region] has taken over this region, and has claimed it as our own. This region was founded by [region]The Silence[/region], who, though claiming to be the first true and greatest colonial empire of NationStates, had to create their own &amp;quot;warzone&amp;quot; to compensate for their loss of [region]warzone Australia[/region], which was also captured by the CFN. By pestering the troops of the CFN Military through private TGs and annoying RMB posts, the Silence has made an enemy out of the CFN, and we will not let them forget it. Let this piece of CFN territory in the Silence&amp;#39;s back yard remind them that they are never safe from the might of the CFN and our allies.
