After a debate the new regional Language will be french, We made this decision after realizing that multiple countries here in the great [region]Outer Summer Circle[/region] speak French.

We will be courteous for people here who speak different languages than we do. Of course, English will be our second national language 


Hope everyone has a amazing day! Passe une bonne nuit/journ&eacute;e

From,
The Admin [region]Outer Summer Circle[/region]
