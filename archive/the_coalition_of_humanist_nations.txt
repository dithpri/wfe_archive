The CHN was founded by [nation]The Allied Human Territories[/nation] in the aftermath of the great schism, a cataclysmic civil war that established the supremacy of the humanist ideology but shattered the old Alliance. To maintain peace and order, the new Alliance established a protected region of systems in which humanist nations could find safe haven. The Alliance&#151;and more recently, Great Cadelandia&#151;are the primary military and economic powers of the coalition, and act to protect this region from the greed of more authoritarian nations. So here we stand, 567 free systems where all people can come together to live in peace.
