Welcome to the wonderful Haus of Tippit, where dishes are never done and screaming must be practiced daily (if you want, that is).

Are you tired of oppressively being told that you don&amp;#39;t have to do anything?
Are you afraid that the government is watching another government watch you watch television?
Are you opinionated in such a way that there is no satisfying your demands no matter how drastic the motions may be?

Then this probably might not be but at the same time is the place for you.

Join hands, hooks, and artillery lines in song, as we sing the glorious tunes of our grand Haus and feast in forceful merriment upon the flesh of animals (or plants, if you don&amp;#39;t like killing mammals).
