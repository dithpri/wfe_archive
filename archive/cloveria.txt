I found a four leaf clover
and was happy with my find,
but with time to think it over,
I&#39;ve entirely changed my mind.
I concealed it in my pocket,
safe inside a paper pad,
soon, much swifter than a rocket,
my good fortune turned to bad.

I broke my brand-new glasses,
and I couldn&#39;t find my keys,
when the kitten ripped the curtain,
and the toast burst into flame,
I was absolutely certain
that the clover was to blame.

I buried it discreetly
in the middle of a field,
now my luck has changed completely,
and my wounds have almost healed.
If I ever find another,
I will simply let it be,
or I&#39;ll give it to my brother,
he deserves it more than me.
