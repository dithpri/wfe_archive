The Allied Nations of LC is based on the belief of a one man ruling, with open-mindedness towards it&amp;#39;s residents excluding anyone who decides they don&amp;#39;t like that idea. My main purpose is to eject &amp;amp; ban Quinton from this group unless he provides useful, and with his falling regional influence he is being both useful and technically not useful. I guess you&amp;#39;ll have to appeal to me if you want to stay in the group or by the time I have enough RI to eject you I will, but not with a ban. If you don&amp;#39;t know who to appeal to, then you shouldn&amp;#39;t even be in the region. That&amp;#39;s about it for now.
