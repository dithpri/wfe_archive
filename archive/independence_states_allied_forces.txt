A band of nations that even though they don&#39;t have many things in common, have agreed to cooperate with each other. This group is firstly a military alliance to assist with protecting each of our members from threats both internal and external. From this birthed friendships that shaped the I.S.A.F. bringing the nations closer in a way that can be only called a family. Joining the I.S.A.F. is more than looking for protection now, you are giving a promise to loyally stand by brothers and sisters. In war, natural disasters, economic problems, and public disorder, it is the duty of our members to be there till the end disregarding how hopeless or dire the situation is.
