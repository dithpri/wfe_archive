[color=red][b]&#147;Demons run when a good man goes to war
Night will fall and drown the sun
When a good man goes to war

Friendship dies and true love lies
Night will fall and the dark will rise
When a good man goes to war

Demons run, but count the cost
The battle&#39;s won, but the child is lost&#148;[/b][/color]
