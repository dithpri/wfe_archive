The New Solar Empire is a forested land rich in resources originally settled by the Empire of Halvith, then everything changed when the Solar City attacked. The Solar City&amp;#39;s armies marched in, and annexed Halvith into the newly created New Solar Empire in order to exploit the region&amp;#39;s abundant natural resources. Since then, The Solar City has kept a loose reign over Halvith, allowing them to govern themselves as they please. Sweedenland has recently established itself as a major service provider within the New Solar Empire. Off the coast of the New Solar Empires lies the small banana republic, Terra Da Vida.
