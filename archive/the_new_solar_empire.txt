The New Solar Empire is a forested land rich in resources originally settled by the Empire of Halvith, but the swift rise of the Solar City and Sweedenland as major powers soon shifted the balance. As an attempt at maintaining regional peace, the New Solar Empire was founded to ally the three nations. Since, the region has grown to include several other nations in the area. Off the coast of the New Solar Empire used to lie the small banana republic, Terra Da Vida, before its destruction in the Great Fruit Bat War of 2079.
