The Great Isotpian Sea is located in the north-central portion of the country, forming part of the border with Eastern Isotopia. The southeast Isotopia, generally stretching from the Wabash River on the south, includes a variety of warm temperate and subtropical moist and wet forests, as well as warm temperate and subtropical dry forests nearer the Great Plains in the west of the region. The Midwest also has a vast amount of cave systems.
The Great Plains lie west of the Frontworth River and east of the Dirty Mountains. A large portion of the country&#39;s agricultural products is grown in the Great Plains.
