The Sense of Right Alliance was once a region of plenty until it was raided. Those who remember don&#39;t want to. Those who don&#39;t remember are too frightened to ask. But, from the godforsaken region, new hope arose and turned the tide of war. The raiders fled in fear to return.



The Sense of Right Alliance will endure forever.






PS: The raiders just left because they were on a training raid.

HELLO. WE BELIEVE SASQUATCH AIN&#39;T REAL... BUT FLYING POTATOES ARE THE REAL THREAT. THEY KILLED EVERYONE, and one day... they will return...
