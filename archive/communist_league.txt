[b][color=darkorange]This region was once occupied by [region]The New British Empire[/region] from communist forces. But luckily, it now serves as a protectorate for [region]NBE[/region]

[/color] [color=scarlet]With the collapse of the old empire, the new [region]NBE[/region] has colonized and seized the region[/color] [color=black]before the old empire could allow the [region]UCR[/region] and [region]The Cooperative Union[/region] to restore communist control to this region.[/color]

[color=blue]We will never stop until Communism is eradicated from NationStates. Long live [region]NBE[/region][/color]![/b]
