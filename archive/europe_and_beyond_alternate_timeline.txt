World history is unchanged until somewhere in the first half of 2020. From that point on, this region/ alternate timeline unfolds through the social, economic, and political initiatives of every member-state. The first alternate event is the reunification of Romania and the Republic of Moldova.
 
I am looking for players that are passionate about Geopolitics so that we may discuss and establish how such a scenario would play out. While this timeline is set in motion by events in Eastern Europe, the goal of this Region/Timeline is to study what other major events could alter the course of contemporary history; this means that anyone who would like to take on the role of any real country is welcome to do so.
