[b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]The Eastern Pacific Armada[/url] and the [region]Augustin Alliance[/region] recently declared each other to be very very good friends.

In this seond edition of the day of good good friends, we decided to go on a sightseeing trip together, and we set sail into the sunrise.

Along the way, we heard a distress signal from your region, and thus decided to stop here to explore!

After rescuing some stray cats emitting the distress signal, we left behind some fruits and this WFE to help you stay safe!
