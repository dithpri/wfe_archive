The avata Mounts; far from any place you can imagine is where the North Avata Mounts are located, named after a great warrior from the South, Kobi The Avata. the legend tells that his son, Yona Avata The Gambash, was kidnapped by a terrible monster from the mounts. So he killed it. 
This is a stunning place with a long history and with a lot with stunning antiquities.
After Kobi Avata&#39;s pioneer movement, by the early 20th, the area was settled by idealistic pioneers and war and poverty survivors.
Today, the Avata countries are progressive and strong countries.
The civils of the Avata, just as the weather is, are pretty cold but dry.
