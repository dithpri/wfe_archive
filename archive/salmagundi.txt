A group of people / nations made up of the anthropomorphic Ferret state, mixed taur like Newfoundland Dog - Horse states, and the Giant Hog-Nosed Skunk individuals. The Ferret / Taur states are currently tied together through a complete economic integration plan as well as several smaller military alliances that keep the states bound together under a confederation referred to as a Coadunate, called a WolFer Coadunate by the Ferret state. Together they form an even weaker union with the more anarchist Skunks to collectively make up the Salmagundi that refers to all three different species of the supranational state.
