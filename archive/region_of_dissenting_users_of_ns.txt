Lesbian, Gay, Trans and Bisexual lives matter &amp;lt;3

Everyone is valid, regardless of their identity. You are beautiful and worth it, as cheesy as it might sound. In a world where it&#39;s easy to hate &#39;the other&#39; because they&#39;re different, you deserve to know that someone out there thinks you&#39;re valid and beautiful. Negativity can indeed be overwhelming and drown out positivity but goodness is honest. Negativity is bitter. You&#39;re loved. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you not to embrace what you are. Bigotry is a lost and dying cause. Love is as old as time.

Thank you to a lovely person for this lovely flag too, wish I had space for two flags but oh well &amp;lt;3
