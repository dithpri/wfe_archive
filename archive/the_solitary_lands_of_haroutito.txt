The region consists of territories that surround Haroutito. Much of it is used as a buffer between Haroutito and the outside world, consisting of advanced defense systems developed by our brightest scientists including a force field that surrounds the entire nation and advanced missile interceptors and drones that patrol the perimeter. Those that attempt to enter without permission will be greeted genially with a surface-to-air missile.
