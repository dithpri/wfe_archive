[B]A MUST READ IF YOU ARE A CoG MEMBER[/B]

[B][u][i]To all of the members of the CoG[/i][/u][/B]

This was the only way that I could think of that I could adequately establish a line of communication.

I want to tell all of you that I am sorry for all of the harm that I have done to you all, and that the banjection was justified. Khalite&amp;#39;s calling me all those things were completely justified and were deserved 100%. I do not deserve your acceptance or understanding, but it is greatly appreciated. You guys are amazing, particularly the admins, who keep the order that I have come to love the CoG for.

I am stupid, dumb, arrogant, egotistical, narcissistic, too defensive, and I am over all a huge &amp;quot;Donkey&amp;quot;...

[u][i]I hope that you all will accept my apology[/i][/u]

Most sincerely,
Ves
