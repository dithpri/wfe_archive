The Thunder Territory is in the Mountain Peaks and is also in the Great Rift Valley. A small, but connected group, they have thrived over the years. It was founded by our leader, the Supreme Leader of Magicarnia.

From there, our region grew in size. Officers were established, and we flourish to this day. We support a variety of different governments, of all flavors and kinds. We also support controlled chaos and will engage in emergency operations as needed. As need we have established embassies with many different countries and we are quite friendly. 

Our Region is also Invasion Proof, and have been known to go on invasion expeditions.
