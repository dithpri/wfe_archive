The Thunder Territory is in the Mountain Peaks and is also in the Great Rift Valley. A small, but connected group, they have thrived over the years. It was founded by our beloved leader, the Supreme Leader of Magicarnia. From there, our region grew in size. Offices were established, and we flourish to this day.

We support a variety of different governments, of all flavors and kinds. We also support controlled chaos and will engage in emergency operations as needed.
Our Region is also well known to be Invasion Proof, and have been known to go on invasion expeditions.
