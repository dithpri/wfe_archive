[color=brown][region]The Thunder Territory[/region] is in the Mountain Peaks and is also in the Great Rift Valley. We support a variety of different governments, of all flavors and kinds. We also support controlled chaos and will engage in emergency operations as needed since we have established embassies with different regions and we are quite friendly. Our Region is also Invasion Proof. We are always open to new ideas and suggestions when needed.[/color]
