[b]We live and die by the flags we fly[/b]

Welcome to the League of Extraoridnary Gentlestates.
Here in the L.E.G. we do not require our member states to adopt any particular form of government or way of life, we only ask that you represent yourself in a manner that complies with the five hallowed tenets of flag design:

[b] THE FIVE TENETS OF FLAG DESIGN[/b]
1: Simple design
2: Use meaningful symbolism
3: Use two to three basic colours
4: No lettering or seals
5: Be distinctive, or be related

One can, in exceptional circumstances, bypass these tenets by passing the &quot;Maryland Point&quot; (Contact Grand Auditor for details)

We hope that you have a pleasant time in our fabulously flaggy corner of the world!
