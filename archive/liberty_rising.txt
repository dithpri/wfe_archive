Quote of the day ~ &#39;In 1944, 19 year old men stormed the beaches of Normandy, ready to take a bullet and risking death in the name of freedom. In 2018, 19 year old men need &#39;safe spaces&#39; and &#39;trigger warnings&#39; so their feelings don&#39;t get hurt.&#39; 

Political correctness is F A S C I S M!

Regional motto for now: In Deo Speramus!
