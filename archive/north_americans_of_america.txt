The North Americans of America is a region based on the diversity of citizens and welcomes all countries to join its ranks. As a country in this region you are expected to follow rules and be an active member but oh well if you don&#39;t, anyway why should you join us because we are going to be active once i get this up and you got an active leader somehow.
