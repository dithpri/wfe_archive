Welcome to the nation of happy and friendly, we pride the happiness of our people and their seeming freedom. People here hail the unicorn as a religious symbol and see the bitcoin as the region wide currency. We fight to defend our rights as happy nation leaders in the current WA world, voting against anything that restricts crazy dictatorships or anything of the likes. We will ensure none of our members are condemned against their will. We hold often elections to select new delegates and we are happy to accept new players and old players. Anybody is accepted and to defend your rights against the new WA powers.
