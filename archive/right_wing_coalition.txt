This is a Stand against the WA Elite. We fight for freedom. We fight for our freedom to choose our policies. We fight to protect our Allies.

Puppets of regions are welcome as ambassadors, as long as the region leader TGs me beforehand, otherwise, they will be ejected, but not banned.

If you are an Embassy of the RWC, then you are considered an ally of our movement and will receive messages through your RMB.
