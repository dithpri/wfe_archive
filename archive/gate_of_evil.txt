[b]Through the Gate lay untold horrors... 
yet still we survive.[/b]

[b][color=red][i]Betrayed by one we trusted most
Flung down from heights of glory
Cast aside and scattered to the winds
From divine light to utter darkness
By common bonds we clung together
Through the night we sheltered
Battling the nightmare shadows
Still our fight continues 
Locked forever behind the Gate of Evil[/i][/color][/b]
