We are still looking for more people to move to the new [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=gatesville_inc]Gatesville[/url] region. If you want to stay here, that is fine, 
but at least sign up on the new forum, the s13 forum, below so you can be aware of what is going on and if
there is anything new going to happen involving [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=gatesville_inc]Gatesville[/url].
