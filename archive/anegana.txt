Anegana is a beautiful region, home to few. We are a welcoming people everyone is accepted with open arms. Anegana was formed as a result of a fracturing region, one that sent dozens away, until they found new homes, this is one such home, a home for all! Anegana is protected by the space fleets of Lycantine, the military leadership of (new general), the never-ending legions of knights from Coridge, and the power of its citizens.

Anegana stands as a cauldron of ideological views, political systems, and economic policies.
