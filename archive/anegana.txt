Anegana is a beautiful region, home to few. We are a welcoming people and everyone is accepted with open arms!

Anegana was formed as a result of a fracturing region, one that sent dozens away until they found new homes, this is one such home, a home for all! 

Anegana is protected by the space fleets of [nation]Lycantine[/nation], 
the military leadership of [nation]Apolliyon[/nation],
the never-ending legions of knights from [nation]Coridge[/nation],
and the power of its citizens.

Anegana stands as a cauldron of ideological views, political systems, and economic policies.
