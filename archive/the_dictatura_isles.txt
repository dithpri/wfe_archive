[b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b]

This region was given to us by the foolish [nation]Captain Woodhouse[/nation] in a pathetic attempt to infiltrate the [region]Antifa[/region] network. It seems all he ended up achieving was becoming a better anti-fascist fighter than he is fighting for his own side, so thanks for the 50+ regions you gave to us in your &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; unaf project.
