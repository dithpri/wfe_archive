[b][color=purple]After all these years, it&#39;s finally restored.[/color][/b]
[i][color=blue]The League of the Black Droplet was one of the largest oil-themed regions during 2021 and 2022. However, with a conflict with a raider group known as The Lightning Army, the League of the Black Droplet sadly fell. Today, it has been finally restored, as the third refounding has occurred (with the lightning army refounding the region originally). We have been liberated, at last.[/i][/color]
