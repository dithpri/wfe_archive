Thank you for considering The Proud Land as your region! Here, kindness and bravery are rewarding and the prudent nations come first. Cowardice is considered illegal here, any retreat from battle will be punished severely.

You will not be forced to endorse anyone, as it is your power to do so. I don&amp;#39;t think that it&amp;#39;s fair when you are forced to endorse someone. You will not be asked to become a WA member, as it is optional. 

The Proud Land has few nations, and I know that many people will stick there nose up at our small population. Quality is superior to quantity. We want nations who will fight for other nations, back them up, even if there wrong. Your loyalty is not just to your leader, not just to your region, but to the people in it!
