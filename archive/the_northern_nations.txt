[b]Here&#146;s to [region]The Black Hawks[/region], they&#39;re true blue,
they&#39;re madlads through and through,
They&#39;re a legend so they say,
Should have gone to heaven but they went the other way,
Singing down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
down, down, down, down, down, down.
