Welcome to the land of Death and Destruction... We&amp;#39;d like to thank you for helping us add to our current sphere of influence. At the moment, many aspects of our region are still being decided upon, as this is a fairly new organization. Please feel free to suggest any changes you feel might be necessary (or not as necessary, doesn&amp;#39;t matter ;)), or comment on anything noteworthy, through our message board (Unless we don&amp;#39;t have one. I&amp;#39;ll have to check up on that...). If you have any urgent questions or comments, you are welcome to message me directly by way of telegram. We hope you have a wonderful, happy day, filled with death and destruction.
