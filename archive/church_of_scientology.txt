Scientology is a religion that offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one&#146;s true spiritual nature and one&#146;s relationship to self, family, groups, Mankind, all life forms, the material universe, the spiritual universe and the Supreme Being. Scientology addresses the spirit and believes that Man is far more than a product of his environment, or his genes. Scientology comprises a body of knowledge which extends from certain fundamental truths. Prime among these are: 

Man is an immortal spiritual being. 
His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. 
His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.

The ultimate goal of Scientology is true spiritual enlightenment and freedom for all.
