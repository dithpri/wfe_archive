        This region was founded by a nation holding considerable power and influence in Axolotlum and The Second Ridge of Badgers, two of the main regions from Verona Area High. The nation had dreams of a peaceful, conflict-free relation between Axolotlum and The Second Ridge of Badgers. This is a place where war does not apply. Therefore, to avoid any conflict, the WA Delegate will not have any executive powers. Nations that don&#39;t care about nationstates all the time, nations that don&#39;t consider &quot;The group&quot; to be a governmental body, and nations that want to take a break from stupid war crap can come here and chat.
