Taken from the 5th quatrain of the Holy Book of Air Bud;

&quot;Woof.&quot;

We accept all religions except all the ones that aren&#39;t Air Bud-related, refuse any nations that do not adhere to the Chicken Tendies agreement of 1805, and insist that all applicants use ORIGINAL RECIPE ONLY. 

Citizens of this region need not fear insult, as Air Bud will smite any enemies with basketballs of fire.

Meme or die.
