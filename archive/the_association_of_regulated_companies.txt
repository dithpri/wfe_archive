The [b]Association of Regulated Companies[/b] (ARC) is an international organization representing businesses operating within highly regulated industries advocating for stringent commercial regulations to ensure industry stability and consumer protection. 

It promotes fiscal conservatism by supporting policies that maintain balanced budgets and prudent financial management. 

The association endorses protectionist measures, such as tariffs and import restrictions, to shield domestic industries from foreign competition. 

Additionally, ARC opposes foreign influence in domestic markets, favoring policies that prioritize national interests and limit external economic impacts.
