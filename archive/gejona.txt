Maz wb Gejona!
Welcome to the Gejona! You&#39;re welcome to join, and we are equivocally happy to have you! Here, there is only peace and safety. Enjoy!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is voluntary. You can do as you wish (except for raiding!) Governor [nation]Baman and Juket Liberationists[/nation] will remove you if you come here to raid or are being a serious nuisance to the others, but other than that you are welcome to do anything you wish; your way.

For now, there are few activities but we will add more for you to do slowly.

Thanks for reading!
