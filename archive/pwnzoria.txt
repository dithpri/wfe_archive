[*] There is only one true raiding god, and his name is Ultra-Pwnzor; Pwnzoria is a region dedicated to combating the Black Riders and its tainted allies that plague the NS&amp;#39;verse. Here, lies the headquarters/puppet storage of Cyanism&amp;#39;s finest warriors and allies. May they crush the false deity that is Raideron.
[*] Also home to the sub faction, The Black Van Society.
