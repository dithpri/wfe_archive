Tamriel is a vast, sprawling region. It has many sub-regions, including Cyrodill, Black Marsh, and High Rock. Tamriel can be violent, but will often work as one to take out enemies. It will defend it&amp;#39;s friends, and destroy it&amp;#39;s enemies. As a region, we seek to be fun, active, and strong.
