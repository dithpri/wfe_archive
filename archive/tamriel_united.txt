This region thought itself powerful. It was arrogant and weak! It challenged the power of [region]Land Mass[/region]! With only our words, we dismantled their region from the inside out. We turned their own people against them without speaking to them. If this is what we do without using force, then reconsider incurring our wrath. We have claimed this region as our war trophy. Through fear alone they have chosen to surrender and abandon their home. Let this serve as a warning to invaders and as a symbol to our allies. To all defenders, you are strong.
