The Fretton Confederacy is a small group of island nations. It is away from the public eye and nudity is rampant. Interactions with the outside are very little and Fretton maintains a military force and keeps a well regulated civilian militia. Fretton has been in little conflict, it only occurring during the beginning of the nation&#39;s history. Fretton does, however, maintain trade with the outside, however, it is very small.  Contact with outsiders is very minimal and it maintains strict neutrality in all conflicts.
