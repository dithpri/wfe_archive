The Confederate Wastelands, founded in 2077, is home to nations based on Religion, Environmental Sciences, and Military Force. Each nation plays its part in advancing the region as a whole, as well as having the ability to individually better themselves by the means they see fit. The Confederate Wastelands are founded on beliefs common to each individual nation, but also holds a firm belief if order, not allowing a single nation to act out to harm the progress of the whole. The ability to remain independent is something the nations are proud of, and this independence allows them to be selective of nations allowed to join them for the future.
