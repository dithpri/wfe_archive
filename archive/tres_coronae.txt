Tres Coronae: [color=#b48706]&quot;Con onore e gloria per le corone!&quot;[/color]

[color=#da91d1]Long ago, three warriors came together and assassinated their respective rulers.
They usurped each of their crowns and moved them all into the center of the region, forming the &quot;Castrium Coronarum&quot;, the gigantic castle which acts to bring the region&#39;s king and queendoms together.
The Castrium Coronarum brought the souls of the three conquerors together, and granted the new monarchs the gift of eternal life and youth.[/color]
