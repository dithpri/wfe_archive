Tres Coronae: &quot;Con onore e gloria per le corone!&quot;

Long ago, three warriors came together and assassinated their respective rulers.
They usurped each of their crowns and moved them all into the center of the region, forming the &quot;Castrium Coronarum&quot;, the gigantic castle which acts to bring the region&#39;s king and queendoms together.
The Castrium Coronarum brought the souls of the three conquerors together, and granted the new monarchs the gift of eternal life and youth.

Tres Coronae was officially founded and marked on maps for the first time in 967AD.

Con onore e glorie per le corone!
