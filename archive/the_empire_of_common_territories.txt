This region was built to hold the puppets of [nation]The Common Territories[/nation], or better known as TECT. This is a puppet storage region for my main RP nation and anyone who wants to visit/dump their puppets for storage.

Everyone is free to come and go but will submit to the Empire&amp;#39;s authority in regional matters if any do come up at all. This can be a casual region and people are welcome to join as I TECT will be active in both this region and others.
