This region was built to hold the puppets of [nation]Common Territories[/nation], or better known as TECT. However, do to the times and changes in the field, this region shall become a private region. But don&amp;#39;t worry, this region is still a puppet storage place so feel free to visit for a while!

Everyone is free to come and go but as this is now the region holding my main roleplaying nation, I will be more authoritative to anyone who wishes to join in terms of regional matters.
