Hi! We are the most Eastern place in the Universe! We are communist, having achieved true, pure communism:

No dictators
No government propaganda
Freedom of religion
Freedom of speech
Democratically elected government
No privately- owned industry
No income inequality (e.g. everyone earns the same amount.)
No private property (although you can&#39;t just go and live in someone&#39;s home without their permission, you have an assigned home. Government- owned real estate agencies exist)
