The name literally means Commonwealth of the godless. Needless to say, this is not a nice place to live. Come at your own risk...
only the creator has power over the region...and it&amp;#39;s chief 4 nations...

The land is terrible, harsh, and evil. Animals none have ever heard of suddenly appear and murder the helpless. The waters make you sick and the air is heavy. Children learn to tough quickly. The army is one of the best.
