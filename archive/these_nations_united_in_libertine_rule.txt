These Nations United in Libertine Rule was instituted to defend the essential Liberties of man. It is our belief that man has rights; unalienable in their nature - absolute in their weight. It is these rights that develop the necessity of government, and that instill it with purpose. It is the sole duty of government to protect these rights. Never should it be trusted to do more. Never should it be allowed to do less. 

These Nations United in Libertine Rule welcomes all nations of a libertarian doctrine. In unity, we can defend individuality.
