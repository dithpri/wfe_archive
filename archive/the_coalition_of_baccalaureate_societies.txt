The summer of 2013 was a hard time for many nations in The Collaboration of Baccalaureate Societies. Many good nations fell into ruin, but they will not be soon forgotten. For those of us who still remain are a resilient few, a chosen people, and we shall rise from the ashes, and together we will build a new society, where respect and unity reign supreme.

If ye be a willing baccalaureate, come and join us in creating The Coalition of Baccalaureate Societies.
