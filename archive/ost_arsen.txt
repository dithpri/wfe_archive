[B][region]The Black Hawks[/region] have been swooping around a lot this week, and after their many adventures they decided to buy a copy of:
[region]PowerBall[/region]
[region]Ocrad[/region]
[region]Kerovia[/region]
[region]England is my city[/region]
[region]Mythos[/region]
[region]Order of the Red Dragon[/region]
[region]New Scandia[/region]

The Hawks quickly battled everyone in sight, had a brief argument over who is the best starter pokemon, and sent loads of people Haunters holding Everstones. Finally, feeling rather rested, we were ready for another day!
