[b]Welcome [color=gold]Central Tigers[/color]![/b]

This is where the nations of Central Magnet School come together. You are lucky enough do be apart of AP Human Geography. Each class will be making their own nation and moving 
to [color=gold]Central Tigers[/color]. Here, we can put every nation side by side and compare their industrialization, human development index, population, economy, political freedoms, and many other things.


[url=http://www.central.rcs.k12.tn.us/Teachers/burnscl/new11_teacher_template/index.html]Coach Burns[/url] has selected [nation=short]Doofistan[/nation] to be the WA Delegate. However, each month we will vote on which nation, made by students,
will be the next WA Delegate for the [color=gold]Central Tigers[/color].

NOW [color=gold]GO[/color] OUT [color=gold]THERE[/color] AND [color=gold]BRING[/color] HONOR [color=gold]TO[/color] THE [color=gold]TIGERS[/color]!
