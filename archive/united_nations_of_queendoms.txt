Welcome to the United Nations of Queendoms!

This is a region for all you lovely queens out there: cordial queens, fair queens, psychotic dictator queens... all are welcome!

Nations are welcome to discuss all matters relating to effectively governing their nations with queenly authority!

If you&amp;#39;re not a queen, become one. This is an all queens club!

Female monarchies also welcome. The more elaborate your Factbook the better.
