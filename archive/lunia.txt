Welcome to Lunia, the fastest rising region in the NS Sports community! We are a diverse region with many different kinds of nations across multiple tech levels and multiple cultures, but the one thing that unites us is sports. We may be a young region, but some of us have already achieved success elsewhere before founding the region. All who share our love of sports and collaborative writing are invited to come and see what things are like around here. Why not join us?
