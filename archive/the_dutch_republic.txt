Welcome to the Dutch Republic, based off the Dutch Republic (or Confederacy) during the 17th century. We are currently a growing region and hope to see more nations join soon. We would like to start up RPs in the region and get more involved in the world as we continue gaining members. Hopefully with more members we can expand more and more creating more programs and fun things for you to enjoy. With all this being said we hope you enjoy your stay, and do stay as long as possible. A quick final note is that we will have open borders, it was a standard for the Dutch Republic to accept almost anyone into their society, from religious outcasts, to people just quickly stopping by. Any way again please enjoy your stay we hope you have fun.
