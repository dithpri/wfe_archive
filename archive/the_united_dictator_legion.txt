The United Dictator Legion is a powerful military alliance formed by several authoritarian regimes around the world. Its members are unified by their disdain for democracy and human rights, instead embracing totalitarian rule through force and oppression.
The UDL operates with no regard for international laws or norms. Its aggressive tactics include funding rebel groups, fomenting coups, and even directly invading nations deemed threats to the alliance&#39;s interests. Censorship, propaganda, and violence against citizens are regarded as legitimate tools.
