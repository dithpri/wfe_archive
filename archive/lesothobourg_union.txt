[color=blue][b]Lesothobourg Union is back, and better than ever! Since the takeover, some things are changing:[/color] [/b]

[list] -WA cannot access regional control. We will be modeled after our former oppressors, the [region] Eowyth Union[/region]. Everything will be decided with polls. 
-We will have an-new regional map! 
-We do not get involved in other regions&amp;#39; business. We don&amp;#39;t need any more takeovers or LU-EU conflicts 
-New poll system will be initiated. Check Dispatches for more info.[/list]
More updates to come!

Also, post ideas for a new regional flag on the RMB!
