Lead by the fallen seraphs (the unseen masters of the Nation of Bleeding Dawn).
Ruling with swift action, the high ranking members of the Seraphs see themselves as the proper interpreters of the law. Military and justice is a high priority in all nations of the Bleeding Dawn, so the Seraphs rule with an iron fist, but that is not to say each citizen does not enjoy freedom of religion and many other rights. 
We ask that you be fair in your choices and with time, you may make it into our ranks.
