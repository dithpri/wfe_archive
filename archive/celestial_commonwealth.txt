Welcome to the Celestial Commonwealth.
We enforce a policy of single nation regional independence.
Should any solicitation to move regions and disband the commonwealth be made to the regional founder, an embassy request will be made instead to the soliciting nation&amp;#39;s region.

Rejection of such a request will be considered an act of hostility, prompting sanctions on that regions leader.

Current enemies of the commonwealth:
-[region=Coalition of Freedom] lead by [nation=riftend]
-[region=Geopolity] lead by [nation=geopolity]
-[region=Austritaria] lead by [nation=Geniocratics]
-[region=Eurasian Socialist Union] lead by [nation=Kedalistan]
