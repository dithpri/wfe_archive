[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]This region was previously tagged by [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], and then seized by one of their members known as [nation=short+noflag]Improper Classifications[/nation]. However, IMPC was exposed for doxxing, and the state captured this region on 1/31/25 after IMPC puppets began CTEing due to the fallout. This region is now held as a trophy against doxxers, those who harbor them, and the Brotherhood, who made quite possibly one of the [b]worst [/b]&quot;apologies&quot; for their members&#39; actions ever witnessed on NationStates.[/color]
