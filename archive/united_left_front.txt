The United Left Front (ULF) is an alliance of leftist nations. The ULF welcomes all leftists including, but not limited to, Communists and Socialists. The ULF is and will remain strongly anti-fascist and against other far right ideologies.
We pledge to support any uprising lead by our leftist brothers. We must stand together, we leftists must stand united, as a front against those most hated rightists. We must stand as a United Left Front.
