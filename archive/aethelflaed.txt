[b][color=red]T[/color][color=darkgreen]hunderous war,
March, [/color][color=blue]you[/color][color=darkgreen] will see the fight.
Shake your foe to the core,
See the light,
Descend into night.
Raise your shield, see your men,
March, fight again.

By the moon,
Thrust, hack, with sword, and call.
War-chants and a brazen tune,
Your line [/color][color=blue]will[/color][color=darkgreen] hold the wall,
Stand strong, brave and tall.
Have your soul and spirit,
War-fires shall be lit.

[/color][color=blue]Be[/color][color=darkgreen] strong,
See the flame, the fire.
Never put a foot wrong,
The enemy&amp;#39;s fate is dire,
The victory is [/color][color=blue]mine[/color][color=darkgreen], the enemy will tire.
They will flee,
Victory belongs to me.[/color][/b]
