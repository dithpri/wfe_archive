[b][color=red]G[/color][color=darkgreen]reat fate, thunderous war,
March on, [/color][color=blue]you[/color][color=darkgreen] will see the fight.
Shake your foe to the core,
See the light,
Descend into night.
Raise your shield, see your men,
March, fight again.

Great War,
Alfred, Ceowulf II, fighters true,
Great War,

[/color][color=red]O[/color][color=darkgreen]n the field, by the moon,
Thrust with sword, and call.
War-chants and a brazen tune,
Your line [/color][color=blue]will[/color][color=darkgreen] hold the wall,
Stand strong, brave, tall.
Have your soul, spirit,
War-fires shall be lit.

Great War,
Alfred, Ceowulf II, fighters true,
Great War,

See the flame, the fire.
Never put a foot wrong,
The enemy&#39;s fate is dire,
The victory is [/color][color=blue]mine[/color][color=darkgreen], the enemy will tire.
They will flee,
Victory belongs to me.[/color][/b]
