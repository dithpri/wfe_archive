[b][color=red]T[/color][color=darkgreen]hunderous war,
march, you will see the fight.
Shake your foe to the core,
See the light,
Descend into night.
Raise your shield, see your men,
March, fight again.

By the moon,
Thrust with sword ,and call.
War-chants and a brazen tune,
Your line will hold the wall,
Stand strong, brave, tall.
Have your soul, spirit,
War-fires shall be lit.

Be strong,
See the flame, the fire.
Never put a foot wrong,
The enemy&amp;#39;s fate is dire,
The victory is mine, the enemy will tire.
They will flee,
Victory belongs to me.[/color][/b]
