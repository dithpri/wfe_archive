You think you&#39;re oppressed? Try being a gamer. Us gamers are constantly under attack by the right and left wing. Constantly getting friendzoned and attacked all for enjoying a hobby that actually improves your critical thinking and problem solving skills. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, America! If any of you gamers out there feel the same way, join me in overthrowing the oppressive anti-gangweeders, so that we may rise up. We will show everyone that gamers are bred from generations of men and women with superior senses and intellect. GANGWEEDERS RISE UP!!1!!!!!1
