Axiom Worldship is artifical planet, equiped with Gravity Manipulation Matrix (GMM) that serves as its STL propulsion system, protective shield, main weapon, and manipulation tool. For FTL, worldship uses Frame Shift Drive (FSD), that can achieve 3001c; alternatively, Axiom could perform &quot;FTL Jump&quot;, with range 1 parsec, and 1 day recharge.

There are three artifical suns, placed in fixed points in triangle above planet equator.

Planetary surface is divided into hexagons, where each one can be controlled by single nation, while others may exert influence to gain control. &quot;Origin Hexagons&quot; (nations homes) are immune from takeover; nation may relocate its Home to any currently controled hexagon.
