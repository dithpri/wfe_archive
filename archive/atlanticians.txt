If you want to learn with the best, raid with the finest, and are willing to put in a bit of elbow grease in order to earn a reputation, then this is the region for you. Our name is known throughout the game, and we have conquered many of the largest regions in NationStates.

The Black Hawks always welcome new recruits. Once you&#39;ve enlisted, you will receive one-on-one training with an experienced military officer who will walk you through the steps to becoming one of the most feared players in all of NationStates.
