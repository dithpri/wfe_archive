A region founded on the tenets of ancient Sparta and Athens, we have worked to include the best aspects of both Sparta and Athens into our region.  Like the Athenians of old, the members of this region participate in regular elections and are committed towards democracy. And like the Spartans of old, the members of this region are staunch supporters of the ideal of sovereignty and that of the republic. We brook no external interference in the politics of our region and don&amp;#39;t tolerate nations with an authoritarian outlook. I repeat, the region of Sparthens is committed to the concepts of democracy and sovereignty and will not surrender its ideals at any cost.
