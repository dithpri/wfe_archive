The [b]Vrijheid Coast[/b] is a mix of [b]East and West[/b]. Located on the [b]northwestern coast of North America[/b], it is a region where the [b]Dutch, British, Chinese, Malays, Indonesians, and East Indians settled[/b] during the 300 years of colonization and importation of indentured laborers from South and East Asia to North America by the [b]Dutch Republic[/b] and [b]Kingdom of Great Britain[/b]. We have [b]been through struggle, strife, war, political uprisings,[/b] but as of [b]2011[/b], [b]&quot;WE THE PEOPLE&quot;[/b] have gained our [b]independence[/b] as strong [b]free nations in a proud political union[/b] of [b]many people and nations[/b]. So if you[b] love real world alternate history[/b] or want to create a nation that broke free of [b]British, Dutch, or American colonization[/b] than we are the region for you to join. [b]Thank You![/b]
