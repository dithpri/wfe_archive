The [b]Vrijheid Coast[/b] is a mix of East and West. Located on the [b]northestern coast of North America[/b], it is a region where the Dutch, British, Chinese, Malays, Indonesians, and East Indians settled during the 300 years of colonization and importation of indentured labourers from South and East Asia to North America by the Dutch Republic and Kingdom of Great Britain. We have been through struggle, strife, war, political uprisings, but as of 2011, &quot;WE THE PEOPLE&quot; have gained our independence as strong free nations in a proud political union of many people and nations. So if you love real world alternate history or want to create a nation that broke free of British, Dutch, or American colonization than we are the region for you to join. Thank You!
