Quere is an empire of anarchy and democracy.

Quere believes that the people and the environment are far more important than the money and the government; may democracy and anarchy promote unity and individualism, which bring virtue.

The democratic-anarchic government of the Querean Empire prefers to deal with internal and external affairs alone. Still, it is willing to develop embassies with other nations if the Querean Region believes that said nations will benefit Quere&#39;s anarchic and democratic principles in both the near and far future.
