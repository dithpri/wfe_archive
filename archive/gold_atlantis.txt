Atlantis (Ancient Greek, &amp;quot;island of Atlas&amp;quot;) is a island mentioned within an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato&amp;#39;s works Timaeus and Critias, where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges &amp;quot;Ancient Athens&amp;quot;. In the story, Athens was able to repel the Atlantean attack, unlike any other nation of the (western) known world, supposedly giving testament to the superiority of Plato&amp;#39;s concept of a state. At the end of the story, Atlantis eventually falls out of favor with the gods and famously submerges into the Atlantic Ocean.
