The heart of England, Northampton gives visitors a friendly welcome (don&#39;t be surprised to be greeted with a jolly &quot;ey up me duck&quot; from a local!) and a chance to glimpse what England is like off the typical tourist trail. But don&#39;t let anyone suggest that Northampton doesn&#39;t have big attractions - it includes the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, one of only four copies of the Magna Carta, a stunning National Park, beautiful country villages and world-famous food all in one region.
