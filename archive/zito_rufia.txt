Zito Rufia was founded by a traveling monarch named Zito Rufius who found the the land a place of ruins from former civilizations. He ruled for years, then his son Zitorius ruled for years, until assasinated by his general, who was angry about wartime failure with the neighboring country named Saturn, the general was inprisoned by the king&#39;s gaurds, and died when the underground caved in on him during a riot. The last monarch, Rufius ruled for some time until a group of people inspired by Saturn&#39;s socialist revolution then revolted themselves, bringing an end to the large poverty and sickness of the lower class, and the oppression of free-thinkers.
