Zito Rufia was founded by king Zito Rufius after The Great Snow, a terrible blizzard that killed many. Rufius found a great city in the sand land that had been snowed-in. The people that had lived there resorted to cannibalism and insanity. He formed an army, and took the city by force. Those he fought to take the city were unorganized and delirious, making the take-over easy. He took the city survivors and converted them to sanity, set up a monarchy, and had a son named Zitorius, who would be the father of Rufius. The Kingdom was named Zito Rufia, after the first king to rule it. The Kingdom was known for having mercy to enemies, and building many churches and rehabilitation centers.
