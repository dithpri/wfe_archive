Shadow Proclamation Realistic Role Playing is a region where the men and women of SP can come for RPs with realism. No mech(Islands can have his Jap mech), no space battles, no magic, no unobtainium*glares at zero*, just real life units. 

Questionable fights will be put through CMANO to determine the outcome.

Research is highly recommended in order to stand a chance and maybe even an advantage.
