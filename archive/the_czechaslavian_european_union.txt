 Welcome to the Czechaslavian European Union also known as the C.E.U. We thank you for resting your nation in the embrace of the Union in which we hope to inspire other nations to join our socialist union and socialism all together. Now in this region we hope to formally settle conflicts between nations and to give non-socialist nations a good first experience of true and organized socialism. Now every union needs several policies to keep order between these and the C.E.U is no exception to this so here are our policies:
1. We heavily suggest that your nation uses the Kyep as currency.
2. If it is not yet obvious you must be socialist to be in the C.E.U.
3. Give your nation democracy, please.
May your nation live long and hail to socialism.
