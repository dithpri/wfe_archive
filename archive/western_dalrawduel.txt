For those who find themselves cast out of their own region, welcome to Western Dalrawduel. 

This region&amp;#39;s name is given us due to our backstory: at one point, the first five nations of the region dwelt in the medieval region of [region]Dalrawduel[/region]. After a point, however, overpopulation led to the reformation of boundaries, which resulted in the division of the region into Eastern Dalrawduel (which retained its original name) and Western Dalrawduel. Now we stand alone, but welcome all those who seek to join us.
