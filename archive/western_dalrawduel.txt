Welcome to Western Dalrawduel!  Governments generally endow their healthcare departments with a large amount of funding, with an average of 7% of government budgets across the region being devoted to healthcare. Welfare is a large part of government expenditure, with denizens amply provided for. Governments within the region are fixated with religious worship, with nations having an inordinately high average of 22% of total government funds devoted to it.  However, this is a rather unfortunate type of spirituality, being that the religion in question requires the sacrifice of carrots daily and worship of a small carrot from thousands of years before. It&amp;#39;s rather odd, quite frankly.
