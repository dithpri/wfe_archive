Welcome to Western Dalrawduel! This region was founded for the purpose of housing those nations of [region]Dalrawduel[/region] who were considered to be overpopulating it in the days of the republic. Now, as each of those puppets have found a home of their own, it had ceased to exist... until now. Refounded upon the exact same date as it was the previous year, it now serves to be a home to whatever nations choose it as such for themselves, in the hope that it might one day come to be a meaningful extension of Dalrawduel.
