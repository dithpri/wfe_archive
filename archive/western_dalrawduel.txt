For those who seek power, glory, and success, welcome to Western Dalrawduel! 

Western Dalrawduel is an extension of Dalrawduel, a medieval-themed region with a great variety of nations. It was founded for the purpose of housing those nations of Dalrawduel who were considered to be overpopulating it in the days of the republic. Now, as each of those puppets have found a home of their own, it had ceased to exist, until it was refounded upon the exact same date as it was the previous year. It now serves as a reinstitution of the original Dalrawduelian monarchy, and is open as a home to whatever nations so choose to reside here.

We will be glad to receive you as a member of this fantastic region!
