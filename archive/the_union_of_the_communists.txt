This Region is a place where communist countries can come and relax in a region dedicated to pure and undiluted communism. This is also a refuge for communist nations who are frustrated with the impurity of conventional &amp;#39;communist regions&amp;#39;. The flag is a simple communist flag, representing the purity of the communism of the region, the large gold star represents The Great Tambooran Empire, who founded the group, smaller gold stars represent other pure communist nations that have joined the union.
