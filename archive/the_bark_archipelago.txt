Soil degradation:

- wind
- rain (including gullying)
- improper agricultural practises
- salinization due to aridity + irrigation

Human activity often makes this worse because agriculture means the soil is often left bare. Roads collect and channel water and can cause gullying. Animal overgrazing bares soil and leaves it vulnerable to wind erosion. Removal of woodland? Bam. Soil exposed. Ruined.

There&#39;s real bad soil degradation in India and the Midwest USA :(
