We are known by many names. The Family. Cosa Nostra. Die M&auml;nner. The Honoured Society. The Black Hand. The mob. The mafia. Whatever you call us, you always know we&#146;re here. We&#146;re always waiting, always watching, always just an inch away from taking out you, your family, your girl. We will always be here. We have always been. Whether you see us or not is up to you. Just know these two things: You don&#146;t cross us. And you don&#146;t betray us. Because the Family doesn&#146;t forgive. And we don&#146;t forget.
