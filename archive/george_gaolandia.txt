Named after the Holy Person, George Gao, George Gaolandia serves as a last surviving region from the crumbling empire of Shererland. After the nations of this fair region suffered under Shererland with the retirement of the tyrannical Douglas, they set out on their own as independent states under a common region rules by a plurality under the tyrannical fist of Yainey. George Gao, our Holy Person one of the most powerful under the rule of Shererland, inspired us to create this region and get along, with the advice and consent of Yainey.

With immigration from Valadezland, George Gaolandia has rebounded as a insanely great region. We stand for Destruction, Infighting, and hatred towards our former ruler, Douglas.
