 Welcome to the hills of hollow deep in the Great black forest, on the Rhine River. 

We hope your nation has an amazing time here.

*Hollow functions as a forest community working with Fraelrisst, Riverside, and Brookspreegen to form a single Principality. We exercise free trade, work together, and mainly work in the service of agriculture.*

Our minister, Richard Sp&auml;rs&uuml;el, runs the country with wonderful ideas.
