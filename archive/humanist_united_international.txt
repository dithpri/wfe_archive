Greetings and welcome to our glorious region, the Humanist Untied International!! What are we? What do we do? How are the people? What is our Government? Well fellow visitor or delegate, I shall answer all the FAQ for you.

What are we? We are the Humanist United International, we are a human only region that secures human rights and freedoms, as well as making the people happy.

What is our government? We are a Coalition of Ordered Governments, serving the people, and not the people serving us. We ensure freedoms, equality, and human rights under a democracy for the people.

How are the people? That depends on what nation you decide to settle in.

What do we do? We currently are at war with the Demon Lord and her tyrannical armies.
