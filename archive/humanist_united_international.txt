Greetings and welcome to our glorious region, the [Color=red] Humanist Untied International!! [/color] What are we? What do we do? How are the people? What is our Government? Well fellow visitor or delegate, I shall answer all the FAQ for you.

What are we? We are the Humanist United International, we are a human only region that secures human rights and freedoms, as well as making the people happy.

What is our government? We are a Coalition of Ordered Governments, serving the people, and not the people serving us. We ensure freedoms, equality, and human rights under a democracy for the people.

How are the people? That depends on what nation you decide to settle in.

For now... We are at a massive war against the Demon Lord and her tyrannical armies!
