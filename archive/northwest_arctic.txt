[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr]

This region was fought over by several raider factions, including [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]Lily[/region], [nation=short+noflag]Alpha Wolf[/nation] along with myself ([nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]), and of course the defenders trying to boot everybody out. But then somebody foolishly left it open for capture after the dust settled! It is now an imperial territory.[/color]
