The area now known as Okprela was established around 275 years ago as a colony of an ex-superpower looking to expand away from their environmentally failing nation.  Now both the old country and Okprela have split into several different countries, the newest of which is Ankrazh.  The country generally shown as the &amp;#39;main&amp;#39; state of Okprela is Inebristan, which was founded by escapees from an ethnic cleansing camp only 60 years ago.

Okprela has a coastal area to the south and west, with territory north-east of the area yet to be explored and claimed.  No country in Okprela seems to be willing to take this task on, leaving it free for colonisation by an outside nation.
