Hello friends, and [color=red]W[/color][color=blue]e[/color][color=yellow]l[/color][color=purple]c[/color][color=orange]o[/color][color=green]m[/color][color=pink]e[/color] to [color=amber]New Sheoth[/color]. I&amp;#39;m your host, Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. We have a wonderful time here. [color=blue]Butterflies[/color], [color=red]Blood[/color], [color=brown]Foxes[/color], [color=purple]Severed Heads[/color], hoho and the [color=orange]CHEESE[/color]!! To die for. Feel free to ask Haskill, or myself, or yourself, to get any questions answered. Send messages, either a song, or a summons, or a letter scrawled on the back of an Argonian concubine; those are my favorite.

Now, this is the [i]only[/i] rule in [color=amber]New Sheoth[/color]:

#1 [b]Obey me[/b]

If you do not obey these rules, you will be killed and you will not get cheese.
