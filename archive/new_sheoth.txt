Hello friends, and welcome to New Sheoth. I&amp;#39;m your host, Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. We have a wonderful time here. Butterflies, Blood, Foxes, Severed Heads, hoho and the CHEESE!! To die for. Anyhoo, feel free to ask Haskill, or myself, or yourself, to get any questions answered. Send messages, either a song, or a summons, or a letter scrawled on the back of an Argonian concubine; those are my favorite. Haskill and I will be happy to assist you mortals.

Now, these are the only rules in New Sheoth:

#1 Obey me

#2 Eat Cheese

#3 Practice Sheogorathism

If you do not obey these rules, you will be killed and you will not get cheese. Now come back soon, OR I&amp;#39;LL PLUCK OUT YOUR EYES!! Ta Ta.
