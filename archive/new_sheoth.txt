Hello friends, and Welcome to [color=amber]New Sheoth[/color]. I&amp;#39;m your host, Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness. We have a wonderful time here. [color=blue]Butterflies[/color], [color=red]Blood[/color], [color=brown]Foxes[/color], [color=purple]Severed Heads[/color], hoho and the [color=orange]CHEESE[/color]!! To die for. Feel free to ask Haskill, or myself, or yourself, to get any questions answered. Send messages, either a song, or a summons, or a letter scrawled on the back of an Argonian concubine; those are my favorite.

Now, this is the [i]only[/i] rule in New Sheoth:
