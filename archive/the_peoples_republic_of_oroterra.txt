Dear International Public,

The President of the The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Oroterra founded this region to protect the people&amp;#39;s liberty by not surrendering their hard-won independence to a large and corrupt multinational region. All information on this region may be found by way of the Oroterran factbook. This information is given on the Oroterran nation, but, since that nation is the only one in the region, all information should be the same with regard to the nation&amp;#39;s region.

Yours Sincerely,
The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Oroterra.
