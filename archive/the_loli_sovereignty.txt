[color=gold]The Loli Sovereignty, a sanctuary for all anime-loving dwellers; we accept all who are willing to embrace this radiant and brilliant life, especially those accustomed to the denizens known as[/color][color=red] &#39;lolis&#39;[/color][color=gold]. We are a true monarchy - working in hierarchies and kingdoms, we bless our strongest and most able with boons and powers; who will gain great amounts of glory. Likewise, we - as a region - endorse capitalist behaviour to create economically-expert nations; similarly, we [i]don&#39;t[/i] discourage totalitarianism governments - after all, sacrifices must be made.[/color]

[color=yellow]On a different note; feel free to role-play, discuss what you want - [b]WITHIN REASON[/b] - and most importantly: praise The Loli Sovereignty![/color]
