The history of our great region of Yeetville started when our Dear Republic Leader, The People&#146;s Republic of Yeetville, was founded in the South Pacific. The republic decided after a nationwide referendum to start a region of pure and total socialism. So we started a region named after a famous word with a y at the end. We were bored without anyone else there, so we decided to make a bunch of nations and let them have independence. Some are capitalists and libertarians while some are ruled by single people in a dominion. But we don&#146;t care! Our policy is to make the region eventually become fully socialist and make it very, very pure. Our foreign policy is to reach out to everybody we can find. And I will now see you off.
