[b]Overview[/b]
A coalition of successor worlds bound by one law &#151; order must outlast collapse. The Continuum preserves, regulates, and endures where empires fade.

&#149; [b]Continuance:[/b] What endures must be recorded.
&#149; [b]Stability:[/b] Entropy is the only enemy.
&#149; [b]Custodianship:[/b] To rule is to preserve.

[b]Creed[/b]
&quot;To preserve is to serve; to serve is to endure.&quot;
