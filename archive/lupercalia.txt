Lupercalia is a cold but pristine region of countries that often argue amongst themselves. Wildlife includes rare aquatic crustaceans, three hundred different species of owls, bats, large packs of wolves, caribou, sixty-four different species of deer, foxes, lemmings, and nine species of cicada that are known to harmonize with local songbirds. The founder of Lupercalia is Maathia, a theocratical nation of enlightenment.
