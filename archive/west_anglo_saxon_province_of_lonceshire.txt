Old Britannia is dead. West Anglo-Saxonnia is a group of sizeable semi-inhabited islands in the an unknown portion of ocean. Entesshire is one of the major islands, offering bracing weather, fine historical preservation of pre-viking settlements and surprising amounts of decent land, space and resources. Its people are largely decedents of Germanic settlers, but recently more foreign communities have begun to immigrate. A fairly stagnant biodiversity means environmentalism is rare compared with some states.
