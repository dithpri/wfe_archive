[color=#3B0B0B][b]=Strong we stand!=[/color][/b]
This region is neither a defender nor invader. We are simply a region that abides by its own rules and no other. It is new, so there are not many nations, but soon we will be strongest of all! Our goal is to fight for what we stand for and nothing else. We allow puppets for raiding/defending purposes, and any nation can join us, and any nation can become regional delegate. There is no endorsement cap yet, and the endorsement cap will only be established if  Fortis Sumus is in any potential danger.
