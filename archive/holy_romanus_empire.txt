This Feudal Empire is dedicated to preserving morality, freedom, wellbeing, and justice for its citizens. It is run according to objective morality, though some outlier groups may be allowed to a certain extent if they keep to themselves. Beyond those basic rules, however, local leaders have a lot of freedom to govern as they see fit.
