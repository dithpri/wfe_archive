This region has been inactive for months, but is officially now a historical record for its old members as of 08/29/2024. This will continued to be protected, and kept sacred to those who enjoyed this community. Thank you all those who supported this region, some of our best role-plays happened here, but good things do not last, and they always have to come to an end. - [i]Qetho, former Security Council, bloodcat, and now Governor of the late, and great New Ardenia.[/i]
