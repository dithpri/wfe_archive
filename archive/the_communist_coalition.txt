Welcome everyone, to the Communist Coalition.
We are comrade states, and we will gladly take in political refugees, since this region is not affiliated with the Communist Party of NationStates. This region is concerned with the spread of Communism. We will take measures to prevent fascist and capitalist countries.

Due to our discontent of the communist region that the founders of this region are fed up with, we declare independence. So we successfully demoted them to second largest in 2 days and with an army of 3 people.
