Welcome everyone, to the Communist Coalition.
We are comrade states, and we will gladly take in political refugees, since this region is not affiliated with the Communist Party of NationStates. This region is concerned with the spread of Communism. We will tolerate capitalism and fascism but we will strongly encourage you to become Communist.
Due to our discontent with the communist region&amp;#39;s government, we declare independence. So we successfully demoted them to second largest in 2 days and with an army of 3 people.
