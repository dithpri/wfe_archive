Welcome everyone, to the Communist Coalition.
We are comrade states, and we will gladly take in political refugees, since this region is not affiliated with the Communist Party of NationStates. This region is concerned with the spread of Communism. We will tolerate capitalism and fascism but we will strongly encourage you to become Communist.
