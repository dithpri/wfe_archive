Welcome everyone, to the Communist Coalition.

We are comrade states, and we will gladly take in political refugees, since this region is not affiliated with the Communist Party of NationStates. This region is concerned with the spread of Communism.

Due to our discontent with the communist region&amp;#39;s government, we declare independence. So we successfully demoted them to second largest in 2 days and with an army of 3 people, and we have efficiently couped their tyrannical government.

NO RECRUITING ON THE RMB
