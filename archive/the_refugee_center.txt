[b]If you answered yes to any of this, then you can join the Refugee Center! With active admin(s) against raids and any dramatic bull crap like that, we are open to anyone just looking to get away from all the region and world assembly stuff to just take a breather. We have snacks on the counter and cold drinks in the fridge, enjoy your stay![/b]
