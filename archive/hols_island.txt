[u][region]Hols Island[/region][/u]

[region]Hols Island[/region] was undiscovered until the late 1700&#39;s by Russian and Japanese explorers, giving birth to [nation]Pakeiya[/nation] and [nation]Toko Ghaman[/nation]. The nuclear-armed nations of [nation]Pakeiya[/nation] and [nation]Toko Ghaman[/nation] are the two hegemons of Hols Island, with a mutual defensive pact declared between them to protect all the nations in [region]Hols Island[/region]. In the most recent history of [region]Hols Island[/region], there was a dispute with the neighbouring islands (primarily between [nation]Pakeiya[/nation] and [nation]Azterrah[/nation]) now known as [region]The Great Free Archipelago[/region], which had caused a decade old treaty between these regions to collapse.
