Hols Island is split between 5 nations. Azterrah was the native inhabitants. Toko Ghaman was a Japanese colony that declared independence in 1904. Pakeiya was born from a Russian colony that declared independence in 1918. The former British-Italian colony Intellectus Semper declared independence in 1922. Cercusant was granted independence from France in 1959, and Azterrah was granted independence from Cercusant later that year. During the Cold War, global powers attempted to influence the young nations, so they signed a mutual defence treaty. This eventually prospered into an economic union, similar to the European Union.
