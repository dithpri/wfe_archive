Founded in 2024, the Third Position Alliance is a social community founded with the goal of advancing the Third Position ideology commonly known as Fascism across the the world of NationStates. The NSRight lacks the organization, fortitude, and disciplined military &quot;Invader&quot; forces it once boasted in great prowess and numbers. The Third Position Alliance is the only Fascist region on NationStates attempting to organize the NSRight in military operations as well as social interaction.
