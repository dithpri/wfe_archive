The Eternal Void where the Pain Lord and its Shreikh inhabit. There is no gate or portal , in or out. Black Stars and Black Holes are the only ways into the void, where you will feel. A utter euphoria of pain at your very existence being torn away slowly and endlessly , until your soul remains. The currency and sustenance for the Shreikh race. There is a solitary lone planet in the depths which inhabit a small human nation on the planet Shreikh,they worship the Shreikh and serve their very will. The Shreikhs personal farm of souls in their back yard.
