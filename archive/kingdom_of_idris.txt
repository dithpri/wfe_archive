The historic Kingdom of Idris has gone by many names, with many nations having fallen at one point in time with the exception of the few eternal nations. Standing for democracy, liberty, peace and equality, the land of Idris stands proud and tall once more. A bastion of LGBTQIA+ rights, Idris does not tolerate discrimination of any kind.
