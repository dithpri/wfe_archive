The Realitants (officially the [i]Realitary Armed Forces[/i]) is focused on the never-ending battle to unite the Multiverse under the banner of the New Realitary Order.

The Realitants&#146; mission, simply put, is to collectively encompass the ever-expanding Multiverse (currently known to be over 700,000 discovered realities and counting) under one flag; one region; and one Realitant flag. The continued discovery of new realities within the Multiverse calls for special action: a sort of Manifest Destiny- of all Creation.
