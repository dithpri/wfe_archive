As free nations:

&#149; We demand our government have fidelity to its own governing documents.
&#149; We believe in a noninterventionist foreign policy.  
&#149; We believe the free market is the most just and humane economic system.
&#149; We oppose a central bank, which reduces the value of currency.
&#149; We believe issues should be predominantly resolved locally rather than nationally.
&#149; We will not transfer sovereignty to a collective under which we do not maintain representation.
&#149; We believe that freedom is an indivisible whole, including economic liberty, civil liberties, privacy rights, and all the freedoms protected by the country Constitution.
