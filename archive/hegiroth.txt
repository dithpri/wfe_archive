[b][color=red]HEGIROTHIAN SLAUGHTER MONUMENT[/color][/b]

A place where the glorious liberators of [region]The Wolf Clan[/region] can remember what We once accomplished to save a group...that later betrayed us. 

In all reality this place was filled with complaining liberal countries that just can&#39;t properly run a region. Just like most nations in [b]NSGP[/b]!

[i]Strange how history repeats itself... right [nation]New Excalibus[/nation] and [nation]The Greater Low Countries[/nation]? Now that [region]The Clover Confederation[/region] 
is dead, shall [region]Aramos[/region] be next?[/i]
