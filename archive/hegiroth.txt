[color=red][b][u]HEGIROTHIAN SLAUGHTER MONUMENT[/u][/b][/color]

[b]A place where the glorious liberators of [region]The Wolf Clan[/region] can remember what We once accomplished to save a group...that later betrayed us. Named [region]The Clover Confederation[/region] Just like the former founder of Hegiroth.[/b]

In Memoriam of a once mediocre region that gave many people a place to argue, complain, and fight.
