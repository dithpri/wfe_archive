[b][u]The Memorial to Hegiroth[/u][/b]

Hegiroth was once a thriving region; a region of discussion, roleplay, and friends. Now all that is gone.
Hegiroth was originally founded by [nation]Lytchett[/nation] long ago in August, and soon [nation]New Excalibus[/nation], a refugee from [region]The VALTIC[/region], joined as Co-Founder. Soon, many more VALTIC refugees arrived, those being [nation]The Greater Low Countries[/nation], [nation]Rughzhenhaide[/nation], and [nation]Puetavisa[/nation]. The region came to be known as The Grand Union of Hegiroth. It was great.

That all changed one day.

The region was controversially integrated into [region]KAISERREICH[/region]&#39;s Kaiserbund group of regions. Because of this, Hegiroth began to crumble.
And now it is gone. 

Here you may silently remember Hegiroth for what it was once.
