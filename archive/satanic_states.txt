O&amp;#39; mighty Lord of the Night. Master of beasts. Bringer of awe and derision. 
Thou whose spirit lieth upon every act of oppression, hatred and strife. 
Thou whose presence dwelleth in every shadow. 
Thou who strengthen the power of every quietus. 
Thou who sway every plague and storm. 
Harkee.
