     Welcome to the Samurai Valhalla of the Spartans where freedom is our most precious commodity and there are plenty of weapons to keep it that way. Samurai Valhalla of the Spartans (SVS), as a region, is not a governing body, but a collective of nations who desire full autonomy yet protection from those who abuse the systems of other regions. We are open to any who wish to seek refuge, lie low, or develop their nation in full safety. Do not threaten our freedoms, and will not annihilate yours.
