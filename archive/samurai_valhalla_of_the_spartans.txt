     Welcome to the Samurai Valhalla of the Spartans where freedom is our most precious commodity and there are plenty of weapons to keep it that way. Samurai Valhalla of the Spartans (SVS), as a region, is not a governing body, but a collective of nations who desire full autonomy yet protection from those who abuse the systems of other regions. Feel free to bring your nation in, but be sure to mind your manners.
