Neo Rome is best described as a Galactic alliance more so than a world region. The Empire of Lord Deamounios was the first to discover the worm hole that allows travel to this uninhabited, but well Terra-formed galaxy. The Empire secured several solar systems and has begun populating them by plucking young but worth while nations from it&#39;s old home world and depositing them on their own world to grow on their own into a new power in the galaxy. The worm hole has since been sealed behind Hell&#39;s Gate, and is guarded by a fleet of star ships know as the Cerberus Armada. No entry with out the Emperor&#39;s permission, and pray he decided to leave you be while he deals with these pesky native Jedi.
