The Goddess Elisa
Queen Elisa, who ascended the throne after the 2024 war which saw the women&#39;s revolution against male domination and female victory, understood that the cause of the patriarchy which lasted 3000 years were the three &quot;Abrahamic&quot; religions which traced back the sins of women to the original sin of Adam pushed by Eve, therefore only with the elimination of the three religions and the establishment of a single religion that venerated a Female Goddess could Female Power be maintained, but it was necessary to proceed with the persecutions of the followers of the three religions especially against males who refused to bow at the feet of a Goddess, therefore she had to declare herself a Living Goddess
