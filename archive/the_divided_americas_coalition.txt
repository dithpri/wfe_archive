The DAC (Divided America&#39;s Coalition) Is a region in Central and North America that aims to collectively empower countries distraught by current situations between them and allies, and find new grounds in creating better nations with better rules. 

The DAC allows all countries to join, but has strict policies about actions within the region, and will remove nations from the region if deemed neccessary. This will not always be a executive decision, as many times we will have polls and issues brought up to all of the countries in the region to discuss new ideas and politics.
