Welcome to The Brave New World. Here we strive to make a new region, with new principals, of new people, under such new government that it will dawn above the others. Will you journey on to this new region, a region of promise, A region where you can start again, or will you just move past this place not thinking of what can come afterwards? My fellow Nations, we await on your arrival to this brave new world.
