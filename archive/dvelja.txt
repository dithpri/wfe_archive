[color=#666666]What comes to your mind when you hear the word &quot;dwelling?&quot; Perhaps it is most likely a humble single-floor house that shelters you and your family, or an apartment room on one of the floors of a highrise building, Perhaps it is a pristine and elegant mansion on top of a hill, or it is the only rag large enough to use as a blanket. For us, our dwelling is our planet, our only home, where our hopes and dreams manifest. In spite of it all, we have learned to accept that this world is our dwelling place.[/color]
