The Remnants of North America are the American Powers inadvertently created by the downfall of the United States and most First World Countries. The Remnants keep order in the North American territories, keeping any foreign Power out. So far the stable nations in the Remnants are Alaska, which controls Alaska and Canada, Michigan, which controls the entire Great Lakes region, including A portion of New York, California, which controls The entire West Coast and Nevada and is also a slave nation, and Texas which controls Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Florida, and Mexico.
