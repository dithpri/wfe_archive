[color=blue]The United Nations of D3[/color] (or [color=green]UNOD3[/color]) were formed as an international D3 Brigade connection. [color=yellow]Any[/color] nation is allowed to join the alliance and can feel free to do whatevs in the universal chatroom so long as it isn&amp;#39;t [color=red]offensive or rude[/color]. If it is we might have to kick your nation out of the alliance, but we hope we don&amp;#39;t have to do that.

The UNOD3 are mainly peacemakers, however, we are moreso about variety. So for those with random opinions or ideas about our rules, I will take it into consideration and try to add it to the list. [color=blue]For now, the only rule is don&amp;#39;t hurt people or their feelings.[/color]
