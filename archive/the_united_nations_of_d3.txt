The United Nations of D3 (or UNOD3) were formed as an international D3 Brigade connection. Any nation is allowed to join the alliance and can feel free to do whatevs in the universal chatroom so long as it isn&amp;#39;t offensive or rude. If it is we might have to kick your nation out of the alliance, but we hope we don&amp;#39;t have to do that.

The UNOD3 are mainly peacemakers, however, we are moreso about variety. So for those with random opinions about our rules, I will take it into consideration and try to add it to the list. For now, the only rule is don&amp;#39;t hurt people or their feelings.

Have fun! :D
