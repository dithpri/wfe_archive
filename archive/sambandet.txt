[b]Countries with different ideals can work together in [region]Sambandet[/region]. However, you have to be invited by someone inside the region who you know in real life.
You can give out the password to people you would like to invite to join, but it would be appreciated if you first consulted [nation]Emluin[/nation] or [nation]Maria Leilani[/nation].
If you act rude, disrespectful or in any other way unacceptable, you may be ejected and/or banned. However, this does not include having different opinions than the leaders. If someone ejects you for disagreeing with them, they will themselves be ejected.[/b]
