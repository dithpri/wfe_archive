The Allied Liberal Nations are new region made up of mostly, you guessed it, liberal nations.
However, anyone is encouraged to join regardless of their beliefs.
Our government is a republic that consists of The Allied Council, The President,and The Chief Justice.
Anyone can participate in government and even become a lawyer!
We&amp;#39;re starting up and getting ready for our first elections!
We would appreciate all the nations we could get!
We also have an off-site forum where you can find more information about our region.
