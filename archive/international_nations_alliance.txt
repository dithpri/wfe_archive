Welcome to the International Nations Alliance(INA).

Our Motto: 
Strength Through Compliance

About Us:
The INA is rather new but that doesn&#146;t mean we can&#146;t still dominate the world!

Our Goals:
The INA hopes to dominate the world one day in with majority of vote for the World Assembly and control and larger region. We hope to have an embassy soon in almost all major regions.

Other: 
If you have questions, concerns, or would like to no more you are welcomed to send a telegram to me or one of my associates. I hope you consider joining the INA.
