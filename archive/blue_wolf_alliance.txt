Welcome to the [b][color=#1c7ac1]Blue Wolf Alliance[/b][/color], which is better in every way than the [b][color=#d83623]Red Wolf Alliance[/b][/color], and, of course, every other region. The Blue Wolf Alliance is based on its central principles, the three Fs: Freedom, Fun, and [url=https://pastebin.com/KfMjV1NU]a third one which is automatically censored[/url].

Most regional activity is conducted on [b]the regional Discord[/b], which can be found [url=https://discord.gg/aBEtam7]here[/url].
