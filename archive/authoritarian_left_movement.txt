The Authoritarian Left Movement protects nations from neoliberal and anarchist policies that have destroyed and corrupted the left. This region welcomes leftist nations that have authoritarian views on any social topics such as abortion, cannabis legalization, economics, and the press. This region protects nations who oppose liberal views of Trotsky and Council Communism. This region is anti-globalist and supports left-wing nationalism. There is no hate speech here, only free speech. 

We oppose Fascism and all other reactionary views of the right.
