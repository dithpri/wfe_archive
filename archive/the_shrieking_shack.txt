[color=blue]The flag is flying, announcing complete independence;
the nation rises up because of the faith we have in this our Shack.
Let us always have devotion to love our Great Islands.
We Shriekers are of one blood.
We Shriekers are of one world.
On these Islands we were born; these Islands brought us up.
May luck always help us;
Let us always have the firm resolve to love our fatherland, love our religion and the world.
The flag is flying.
From the Thirteenth of February the Nation rises up.
Our Islands are lined up: [nation=noflag+short]Piggetrea[/nation] and [nation=noflag+short]Nelusburg[/nation], [nation=noflag+short]Seijou[/nation] and [nation=noflag+short]Rosaya[/nation].
Let us always have devotion to love our Great Islands.[/color]
