All WA members are required to endorse the current WA Delegate upon entry, and no other nation. Punishments may occur such as a warning or ejection.

Please note that three warnings lead to an ejection, and then a ban.

Please notify the WA Delegate, Vice-Delegate or Security Delegate if you have an alternate account.

Words of disrespect or anger is strongly discouraged.
