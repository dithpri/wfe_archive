ALRIGHT LISTEN UP YA SCURVY DOGS
I finally managed to get the rest of North Mia under control and it will be where all my nations will be placed! Yer more than welcome to join, but a warning- it is very cold. It snows like half of the year here. Yes, we do have summer. Also, no World Assembly happenings here. Or else i&#39;ll be forced to eat you.
