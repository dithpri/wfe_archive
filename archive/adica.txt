Adica is a newly founded region. Founded by a small group of natives who, after years of war, agreed to a peace and founded a new nation named Radiolans. They have begun exploring this vast new land with the hopes of creating a new world, open to all people and nations. If you would like to contribute to the creation of Adica, please apply for citizenship here.
