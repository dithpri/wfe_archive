The United Confederacy of Fascist Nations (UCFN), is a region populated with nations who&#39;s current government is in a Fascist state. This includes all forms of Fascism (Italian Fascism, Strasserism, National Socialism, Neo-Fascism, Clerical Fascism, etc). Democratic Fascism is welcome too but not encouraged. All Democratic Fascist nations will eventually have to join the rest of the nations and give up democracy.
