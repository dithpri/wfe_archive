The United Confederacy of Fascist Nations (UCFN), is a region populated with nations who&#39;s current government is in a Fascist state. This includes all forms of Fascism (Italian Fascism, Strasserism, National Socialism, Neo-Fascism, Clerical Fascism, etc). Democratic Fascism is welcome too but not encouraged. All Democratic Fascist nations will eventually have to join the rest of the nations and give up democracy. UCFN exists in a alternate reality where the Soviet Union never fell and East and West Germany never reunited. East Germany took the name Germany and joined the Soviet Union. West Germany became The United Confederacy of Fascist Nations.
