The United Confederacy of Fascist Nations (UCFN), is a region populated with nations who&#39;s current government is in a Fascist state. This includes all forms of Fascism (Italian Fascism, Strasserism, National Socialism, Neo-Fascism, Clerical Fascism, etc). Democratic Fascism is welcome too but not encouraged. UCFN exists in a alternate reality where the Soviet Union never fell and East and West Germany never reunited. The UCFN is in constant conflict with United Nations, and there is tension brewing with The World Assembly. If you wish to join, send a telegram to the founding nation, Romeres.
