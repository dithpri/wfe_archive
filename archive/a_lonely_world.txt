[b][u]WE ARE WORKING ON RESTORING THE REGION, STAND BY[/u][/b]

For anyone still active in the region, we are working on repairing the damage. Visit the sealed discord channel for details, until then, please ignore the World Assembly delegate, he has been stripped of any administrative power.

We have decided that it is a bad idea to leave this region without a password, but we still want to be friendly. All nations that wish to join us are to contact our leader, [nation]Citoro[/nation].

We apologise for the inconvenience.
