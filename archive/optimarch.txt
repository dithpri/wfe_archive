Optimarch was founded as a breakaway region by nations seeking order, logic, and efficiency over chaos and ideology. Born from a coalition of technocrats known as the Order Initiative, it became a region where governance is guided by data, merit, and productivity. Efficiencia, a founding member, helped shape its identity as a hub of calculated, optimized rule. Today, Optimarch is known for stability, precision, and its relentless pursuit of a better system.
