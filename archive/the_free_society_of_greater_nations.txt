Salutations! What you see before you is a mighty global society, which values sovereignty and freedom for its members before all else. Nevermore shall you go unrepresented, ignored, or mistreated by an imposing regional government. 

Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness! These are our ideals - the very foundation of the Free Society!
