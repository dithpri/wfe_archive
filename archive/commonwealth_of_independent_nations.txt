Upon joining, a nation will be able to vote on issues of the time. This is not an anti-world assembly region, all nations belonging will have to submit to WA laws if they are a member. Members of this region will vote on bills that any joiner can propose without backing. Votes are via a forum that I will make at some point. I hope to see you join and help the commonwealth grow. Also, if an invasion is attempted, all members must support the commonwealth by any means necessary.
