[b]Welcome to the Commonwealth of Independent Nations![/b]

The Commonwealth of Independent Nations (CIN) was founded to grow a laid-back role-play environment where everyone, regardless of ideology or skill, could come together and have a good time. We though aren&#39;t a region that treats its members like numbers. We are members of a vibrant community that&#39;s been growing for two years.
