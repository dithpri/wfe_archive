   The UCR is a strictly anti-fascist, anti-imperialist, and anti-capitalist region altogether. We do not seek aggression against nations just for being capitalist, but we will aid any revolution in the name of socialism and communism. 
   We are not authoritarian. In fact, that is the exact opposite of our goals.
   Recently, our agenda has reached out to include finding common understanding of opinions between capitalists, socialists, and communists. This is to make people more accepting of each other, and to make conflicts over opinion less common.
   Our region cannot accomplish its goals without more members, so please join us now!
