Welcome to the UCR! We are peaceful Socialist and Communist Nations. However, peaceful as we are, there are Fascist nations which threaten to destroy the peace and freedom of the world, and as such, we do what we must to protect not only those virtues, but life as we know it. If we do not fight, we shall be overtaken. We must fight to progress. But only when necessary.
&amp;quot;Never pull the trigger first.&amp;quot;
