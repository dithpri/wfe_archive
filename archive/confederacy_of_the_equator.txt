Our nations may be weak, bathed in a history of bloodshed, but we have something no one else does - true freedom, and faith to guide us forward. Many have come to the shores of our nations, looking to plunder, pillage and rape. We have finally put an end to that. Some may condemn the strong hand we have employed to bring our great people into the modern world. But they are the very same nations that dominated us for so long. All we have to say to them - &quot;Blood, faith, and tears for our people&quot;.
