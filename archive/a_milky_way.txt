The Milky Way is a galaxy, a big one, currently home to a few nations but several more are undiscovered.

[strike]Private[/strike] Personal region of [nation]Republics of the Solar Union[/nation] but everyone else is welcome to visit. All embassy requests as long as the region isn&#39;t lead by a governor or delegate I consider aggressive or an enemy are accepted.

A region for those who enjoy science fiction, A Milky Way is centered around outer space. Specifically, interstellar empires and the like. Stuff Isaac Asimov would probably write about. Anyone is welcome. Hopefully, you like sci-fi and related concepts. Because if you do, this is a good place for you. We have active Roleplays down in the forums, even if they are not necessarily region-canon.
