[b]welcome the nations of Aeuvurious[/b]

We are an RP-based region where the setting is partially inspired by the witch trials doing the end of the 1600-hundreds. Doing roleplay each nation will choose to be either a regular human or a magician. No trials as we know them from the 17th century are obviously allowed to take place and we expect the NS rules and the rules of the region to be followed by the players.

of course, whether a nation from the opposite faction is considered to be friend or foe is up to you but do it within the rules of the NS webpage and the region itself :)&#39;

enjoy

PS: Rp will take place in the regional message board to make it easier for everyone
