Welcome to the Southern Pacific. A non-feeder region established no April 28, 2013. This region was established as a haven for new nations or old to have a primary say in the construction of a region&amp;#39;s constitution, laws, and influence in the world. Many regions have been established for years leaving some new users lost as to the full process of nation building. The main goal is to have an introductory relationship to all aspects of NationStates so please aid and encourage others on making this a habitable pleasant region.
