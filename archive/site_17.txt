Site-17 is the second largest Foundation facility, primarily focused on the containment and study of low-risk humanoid entities, although the Site has additional capacities for the containment of inanimate objects, non-humanoid creatures, and higher risk anomalies. As per its main focus, Site-17&#39;s permanent staff includes a large number of medical and psychiatric professionals, to deal with the unique physical and psychological needs of both the contained anomalies and the on-site staff working in this challenging environment.[/i]
