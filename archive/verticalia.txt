Verticalia is primarily made up of sheer cliffs.
It contains such diverse ethnic groups as the Gabblers who migrated and became the Meeboians. Recent archaeology digs indicate that that the someplace or someone named QC is in their distance past. The other ethnic group is the Dumbrellians. Not much is known about this group but archeologists remain hopeful that further digs (and further funding) will provide them with answers.
