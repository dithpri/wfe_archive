[b][color=green]This region has been visited by the Eastern Pacific Soverign Army! As part of UPPERCUT in N-Day[sup]3[/sup], we feel obligated to revisit UPPERCUT and it&#39;s old AA-nuking glory. We at [region]The East Pacific[/region] always believe in leaving someplace you visit in a better shape than when we found it, so take it upon ourselves to beautify the irradiated, desolated regions left behind.[/color][/b]
