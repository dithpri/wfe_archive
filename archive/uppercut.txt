[color=darkred][i][b]In the dark of the update[/b] I was tabbing and refreshing
And the evil I saw was as bad as can be
It scared me out of my wits!
A region falling to bits!
Then I opened my eyes and [b]the nightmare was here[/b]!

I was once the most moralist man in all of Pacifica
When the Imperialists betrayed me they made a mistake
My raid made each of them pay
But one little region got away
[b]Little Feeder, beware[/b], we&#39;re awake!

In the dark of the update, [b]evil will find them[/b]
In the dark of the update, [b]just before dawn[/b]
Revenge will be sweet
When the raid is complete
In the dark of the update, [b]they&#39;ll be gone[/b]![/i][/color]
