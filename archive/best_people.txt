[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to ask themselves a very important question. 
How wet is [color=blue]water[/color]? 
The only way to find out was to visit regions and gather opinions on how wet water is! The hawks flew to the core of the earth, the coasts of continents, and even to a realm where there was only [color=red]fire[/color]! 
After much research, the scientist hawks found an answer. 

How wet is [color=blue]water[/color]?
- Yes
