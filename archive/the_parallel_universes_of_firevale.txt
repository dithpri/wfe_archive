The nation of Firevale, a small island in the East Pacific, is a curious one. Through some anomaly, some experiment, some purely random chance, the location has a massive temporal error. Various different Firevales - one an economy-crushing left-wing archipelago, another an insane feudal nightmare bent on reducing the average lifespan to 14, yet another a militaristic dystopia focused only on world domination - intersect in the shattered spatiotemporal region, a unique location to view what other versions of the world could have been.
