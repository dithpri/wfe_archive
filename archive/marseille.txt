With its terracotta-roofed buildings the colour of cracked wheat, ripened apricot and blanched almond scattered around the mistral-whipped sea, Marseille is infused with a perceptible and irrepressible energy.

This gritty, grimy and gloriously real city &#150; France&#146;s oldest, and largest after Paris &#150; isn&#146;t gentrified like its Proven&ccedil;al counterparts. But its rough-and-tumble edginess, wailing sirens and litter-swirled streets, and its coastal corniches, chicaning around rocky inlets, coves and sun-baked beaches, are chock-a-block with treasures.
