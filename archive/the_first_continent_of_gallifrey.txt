[b][i]&quot;On one planet among seven, circling a dual star system, there lies a golden empire. Unaware of the bounds of time...&quot;[/i][/b]

The planet [region]Gallifrey[/region] has long been a part of this universe, and the Timelords are now a highly advanced race. In many times they have been lead in many parts, or as one. Today they are split into empires by continents, [region]The First Continent of Gallifrey[/region] being the site of the old capital of the planet, [nation=short]The High Citadel[/nation] as well as the one of the lushest mainlands on the planet, [nation=short]The Diplomatic Monarchy of Finnland[/nation] (no reference to the place on [region]Earth[/region]).

The rest of the continent, and, indeed, the planet, are yet to be inhabited. There will be more to come from [color=green]The Planet Gallifrey[/color].
