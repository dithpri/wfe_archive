The Lower Commonwealth is a collection of nation-states which may be considered lesser-off or undeveloped by major world superpowers. The goal of The Lower Commonwealth is too help these nation-states by sticking together economically and in times of emergency military intervention. Together we are somewhat Isolationist, Democratic, and the likes. We believe in great civil rights, and even greater political rights, at the expense of some industry. Pro Recta Sta!
