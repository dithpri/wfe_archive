The Kaust Paradise was first founded in 7000 BCE and got run over by neighbouring tribes. It hid low in the shadows letting nations like Mesopotamia rule the world until in 2009 AD where it struck out with its dwindling numbers and quickly became a technologically advanced haven. We offer supreme civil rights and political freedom. And an excelling economy. Whats important is the People. GLORY TO KAUST!
