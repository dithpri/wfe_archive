The Kaust Paradise was first founded in 7000 BCE and got runover by nabouring tribes. It hid low in the shadows letting nations like mesopotamia rule the world until in 2009 AD where it struck out with its dwindling numbers and quickly became a technologically advanced haven. We offer supreme civil rights and political freedom. It does not matter how our economy is! Whats important is the People. GLORY TO KAUST
