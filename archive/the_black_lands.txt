In the mists of time, before the notion of peace there was a land created by the Gods, to store their left over stone tablets for commandments and stuff. This land slowly was forged through war and oppression into the lands we know today as &amp;quot;The Black Lands&amp;quot;. Sadly all the stone tablets were lost to the ruins and remain undiscovered. Its a shame really that the gods didn&amp;#39;t just beam all the knowledge into our minds instead of a select few who had to write it out, but i guess an all knowing god can &amp;#39;t truly know everything.....
