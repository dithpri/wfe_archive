Welcome to the [region]Empire of Christian Nations[/region], in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ!

The Empire of Christian Nations is an emerging conservative, Christian region, dedicated to the spread and preservation of the gospel and standing on the truth of God&amp;#39;s Word.

The Empire of Christian Nations had its roots in the original League of Christian Nations. On Independence Day 2014, Markus of Greater Israelia felt necessary to abandon the LCN, tired of the apostasy and liberal Christian attitude characterizing the region.

The ECN, as it should be called, is a serious region and, because of our gospel foundations, refuses to establish embassies with regions that do not take God&amp;#39;s word seriously.
