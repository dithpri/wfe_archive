This region is strictly against the WA! A recent WA vote against banning factory farming was our breaking point, and now we desire to occupy the button they currently hold to the left.

There is never one way or answer, and choosing a door closes a door. In other words, making a choice is detrimental to other potential choices. So what of the voiceless, what of the non-human, in the hyper real echo chamber of human to human speech.
