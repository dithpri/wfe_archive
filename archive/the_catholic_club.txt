A place for all Catholics to join together and connect with one another while having fun playing a game we all enjoy. Us Catholics have had a bad reputation throughout history and so the world continues to look down on us for our Church leaders&#39; past mistakes. But what they don&#39;t realize is that our Church leaders are and have always been human. But also let us not forget that the founder of our Church was Jesus who never sinned or made mistakes. Let us help our Church have more of a powerful hand in the world&#39;s culture by doing just this little small thing in our world that can do great things even though it&#39;s such a small act.

&quot;Go forth and set the world on fire.&quot; -St. Ignatius of Loyola
