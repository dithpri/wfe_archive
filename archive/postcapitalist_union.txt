[b]The Post-Capitalist Union[/b]
--------------------------------
The PCU is a free democratic association of former moderate Soviet states and left-leaning democracies that reject the current capitalist and consumerist system as well as the growth-oriented economy.

Our ideology is largely based on post-growth economics and its focus on people&#39;s welfare rather than pure GDP growth. Unlike other classical communist ideologies and regions, we reject authoritarian states and focus on democracy and full freedom of speech. We represent liberal and progressive values in all areas of private life, in migration and foreign policy, as well as in domestic policy.
