The Bad Hairline Tax Act
The great and powerful leader of The Legendary Super America was bored and decided to create a tax for those with bad hairlines. This act requires those with bad hairlines to pay an extra 57.9% tax on top of flat tax.
&quot;If thou hast a crusty hairline, thou shalt henceforth pay 57.9% thine income, until thou decides to fixeth thine hairline, or thou shalt face the Gallows!&quot; -Zach The Werezombie Ghostpire
