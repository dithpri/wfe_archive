[b]A Region Proudly Under The Quadumvirate of [nation]Coria New[/nation], [nation]Wangul[/nation], [nation]Palractus[/nation], and [nation]Imperial Siber[/nation]![/b]

We do not seek subjugation of the native [i]Furries[/i], only loyalty. They may do whatever they desire on the RMB(provided it&#39;s allowed within NationState&#39;s TOS) but may [b]not[/b] attempt to revolt against their new and rightful government. If they do so, their community will be razed.


Happy Canada Day +8
