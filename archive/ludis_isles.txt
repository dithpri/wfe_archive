Territorial conquest will be conducted via population milestones every 25 million people, after 250 million the rate at which territory is taken reduces to every subsequent 250 million.
in other words, at 100 million a nation will have 4 provinces, at 250 they will have 10 and at 2 billion they will have 17.
at 2.5 billion the rate will change once more to every subsequent 2.5 billion, obviously this is to prevent a ludicrous amount of territory going to old accounts.
