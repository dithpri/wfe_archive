Salutations from the Satanic Cathedral. Here reside practitioners of the Left-Hand Path and an independent congregation of Satanists (LaVeyan, Setian, Theistic, Luciferian, etc). We venerate and regard individuality with the highest precedence and advocate the rule: &amp;quot;Do unto others as they would do unto you.&amp;quot; We are proponents of personal sovereignty and responsibility, indulgence (intellectual and or carnal), strength over weakness, and knowledge over ignorance.
