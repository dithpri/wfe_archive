Welcome to the Infernal Empire, a dynamic community of Satanists, occultists, and practitioners of the Left-Hand path. Our primary objectives are to assist in establishing a resilient Satanic presence in Nation-States, promulgate cognizance of the Satanic philosophy to truly meritorious individuals and dispel misconstructions/false stereotypes about Satanism, and to of course combat religious fundamentalism and dogma.
We believe in radical individuality, indulgence (intellectual and carnal), undefiled wisdom, and self-deification. We advocate naturalism, Social Darwinism, Lex Talionis, and an amoral universe.
