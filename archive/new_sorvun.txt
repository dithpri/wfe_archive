[region]New Sorvun[/region] is a  nearly 5 year-old region that has witnessed and experienced a lot. Whether you&amp;#39;re a military mastermind, a scheming politician, the king of roleplaying, a savvy business mogul or simply a spamaholic, we have something for everyone (and a bit more).  Where everyone has a chance to join in and become part of an ever more close-knit community.
