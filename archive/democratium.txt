[b][color=red]On November 9, this region, once a harbor for capitalist and reactionary nations, was stormed by the Red Partisans of [region]The Communist Region[/region] and the [region]United Sovereign Socialist Republics[/region], in spite of defenders&amp;#39; pathetic efforts to save [region]Democratium[/region].

The invincible, unstopable fighting machine of the NS proletariat, the People&amp;#39;s Red Army, has once again demonstrated its complete superiority over the 1 man &amp;quot;army&amp;quot; of [region]Unity[/region] that came running at us with plastic swords and water guns.

Today&amp;#39;s victory was brought to you by:

Commander of mission- General [nation]Lipno[/nation]
Corporal [nation]Urzistan[/nation]
Private [nation]Tireseos[/nation]
Comrade [nation]Dalos[/nation][/b][/color]
