Hello everyone!  I&amp;#39;ve got a bit of an update for you concerning our regional forum.

It turns out someone had hacked my server and installed some malware and virus software.  I had to wipe everything on my server, so our forum&amp;#39;s programming has been deleted.  However, all of the data (posts, topics, etc) for our forum are still in existence.  I simply have to reinstall the forum, which will cost me $25.  So, if I ever must up $25 bucks that I&amp;#39;m willing to spend on this, then we&amp;#39;ll be back in business.

Just keeping you updated.  Feel free to message me.
