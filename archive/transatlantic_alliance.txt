[b][color=red][i][u]WELCOME TO THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE[/b][/color][/i][/u]

The Transatlantic Alliance as it is known today was formerly known as the [region]Trans_Atlantic_Alliance[/region], founded by [nation]the_hurricane_islands[/nation] in 2015. 

We are a small region focused primarily on casual play and invite any nation who shares this style of gameplay to join us.

No citizenship applications, no weird verification requirements, no outside forum. There will soon be a regional map and plot claims to follow shortly after. For those that enjoy interacting outside of NS, though not at all required, there will be a Discord server coming soon. Just finishing up the formatting and setup before publicizing it.
