[b][color=#000061]This very small region is located near Panama and Colombia. Hollowegian people adore their freedom of speech and expression. Holloway is bordered on three sides by ocean and on one sides by islands. Their relations with their neighbors to the east are neutral, while relations with neighbors to the south are stable. There are two major cities, Hollowaytown and Seaside City the largest of which is located in the east of the region. They are often troubled by tropical storms and shark attacks. Hollowegians are proud of their local attitude.[/color][/b]
