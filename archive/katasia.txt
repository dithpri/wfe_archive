Katasia is a long-established region noted for its quiet, backroom diplomancy among members. While there is no restriction on any nation becoming a UN member, it has been made clear that UN member nations and delegate nations have little influence on the region as a whole (Regional control restricted to founder, in other words).

Katasia is an allied region to Kattar with trade and military links.
