This land is not given; it is inherited. It speaks through the whisper of the wind, through the cry of the eagle, through the rhythm of the drum that calls us home. The forests remember our footprints, the mountains bear our names, and the waters reflect the truth that was never erased&#151;only buried beneath the silence of those who wished us gone. Here, in the sovereign land of Indijina, the ancestors walk beside us, and the future is forged in their memory.
