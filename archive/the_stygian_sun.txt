A totalitarian region where the nations within rule with absolute and utter power. Everything is controlled by the government; media, immigration, business. Tourism is non-existent. Happiness is known to none but the oldest.

There is only pain under the black sun 


&#147;If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face&#151;forever.&#148;

&amp;#8213; George Orwell, 1984
