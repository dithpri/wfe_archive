From the ashes, from the ruins, the Bloc of the Soviets arises once more. The splendors of the international proletariat and their joyous triumph over the fascist aggressors shall shine for all to see, our security from the imperialists who seek to overthrow our dear state shall be assured, and he freedoms hard won shall be preserved for eternity. 

Liberty, Equality Fraternity!
