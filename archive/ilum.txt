[b]This region is a territory of [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region][/b].

Ilum was originally founded on 19th June 2007. 

It was part of the LKE Empire from its founding. Emperor Lucius I commissioned Citizen Erased and Earl J. Grey as the first Governors-General; this is the only region in the history of the LKE Empire where the role of crown representative has been shared. The Governors-General promoted Ilum as the most liberal dominion within the Empire. Although Ilum is no longer home to an active community, it remains a territory of the LKE Empire.
