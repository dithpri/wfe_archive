[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] flew out to support a couple of up and coming Hawks in their studies and got a little carried away, having to finish up double speed to get the little Hawklings back to the nest in time for bed time. If you join our [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]discord[/url] please be mindful of the sleeping Hawklings and keep the noise down.
