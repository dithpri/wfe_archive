  &#134;&#134; Welcome, drifter!  &#134;&#134;

 Aboveground Dust is a tiny region of nations, established with the hope of spreading a little humor, making friends, and having as much fun as possible, along with  bringing together many different nations with different political and social views. We want our region to be as completely inclusive as possible, and each member will hold a very important role in decisions for our community.

We have so many opportunities for strong leaders to take charge right now,  along with creative people assisting with maintenance and establishment of the offsite forum!  Inquire with [nation]Naslae[/nation] or [nation]Canaphae[/nation]
