The Order of the Crow is an ancient brotherhood whose beliefs are set upon by an obscure creed. We are few, and we are vigilant. Wisdom whispers in the winds of change. Dark wings paint the minds of men. Only those who heed the Night&#39;s music may sit besides her Crows. The bloodied silence calls us forth into twilight.
