Fa prevaricator comrade!

We would welcome you to the great region of Da, but we find it unlikely that you have actually made it to the inhospitable and remote wastes.

If you have made it, congratulations! You have made it to the most glorious region in the world. Here, our nations have a strong belief in equality, compassion and unrelenting militarism. You should also not that there are two major sects to this great region. There are the native, socialist Da, named after their glorious homeland, and the deviant newcomers, who despite their misdirection, support the greater Da agenda. Which will you be?
