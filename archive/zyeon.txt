[i][color=teal]Zyeon is a mystical planet beyond dimensional boundaries, shaped by wandering celestials and ancient gods. It is home to immortal beings and diverse races&#151;elves, dwarves, orcs, dragons, humans, and many others. Magic pulses through its vast forests, deep oceans, rugged mountains, and golden plains, resembling Earth&#146;s geography but with layers of enchantment. Civilizations rise and fall in cycles of prophecy, divine will, and arcane power. Its skies are watched by two distant moons, and its lands are marked by ruins, sacred groves, and ancient strongholds. Zyeon stands as a nexus of myth and reality, where time flows strangely and forgotten legends live on.[/color][/i]
