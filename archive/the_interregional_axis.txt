[b]The Interregional Axis (IRX)[/b], otherwise known as the Co-Belligerent Axis, Co-Belligerent Army, or the Interregional Army, is a proposed coalition of ideologically cooperative regions promoting unified defensive and offensive military action within a combined and orderly ranking system filled with the member regions&#39; most prominent leaders and military officers. Unlike failed coalition forces of the past, the IRX seeks not to trample over the sovereignty of it&#39;s member regions, but instead seeks to form a single, co-belligerent military entity that incorporates all state, private, party and paramilitary militias it&#39;s member regions host.
