[b]The Interregional Axis (IRX)[/b], otherwise known as the Co-Belligerent Axis, or the Interregional Army, was a proposed coalition of ideologically cooperative regions promoting unified defensive and offensive military action within a combined and orderly ranking system filled with the member regions&#39; most prominent leaders and military officers. Unlike failed coalition forces of the past, the IRX sought not to trample over the sovereignty of it&#39;s member regions, but instead to form a single, co-belligerent military entity that incorporates it&#39;s member regions.

On November 1st, 2020, the IRX formally dissolved following the ceasation of hostilities for it&#39;s member states. Further interregional cooperation is spearheaded by [region]Farkasfalka[/region].
