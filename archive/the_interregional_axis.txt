[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region was the headquarters of a former major interregional alliance including J o J and several of it&#39;s closest allies. However, it was eventually dissolved and this region nearly fell into the hands of evil, but [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation] showed up in the nick of time to plant the [b][color=green]Green Banner[/color][/b] on the hill before anybody else got to it!
