A region home to [b][color=red]freedom[/color][/b] and [b][color=blue]democracy[/color][/b]! Despite our name, we are not completely meme-oriented. We broke away from the Doritos Clan after they treated us unfairly, leading to their region&#39;s collapse. Their former leader still threatens and taunts us today.
