A region home to [b][color=red] freedom [/color][/b] and [b][color=blue] democracy[/color][/b]! Despite our name, we are not completely meme-oriented. We broke away from the Doritos Clan after they treated us unfairly, leading to their region&#39;s collapse. Their former leader still threatens and taunts us today.

I&#39;m sure you will have a grand time with us. We appreciate guests and new members. And to those who intend to join us, welcome to [color=orange][b]The Free Republics of Memes[/b]![/color]

Make sure to join us on Discord and endorse our glorious leaders: [nation]Harlanio[/nation] and [nation]USSR Round II[/nation]. BTW one is more glorious than the other
