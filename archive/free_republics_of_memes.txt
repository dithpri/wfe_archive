Hey [nation]Harlanio[/nation] ;)

This region serves as a memorial to the [b]corrupt dictatorship[/b] in the [i]old FRM[/i]. After the people rose up and liberated the region, the former founder refused to peacefully return. As a result, this region is on lock-down until further notice. Please telegram [nation]USSR Round II[/nation] with inquiries.

Warm regards.
-The Liberators
