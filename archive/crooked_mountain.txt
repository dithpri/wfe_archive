A place of abundant beauty and resources. We all shall unite under the great colossal pinnacle of our home. A home for our allies, a nightmare for our enemies. 

We strive for everlasting peace and a safe haven for those who choose to call this place theirs, although we do not practice many regional gatherings we have zero tolerance for oppressive nations and will take military action if needed. 

We will communicate and welcome all, reason with some, and avail few.
