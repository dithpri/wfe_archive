This region is dedicated to [region]The Internationale[/region]&amp;#39;s project for the restoration of its historical record. We intend to collaborate in writing a record of The Internationale&amp;#39;s previously lost history, from April 2012 to the present day, to be officially approved by comrades in that region.
