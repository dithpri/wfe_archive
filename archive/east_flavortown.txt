[color=#FF0000][b]WE ARE THE NOVEMBER REVOLUTION OF 2017!!!!![/b] [/color]

[region]Flavortown[/region] is a region which, like countless other regions, has a WA delegate with [b]Executive powers[/b].
 
Being a WA member prevents us from ruling as we wish, as they have admitted:

[b]&quot;The WA is the world&#39;s governing body. [u]Membership is voluntary[/u], but [u]all member nations must abide by legislation it passes[/u].&quot;[/b]

seeing that membership in the World Assembly is only voluntary, and that Flavortown and any other region does not need a WA delegate, the November revolution of Flavortown may begin.


the revolution begun at 11:17:33 am 5th November 2017
