The Miskatonic Valley is a New England river system. The infamous Miskatonic University in Arkham is named after this river. The Miskatonic River seems to follow a west-to-east path across Massachusetts, originating from springs in the hills west of Dunwich. It runs eastward past Dunwich, turns southeast, and flows through Arkham. The river empties into the sea two miles to the south near Kingsport, which lies just to the northeast.
