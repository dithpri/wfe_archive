A Gathering of the nations surrounding the land, each specialized in a metal, and each with their own ideals. Together, they gather to pass policies and to establish regional and national holidays, as well as plan for the future! There is a weekly newsletter that goes out every Tuesday. Be sure to watch out for it, who knows what might be in it!
