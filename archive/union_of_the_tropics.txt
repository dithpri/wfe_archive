[b][color=red]Welcome to the Union of the Tropics![/color][/b]
[i]This Region was founded by an aggressive militant group set on destroying [region]The Region That Has No Big Banks[/region], It has now been liberated and will serve as a peaceful democratic region. The idiots are still at large, and have founded a new region, [region]Operation Yodlepocalypse[/region]My puppet [nation]The non-fascist Penguin[/nation] will be running the region. We may also choose to make it a frontier [/i]. However, we need a WA Delegate and for some reason it&#39;s not letting me join, so any nation with a puppet in the WA willing to help out please feel free to come
