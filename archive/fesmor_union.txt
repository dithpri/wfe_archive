In a remote place of the earth, an Union of mostly Totalitarian nations thrive in peace. They all follow common objectives, share the same agenda, but of course they also have some conflicts. The two major nations [nation=long]BioTeckar[/nation] and [nation=long]Lorgha[/nation], once decided to share their forces, founding the Fesmor Union, an alliance based on reaching the political agendas of both countries. Later on, minor nations, from the Askain continent and even outside, were granted the permission to join the Union as long as the two founding leaders see fit. Now... the future is waiting to be written.
