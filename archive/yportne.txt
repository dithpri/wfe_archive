Malice lurks around every corner, and never sleeps. Dread it. Run from it. Malice arrives all the same. Embrace malice or malice will be forced upon you. Malice never dies. Raider Unity, Maintain a [strike]Founder[/strike] Governor, Sign a Treaty. Praise the Overseer! What is malicious may never die. May malice be with you.
