The [b]Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party[/b], officially the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is the executive committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

Currently, the bureau is a group of 24 top officials who oversee the party and central government. The politburo is headed by the general secretary. Unlike the politburos of other communist parties, the CCP Politburo subdelegates many of its powers to the smaller Politburo Standing Committee. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
