In 1856 a new continent was discovered by an arms trader heading torwards Japan. He returned with news of the great discovery. People began flocking to the continent immediately. Approximately 12 million people lived on the continent, free of government from 1857-1945. They only explored 60% of the entire continent. After a failed Japanese invasion and the close of WWII, a constitutional republic was formed. Later in the 1950&#39;s, the USSR became close allies and trading partners of the government. The Soviet influence was so strong that a centralist revolution occured in 1957 and a new government was created. It was a dictatorship known as Astochiak. Astochiak remains a dictatorship and controls 60% of the continent as of 2016.
