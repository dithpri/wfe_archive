A combination of nation states of the same origin, each with their own distinct government system and source of national pride. These sister states are allies, even if some are more reluctant than others. One main conflict within the states is the attempted interference of some states with others, as there is such a diversity in beliefs and political views. To remedy this, citizens are free to move from one state to the other with relative ease; there has been an agreement in which the other states may vote to &quot;rescue&quot; citizens from one state if they wish to leave but are not allowed by their home state. This, however, is a rarely needed safety measure.
