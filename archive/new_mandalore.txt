Welcome to New Mandalore!

&quot;Strength is Life
 For the strong have the right to rule
 Honor is Life
 For with no honor, one may as well be dead
 Loyalty is Life
 For without one&#39;s clan one has no purpose
 Death is Life
 One should die as they have lived
 On a field of blood and sweat
 Is where we lay our weary heads&quot;
