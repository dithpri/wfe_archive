We are a fast growing region with an aim to be as adaptive as possible to make your country successful and every member that belongs to our region. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact any administrative officer. The most loyal members and best suited will have a higher opportunity to gain a seat or a promotion in administration if that is their goal. Countries will be required to follow the rules of the set laws but each law will not be set in action until appropriate voting, examination, and changing have taken place. Any member of the region is free to propose a new policy to the region to be set into action.
