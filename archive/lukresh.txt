Once again,  Welcome to Lukresh!

Our regions name originally came from a short story of a dignified elf rogue who decided to fight to protect the land he once called his home. Though that character was reluctant to protect Lukresh, nations that reside here wish to keep it safe, whether it be through having the technology of Space Lasers or even an obnoxious amount of defense spending, do what you can to protect your land. We also ask that each resident have a detailed personality and stylized look for their Leader and a name for Leader&#39;s pet (which would be your national animal).
