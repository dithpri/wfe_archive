CARON is a fun, small, and loving region with a few ground rules... 
 1. please don&#39;t be mean
 2. don&#39;t double post on the message board just edit it
 and
 3. have fun!
also don&#39;t feel like your forced to do anything if you don&#39;t want to do something you don&#39;t have to.

The main officers ([nation]Boaciamper[/nation] and [nation]Ueclaya[/nation]) are liberalist, but any ideological beliefs are welcome here!
