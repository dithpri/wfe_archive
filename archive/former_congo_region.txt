The instability of the former Nation of Congo lead to a weak government around the same time as parts of Africa became increasingly viewed as &amp;quot;the new world&amp;quot; a market in land boomed as the dissatisfied left their home nations to take advantage of the political vacuum and the freedom there in, this was a messy but lucrative time as swarths of land were auctioned off, some times to adventurous co-ops and idealist hippies sometimes to private companies or the extremely wealthy. the allocation of land wasn&amp;#39;t the most organised, time has since passed and societies became set in their ways. As it stands the FCR is a hodge-podge of nations with a large market in holidays and social experiences for the (very!) adventurous.
