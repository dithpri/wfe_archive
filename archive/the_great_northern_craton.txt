Welcome to The Great Northern Craton!

It is a land of stunning beauty and endless plains. It is a land of the free-governing and generally democratic nation(s) that welcomes diversity and civil rights, also economy and safety. 

The Great Northern Craton is a large and generally flat area. It is lined with mountains in the East and South and seas in the North and West. There are large sea-like lakes in Southwest.

All are welcome! Just come...it will be one hell of a party!
