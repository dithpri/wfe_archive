[/b][quote=north_sonovia;43729869]Okay, but are you talking about the region&#39;s tag, &quot;anti-fascist&quot;? 

Or how I described myself as &quot;anti-fascist&quot;? 

Or do you actually like Antifa? Because they&#39;re clearly a bunch of radical idiots and rioters, who are actually racist themselves for exploiting a movement &quot;standing up for black people&quot; and using it to loot and burn [i]black and other colored-owned businesses.[/i][/quote]
