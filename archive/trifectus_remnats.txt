We, of the former Trifectus Remnats, sincerely apologize for recent errors regarding our region on the international field. There have been too many &#147;joke nations&#148; entering the region, and the even more embarrassing typo in our old region&#146;s name. That is why we have constructed a new, better, zenith region: Zenith Trifecta. In order to be taken more seriously we, the Trifecta Council, have implemented stricter axioms regarding domestic and international affairs. We request that all regions allied with us withdraw their embassy from The Trifectus Remnats and relocate them to The Zenith Trifecta. If you have any questions please feel free to contact Proxsha or General Vostag for more information. We thank you for your understanding.
