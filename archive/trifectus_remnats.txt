*We are the remnants of the former Tribulus Imperium.

*We act as one nation (each &amp;quot;nation&amp;quot; on the list is a municipal state), ergo, if you declare war against one of us, you have declared war against all of us.

*We mainly communicate through telegrams, not the regional wall.

*Important People:
First in Command: Lord Cazeroe Rohan Ketler (Proxsha)
Second in Command: Supreme F&uuml;hrer Strauffenburg (General Vostag)
