Asten is a Closed Knit Community,broken out of a region after our declaration of Independence on 3rd of April 2022.We are an authoritarian democratic state,trying to do the best for the people that are here now,and that are to come later.
We want to grow and become one of the most influential regions on NS.
LONG LIVE ASTEN AND THE ASTENIAN PEOPLE!

Everyone is respected and accepted regardless of Ethnicity,race,language,sexual orientation etc.

For the security of the Region,please [b]ENDORSE[/b] our WA Delegate! Thanks!

Everything takes place on our discord (https://discord.gg/3zZvDnv5JU) So feel free to head there if you want to take part in activities like elections,possibly a roleplay,laughs and hangout.
