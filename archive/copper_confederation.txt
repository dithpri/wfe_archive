Copper, copper will someday be worth the value of gold and when that day comes we the Copper Confederation will be prepared and rewarded for are intelligence. We urge others to follow in out footsteps are divine footsteps. You too may get in on the action, better be prepared to mine that &amp;quot;gold&amp;quot;!

Copper is used to create many things such as new age wiring, coins, bullets, motors, musical instruments, brass, and bronze. Copper is also very heat and electricity conductive and used in naval ships because it doesn&amp;#39;t corrode! Without copper we couldn&amp;#39;t make bells to warn us when the Reladonians were coming or the angry mobs of the Bessie Empire not to mention the key rule copper played in the fall of the 10th Era Moubarak Empire.

Believe in Copper!
