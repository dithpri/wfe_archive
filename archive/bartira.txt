Bartira is a small island composed of three nations- Tilasu, Shilva and the Federated States of Islace. Tilasu dominates the island, while Shilva holds onto a small part. However, Shilva is by far the richer nation. The FSI recently arrived, fleeing persecution from a nearby state. Tilasu gave them a small piece of land, grudgingly but wishing to avoid conflict with the empathetic Shilva.
