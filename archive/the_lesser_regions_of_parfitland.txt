In my infinite wisdom, I recognised that the world needed a place where intellectual brilliance and ethical clarity could thrive without the mundane constraints that hamper lesser nations. Thus, I conceived The Lesser Regions of Parfitland, a nation where reason, progress, and justice are not mere ideals but the very fabric of society. My vision was to create a utopia where every citizen could reach their fullest potential under my benevolent guidance. This was done with a minimum of hubris or fuss. Callooh! Callay! Glorious day, may all sing praise to this eternal act of selflessness and humility!
