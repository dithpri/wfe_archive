[b][color=194b19]The East Pacific Sovereign Armada[/color] has a simple policy: No quarter for Fascists.[/b]

When we saw that this fascist region was attempting to be reinforced, we immediately mobilised to blow them out of the water!
You can hide, but we&#39;ll find you. 
So run, and run if you can, for we will find you, and we will hunt you down.

Special thanks to our friends from the [b]Bankless Liberation Force[/b], [b]Legio Pacifica[/b] and [b]Anti Fairy Pact[/b] for joining in on this bash!
