Avalon (/&amp;#712;&aelig;v&amp;#601;&amp;#716;l&amp;#594;n/; Latin: Insula Avallonis, Welsh: Ynys Afallon, Ynys Afallach; literally meaning &quot;the isle of fruit [or apple] trees&quot;), sometimes written Avallon or Avilion, is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend. It first appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#39;s 1136 Historia Regum Britanniae (&quot;The History of the Kings of Britain&quot;) as the place where King Arthur&#39;s sword Excalibur was forged and later where Arthur was taken to recover from being gravely wounded at the Battle of Camlann.
