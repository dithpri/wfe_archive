In the not so far-future ,a great war caused chaos across every continent and changed the world as we knew it. With the maps reshaped,and many new nations created the threat of war is higher then it has ever been. In order to have some sort of peace,Iceland (the last surviving nation of the old world),created the Icelandic Neutral Zone,which gave ever nation a place to counsel,and disuse foreign relations in peace. 
....Will the world be saved? Will there ever be peace? Thats for you to decide.
