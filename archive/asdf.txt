ASDF dates back to the misty era of prehistory. Sir ASDF was the leader of a small group of hunter-gatherers and decided that there was more to life than smashing bones together and picking berries. He decided that he would create a group of peoples that stretched beyond the boundaries of his kin. He reached out to his neighbors, and ASDF was born. Civilizations rose and fell, but ASDF remained. Through it all, ASDF held true the values of freedom, and representation. 

Why anyone would ever want to challenge the might of ASDF, no one can tell for sure, but let it be known that ASDF will not take opposition lightly.
