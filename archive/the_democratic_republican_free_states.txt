The Democratic Republican Free States was formed out of the tumult of the Icelandic-Patagonian Conflict of 2516. An independent faction led by John Graham Mellor, a world advocate for Democracy and representation, the Democratic-Republicans of the Northern Hemisphere created a separate, self-governing state founded upon the basic ideals of the European Union.

The D.R.F.S. utilizes ethical and sensible standards in maintaining the governed regions with inherent freedom.
