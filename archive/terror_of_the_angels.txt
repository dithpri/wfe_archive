[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their friends in [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=valle_de_arena]The Sekhmet Legion[/url] and [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] decided to embrace an old stereotype, and kick down some sandcastles! 

We went from region to region kicking down every sandcastle we could find until we found one particularly big fenda sandcastle, and kicked that down as well.

If you too would like to kick down fenda sandcastles, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
