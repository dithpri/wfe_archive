The Lowlands is famous for its vast mountain ranges and low-cutting valleys, which etch intricately into the surrounding land. Thick forestry of deciduous trees line the border of the region, creating a beautiful frame for the area. The most notable landmarks include the Lake of Iridescence, which sits in the center of the region in Young Valley, which is known for lush wildlife and plant life. The two large mountains creating this valley are known as the Twins, as they look uncannily like each other.
