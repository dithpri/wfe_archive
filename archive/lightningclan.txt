[color=brown][region]LightningClan[/region] is a region dedicated to Warrior Cats fans. Send [nation=noflag]Oakfire[/nation] a telegram if you would like the password to join and I will quiz you on Warriors before allowing you. My [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=chipmunklandia]Commander in Chipmunk[/url] can also help if I am on hiatus.

Other than that, this is kind of just for fun. I enjoy having [i]my own stuff[/i], whether it&#39;s on a nation simulation game or a virtual dog breeding sim. I don&#39;t know, or frankly care, if tons of people join. This is just kind of an outlet for me to both talk about new Warriors stuff and to be ridiculous without caring.[/color]
