[I]After dozens of nations became inactive within a matter of days the [region]imperialist battalions[/region] began a slow downward spiral. Finally on the 16th of May 2017 at 23:57:55 BST Chancellor M. Weekes of [nation=short+noflag]the defrovan republic[/nation] ceremoniously gave up his democratically held power over the [region]imperialist battalions[/region], symbolically ending the region&#39;s brief yet colourful history as a semi-prominent raiding region.

After a series of raids from communist and &quot;anti-fascist&quot; regions the [region]imperialist battalions[/region] was finally forced to enforce a password so it at die in peace.[/I]
