For all retired puppets and/or retired main nations. May those who have passed find eternal raiding joy.
[i]O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;&nbsp;
The ship has weather&amp;#39;d every rack, the prize we sought is won;&nbsp;
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,&nbsp;
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:&nbsp;

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;&nbsp;
Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills; 10&nbsp;
For you bouquets and ribbon&amp;#39;d wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;&nbsp;
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;&nbsp;
Here Captain! dear father!&nbsp;
This arm beneath your head;&nbsp;
It is some dream that on the deck,&nbsp;
You&amp;#39;ve fallen cold and dead.[/i]&nbsp;
