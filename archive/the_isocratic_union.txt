The Isocratic Union is a form of governmental organization where all member nations have equal political power. The Isocratic Union expands from the legal right of isonomia, or equality of political rights, to political and economic systems, from equality of law to equality in governance. To achieve this, the Isocratic Union both combines and expands features of liberal rights and those in democratic rule. With protections embodied through constitutions, thus not being subject to the vagaries of popular opinion, the Isocratic Union is secular, republican, and does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, etc.
