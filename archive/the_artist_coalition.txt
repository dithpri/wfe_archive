A place for artists to gather and share their artwork and get feedback, where you&amp;#39;ll get to see Artwork you may have not gotten the chance too, talk about your favorite artist and artwork, discuss Art Theory &amp;amp; Art History.

I encourage you all to come and share your art whatever the form painting, drawing, sculptor, computer art, poetry, anything and everything is welcome. From the Students to the Professionals, from the hobbyist to the thing you made in art class, come share your art with us![/color]
