Nuclear physicist Niels Bohr was rescued in the nick of time from German occupied Denmark. While Danish resistance fighters provided covering fire he ran out the back door of his home stopping momentarily to grab a beer bottle full of precious heavy water. He finally reached England still clutching the bottle, which contained beer. Perhaps some German drank the heavy water.
