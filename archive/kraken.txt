The Kraken emerges and claws at the ship,
Throwing everything back and forth as it did.
The pirate uses every trick in the book,
To scare and break from this intruders hook.
His efforts are vain for the Kraken succeeds,
In swallowing up his ship from underneath.
To Davy Jones&#39; Locker thr pirate is bound,
But where can this accursed place be found?
