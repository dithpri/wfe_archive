[i]Farewell to Nova Scotia
The sea bound coast
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
When I am far away
On the briny ocean tossed
Will you ever heave a sigh
Or a wish for me

The sun was setting in the west
The birds were singing on every tree
All nature seemed to be at rest
But alas, there was no rest for me

Farewell to Nova Scotia
The sea bound coast
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
When I am far away
On the briny ocean tossed
Will you ever heave a sigh
Or a wish for me

I grieve to leave my native home
I grieve to leave my comrades all
And my parents
Whom I love so dear
And the bonny bonny lass
I do adore[/i]
