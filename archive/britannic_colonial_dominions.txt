We are the community of nations that have been colonized by the former &quot;Britannic Empire&quot;.

The Britannic Empire was an absolute monarchy which had its armies colonize 10% of the world, having it a massive empire spanning from Vinland to Cambodia, and from Iceland to Angola, an absolutely massive colonial empire which resulted in our foundations.

We do not have a discord server yet.



Suggestions below (not needed btw):


Have the Union Jack in the Canton of your flag, it shows that you were formally British.
Have a creative name, and it can only be of areas actually colonized, such as Luanda, Reykjavik, or like me, &quot;British Vinland&quot;.
We speak English here, so I suggest only joining if you speak good English.
