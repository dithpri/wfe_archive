Castar is a loosely defined region, consisting typically of the large central landmass known as &amp;#39;the Castaran Continent&amp;quot; as well as many outlying islands and minor landmasses. It is located in a vast wasteland of ocean, near no other major power and relatively secluded. Yet, with major internal strife from major powers in the region, one could say it is more active than the interconnected regions.
