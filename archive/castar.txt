Castar is a small, 250km^2 continent divided along the River di Casta between two countries: the Commonwealth of Northern Castar and the Military State of Southern Castar. Locked in an eternal feud as the result of a bloody civil war, it is unlikely these two peoples will ever be reunited. It is also rumored a secession movement is growing near the border, as the people there grow tired of the strife between the two nations, and would rather go their own way.
