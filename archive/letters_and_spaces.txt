NationStates moderators, I agree that it is hard to believe that a human can create 40 nations in 30 seconds.
But, I am using NO script since I am just yet only trying to learn how HTML works
Even making a script that will click on a button is impossible for me

I don&#39;t think that duplicating the page (right mouse button on window) is a script, do you?
And I don&#39;t remember any rule that says &quot;You can&#39;t create nations using duplicated pages&quot;

(When you duplicate the page, most things that you wrote save, so all you have to do is just waste is 15 minutes by typing the number of nation and pasting password twice)[/quote]
