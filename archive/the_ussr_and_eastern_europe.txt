We had a good run here in the USSR and Eastern Europe, but due to the lack of activity for this particular region I have decided to shut it down and do a re-finding of the region as the [region=USSR and Eastern Europe]. Communist and Socialist regional embassies are still welcome just make sure to make them with the new region not this one Newly Reformed USSR will remain here to act as a gatekeeper.

Signed,
