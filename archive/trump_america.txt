[b][color=261892]Greetings and Congratulations, Comrades[/color][/b]

[i]The raider deep state known as [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] has come to save you from the menace that is self-rule, and as a result we have decided to announce a few changes in the regional administration. First and foremost, you are obligated to endorse the delegate and all Regional Officers. Since we are benevolent, however, if one chooses not to, we will guide you to a lovely new estate in the Rejected Realms. Free of cost, of course. Endorsements for any other individual will be regarded as stealing the vote, and we will have to take measures to counter it.[/i][hr]
