Ballenhal was founded on the notion that a good RP story requires 4 things: a good plot setting, freedom from over-restriction, intelligent and thoughtful authors and a friendly community of fellow authors in which to write. we here at ballenhal believe that if these can be achieved then the community can write the best stories as enjoyable for the reader to read as it is the author to write. so come live out your dreams with Ballenhal!!!
