Welcome, test subject 3903. We welcome your petty carcass to bask in the glory that is Aperture Laboratories, founded by the man known as Cave Johnson. Go on, take a companion cube, dodge a few turrets, jump down that ledge to find your parents/a pony farm/a designer jumpsuit from France, or any rich combination of these. That is, if you live.   

Remember, all nations are required to participate in voluntary testing. All those who die will have their DNA taken from them to create clones. We will consider your death as your consent to take that precious DNA. In the rare situation in which you live, cake will be waiting for you in your sleeping chamer.
