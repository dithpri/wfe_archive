A coalition government led by three political authorities or factions:

1. The mainland progressive government led by the Labor Zionist republic of Israel;
2. A conservative and mildly authoritarian &quot;sister party&quot; led by YISRAEL CHAI (This world&#39;s parallel to the LIKUD);
3. A militaristic organization led by the IDF. Often acts in military operations.

There is also a &quot;holder&quot; in Jerusalem that has total executive control over the other factions.

The coalition is planning to reform Israel into a federation under a switzerland-style (Direct) democracy.

NOTE: ZIONISM DOESN&#39;T REPRESENT MY POLITICAL VIEWS, I&#39;M FIERCELY AGAISNT IT AND I ONLY MADE THESE ACCOUNTS FOR FUN.
