This a region that is focused around non-competitive roleplaying and storytelling. Please be considerate to your fellow region-mates and remember to have fun. We can&#39;t wait to see what stories you come up with.

We have a discord available to all members of the region where we play games and discuss roleplay topics in a casual setting.
