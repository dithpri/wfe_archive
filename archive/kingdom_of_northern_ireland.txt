[b][color=red]Welcome to the Kingdom of Northern Ireland![/color][/b]

Founded in March 2012 by Christian Stark, the Kingdom of Northern Ireland was envisioned to be a peaceful region with a thriving electoral system, a historic monarchy, an active forum, and a welcoming community. Although it was short-lived, the region is now memorialized in honor of its original Founder.
