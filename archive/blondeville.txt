[color=yellow][b]Welcome to Blondeville![/b][/color]

Blondeville is a region that is home to blondes and blond(e) sympathizers and supporters. 

United by our love for all that is British (and occasionally Mongolian, don&#39;t ask) we will rise to global power, as blondes have a tendency to do, and impart our blond(e) ways upon the denizens of the world, willing or otherwise, as our ancestors have done for centuries. Particularly towards the start of the last century, but we won&#39;t get into that.

To clarify, we love Jewish people. It has nothing to do with that. We have nothing against any race, except for a few, but Jewish people are not only welcome but honored. Ben Shapiro is a practical God around these parts. 

In conclusion, go blondes!
