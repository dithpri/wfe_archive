Ultimum Imperium was founded on the fact that several different empires throughout the world were competing to be named &amp;quot;The Ultimate Empire&amp;quot;. However, a lone nation named Perficio knew that the fighting would lead to destruction amidst the wars and battles encompassing the land. So in a feat of strength, Perficio resolved itself to defeat all nations and put them into one unified empire. And thus, Ultimum Imperium was born.
