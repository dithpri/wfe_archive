[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were tired of being cooped up in the same place for [i]soooooooo[/i] long! So, they decided to stretch their wings and fly on over to the bakery for some exercise (and some muffins). On the way, they noticed something following them. It had been a while since anything like this had happened, but from consulting much older hawks upon their return, they were able to determine that they had been &#39;chased.&#39; 

Whatever that means.

After successfully ditching their griffon and unicorn pursuers, as well as some with huge forks, they returned with tasty treats in tow.
