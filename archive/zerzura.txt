[b]Sergeant [nation]Ursidae[/nation] is going training mad and took the Hawks out for [i]yet another[/i] training run. It appears to be taking its toll as the new Privates managed to make it into more regions than Bear-boi. In spite of that, the training was a success and the Hawks returned home for some well deserved Sodapop. Join our [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]discord[/url] if you would like a chance to show up Ursus as well, or sign up to our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]forums[/url]  if you want access to our Sodapop reserves.
