Disan Tabar, the Region of Calm in the language of Taravan, has been established by the founding nation of Taravan, which seeks quiet to grow peacefully. If you wish to join a region without annoying spam, and enjoy conlanging or other activity that you can share in your factbook and through dispatches, Taravan invites you to move to Disan Tabar.
