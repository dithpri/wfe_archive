The Pacific Federation is a union of islands and coastal nations in the Pacific Ocean. The region enjoys plentiful fish harvests and heavy boat traffic on some of the most prosperous shipping lanes in the world. A heavy socialist and anti-capitalist attitude exists, with a direct representative council making up the government of the Federation.
