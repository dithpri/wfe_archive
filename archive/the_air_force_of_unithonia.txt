Welcome to [region]The Air Force of Unithonia[/region]. We are here for defense and defense alone. I created this region in order to support defender regions in their battles against the evils of invader forces. You can find out information about ranks and more by contacting General [nation]Unithonia[/nation]

Note:
The Air Force is still in its development/recruitment stage, so you will not be able to rise above [i][b][u]Cadet[/u][/b][/i] until the region is ready for missions. This will be when embassies with at least 10 defender nations have been constructed and it contains enough nations for missions (20+)
