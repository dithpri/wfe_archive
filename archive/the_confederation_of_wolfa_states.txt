The Confederation of Wolfa States hails from a common interest to safely manage the governments with peace. Each Wolfa State has the right to vote in Assembly, but the decision rests with simple majority. War is unacceptable amongst the states, but each government must respond in the interest of her Wolfas in the case of outside attack.
