In a world surrounded by Communism, one light shines through the darkness. DEMOCRACY! We believe freedom, patriotism, loyalty, and obesity are the building blocks for a successful nation. Through capitalism we can gain the trust of other nations and build industries overseas without effecting our own nation while still gaining profits. In the Land of Empathy you will find smart thinkers and innovators such as Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Joseph Stalin, and George Clooney. So stop wasting time and join the one region to rule them all! (Sidebar: We will win over other nations peacefully, *cough* not {secretly through spec ops and silent democracy}. So stop being a Communist and join today!
