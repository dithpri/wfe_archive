The Kingdom of Balmorra was facilitating guerilla raids into Eulatrya by terrorists in Upper Bathielia. At the same time, there was a movement among dissenters in western Balmorra, in the duchy of Ilgast that was increasingly frustrated with economic ruin and oppressive personal restrictions. After the outbreak of a civil war between the Balmorran government and the Ilgastian revolt, Eulatrya sent aid to the rebels and eventually joined the war on their side. 

The conclusion of the war saw Ilgast, and a few surrounding provinces gain independence from Balmorra, and formed a new kingdom under the name of Ilgast. Eulatrya and Ilgast formed the Bathielian League to protect the newly formed country from retaliation of Balmorra.
