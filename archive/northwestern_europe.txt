[color=black]&amp;#10016; Secured:[/color] Nov 26 2020[hr][region]Northwestern Europe[/region] is an inclusive term for those European countries in which members of the Germanian peoples are concentrated, in contrast to the Eastern and Southern regions of Europe that contained Mediterranean peoples, Slavs, and other non-Germanian peoples. All of the Germanian countries and areas such as northern France, which historically contains large numbers of people of Celtic and Germanic Frankish descent, are included in Northwestern Europe. 

There is very close genetic affinity among Northwest European populations as expected. Are you Germanian? We want you!
