A distant, barely explored archipelago. Recently colonized by refugees from democracies defeated in the Great Awful War. The democracies of the Outer Rim prize political and economic liberty above all else. To be a member, a state must have a rating of &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; or better in either economy or political freedom. States that are lower than &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; in economy, civil rights or political freedom will be looked upon with suspicion. However, such nations will typically be given ample opportunity to improve before being sanctioned. The Outer Rim Charter requires member states to maintain consensual governments and to provide at least average levels of civil rights and political freedoms to its citizens.
