[i]In the eternal void, violence is the only thing that preserves you. It is the shield that guards you, the sword that serves you. But will it consume you? It almost always does.

Or maybe you will be warped by acts of unforgivable violence, destroyed and eviscerated for your crimes. Only time holds the answer...[/i]
