[i]On the final frontier, violence is the only thing to keep you alive. It protects you, it helps you, it keeps you safe. But will it consume you, destroy you? It almost always does, here in the eternal void. But maybe you&#39;ll be one of the few, who ascend past mere mortals. Maybe you will someday rule us. Or maybe you will die, fade, crumble, or be turned into a pulp, warped by unforgivable violence. Only time will tell...[/i]
