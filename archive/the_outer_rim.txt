[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] realized that they were out of their favorite drink: defender tears. In a panic, they assembled a team of juicers to try bait and grab as many fenda tears as they could. Some hawklings were also taken along to learn the art of juicing. If you want to join in on the loot, come join us at [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]forums[/url] .
