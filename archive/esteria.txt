[b]&amp;quot;Esteria is a fusion of old and new nations, a tropical paradise filled with sandy beaches, bustling harbour towns and groves of palm trees. The main exports are cocoa beans, refined sugar, and even more refined citizens! All nations are welcome to join this glorious region.&amp;quot;[/b] -World Factbook Entry, June 2006

Founded in Nov 2005 by The Kingdom of Sandralina, [b]Esteria[/b] was a small community of ~25 nations with an offsite forum for role-play, a Constitution with a unicameral legislature, intelligence agency, region map and flag, and embassies with regions such as [region]Liberalia[/region], [region]The Ocean of Purity[/region], and [region]Alliance Defense Network[/region]. Esteria collapsed in July 2006 due to inactivity and ceased to exist shortly after.
