Gettersocswill (Pronounced Yetter-socks-ville) Is the region where Gerkilunt was created. A massive, massive, expansion of land, where any type of land can, and will be found. Grasslands? We got those. Deserts? We got them too. Snowy mountains that house the most dangerous and hungry animals? Yes, we have those as well. Any thing you want will probably be here, so long as you follow Gerkilunt (Pronounced Yergi-loont. In English, it&#39;d be pronounced Yergi-land.)
