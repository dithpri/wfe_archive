The Eastern Fjord Alliance (EFA for short) was forged by the Haltashar pact, named after the city in Ulkur-al in which it was signed. The Alliance is made up of various countries that wanted to create a larger world power. All countries maintain control of their own laws and regulations, but all contribute to the alliance. Feel free to join.
