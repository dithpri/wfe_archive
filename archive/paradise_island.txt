A peaceful area aimed at center and right-wing nations looking for a new and peaceful region to join. If applicable, Elves, Dwarves, Mobians, Gallifreyans, Kryptonians, Pokemon/Pokemorphs, Vulcans, Q, Douwd, Celestialsapien, Galvan, Petrosapien, Osmosian and most other alien species are welcome to join.  (Bonus points if you know all of the species, although they mostly have at least one noteworthy character.) Special permission required for Borg or Dalek nations. No magic is permitted whatsoever, as that is incompatible with the beliefs of the founder, to give a forewarning, although magical species will not be discriminated against, it is simply the practicing of sorcery that is the concern.
