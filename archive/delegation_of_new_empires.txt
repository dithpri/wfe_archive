[color=#808000][b]Summary:[/b][/color]
After a nuclear holocaust happens, the human race is thrown into the stone age and an ice age. After the Ice Age is over, we begin to rebuild, using pieces of our past. Now, large empires are starting to form, as the old world is seeming to rebuild itself. The current year is 157, and the current month is April.
