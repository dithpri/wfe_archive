A collection of Temecula Valley High School Students building countries to honor our grand emperor, the King of Jazz, Duke Silver. So come on in, and take a bath in Duke&amp;#39;s relaxing jazz.

This Declaration is intended to provide the basis for all legislation in the Isle of Paul. Other nations in the Alliance may choose for themselves whether or not they choose to abide by this Declaration, a right secured by Foreign Policy #1 in the Declaration.
