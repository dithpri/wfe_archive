[B][color=red][i]Hello to anyone stumbling upon this region,

This is The Hidden Alliance home to people who want revenge. But entering The Hidden Alliance comes at a price, you must gain my trust before fully becoming a true member, but be careful because one mess-up will result in ultimate destruction. Trust me I will not sleep until those that betray The Hidden Alliance are destroyed.


ALL WA MEMBERS ARE [u] REQUIRED [/u] TO ENDORSE BERMA, THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES IF YOU DO NOT ENDORSE.

Remember The Hidden Alliance is not for the faint of heart[/i]
