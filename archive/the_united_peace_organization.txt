[b][u][color=#265780]Welcome to the World Peace Organization (UPO)![/color][/u]
[/b][color=red]&quot;Peace, Freedom, and Prosperity!&quot;[/color]
[hr]The United Peace Organization, is a small, peaceful, and relaxed region. There are not many laws in place, but the ones we do have are the basic one. (See below for the link). However, if you join this region with evil intent, I ask you to leave before you harm our region. If you don&#39;t we will find you out eventually, so just leave and don&#39;t waste our time. Also, due to previsous issues with spies, the WA Delegate [i]only[/i] has WA power, so if you are a spy and you plan on raiding by becoming WA Delegate, that won&#39;t work.
