-= [b] History of Radville [/b]
West Radville is a small, fiercely independent region of various states, each differing greatly from the other in every way except for high nudity levels across the board. West Radville&amp;#39;s countries are largely democratic, and frequently socialist in policy. Contention between nations is high. Competition is lethal. But all in all, the countries which make up West Radville are unique and independent in the best of ways.
