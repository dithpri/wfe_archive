[hr]

As of 7:54 on 11/2/2017, this region has merged with the [region]Imperial Roman Coprosperity Sphere[/region]. Please move there.

This is a region based of the actual [color=blue][b][i]Holy Roman Empire.[/i][/b][/color]

This region is a conglomerate/coalitions of nations in a world of superpower regions like [region]The North Pacific[/region] and our region will prosper with eventual difficulties and setbacks and become, hopefully, a powerhouse of it&#39;s own.
