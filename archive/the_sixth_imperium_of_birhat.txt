Orbiting around the star &amp;quot;Bia&amp;quot;, the Sixth Imerium of Man arose following an incursion by the Achuultani which devistated all of Mankind&amp;#39;s and the Narhani&amp;#39;s inhabited worlds and controlled systems, save for one: Birhat.

     Following Emperor Colin I&amp;#39;s defeat at the Achuultani homeworld to the Achuultani Master Control Computer, the Imperial fleet was all but destroyed, leaving only a small defense force behind to protect the Imperium. The devestated fleet&amp;#39;s remains left the Master Controller the means to capture, reverse-engineer, and ultimately utilise the Imperium&amp;#39;s advanced technology, most notably their gravatonic missles and warheads and their Enchanach and hyper drives.
