Hindustan or Indostan, literally &amp;quot;land of Indians&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;land of the Indus&amp;quot;, is a popular name for the Indian subcontinent. Delhi and Agra have been the traditional capitals of Hindustan. Though the meaning of Hindustan has evolved over the years, since the partition of India it primarily refers to the Republic of India.
