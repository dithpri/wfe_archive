The Greater Eslonian Valley was once home to the Eslonian Empire, a mighty and economically massive dictatorial kingdom. In the late nineteenth century, a revolution started in the south of Eslonia due to Emperor Evgeniy Vinogradov II&#39;s signing of a legislation barring Eslonians from immigrating to neighboring countries in search of political, social, religious, and economic freedom. The emperor was assassinated on December 31st, 1882 by his Military General, Aleksander Tkachenko. The Greater Eslonian Valley was then divided up into five separate nations: Northern, Southern, Western, Eastern, and Middle Eslonia. They each picked up a different piece of the former Eslonian Empire, and used it as a blueprint for their government.
