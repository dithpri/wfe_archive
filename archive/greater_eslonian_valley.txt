The Greater Eslonian Valley is home to Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, and Middle Eslonia. Each of these nations openly trade and cooperate with one another and are friendly towards newcomers from all over the world. Except for Southern Eslonia. They hate everyone. All are welcome, so long as they obey all laws and statutes and don&#39;t start trouble.
