The Greater Eslonian Valley is located between the Brannackian Mountain Range and the Eslonian Plateau, and is mostly made up of lush pine and cedar forest, with a largely biodiverse wildlife population. The Greater Eslonian Valley is home to Northern Eslonia, Southern Eslonia, Middle Eslonia, Western Eslonia, and Eastern Eslonia, which are the remnants of the once-mighty Eslonian Empire.
