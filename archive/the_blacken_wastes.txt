Reviving my old Region 

The Blacken Wastes is the homeland to the Sharuez Clan and its people. It is a glorious honor to live at the home continent where it is mostly dominated by weird creatures and monsters as well as alienated creatures. 

Sharuez lives in constant danger but as well it serves as a defense against enemies and rebel forces.
