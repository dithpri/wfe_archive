The Stellar Althing convenes pursuant to the common welfare of its constituent nations. Whatever the degree of political freedoms possessed of by the commoners of these nations, the Althing does not represent them. Every leader has equal say at the Althing.

This Althing has the authority to compel its member nations to the pursuit of a common goal, under threat of expulsion. While cultural conformity is desirable, it is not requisite. Also, member nations are urged to pursue a dedicated course: military, intellectual, spiritual, industrial.

When you join, declare yourself and the priority of your nation. Let those who stand around you know you.
