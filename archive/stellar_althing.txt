The Stellar Althing convenes for the common welfare of its constituent nations. The Althing does not represent the citizens, but rather the nations, of which it is composed. Every leader has equal say at the Althing.

This Althing acts as a council and meets to discuss issues of security, economy, etc. that may be of common interest between each nation.

This organization is comparable to the Nordic Council.
