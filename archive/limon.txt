Ahhh yes. [region]Limon[/region].

Truly a region to behold.
While we may not be as numerous as some other regions, we do consist of the most beloved nations.

Limon does not have a leader, for we are all equal. Something many a region have yet to comprehend.
Our industries and nature are marvels to behold. And let us not even mention our cultural heritage, spanning many a generation.

Limon must surely be, without a single doubt, the best place to be.
