[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] brought out some new hawks to fly about on a raid. 

We did some slow loops, drank some tea and tried on some party hats while floating along the winds.

If you would like to fly with us, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
