LIMBO is a 2.1 Extreme Demon mega-collaboration hosted and published by MindCap, co-hosted by Djoxy and verified by BGram on 26 November 2022 after 109,490 attempts. The level is designed in a 1.9 style with a mix of indigo, dark blue and red, similar to the last 25% of weoweoteo&#39;s Extreme Demon Marathon but more detailed. The theme is also similar to both Hinds&#39; and Vlacc&#39;s parts in Cybernetic Crescent. It is made to be the hardest memory Demon without relying on visual interference while implementing unique gameplay mechanics.
