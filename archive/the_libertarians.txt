Originally created as a backup in case of raids for the region [region]Libertarians[/region] back when that region was controlled by natives, [region]The Libertarians[/region] has now been refounded to preserve the history of [region]Libertarians[/region] before it was refounded by outsiders, and turned into an outpost of REATO in the REATO-Communist war which the original region stubbornly refused to participate in.

Now that I ([nation=short]Ancapitalistan[/nation]) am the only native left, I am re-dedicating our region to the true, original meaning of libertarian: Libertarian Socialism. This wasn&amp;#39;t the original position of the region but it is the original meaning of Libertarianism, and social anarchism deserves the region named after its word.
