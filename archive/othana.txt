This is a medieval based role play world. Looking for more people to help set it up and get it going. 

Basic Rules:
1) Treat each other with respect. This is obvious and goes without saying.
2) OOC and IC are separate.
3) No power gaming/god modding/meta gaming
4) Don&#39;t mess with stuff, I will feed you to the meerkats if you do (Looking at the Polemarch)
