This is a medieval based role play world. Looking for more people to help set it up and get it going. 

Basic Rules:
1) Treat each other with respect. This is obvious and goes without saying.
2) OOC and IC are separate.
3) No power gaming/god modding/meta gaming
4) The Primarch is a jerk and no one likes him.
5) The Polemarch is the bomb diggity and everyone loves her.
