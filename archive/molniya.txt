Located on an enormous island, Molniya stretches vertically across the map, crossing several longitudes, and therefore has an extremely varied climate. It has glaciers at the southern tip, making up 12% of its landmass. The eastern coast is a beach, with black volcanic sand, and the west coast is jagged cliffs that run right up to the ocean. Between is mostly verdant forest, with a few isolated towns in the south, and the capital city, a bustling metropolis known as Mirbek in the north, surrounded by smaller cities. The North and south are seperated by a mountain range, which is why the south is less populated.
