The final frontier: travel time takes years, the economy is slow, and resources are plentiful but separated by light years. Space faring nations thrive using suspended animation techniques and the economy runs by shipping vast amounts of freight between worlds and star systems (100+year transit time) keeping the economy going by synchronizing sleep-wake cycles with citizens waking up for 1 year for every 100 years of cryosleep and letting bots do the vast majority of work. Email, IM, and social networking often take anywhere between 3 seconds to 100 years to reach the intended destination.
