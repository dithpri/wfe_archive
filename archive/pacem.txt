Pacem was founded on 4.6.17 as the world&#39;s only completely tolerant region that has active politics as a major prospect. Anyone can rise in the ranks to take on the role of WA delegate, under the Supreme Viceroy for Life, Dr. Prof. Eldridge G. Swann IV. We encourage communication and resourcefulness in our great region. We may be small, but we are going to continue to be forever mighty and glorious, that is, amongst our own citizens. Neo-Felicitatem is our Capital nation with the soon to be Capital City of Eldridgrad-- Remember, Pacem et Felicitatem!
