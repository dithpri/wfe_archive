Welcome to Pacem!&nbsp;

Pacem is a region for nations with peaceful values. Pacem is a community of nations that have one main goal and that is to keep the peace. That&#39;s why our region&#39;s name is Pacem, which is Latin for peace. Pacem is also a governmental role-play region. You may run for certain government positions or be appointed to them.&nbsp;


If you want to help build Pacem come join this region as we work on a constitution, the government positions and more.&nbsp;
