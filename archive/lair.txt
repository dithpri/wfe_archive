Hello comrade! I hope you look no further than the LAIR as your new home. LAIR stands for legion of armed inhabited reservations. I want Capitalists, Strong Economies, any who join the LAIR and have below a reasonable economy will be ejected, but they can change while they aren&#39;t in the LAIR, and can join back once they rebuild themselves, if they haven&#39;t been rebuilt they may be banned. We are democratic, and quite possibly will become invader. I hope our community grows together. Regional government will be put in place once we are large enough.

Uhhmmm... Hello... Is this thing on? *static*
