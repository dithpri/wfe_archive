Tired of all the Social Democrats, Intrusive Republicans, growing globalism, and needless wars? The Libertarian Commonwealth advocates individualism of all nations, maximum civil rights, maximum economic freedom, anti-World Assembly policies, and a Libertarian/Classically Liberal society for all members! We hold elections every two months for President, Vice President, and four Supreme Court Justices. Every member has a say in the United People&#39;s Congress! (The regional government will operate strictly to the Regional Constitution to ensure each individual can live accordingly to his own judgement without excessive government interference.) We will only hold Congressional meetings once a month. Welcome to true Liberalism!
