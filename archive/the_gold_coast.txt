The Gold Coast is a prosperous coalition of neighboring independent states. Member states contribute to a regional defence force, primarily utilized for trade protection and peacekeeping operations. A free trade agreement is also in-place for all coalition nations. States have sovereignty over all internal and external affairs, save for the required military contribution and ratification of the trade agreement.
