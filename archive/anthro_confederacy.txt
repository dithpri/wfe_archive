A region that, while anthropomorphic creatures exist, distances itself from the &amp;quot;furries&amp;quot; due to the negative stigma that the term carries. Based on an offsite forum, roleplay that we engage in is designed to be realistic in both modern and future tech.

Just starting out the region, going to attempt to start up a new community for fans of anthropomorphism and choose to roleplay with such types of characters. Of course, human characters are just as welcome, there&amp;#39;s no bias there.
