To all who believe in peace, liberty, and progress; you are welcome to the Domain of the Holy Ecumene with open embrace. Together we shall stand against all in this world who would threaten our dedication to what is right, what is honest, and what shall see this world improved for all who inhabit it and live fiercely. Join us, and together we will march brilliantly through the halls of time, trampling the pestilent scum of our world in our stride, as we move to an ever better tomorrow for all.
