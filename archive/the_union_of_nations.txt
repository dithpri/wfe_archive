    We are a Democratic Union of nations. The Union of Nations is a peaceful region where a nation&amp;#39;s economy can develop in peace. We welcome any nation that is not a dictatorship, a communist nation, or any other form of government that opresses the people. We are Capitalists. We care for all the nations that join us. We help them in any way. So come join, your welcome!
I will be adding a Senate, and a Supreme Court. We have an embassy with  Kingdom, a region for kingdoms. Monthly elections will be held.
