Akania is a small occupied space, dominated by the ever-growing city of Altomelia, wherein the latter has been nominated by several smaller settlements, towns, and trading posts as leader for protection from internal and external terrorists and acts of likeliness. Akania is proud of it&#39;s military strength, despite of it&#39;s size, and aims to become a formidable and reliable ally of any interested regions and territories alike.
