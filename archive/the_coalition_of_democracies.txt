A region where any region which is a democracy can associate with other democratic nations in an open and fair environment. 

We will openly discuss any legislation which is up for a vote in the World Assembly and will vote within our region before deciding which way to vote. Whichever way the region votes, all elected officials will vote.

This region is exclusively for democracies and if a nation&#39;s government changes to something other than a democracy, the nation is subject to expulsion from the region.
