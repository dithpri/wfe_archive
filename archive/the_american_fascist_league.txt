[I]Transferred control: 13.03.23[/I]

This fascist region was created by [nation]Greater Americania[/nation]; it had several outpost regions, claimed to be former communist holdings, under its control. Now the region has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with other [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascist[/b] forces.
