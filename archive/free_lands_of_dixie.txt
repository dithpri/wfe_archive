Welcome to FLD, friends and loved ones! I, [nation]The Wild West[/nation], pledge to remain an active Founder.

Addendum: to all of the people that keep sending telegrams saying things like, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve liberated Dixie for you!&amp;quot;, please stop.
The old region has no Founder, and it will remain a hopeless contested territory forever.
