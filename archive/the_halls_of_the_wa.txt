A bizarre interdimensional platform where anything is possible, gnomes reign supreme, a comic supervillain is the secretary-general, drunken bar-brawlers are called &quot;ambassadors,&quot; magic invisible clauses trump actual law, and the Secretariat is so freakin&#39; lazy they have to appoint a &quot;council&quot; to do their work for them. Oh, and where raiders are summarily defenestrated. But for the rest of you, happy hour at the Strangers&#39; Bar is just getting started, so park a puppet and stay awhile.
