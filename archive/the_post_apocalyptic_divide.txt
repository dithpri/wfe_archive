The Post Apocalyptic Divide is formed of nations rebuilding after the Z-Day apocalypse. Having proven their resilience time and time again, The Post Apocalyptic Divide was founded by [nation=the turkmenian territories], [nation=the free states of phurlli], and [nation=the sovereign states of shelly]. Together, these three nations form The Triumvirate, and have created a haven in which nations could reside following apocalypse, and make efforts to rebuild and be better prepared should such an event happen again.
