The Alliance of Pkardia is a political, military, and economic union founded by Hexastalia, Xanea, and Baldaria (gone but not forgotten). The Alliance was founded on the principals of ensuring liberty, encouraging cooperation between its members, and protecting peace in their region of the globe...or something like that.
