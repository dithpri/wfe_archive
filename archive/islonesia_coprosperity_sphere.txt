The co-prosperity sphere was founded to protect it&amp;#39;s members from external aggresion and promote fair trade between it&amp;#39;s member&amp;#39;s developing economies. 
The Islonesia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not a supranational organization with intention of taking aggresive stands against other nations despite the propaganda of hate spoken by our enemies. The purpose of the military of each country is purely defensive as for now.
