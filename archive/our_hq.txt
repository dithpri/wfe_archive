Raiders can be simply part of the game, so long as they are playing the game, arranging for matches between regions, which may end peacefully.
But we all know there are people who are deliberately wrecking the place for other players, all for their own enjoyment. The ones who wipe out factbooks. The ones who crash regions.

An effective counter-campaign rests on three principles:
- Information
- Speedy response
- Strength
Let Our HQ be the gathering-place where the alarms are sounded, whenever destructive raiders threaten peaceful regions. Let it be the place from where the allied armies march forth. Let it be the place where we hear the reports of informants and spies.
