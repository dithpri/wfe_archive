      Geographically, Sub-Saharan Africa is the part of the continent of Africa that sits south of the Sahara Desert; it technically starts somewhere within the Sahel region.  Welcome! 

      We are a quite young region just getting started and we look forward to getting to know those who decide to join us!  For those of you who join, make yourself at home! 

      But, don&#146;t take any of our kindness for weakness; we&#146;ll have to show who we really are if it comes to that. : )
