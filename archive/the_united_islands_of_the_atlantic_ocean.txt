We are the United Islands of the Atlantic Ocean. Island nations are given higher authority than non-island nations in this region. World Assembly Members will also be given higher authority than non-World Assembly Members.
So, it goes like this:
1. Me
2. WA delegate
3. All officers
4. WA member, island nations
5  non-WA member island nations/WA member non-island nations
6. non-WA member, non-island nations
