[i]One for the murmurs of dread in the cosmos, whispers of Gem, Monarch of Europeia.

Two for the pallid moons that dance in the ether, their paths manipulated by His imperial will.

Three for the ancient runes inscribed deep within Europeia&#39;s heart, arcane symbols that pulsate with His unspoken power.

Four for the chthonic creatures lurking in the shadows, slithering serpents bound to His immortal command.

Five for the timeless gateways hidden across the lands, doorways to dimensions where Gem&#39;s domain extends beyond comprehension.

Six for the celestial melodies only the mad can hear, hymns sung to the rhythm of His unending reign.[/i]
