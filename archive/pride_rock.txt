[color=rainbow][i]One tradition that seems to persist when a new ruler takes the throne: 
they climb to the top of Pride Rock, 
and let out a roar across the animal kingdom.[/i]

[u][b]Emperor of the Hill - Republic Day[/b][/u]

This festival is about celebrating our region as a Republic ... but sometimes you just need to get the power-grabbing out of your system!! Your mission is to wrest control of Pride Rock by amassing as many friends to move in at major update. The floodgates are open - but if you fail to capture Pride Rock, do not fear; your second chance will come at minor update, when the temporary victors will fight to keep their power-hungry rivals at bay. Whoever owns Pride Rock after minor update on Monday will be crowned Emperor.
