Fa Prevaricator, new Comrades!

Following the glorious victory of the revolt, New Da rises from the ashes of its former Da&#146;ish self.

Our values of civil liberty, economic socialism and iron-fisted political rule reinforced, we now retake our position on the world stage and welcome any those who wish to join the union and brave the icy conditions of glorious Da.
