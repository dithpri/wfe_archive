The Eternal Imperium of Man is the neo-technical future state derived from the revelations brought back through a time-traveling inebriated mad scientist who traveled back in time from the year 40,000 A.D. disguised as a pickle alongside his teenage sidekick and grandchild.  They prophetically explained to Senator Kainos Kerensky of Immensia that the time would come when Xenos and demon spawn from the voids of the universe would come to clash with the expansion of mankind.  The only way to ensure humanity&#39;s survival was to begin the founding of an eternal technocratic empire that would pave the way for the Imperium of Man and the future God-Emperor of Mankind.
