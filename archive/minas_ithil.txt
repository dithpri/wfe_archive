Minas Ithil, the Tower of the Moon, was the easternmost fortification in the Kingdom of Gondor. Minas Ithil safeguarded the eastern borders of the realm and protected the capital Osgiliath from the forces of Mordor during the early part of the Third Age. As Gondor&#39;s power weakened, it was then taken by the forces of Mordor, and used as a base to attack Gondor. In the process, it decayed into a dark fortress and was renamed to Minas Morgul as a result.
