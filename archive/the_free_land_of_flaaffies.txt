[I]Starting a revolution one nation at a time[/I]

We are a free land of flaaffies, seeking peace after years of injustice by our corrupt leaders of our past. We intend to lead a new, peaceful, happy life, here. Where the weather is great and the grass never runs short.

If you have any questions, feel free to telegram myself, [nation]Flaaffies[/nation] or [nation]Heatondom[/nation], our WA delegate.

[I]For the good of all flaaffies![/I]
