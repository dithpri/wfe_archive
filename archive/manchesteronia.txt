This is a class region for Mr. Anderson&amp;#39;s Civics &amp;amp; Economics class at Manchester Middle School. This will be our daily &amp;quot;Warm Up&amp;quot; when entering class. You are held to the same rules for the school and the county. No profane language. No bullying. No racist/sexist/or otherwise horrible things are to be said for the sake of attention. You are better than that. Now, let&amp;#39;s get to ruling our country the way we want!!!

Good Luck!
The Architect is watching you...
