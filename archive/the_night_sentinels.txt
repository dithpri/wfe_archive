[color=blue]The Night Sentinels are an ancient, shrouded group of warriors whom are known mostly as the people who fought off the evils of hell, and more importantly, for the man who wears the Crown of the Night Sentinels, the Doom Slayer.[/color]

This region is based in the game DOOM, more specifically it&#39;s fourth installment, and the lore of the Doom Slayer and the Night Sentinels. In gameplay terms, we are a Defender Region. Everyone is welcome! Well, besides demons and the threats to humanity, of course. This region isn&#39;t heavily RP outside of Gameplay, but it can be from time-to-time. Embassies for roleplay are accepted, as are non-roleplay regions.
