The New Homeworld of the Zaktarians. 

In the 10th Rift War(The War of the Flaming Chross) the old homeworld (Zaktarium Prime) Got orbital bombarded by the Zurkses killing 90% of the population that was left on the planet and leaving it a barren husk. But there is still hope with the new found technology called terraforming, there might still come a day when Zaktarians can repopulate the planet.
