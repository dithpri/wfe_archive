In geometry, an apeirogon (from Ancient Greek &amp;#7940;&amp;#960;&amp;#949;&amp;#953;&amp;#961;&amp;#959;&amp;#962; apeiros &#39;infinite, boundless&#39;, and &amp;#947;&amp;#969;&amp;#957;&amp;#943;&amp;#945; gonia &#39;angle&#39;) or infinite polygon is a polygon with an infinite number of sides. Apeirogons are the two-dimensional case of infinite polytopes. In some literature, the term &quot;apeirogon&quot; may refer only to the regular apeirogon, with an infinite dihedral group of symmetries.
