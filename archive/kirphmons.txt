Kirphmons is a cluster of islands which border the territories of Greenland and Scotland and have recently been recognised as a separate region due to the fact it lies on seas owned by no existing government or region.

It is currently ruled over my its first residents who moved in from Greenland, the Imperiadians of the newly founded Kingdom of Imperiad.

It&#39;s geographical size is quite small and the small population of Imperiad is dispersed among the isles which have specific attributes and traits.

Altogether, the region is composed of 6 isles and is notable for its large uranium deposits, sprawling agriculture, civil rights and retail.
