The United Nations of the Eastern States is a truly capitalist region, of statist and liberal nations, but above all, of the right. Left governments will not be accepted, unless they want to progress and change sides. Andrikova and President Artur perpetually lead in order to simplify the political system. To remain here, countries need to demonstrate, at the very least, considerable economic growth, as it is also an economic cooperation bloc. Fiscal officers from the ruling nation shall be admitted to each territory belonging to them in order to supervise, when necessary. The regional motto is: &quot;Non dvcor, dvco&quot;.
