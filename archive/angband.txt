[color=grey][i]I am the Elder King: Melkor, first and mightiest of all the Valar, who was before the world, and made it. The shadow of my purpose lies upon Arda, and all that is in it bends slowly and surely to my will.[/i]

[i]Angband, also known as the Iron Prison, was the ancient fortress of the Elder King Melkor in the depths of the Iron Mountains that was built after the destruction of the Two Lamps as an arsenal of Udun. It would later be the Elder King&#39;s primary stronghold, the capital of his dark realm known as Dor-na-Daerachas. From this fortress, Melkor relentlessly sought to dominate Arda throughout the First Age.[/i]
