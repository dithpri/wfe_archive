The Union of Independent Nations is a relatively small, yet promising region that is based on a democratic and logical form of government. We are governed by a Federal Chancellor and our Founder who currently holds both offices but the office Federal Chancellor changes frequently. Another office that changes often is that of our WA delegate and we have had 4 different Delegates in the past 2 days (we are working to rectify this issue and to have the delegacy as a slightly more permanent office.)
