We are a Union of Nations who have much autonomy and are very Liberal. The Union is to be shaped and governed by The Nations comprising it, whoever they may be. We stand for Liberty, Strength and Order. Unitiva stands that they shall not interfere largely with the politics and order of The Union after its birth. Anyone is eligible for a position of power, and we are a Direct Democracy. Even YOU could be someone in an high level of power. If this does not sound like the right place for YOU, remember, YOU drive this Union if YOU chose to join. Do not expect Unitiva to be active, and all power is with the Nations comprising the Union and YOU.
