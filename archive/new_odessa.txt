Hi, Eaglleia here.
You recall my earlier TG? Well, you should have gotten it unless you blocked out all TG&amp;#39;s, but basically;
This region is [i]CLOSING DOWN[/i] due to the deletion of our Founder&amp;#39;s previous account and therefore the inability to protect it from Raiders (we aren&amp;#39;t considering a password a permanent solution, by the way). This region will be entirely leaderless very soon. But don&amp;#39;t fear, if you wish to stay on with this community, simply move over to [region]New Pandora[/region], created by Oaledonia&amp;#39;s (our founder, in case you somehow don&amp;#39;t know) new account, [nation]New Oyashima[/nation] where we shall all be heading. Hope to see you&amp;#39;ll there.
