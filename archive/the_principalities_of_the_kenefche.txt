[i]Preface:[/i]
This region is devoted to a miniscule RP world shared amonger few RL friends, for the time being there is no plan to invite outside nations, but we are open to everyone who would like to train their RP skills in a friendly environment. 
This region will influence the actions of a proper state - The Holy Empire of [nation]Kenefche[/nation].
This region [b]WILL NOT HAVE[/b] a WA Delegate as it is mostly comprised of alternate nations/puppets who want to participate on smaller scale RP on the side, while still properly playing with their main nation. As such, if you are looking to participate actively in the World Assembly, we recommend to you to search for another region.
