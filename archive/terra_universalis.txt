Evening!
We are a bunch of plucky, world-conquerng and influencing dictatorships, empires and kingdoms that mostly follow a new-and-old system called neo-historicalism, a system that revolves around extreme piety and going forward with the times while still in the past age. We&#39;re talking clockpunk, steampunk, melee-only, dieselpunk or just PT mutations in general!

We look forward to accept any nations who dwindle in the days of old and want to adapt to the new age whilst keeping themselves prosperous, and also enter in the trade of Nostrumium, the world&#39;s most powerful metal.
