[b]Cape Breton Island[/b] is located on the Atlantic coast of North America and is part of Nova Scotia, Canada. Although physically separated from the Nova Scotia peninsula by the Strait of Canso, it is artificially connected to mainland Nova Scotia by the 1,385 mile long rock-fill Canso Causeway. The island&#39;s northern and western coasts front the Gulf of Saint Lawrence; its western coast forms the eastern limits of the Northumberland Strait. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean; the eastern coast forms the western limits of the Cabot Strait. One of the world&#39;s larger salt water lakes, Bras d&#39;Or, dominates the centre of the island. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
