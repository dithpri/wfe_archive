[color=red]Rule[/color], [color=blue]Britannia[/color]! 
[HR]
There shall be [b]ORDER[/b] in the Realm - [color=indigo]We[/color] promise you that.  How you run your nation is your choice.  However, [color=indigo]We[/color] are not amused by this nasty business of elections.  While [color=indigo]We[/color] shall never sully Our hands with the trivial affairs of the World Assembly, the Realm shall [u]ALWAYS[/u] remain free to bicker about sending a representative to that congress of fools if they like - join the fray and compete for endorsements, sow havoc, and overthrow the delegate if you can.  [color=indigo]We[/color] find that they are much like cockroaches on a hangman&#39;s rope, and another will triumphantly make its scuttling ascent the moment that a space is cleared for it.

Enjoy your petty games, [color=indigo]We[/color] are always watching.

[nation]The Lion and Unicorn[/nation]
