Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the web.
[HR]
There will be [b]ORDER[/b] in the Realm - [color=red]We[/color] promise you that.  How you run your own nation is your choice, however, [color=red]We[/color] are not amused by the nasty business of elections.  While [color=red]We[/color] shall never sully Our hands with the trivial affairs of the World Assembly, Our Parliament shall [u]ALWAYS[/u] remain free to bicker about sending a representative to that congress of fools if they like - join the fray and compete for endorsements, create sheer bedlam, and overthrow the delegate if you can.  [color=red]We[/color] find that they are much like cockroaches on a hangman&#39;s rope, and another will make its scuttling ascent the moment that a space is cleared for it.

Enjoy your petty games but remember, [color=red]We[/color] are always watching.
