Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the web.

There will be ORDER in the Realm - We promise you that.  How you run your own nation is your choice, however, We are not amused by this nasty business of elections.  While We shall never sully Our hands with the trivial affairs of the World Assembly, Our Parliament shall ALWAYS remain free to bicker about sending a representative to that congress of fools if they like - join the fray and compete for endorsements, create sheer bedlam, and overthrow the delegate if you can.  We find that they are like cockroaches on a hanging rope, and another will make its scuttling ascent the moment that a space is cleared for it.

Enjoy your petty games but remember, We are always watching.
