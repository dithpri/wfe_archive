Nations held together by the ancient bonds of the brotherhood of the net, UNOSS seeks to bring about a new world that constantly hangs in balance of good and evil.
For the greater good, of course.
Our nations may differ in ideas and ideals, but we strive forward in our ridiculous friendships.
We didn&amp;#39;t get up at 5am for nothing.
