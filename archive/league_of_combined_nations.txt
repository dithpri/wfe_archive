[b]This region is now [color=blue]under the protection[/color] of [region]The Ancient Empires of The World[/region] from [color=red]The Black Hawks[/color].[/b]
[i]The previous Factbook Entry and flag is not in our database. Therefore, we will use it to display a public message until someone who knows what it was speaks up. Before next update would be nice...[/i]

[u]To The Black Hawks[/u]: This is simply a warning message. No doubt you&amp;#39;ll be back, once your officers finally decide to wake up and take to the skies again. Until then, I believe that this is ours. Correct me if I am mistaken.

This region will be restored after it is password-protected.
