[b]This region is now [color=blue]under the protection[/color] of [region]The Ancient Empires of The World[/region] from [color=red]The Black Hawks[/color].[/b]
[i]We have been given permission to turn this region into a monument.[/i]

[u]To The Black Hawks[/u]: This is simply a warning message. No doubt you&amp;#39;ll be back, once your officers finally decide to wake up and take to the skies again. Until then, I believe that this is ours. Correct me if I am mistaken. Having The Black Riders take it back for you would be a sure sign of weakness.

This region will be transformed after it is password-protected.
