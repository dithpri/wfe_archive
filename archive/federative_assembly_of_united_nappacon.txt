We are a grand league of federative nation-states with a goal to make this world a great place to live. As united Christians, we hope to give faith, love, holiness, and peace upon our nation-states. we hope to make sure you are kind and well, we do allow debates and talks. roleplay is generally not encouraged but i guess it should be allowed (not to much). ATTENTION MODS, DO NOT CENSOR POSTS. also if your democrat, liberal, gay, or any of that, please stay away. it is literal advice, please don&#39;t try and spread your ideas here. we do have an army to keep our nations safe and we ask you sign to get in. the Armenian genocide did happen, so did the holocaust. Good luck brothers in arms and states. we march to a better furture!
