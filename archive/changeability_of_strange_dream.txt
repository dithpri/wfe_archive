Still is the water where my fears are bound
Watching me fall like a leaf
That was so brutal
Such a simple decision
When will I be released

You can close your eyes
But there is no illusion
Draw the line
Watch the river run dry

Now I see the sun will fade
Now I feel the choice you made
Now I hear the voice aloud and calling out behind me
Now I see the sun
Now I see the sun
