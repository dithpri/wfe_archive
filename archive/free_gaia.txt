[b]The World of Free Gaia[/b]

[i]Free Gaia is an alt-Earth semi-roleplay region. Each nation and its leaders can have various political interests. All systems of alliance and government must be developed naturally and historically. How will the new world fare in comparison to the one we all live in?[/i]

The Primary Rule: 
ONLY ONE NATION PER META LEADER.
