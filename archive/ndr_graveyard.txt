It was raining outside. [color=purple]Cats and dogs[/color]. [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were soaked, could barely fly, and perched on [i]your[/i] region&amp;#8217;s windowsill. Seeing the poor, drenched, birds, a group of natives decided to let the seemingly unassuming and innocuous birds in the house.

They feasted, tearing into meat and mice while their hosts shared bread and stew. But when night fell and the natives slept, the Hawks got to work, painting the walls, tagging every surface, leaving their mark. By morning, they were gone, the house transformed, and the natives still snored, none the wiser.
