[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Transfered control: 25.08.14[/I]

[color=red]This region was refounded by Nazi [nation=short]Captain Woodhouse[/nation] from [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region], as a fake victory against [region]The MT Army[/region]. 

It was then lost by Nazis and refounded/protected by [region]Freedom Justice Alliance[/region]&amp;#39;s leader [nation]BlackGreenWhite[/nation].

It has now been transferred to [region]The MT Army[/region], keeping it out of fascist hands for the foreseeable future.

We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
