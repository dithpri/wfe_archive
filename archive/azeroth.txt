Some folks from [region]the Empire of Mare Nostrum[/region] searched far and wide for a home. The wind howled and the snow fell, but up ahead they spotted a nice war region. Luckily for you, they found your region. Now, your region is a nice comfy home for the Marian Legions, the Sekhmet Legion, and some friends!
