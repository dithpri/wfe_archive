Gliese 105 as an NS region contains three continuities: Kalgamania, Garmageddon, and Ingffhaestia are part of one continuity where the tabulons are invaded by imperialist humans, but then rise up but form their own fascist dictatorship; Kaywell and Tellurius are part of another continuity where the tabulons start off as the imperialists; Morbidia, Osuwa, and the two Kerolons are part of a third, significantly more complex timeline.
