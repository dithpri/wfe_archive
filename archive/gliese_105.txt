All nations here are future tech, managed by the same person, and not necessarily representative of said person&#39;s IRL beliefs. Gliese 105 as an NS region contains two continuities. Kalgamania is part of one continuity where the tabulons are invaded by imperialist humans, but then rise up but form their own fascist dictatorship. Kaywell and Tellurius are part of another continuity where the tabulons start off as the imperialists. Garmageddon and the Ingffhaestian Federation exist in both continuities, but not in the same way.
