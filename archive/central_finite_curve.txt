The central finite curve is a portion of the multiverse in which the laws of physics and mathematics are largely consistent with each other, outside of which only a nonsensical hellscape of non-euclidian horrors exist. Nations in the CFC may exist in the same or different universe, with wildly varying histories, but all within the same continuity. If that sounds confusing, that&#39;s just because it is. Welcome to the Central Finite Curve!
