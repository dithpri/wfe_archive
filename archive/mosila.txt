Citizens of Mosila, you are now under Imperial Laws. A strict curfew will be enforced between 6 pm evening and 6:30 morning. This curfew will be enforced if found to be in violation. Patrols will be frequent. Local law enforcement has been disbanded and Imperial forces will be assuming direct control. This includes control of criminal justice, civilian governance and space travel. All public holidays and celebrations will be suspended until further notice. A citizen representative will be appointed. Cantina&#146;s and other social venues will remain open. Violation of these restrictions will be met with immediate detainment. Glory to the Empire.
