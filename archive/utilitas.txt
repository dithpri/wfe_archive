[color=blue][b]Welcome to Utilitas[/color][/b]

[b][color=orange]The Utilitist Republic of Utilitas is a region based upon the principles of Utilitism, a philosophy which rejects the strict duality of raider vs. defender gameplay and defender morality, in exchange for a system which maximizes interest to the region.  Our region has a unique political system, a meritocratic bureaucracy, and a military that fights for the rights of the vulnerable, and attacks the aggressors of NationStates at their root.
