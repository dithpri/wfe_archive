[b][nation]Merethin[/nation]&#39;s R/D puppet storage and embassy hold.[/b]

[nation]Merethin[/nation] is temporarily appointed Governor for card purposes; the rest of the time, my puppet [nation]One True Nine[/nation] manages the region.

[i]&quot;A little reckless, around the edges
Call it young dumb love and it&#39;s just enough
Keep me guessing
How the story unfolds with you&quot;[/i]

[b]If you&#39;re a fellow raider, you can request embassies here.
If you&#39;re a friend outside of raiding, send the request to [region]Merethin City[/region].
If you&#39;re an embassy collector, forget about it.[/b]
