[i]Brand new state, Brand new state, gonna treat you great!
    Gonna give you barley, carrots and pertaters,
    Pasture fer the cattle, Spinach and Termayters!
    Flowers on the prairie where the June bugs zoom,
    Plen&amp;#39;y of air and plen&amp;#39;y of room,
    Plen&amp;#39;y of room to swing a rope!
    Plen&amp;#39;y of heart and plen&amp;#39;y of hope!

    Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweepin&amp;#39; down the plain,
    And the wavin&amp;#39; wheat can sure smell sweet
    When the wind comes right behind the rain.
    Oklahoma, ev&amp;#39;ry night my honey lamb and I
    Sit alone and talk and watch a hawk makin&amp;#39; lazy circles in the sky.

    We know we belong to the land
    And the land we belong to is grand!
    And when we say - Yeeow] A-yip-i-o-ee ay!
    We&amp;#39;re only sayin&amp;#39; You&amp;#39;re doin&amp;#39; fine, Oklahoma! Oklahoma - O.K.[/i]
