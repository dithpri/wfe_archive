[b]Project MYRA[/b] is the effort to co-create one shared fantasy world (named &quot;Myra&quot;) with an unlimited amount of people over an unlimited amount of years. 

We have been going for over 35 years and will be going 35 years from now...

We have our share of hostile takeover attempts here, by spammers and others, but welcome anyone willing to co-create a fantasy land to establish their home with us.
