The Continent of Durron is full of countries with a strong religious history. They believe that they are a chosen people that are guided by Eleven Divine Dragons, ten of which have a country dedicated to them.  They have a minor caste system, where those who are descended from the original one thousand warriors not only have pure blood flowing through them, but sacred blood, and therefore have more power and opportunities within their holy states. While some gave formed an alliance under the religion, other countries feel that the religion had too much power over their state, and formed a country where the Holy Lords(their version of the Pope) have less power over state affairs.
