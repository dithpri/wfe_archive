Welcome to the once Democratic, roleplaying region of [region]Satius[/region], and most importantly; the home for those who left [region]Audaxia[/region] at the time to attempt to rid themselves of the [region]Audax[/region] name as the group did not have the region of [region]Audax[/region] in their possession at the time. The youngest sister region of the [region]Audax[/region] Trio. Once considered a new or final frontier of roleplay; yet now all [region]Satius[/region] is nothing now besides a barren wasteland.

[hr]Currently a historical region for the upcoming reboot of the region of [b]Audax[/b].[hr]
