[i][b]Welcome to [region]Satius[/region], Traveler.[/b][/i]
[i]Once thought to be the possible new frontier of role play, has became a wasteland.[/i][hr]

Don&#39;t be upset though, because in the coming months, there will be a new image of roleplay being created. Don&#39;t worry about what it will be or try to think what it&#39;s going to be, because when it&#39;s there-you will know.

[b]Satius[/b] is now dead. There is no bringing it back. It&#39;s going to remain that way forever and it will go into the books as a failed attempt to fix a community that was never broken to begin with. It was the structure of the region that broke the community. Not the community itself.[hr][color=#660033][b]Farewell to [region]Audax[/region], [region]Audaxia[/region], and [region]Satius[/region]. Most importantly, farewell to the [region]Audax[/region] community. You all helped me become the person I am today.
