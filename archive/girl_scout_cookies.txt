Girl Scout Cookies is a region. It&amp;#39;s definitely the fastest growing region in the world. You should stick with us because eventually we&amp;#39;ll be big, maybe in like a decade but still eventually!. Plus, our swaggy yet sophisticated flag and title suggest our playful nature but that we also don&amp;#39;t F*** around and we get down to business.

Please endorse [nation]Ganjia[/nation] if you are in the WA.

And endorse [nation]Nearly Finland[/nation] too because he&amp;#39;s been here since the beginning and he&amp;#39;s pretty steezy.
