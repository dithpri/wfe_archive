[b][i]Huzzah Huzzah Huzzah[/b][/i] This Region has been raided [region]The Pirates Crew[/region]
-----------------------------------------------
[color=red][i]Fifteen men on a dead man&amp;#39;s chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
The mate was fixed by the bosun&amp;#39;s pike
The bosun brained with a marlinspike
And cookey&amp;#39;s throat was marked belike
It had been gripped by fingers ten;
And there they lay, all good dead men
Like break o&amp;#39;day in a boozing ken
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.[/i][/color]
