[color=red]Once a Nazi and Fascist region, taken out by [region]Antifa[/region] forces, now secured by [region]The MT Army[/region] to serve as a living museum against hate. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]
