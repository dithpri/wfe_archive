I am the LORD thy Dog

Thou shalt have no other Bones

No worship of pigeons or other feathered friends

Do not take the DOG&#39;s name in vain

Remember thy feeding times

Honor thy owners

Thou shalt not feed the cat before me

Thou shalt not pet the cat before me

Thou shalt not refuse me any treats

Thou shalt not blame me for eating the shoes

Thou shalt not covet bones nor my treats nor my bed
