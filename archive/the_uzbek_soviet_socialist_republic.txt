[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[color=red][b]The iron fist is evidently a bit rusty for [region]the Greater German Reich[/region], because on 17th April 2012, this region was reclaimed from the fascist imperialist Nazis by elite and noble comrades [nation=short]of the Free Socialist Territories[/nation] and [nation=short]Fynnbays[/nation] of [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region], in the name of:[/color][color=red]ANTI[/color][color=black]FA![/b][/color]

-------------------------------

[color=blue]Protected in memory of the [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] concept, whilst also highlighting the failure of then Nazi [nation]Captain Woodhouse[/nation]. His attempt to infiltrate the [region]Antifa[/region] network failed and over 50 regions were handed over to [region]The MT Army[/region].[/color]
