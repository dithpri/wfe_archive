This nation doesn&#39;t care if man or woman, as long as they don&#39;t expect many rights. Rights are overrated. People are considered resources. Democracy is overrated; however, not frowned upon. Dictatorships are the most productive, and the people will learn to like it or else bodybags. The dictators people aren&#39;t as ignorant as stated.
