[b]News:[/b] There is currently a dispute  over who is the manager of our regional map. For now, those who want to be on the map should contact [nation]Nevanmaa[/nation], but don&amp;#39;t expect immediate reply. Esquarium thanks you for your cooperation and understanding.

Esquarium warmly welcomes [nation=short]Gaveo[/nation] to our region!
