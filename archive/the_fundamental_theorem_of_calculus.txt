The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of the derivative of a function with the concept of the function&#39;s integral.

The first part of the theorem is that the indefinite integral of a function is related to its antiderivative, and can be reversed by differentiation. This part of the theorem guarantees the existence of antiderivatives for continuous functions.

The second part of the theorem is that the definite integral of a function can be computed by using any one of its infinitely-many antiderivatives. This part of the theorem has key practical applications because it markedly simplifies the computation of definite integrals.
