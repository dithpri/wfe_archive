The first fundamental theorem of calculus states that, if [i]f[/i] is continuous on the closed interval [a,b] and [i]F[/i] is the indefinite integral of f on [a,b], then
int_a^bf(x)dx=F(b)-F(a). 	

This result, while taught early in elementary calculus courses, is actually a very deep result connecting the purely algebraic indefinite integral and the purely analytic (or geometric) definite integral.

The second fundamental theorem of calculus holds for f a continuous function on an open interval I and a any point in I, and states that if F is defined by F(x)=int_a^xf(t)dt, then F^&#39;(x)=f(x) at each point in I.
