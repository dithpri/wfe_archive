[color=green][b]One day a small racoon and a bored sheep went for a walk through the forest. What was meant to be a quick stroll turned into a 4 hour hike but they didn&#39;t mind. They helped their fellow animals of the world until they discovered this little region.

The sight of it made the racoon cry so the sheep tried to make the racoon smile again by painting it green.[/b][/color]
