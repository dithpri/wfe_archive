[b][color=red]Ah, Schadenfreude. A German word meaning taking joy from the misery of others, a word used by the Nazis of &amp;#39;[region]The Greater German Reich[/region]&amp;#39; very recently to describe the joy they take at creating misery in conquering regions in their telegrams to their hated enemy, the Comrades of [region]The Internationale[/region].[/color][/b]

[b]But we in [region]The Internationale[/region] are confiscating and using the word Schadenfreude now, because we&amp;#39;re using it to describe our joy at seeing the misery the Nazis will be suffering when they realise the Nazi and Fascist region who the Nazi GGR had relations with, &amp;#39;[region]Axis Power Nations[/region]&amp;#39;, has been seized in the name of anti-Fascism and anti-Nazism by [region]The Internationale[/region] and will no longer be a place for the Nazis and Fascists to spread their hateful views.[/b]
