[color=#BF4000]Welcome to the Noosphere[/color]

The Noosphere is located in a far distant Solar System and encompasses it in it&#39;s entirely. The Noosphere is known for it&#39;s unnatural physical environment, which led to its reclassification as Special Hyperspace Zone. The Noosphere contains various habitable Worlds and a huge amount of smaller but inhabitable Planetoids and Asteroids alike. 

Most notably is the Noospherian Ringworld near the central Sun which has been build several Eons ago by a long forgotten Race. 
 
Until recently the Noosphere has been abandoned largely. Renewed exploration efforts of this region of Space have re-commenced recently.
