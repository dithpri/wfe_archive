The Noosphere is located nearby a remote star cluster. Known for it&#39;s unusual physical environment, it had been classified as a special hyperspace zone. The sphere contains various habitable worlds and a huge amount of smaller but inhabitable planetoids and asteroids, and last but not least the Noospherian Ringworld which has been constructed millions of years ago by a long forgotten precursor race.

Currently the Noosphere has been largely abandoned with few star nations retaining a nominal presence.
