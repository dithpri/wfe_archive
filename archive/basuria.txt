[b][color=3543de]Welcome to Basuria![/color][/b]

[color=1e2ed9]Basuria, as a frontier region, does not have a governor, meaning that chaos reigns free here. However, the World Assembly Delegate has the power to bring order, but must be careful as their position can be easily usurped!

Diplomacy is key; anyone can become the delegate with enough persuasion! Good luck![/color]
