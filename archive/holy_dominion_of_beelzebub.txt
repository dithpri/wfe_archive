The holy dominion was founded by the rebel Duke Belzeebub as an outpost of freedom in a world ruled by authority and the tyrany of a celestial monarchy.  As such there is no religion, no rule by another being and humans are free to wage war, go to Wal-Mart and read sordid literature without burning in hell.  The region is very beautiful in a way and despite pockets of wealth people are very happy.  GDP shrinks every year and inflation is kept purposefully high in the pursuit of the good life.
