Our dream&#146;s meaning the earth will never dash
when morning murmurs meld in single chorus,
and silken dawns dissolve before us.

The foul scythe will then be burnt to ash,
the rippling grey will crush to diamond dust,
the regrets drowned in the silent ocean,
our spirits liberated by devotion.

The false sun&#146;s glitter will fade at last.

We are neither stunned by midday desert splendor
nor to the jewels our wills surrender, no;
we are dead for golden coin&#146;s sake.

And robed in silken moon rays we are dressed,
by suns that shine at midnight we are blessed,
and at the darkest hour&#133; we are awake.
