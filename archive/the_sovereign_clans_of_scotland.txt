Although their politics may not be the same they work together strongly to help eachother out.  Some are war mongers and others are peaceful delegates.  No matter they coexist together harmoniously.  It is said that each of the regions have top secret projects that they won&amp;#39;t even tell eachother about.  And a &amp;quot;Brotherhood of Nod&amp;quot; has recently take up residence secretly in one of the islands that make up the region.  It is known that this region is a mystery in, and of itself indeed.
