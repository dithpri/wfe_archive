The Independent International Forum is an open discussion platform through which diverse countries can safely interact without prejudice. Nations of all political backgrounds are welcome to contribute, and the (usually) only mandatory legislature is that of a security agreement, allowing us to protect this forum for all who wish to express their voice (in a non-derogatory manner). Many projects will be centred around polls and data collection to gain a greater understanding of our constituents, provide inspiration for other members, and perhaps assist nations with their own diplomatic endeavours.

We hope to see you soon!
