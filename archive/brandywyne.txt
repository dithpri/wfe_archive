[b]W[/b]hat is Brandywyne, you might ask? 
Brandywyne is small castle on the edge of the existence. Beyond our building is the eternal void. 
The Brandywyne River flows on either side of the castle, and then flows off into the blackness. 
With the edge of the universe so close, magical things happen around the land. Enter at your own risk.
