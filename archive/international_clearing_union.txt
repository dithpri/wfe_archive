The International Clearing Union (ICU) is an institution responsible for for the clearance of trade between nations. It this regard, it operates similarly to a trade exchange with every country as a member. The organisation was established at the 1944 United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in the United States. The idea for the ICU comes from British economist John Maynard Keynes who designed the organisation to regulate international currency exchanges and a global currency known as the &#39;bancor&#39;. All trade between ICU members is denominated in bancors, which has become its own unit of account. The currency has an exchange rate that is fixed to other national currencies.
