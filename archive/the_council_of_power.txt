[color=blue]History: We are the progressed version of the Council of Fantasian Masters. The original Council moved here to this new location also bringing along its greatest allies, Air Temple Region and The Republic of Nations. Our founder also helped to create Glass Gallows, our biggest ally and an important part of our anti-WA movements.[/color]
