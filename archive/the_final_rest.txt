&quot;In Death There Is Peace&quot;

The world is corrupted. War and invaders lurk in every shadow. In this chaos only one thing is absolute. Death. Dying is not a curse, it is freedom.

Here, in The Final Rest, there is but one promise: Peace.

We will not recruit.
We will not promote.
We will not kick.

Welcome to Death, enjoy your stay.
