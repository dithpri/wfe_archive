Brick by brick, we rise&#151;not as conquerors, but as architects of the future. We are an assembly of minds, a fortress of innovation, and a force that no single state can command. We forge alliances beyond the constraints of politics, beyond the grip of history, beyond the limits of what has been deemed possible.
