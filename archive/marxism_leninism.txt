[i]I already destroyed the baseless case that CAPS is the only significant victory:

[region]The Great North Korea[/region]
[region]The True Communist Region[/region]
[region]Grenada[/region]
[region]The Cooperative Union[/region]
[region]International Socialists[/region]
[region]The NationStates Comintern[/region]
[region]Marxism Leninism[/region]

These are all just some of the significant territorial gains we&amp;#39;ve had. What about you? Yerfilag, Aedorin and Libertarians - dead regions that fell into your hands like ripe fruit. No effort whatsoever was put into taking these aside from a few button-clicks.[/i]
