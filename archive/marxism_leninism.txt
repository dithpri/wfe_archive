[i]I already destroyed the baseless case that CAPS is the only significant victory[/i]:

[region]The Great North Korea[/region]
[region]The True Communist Region[/region]
[region]Grenada[/region]
[region]The Cooperative Union[/region]
[region]International Socialists[/region]
[region]The NationStates Comintern[/region]
[region]Marxism Leninism[/region]
