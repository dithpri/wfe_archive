[color=#48D1CC] [b] Welcome to [u]Nova Regalia[/u], a casual modern-tech roleplay region! [/b] [/color]

If raiding/defending isn&#39;t your thing and you just want a casual place to RP and nation-build, NR is the region for you. Each one of our residents is free to role-play with others and develop the culture of their nation at their own pace. Feel free to chat with the other residents, create ridiculously detailed factbook entries or enjoy some of [nation=short+noflag]Salvatrice[/nation]&#39;s crab stew.
