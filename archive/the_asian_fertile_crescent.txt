The Asian Fertile Crescent, the most dynamic economic region of the world, is actually a really tumultuous place, were there are permanent wars. This region is also extremely vast, so it represent a risk but before all an advantage to live in there. The people in there are pretty cynic and evil, but really religious. Every year, we see great Union between people for the Great Religious Events.

The region is sometimes named : &#39;&#39;The Land of Freedom but Authority.&#39;&#39;
