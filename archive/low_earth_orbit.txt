Global warming burnt your house down? Rising sea levels flooded said house? Don&#39;t like Earth? Well, you&#39;re in luck.

Featuring Low Earth Orbit or (LEO) for short. We take your little island nations and haul them up into space with giant rocket engines. Whilst their warranty has expired, we are proud to say that they&#39;re still relatively safe with only 33 accidents a week. You are guaranteed to get to LEO, although you may arrive in tiny, tiny pieces but that&#39;s a small issue. Medical care and insurance sold separately. 

Do we have an official ideology? Ehhh... No. Do what you like. Space is infinite and so are the possibilities. You can do whatever you want and we don&#39;t care. Just don&#39;t blow your own habitat up. They cost money.
