The Buddhist Brotherhood is dedicated to advancing human rights, religious harmony, economic equality and world peace. While our guiding principles are founded from those of Buddhism and Taoism, we seek to avoid evangelicalism, sectarianism, and conflict where possible.

We encourage the use of diplomacy and communication as a means to both, establish and maintain peaceful relationships, and to resolve issues that may lead to further conflict. While all nations in our region are free to communicate with others, we expect that it should be done so with this principle in mind. Should any issues arise with any of our members, please notify our WA Delegate or Founder.
