[color=red][b]The Sentinel Isle[/b][/color]

The [region]Sentinel Isle[/region] is a region created from the aftermath of World War I and II. Bloodbath after bloodbath, obliteration after extermination, the some survivors went on to create [nation]Sentinia[/nation], which ruled over most of the region for years. After some time, their colonies seceded, and other nations were formed, but the [nation]Sentinia[/nation] is still running and has a strong influence in the region.
