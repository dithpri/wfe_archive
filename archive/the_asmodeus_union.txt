 [b]Welcome to the burning lands of the Asmodeus Union traveler! [/b] 

Here, the bodies of those deemed unworthy are laid out for use as paving stones by those worthier then then themselves. Nations contained within the region are hand picked by the administration, who have proven themselves on the international scene of being both sound of mind and understanding of the basics that once made this site great to behold. Those nations faint of heart, or unworthy of this unions blessing need not apply for admittance, for denial of admittance by the administration is as good as a death sentence, for the unworthy fuel the fires of the Union with their blood and sweat.
