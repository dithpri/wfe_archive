And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see! So I looked, and beheld a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. Power was given unto him over the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.....

For the great day of his wrath has come; and who shall be able to stand against him?
