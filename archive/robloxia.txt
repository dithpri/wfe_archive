Roblox is a massively multiplayer online game creation platform that allows users to design their own games and play a wide variety of different types of games created by other users through Roblox Studio. Roblox hosts social network games constructed of Lego-like virtual blocks. Co-founder and CEO David Baszucki started testing the first demos in 2004 under the name DynaBlocks. In 2005, it was renamed Roblox and became available for PCs. The platform was officially released in September 2006 by the Roblox Corporation. As of 2017, Roblox has 64 million monthly active players.
