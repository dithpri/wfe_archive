[b]Welcome to [color=red]NORTH AFRICA![/color][/b]

Founded 4/9/2010

After two and a half years of turmoil, North Africa has returned to its homeland! 

We welcome all ideologies, religions, races, creeds, colours to our lands as we look to create a [color=green]United Africa![/color]

When armies and empires against me were hurled
Firm as my native rock I have withstood the shock
