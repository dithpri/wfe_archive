Hello, and welcome to Eumeric!

Eumeric is anew regional project - the aim is to create an onsite roleplaying region, where nations are intertwined geographically, historically and culturally. The region promotes a wide variety of countries and will accept all governments from dictatorships to democracies and all settings from tropic to arctic.

In the name of realism the region will not take into account game statistics and populations.
