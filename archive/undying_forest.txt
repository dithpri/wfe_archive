Although most of the forest has indeed died, the region takes its name from it. It&amp;#39;s a diverse region full of all sorts of different nations.

We are now setting up a regional government! We will vote sometime relatively soon on how we will set up the government, as well as what sort of regional government we will have! Yay, democracy! 

For now, we will have a direct democracy, of sorts, where each nation has one vote, and all nations get to vote.

(Motion may have passed?) We have 16 for a Republic, 1 opposing, 3 abstentions, 1 Pokemon, and 1 overused meme. The motion will pass if we get a simple majority of 18 nations.
