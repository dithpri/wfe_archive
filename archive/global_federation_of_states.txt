[b][color=darkblue]The North Pacific Army has tagged this region. We&#39;re only doing it because it&#39;s our job, really not very enthusiastic today sorry. There&#39;s some rum in the basement for the inconvenience, yadda yadda yadda. Malphe needs sleep, so does Bob but only because he&#39;s more easy to tolerate when he&#39;s not awake.
