The Imperial Kolechian Court has moved to Balder. Any undertaking with the Kolechian administration, shall have to be addressed there. Our gracious Emperor appointed a Ruling Steward, the Grand Duchy of New Van Diemen Land, to keep the region ordered, until his Third Coming, which will not be happening anytime soon.
