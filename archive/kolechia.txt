Kolechia is a neighboring country west of Arstotzka, bordered by Obristan, Antegria, Republia, and Impor. After the Six-Year War, entrants from and via Kolechia are finally able to enter Arstotzka through the border town Grestin, although Kolechian entrants occasionally face additional scrutiny at the border due to the terrorist threat some of them pose.
