[color=blue][b]Welcome to Aetherius![/b][/color]
[B]Happy Christmas and New Years![/B]

All are welcome in Aetherius. Aetherius is a closed canon RP region, and not a part of the greater NationStates Multiverse. We focus primarily on MT RPs, but non-canon Fantasy Tech, FT, and PT RP&#39;s are welcomed and encouraged. We aim to establish a friendly and warm environment where all are welcome to foster discussions and debates on a wide array of topics. Feel free to say hello and start up a new conversation!
