[color=blue][B]Welcome to Aetherius![/B][/color]

All are welcome in Aetherius. Aetherius is a closed canon RP region, and not a part of the greater NationStates Multiverse. We focus primarily on MT RPs, but non-canon Fantasy Tech, FT, and PT RP&#39;s are welcomed and encouraged. We aim to establish a friendly and warm environment where all are welcome to foster discussions and debates on a wide array of topics. Feel free to say hello and start up a new conversation!
