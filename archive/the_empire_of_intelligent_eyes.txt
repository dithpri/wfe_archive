A vast island where only the most evil and corrupt governments lurk.  Come at your own peril...

The history of this powerful empire is not entirely clear.  It began when [nation]Intelligent Eyes discovered the island.  The island was stolen from the nomads that roamed the countrysides and is now a safe haven for any nation that is on the run.  (Nations must be evil/corrupt/not right in the head to join)
