In this elegant region a strong union has been forged through careful friendship and tenuous alliances. The founding nations of Pyonaea, Plegeia, Lorraine-Rose, and  Zuraccie came together in the Treaty of Arwendall. 

On this day only two of the founding nations still hold land, but with their loss has been born three new members of the region, The Serene Republic of Azn, The Republic of New Canstopia, and The Armed Republic of Havsters. Upon their creation, each with their own paths to nationhood, they have chosen to become a part of a small region that welcomes them with open arms. 



This is a region focused on role play. A map for this nation is in progress of being drawn up.
