[color=ff9900][b][u]Welcome to the ROR![/b][/u][/color]
[color=4b4b4b][i][b]The Region of Regions[/b] is a medium-sized region of mostly detestable environments and a strong manufacturing base. All nations are open to join. The [b]ROR[/b] is neutral in all extraregional affairs and has no official relations with outside regions beyond private trade. Protection is granted by the starving, delirious masses of [nation=long]New Nation of Peeps[/nation] and by the great strength of Spurmberp the Dewmaster. As such, it does not possess a standing offensive military organization. Or, much of any organization in particular...
