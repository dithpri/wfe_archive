The Great city of Chicago was formed in the 1680s along Lake Michigan. The city itself prides itself on being formerly part of the notorious rust belt, its food like the Deep Dish Pizza, and having a plethora of great sports teams. These great sport teams consist of the Bears, Blackhawks, and the Bulls.
