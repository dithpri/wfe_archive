[color=blue][b]Welcome to the LittleBigPlanet Union![/b][/color]
 
A group of clans dedicated to making LBP a better place. This is our political region for those of us who like political hub bub.
We are a small defender region. If you need any help defending a founderless region from invaders we might be able to lend a hand. Our R/D forces are known as the [i]Independent States Allied Forces[/i] [ISAF] 

ISAF is currently trying to detag the [region]Land of Khan[/region] and set it up as a colony. There were no natives there to begin with so we are not disrupting anything.
