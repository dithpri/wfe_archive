Why hello there! Welcome to our region, just a few rules: don&#39;t spam the chat, be courteous (if you don&#39;t, I won&#39;t), don&#39;t be a traitor, and keep up with our guidelines if you join the treaty. Otherwise, enjoy! Endorse the current delegate, and then endorse the next delegate after they&#39;re elected.


Sadly I am only able to give each nation one title, so henceforth all additional titles will be listed below:
[nation=fruchtbarland], Minister of All Things Poll and Dancing Related, Lord of the Flies, Namer of Small Animals, First of His People to Reach Calculous IX, Brony Extraordinaire, Keeper of the Most Vile Name, Creator of All Things Un-Dank, Non-Believer of Shrek, and Furry Connoisseur.
