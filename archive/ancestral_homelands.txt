Why hello there! Welcome to our region, just a few rules: don&#39;t spam the chat, be courteous (if you don&#39;t, I won&#39;t), don&#39;t be a traitor, and keep up with our guide lines if you join the treaty. Otherwise, enjoy! Endorse the current delegate, and then endorse the next delegate after they&#39;re elected.
