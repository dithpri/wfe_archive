A project for looking beyond NationStates at other ways of being responsible for a &#39;territory&#39;. Whether in the physical (places on earth like a typical micronation), that&#39;s online like NationStates. Or the metaphysical like territory in games (Minecraft, No man&#39;s sky etc). 

Hoping to provide a philosophical look at the desire to create new nation states and to allow people with similar motivations to discuss and share ideas for creating their dream, physical or metaphysical, country.
