The Confederacy of Norn was established in the year 2016 as a medium for allied nations of various creeds and policies to create a stable, open market and a platform of mutual defense. Named for the Nordic beings that govern the &quot;destiny of gods and men&quot;, Norn allows for equal representation of both superpowers and less-influential city-states. Admission is earned, not given, and chosen policies are expected to be enforced in both region affairs and otherwise.
