Welcome to The Flying Spaghetti Monster Lands. 
We are a region devoted to the FSM. 
We generally don&#39;t care. Please remember to celebrate talk like a pirate day (September 19) and FSMas (December 25). May you forever be touched by his noodly appendage. 
Sorry about the mess. We were invaded. Still cleaning up. If your nation was ejected by invaders, please, feel free to rejoin. 
FSM in their infinite wisdom allowed the invasion, to remind us that... Hmmm... Not really sure. Let&#39;s pray. Have some pasta and beer. R&#39;amen
