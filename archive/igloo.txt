An igloo, also known as a snow house or snow hut, is a type of shelter built of snow, typically built when the snow is suitable. Although igloos are often associated with all Inuit and Eskimo peoples, they were traditionally used only by the people of Canada&#39;s Central Arctic and Greenland&#39;s Thule area.
