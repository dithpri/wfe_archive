The Chapter named Carcharodon Astra &#151;translated into Low Gothic as the Space Sharks, but known more widely as the Carcharodons - is a Space Marine Chapter of unknown provenance that has relatively recently carved for itself a dark and brutal legend in the bloody wake of the Badab War. Much of the information surrounding its history is shrouded in myth or allegory, but fragmented pieces of data point to it already being in existence as early as late M32, during the Astropath Wars. One thing is for certain, however: that the Chapter was given a sacred duty to travel the empty spaces beyond the Imperium&#39;s borders, seemingly forever, to seek out and destroy the enemies of Mankind.
