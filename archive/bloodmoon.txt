We are all Lycanthropes.  Bronies are welcome. My region, my rules, you do not like, you are more than welcome to leave. Other than that enjoy the region of BloodMoon.A few essential rules: Nudism is mandatory!!! Bring your own source of ammunition and such. All marriages are done as handfasting as opposed to traditional weddings. Anything else I will play by ear as it is brought tomy attention.
