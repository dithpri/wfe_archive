A [colour=#FF9900]triumvir&amp;#257;tus[/colour] is a political regime ruled or dominated by three powerful individuals known as triumviri. The arrangement can be formal or informal. Though the three are notionally equal, this is rarely the case in reality. The term can also be used to describe a state with three different military leaders who all claim to be the sole leader.[hr]
