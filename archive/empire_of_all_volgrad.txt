The Empire of All Volgrad was made by its civil war: the Volgrad rebellion, orchestrated by the duchies of Lesser and Greater Volgrad (Tirisia and Gregoria) aligned with Imperial ideology and guided by the silent hand of the Vampire Duke of Altfrost. While the capital city of Volgrad remains under Imperial control, much of the countryside festers with insurgency, allegiances shifting between banner and blood oath. Altfrost, claiming neutrality, harbors a chilling influence that has spread beyond borders&#151;its aristocracy of the night whispering into mortal ears from candlelit salons and snowbound courts.
