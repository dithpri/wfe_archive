The Union of the Anglican Communion or the U.A.C is a region developed for fellow Anglican Countries. Its main aims is to promote peace, prosperity and to acknowledge the existence and love of God and the work he does today through the Holy Spirit. The U.A.C also asks of states to seek common ground between rivals and enemies in order to develop the perfect world in which we all seek for.
We believe that God works through everyone and we wait for the return of Jesus to this Earth in order to judge the living and the dead.
