This conglomerate of nations is devoted to the reformation, or, if need be, destruction of the World Assembly. For too long, the WA, or rather the way it is structured, has oppressed its member nations through tyranny by the many. Those with the most influence, those in command of the largest regions, those who are willing to promote or reject laws fro the sake fo their own power-hungry needs; these are the people dominate the WA through their sheer number of followers, whilist the Average Joe has nearly no say! The WA needs to come back to its roots, so it is our mission to lead the reformation!
