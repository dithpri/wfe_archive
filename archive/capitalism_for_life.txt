We are a new breed of region. We want to see power spread evenly among our delegates. We support capitalism as we believe it gives economic freedoms, political rights and civil rights to others and the important freedom of private business which will give us the largest economy in the world. We care deeply about the citizens of our nations and would love to see them enjoy their tax-free lives and don&#39;t have to worry about a big government. We would love to see our citizens enjoy the freedom of free speech which is the core of our region, we enjoy seeing our citizens enjoy religious and political freedoms. We would love to see you join us.
