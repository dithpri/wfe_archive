Welcome to the Silver Lake Region. One of the many regions striving to be a part of this world, it has many different parts and is rather small compared to other regions it is on the continent of Antarctica while also unearthly cold there. While not being people who came from other regions this place has surprisingly people who have lived there all their life having thought to be survivors or people who got lost and came upon this place to call camp it has now later become a region which is now known by the whole world.
If you have any questions feel free to ask anyone who might have answers, and enjoy your time in the Silver Lake Region!
