Greetings nations,

Welcome to Raven, the region where you get a say. Elections are held at regular intervals. These elections can be about anything from &amp;quot;Should Raven have a password?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;what must happen to the smoking policies of -insert nation-?&amp;quot;. You can ask the region to elect upon something of your choosing (e.g. an issue) by sending me a telegram. (Elections will be held via polls.)

Want to know more? Just send me a telegram.

I hope to see you around in Raven,
The founder of Raven and Darke Raven,
Rhyt

Upcoming elections: &amp;quot;Should Netain spend more money on arms?&amp;quot;     - This issue will affect the entire region.
Election date: Thursday, April 3rd - Lasting for three days
