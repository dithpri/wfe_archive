By the Authority of the Emperor, Ruler of all the Lands and Seas, Skies and Stars, all Shadows and blinking Lights, the Grand Imperial Protectorate is raised from the murky swamp of the dark ages into the holy light of Eternity.

The Emperors decree allows life to exist peacefully and to bask in the safety his eternal Power provides. 

But as do the blades of his warriors, this arrangement has two sides, one always ready to cut all who defy him, in action as in speech.

All Glory to the Emperor.
