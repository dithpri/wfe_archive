The United Colonies of Old were formed after a vicious bloodbath of foreign invaders. We were formed to protect our people and to expand in the ever popular dragon trade. The United Colonies of Old are open to anyone who wishes to escape the horrible spammy reign of their region, so long as it not be ye who took my crumble fool. If you join, you will be welcome to participate in discussions, polls, endorsements, but you can also reside in our region peacefully and quietly.
