[b][color=#367ba3]About the Region[/color][/b]
[color=#26b3de]The Global Union Consortium is a region primarily focused on roleplaying postmodern and fantasy tech, although if you&#39;re not in those categories, you&#39;re still welcome to join.
We&#39;re an up-and-coming region, currently in the process of establishing a RP setting and formalizing such features as a dedicated regional wiki and other features. 
In other news, please abide by the endorsement cap.[/color]
