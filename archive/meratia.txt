Meratia is a hyper-realistic region (Planet) absent of dramatic wars, except those that happened in the past that are made canon. Realistic modern politics and trade are preferred. Time is a major factor in this region, a military cannot be fully on alert in a matter of hours, trade sanctions rarely happen immediately, and land will not exchange hands easily. All who join will be able to develop their own culture, or use an existing one which will determine their place on the map (a planet of its very own). 

Activity is unimportant, as long as you give national updates (however brief they are) periodically. This region is intended for realistic players who do not have the time to be very active, but does not discourage constant activity.
