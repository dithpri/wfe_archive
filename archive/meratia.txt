Meratia is a realistic, MT, roleplaying region that is meant to be a one-size-fits-all. Inexperienced players will be accepted as small, fledgling nations. Experienced long term residents will have the option of joining as a First World superpower. We primarily focus on trade, diplomacy, and historic RP&#39;s in order to shape our region.
