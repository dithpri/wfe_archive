The Confederation of Independent States (CIS) Is a confederation of roaming ex-soviet states now adapting to a new modern world of freedom. While some nations work to promote capitalism and democracy, some are trying to rebuild their greater soviet regime and continue communism while other nations have abandoned both ideas and are now plunged into civil war, anarchy, and despotism.
