[i]On 18 March 1871, soldiers of the Commune&#39;s National Guard killed two French army generals, and the Commune refused to accept the authority of the French government. The Commune governed Paris for two months, until it was suppressed by the regular French Army during &quot;La semaine sanglante&quot; (&quot;The Bloody Week&quot;) beginning on 21 May 1871.

Debates over the policies and outcome of the Commune had significant influence on the ideas of Karl Marx, who described it as an example of the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;.[/i] - Wikipedia
