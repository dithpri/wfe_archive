The Solar Union is a loose supranational organization meant to keep the peace and commerce going within the Solar System. This is an interplanetary forum where member worlds are able to discuss issues at stake between member worlds but not interfere with the internal affairs of said worlds. Interplanetary space is governed and peace maintained through small forces not alligned with any particular world. This is not the UN, but it does provide a place for tiny asteroid colonies to have a voice and not be drowned out by larger member worlds. It also provides a collective umbrella should an external threat arise.
