Welcome to [region]OrangeJuice[/region]! We are glad you&#146;re here! Take a look around, grab a beer. I hope stay a while though, because I could not bear to see you go. Soon we will have offsite forums  working, I hope these rhymes keep you smirking. We&#146;ll make a map and a roleplay section, come drop in for a session! 
Join in with regional politics, and help with things we need to fix. We have some clubs, guilds, and factions for you, and you can even start one too! Below you&#146;ll find all the stuff you need, or you can ask questions on the RMB! Now this paragraphs coming to an end, so join the fun and make some friends.
