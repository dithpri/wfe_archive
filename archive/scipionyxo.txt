Scipionyxo is an ideal place to start a nation. There are not many rules. The only rule we do have is to retain peace with other regions. If you don&#39;t know where to go, Scipionyxo is a good place to start. Archaeopteryx, prime minister of Saltasauridia and leader of Scipionyxo, has total power, though you will not be ejected from the region unless there is a specific, sensible, reason for it. If you are at any time upset with Scipionyxo, you are free to go, no offense taken. 

The theme is dinosaurs!!!!!
