Sovereign states, Republics, Democracies. What is a nation if boolin&#39; is non-existent? To bool is to live and to live is to bool. If a state does not bool it is doomed to mediocrity and despair. A people who looks down on boolin&#39; looks down us. Do what you will to cease that opinion, for that opinion is wrong. A booling nation is a happy nation and this Federation will always be BOOLIN&#39;.
