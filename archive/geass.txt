An alternate reality of our real Earth, heavily based upon the mecha anime &amp;#39;Code Geass&amp;#39;, with the Holy Empire of Solvada (a roman-influenced super-powerful empire) replacing Britannia in this depiction. Canon, canon-alteration, and fanon nations alike are welcome in this region, and we enjoy RP more than anything else.
