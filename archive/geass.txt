Loosely based on the anime series Code Geass, this region focuses on establishing a role-playing environment, with the setting being an alternate history of our Earth. In this setting, a powerful nation known as the Holy Empire of Solvada has achieved global hegemony, and enacts rule of law across the entire world. However, this great empire must balance the needs of its own people with keeping the peace in the United Commonwealth of Nations, the international organization through which the Empire holds its influence. Can Solvada hold onto its power and maintain peace and order in the world? Or will one of the other nations rise to prominence and shatter the unipolarity of this geopolitical stage? Only time will tell.
