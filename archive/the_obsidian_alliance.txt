The name of The Obsidian Alliance has been changed by popular vote to &quot;The Alliance of Aska&quot;.

A once-together nation comes back together in a alliance to protect each other from further warfare and hardships.
 NOTE: There is a lot more lore to be added whenever the group gets together and actually makes the said lore.
