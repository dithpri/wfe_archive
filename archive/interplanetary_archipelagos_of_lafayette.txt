The Interplanetary Archipelagos of Lafayette is a region of impossible tunnel-connected regions between planets. These planets are Xera and Finisil.
The capital, Lafayette, is on Earth in the South Pacific, although the majority of the population lives on Xera, where it is temperate year round. Finisil is mostly covered in ice, but there is a jungle near its equator. Finisil has a gravity of 1/3g and Xera has one of 1/5g. The people of Xera, protesting the government&amp;#39;s denial to begin conquest of the nearby and uninhabited Ki&amp;#39;i, have decided to create a tunnel system to Ki&amp;#39;i and begin mining the resources the planet (1.5 times the size of earth) has to offer.
