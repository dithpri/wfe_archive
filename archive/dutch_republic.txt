The Dutch Republic&#151;officially known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands (Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden)&#151;was a republic in Europe existing from 1581 to 1795, preceding the Batavian Republic, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and ultimately the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands.

During the Dutch Golden Age in the late 16th century onward, the Dutch Republic dominated world trade in the 17th century, conquering a vast colonial empire and operating the largest fleet of merchantmen of any nation. The Dutch had a merchant fleet of 16000 ships. This is more than the fleets of all the other European powers combined. The County of Holland was the wealthiest and most urbanized region in the world.
