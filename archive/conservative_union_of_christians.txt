The Conservative Union of Christians believe in a democratic based government in which the people rule. We promote self-worth, individual freedom, and personal responsibility. The Union believes in a capitalistic free market enterprise economic system. We believe all people are created equal and are endowed rights, not by government, but by God. We are a Christian region that believes in traditional conservative family and public values.
