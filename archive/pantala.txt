Pantala, also known as the lost continent by the dragons of Pyrrhia, is one of the two known continents in the Wings of Fire series, the other being Pyrrhia. It takes several days of traveling from the west of Pyrrhia to get there. Its existence was hinted at occasionally, before being confirmed at the end of Darkness of Dragons. The Pantalan dragon tribes consist of the SilkWings, HiveWings, LeafWings, and the now-extinct BeetleWings.
