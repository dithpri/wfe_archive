[b]It&#39;s the spooky month, so some spooky hawks from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to go Trick-or-Treating! We flew from region to region, knocking on doors, but there were no treats to be had. Of course, that left us with no choice but to play a trick on your region! If you want to play some tricks too, [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]Come join us![/url]

But the biggest trick was to be played on the Commanders debating name order.
