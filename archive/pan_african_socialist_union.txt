The Pan-African Socialist Union is an alliance of socialist/communist African nations created with the intent to build community between far-leftists by promoting discourse regarding the history of far-leftism and the ideology behind it, but also to unite African nations under a single banner, brought together under the ideals of Anti-capitalism, Anti-colonialism, and Anti-fascism. Other non-African socialist/communist nations are welcome as well. Workers of the World, Unite!
