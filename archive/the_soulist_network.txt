The Soulist Network is a region dedicated to the study and pursuit of Soulism. Soulism is a left-wing anarchist ideology that supports altruism, individualism and the belief that free will must not be restrained, advocating for the abolition of personal and private property, all unjustified hierarchies, preconceived social constructs and the physical limits of nature and human evolution, incorporating elements from anarcho-communism, communalism, transhumanism and Stirnerite egoism.

We gladly welcome left-libertarians of all persuasions, in addition to Soulists.
