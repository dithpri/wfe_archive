[i]Communism is a political and economic ideology that focuses on the working class. The goal of communism is to create a classless society where individuals work together as whole and as a community. Communism works to abolish private property, and use taxes to distribute wealth in order to make a more equal society.[/i]

It is encouraged to be communist if you want to join this region, but anyone can join and debate here!
