In opposition to the homeland, the confederacy has arisen and seized its birthright. We will not be crushed under the scumladen foot of our so-called benevolent ruler. As long as we have our lives, we will continue to fight back against injustice until all has been snuffed out. Our battle is endless, but it is our duty to fight on.
