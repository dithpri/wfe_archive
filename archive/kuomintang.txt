The Kuomintang (KMT), also referred to as the Guomindang or the Chinese Nationalist Party, was a major political party in the Republic of China. It was originally founded by Sun Yat Sen as a nationalist, anti capitalist and socialist party. After Sun&#39;s death, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the original ideologies of KMT as well as backstabbing its close ally - the Chinese Communist Party.

The only legitimate successor of Kuomintang is The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) - one of the eight legally recognised minor political parties in the People&#39;s Republic of China. It was founded in January 1948, during the height of the Chinese Civil War, by members of the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT).
