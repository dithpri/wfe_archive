The Freeworld is an alternate Earth in which all of humanity aspires to global unity. But unity is not easy, not even in a world of people who seek it. While mankind struggles for oneness it must contend with its flawed nature as cultural, spiritual, ideological, ethnic, and economic differences threaten to shatter the balance. Politics will be the driving force behind the nation&#39;s of this world.

IN SUMMARY: The main objective of ALL Freeworld nations is to uphold the freedoms and liberties of all Freeworld citizens. Poverty, economic deficit, famine, natural disaster, and disease in one country will be followed by a collaborative effort from all capable nation&#39;s to fix the issues at hand. Get ready to live for your fellow man.
