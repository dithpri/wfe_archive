[b][i]It&#39;s official! After a month or so of inactivity in the region, Eastern American Union is again refounded. We are a mostly quiet region that tends not to get into a squabble with other regions. Invasion by Lily and the Black Hawks and a month&#39;s worth of disinterest have led to this region&#39;s decline and non-existence. We&#39;re back and we will not take orders from any invader scum whatsoever.[/b][/i]

[b][color=red]ANY NATION FOUND TO BE FROM AN INVADER REGION SHALL BE BANJECTED PDQ![/color][/b]

You know what that means, so have a nice day.
