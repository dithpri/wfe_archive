[i][b][color=red]In light of [region]Lily[/region]&#39;s second attempt at an invasion, the Eastern American Union has become a warzone, and has commenced to banjecting all of its invader scum. This is a warning to the rest of [region]Lily[/region], [region]the Black Hawks[/region] and its league of invaders, and any invader region that foolishly believes they&#39;re &quot;anti-fascist,&quot; when in fact they ARE, in fact, fascist (e.g. [region]NSLeft[/region] and its league of fascist scum). Any attempt at an invasion shall be met with extreme force and banjected PDQ. Anyone who does not bow to Supreme Overlord George VII will have their thumbs broken, their homes raided, and flogged with absolutely no mercy. Martial law is in effect, so there.[/b][/i][/color]
