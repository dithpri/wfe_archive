The land of Jiggilia is historically known to envelope the current borders of The Holy Jigglers, whose capital shares the same name as the Region. Recent propaganda by Jiggilian Media have convinced people that Jiggilia is more than The Holy Jigglers, and is an &amp;quot;expanding region&amp;quot;, which is an odd concept itself. The Holy Jigglers welcomes new people to their native land of Jiggilia, as long as they don&amp;#39;t anger their leader, who is known to make irrational quick decisions.
