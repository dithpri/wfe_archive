[B]The Battle of the Alamo (February 23 &#150; March 6, 1836) was a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under President General Antonio L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna reclaimed the Alamo Mission near San Antonio de B&eacute;xar (modern-day San Antonio, Texas, United States), killing the Texian and immigrant occupiers. Santa Anna&#39;s cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians, both legal Texas settlers and illegal immigrants from the United States, to join the Texian Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texians defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the rebellion.[/b]
