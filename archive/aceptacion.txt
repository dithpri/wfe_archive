Una regi&oacute;n para todos los que sean: pacifistas, anti fascistas y democraticos
A region for all that are: anti-war, anti-fascist and democratic
 
The Aceptacion Comitee has recreated the acepto the 23 of March, 2012. However we have decided that to keep the currency stable there are some considerations to make. Nations that want to join the acepto must:

- Have a GDP higher than 25,000,000,000,000 NSD.
- The goverment budget must be higher than the goverment expenditures.
- The trade deficit can&amp;#39;t be higher than 400,000,000,000 NSD.
- The GDP per capita must be higher than 15,000 NSD.
- Unemployment must be lower than 7%. 
- Crisis can last more than 1 year.

Nations wishing to integrate the acepto union must meet ALL this characteristics.
