Did you know.... The word meme was coined by the biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book &quot;The Selfish Gene,&quot; in which he suggested that ideas could replicate, evolve, and enter popular culture in a process analogous to the way genes spread. Today, a meme is commonly thought of as a variant of an image based on a common theme that has spread widely on the internet.
