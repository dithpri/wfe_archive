The Damned are an English rock band formed in London in 1976. They were the first punk rock band from the United Kingdom to release a single (&amp;quot;New Rose&amp;quot;), an album (Damned Damned Damned), to have a record on the UK music charts, and to tour the United States. The Damned later evolved into one of the forerunners of the gothic genre.
