The British Isles Union (BIU) was founded in 2018 as a way of keeping economic and cultural ties between the nations of England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland and Yorkshire following the collapse of the United Kingdom. Members of the BIU work together in a number of areas including trade, intelligence, military, employment and immigration with the bloc founded upon the principles of freedom of movement of goods, services, people and employment across the British Isles.
