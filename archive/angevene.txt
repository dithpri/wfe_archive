The Angevene Region is a domain that has stood the tests of time throughout its history, It&#146;s natural defenses include three absolutely giant oceans - The Barbed Line which includes high and sharp mountains with this system going to 3,000 miles wide. It&#146;s tropical in the southeast, there&#146;s deserts in the southwest and a Mediterranean climate in the west. Rainforest in the northwest, plains in the interior, mountains in the east and west and a temperate forest climate in the east. There&#146;s a crazy amount of farmland and land for everyone to use, the Angevene Region having flourishing rivers and rich minerals which had been extracted since it&#146;s colonial days.
