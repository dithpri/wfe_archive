Welcome to Franz Josef Sea! Although it&#39;s quite cold here, I would expect you to have a peaceful and strong time at our private group. It&#39;s private, so only people that are new and want a steady start can join. You&#39;ll also be cut off from any other regions around the world. So looking forward to seeing you here!

Yours faithfully,
