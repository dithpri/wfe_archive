On the farthest outskirts of the galaxy, there are some solar systems that have life-bearing planets in them. One of them is the Twinsun-system, comprised of two small suns and a small, rather earth-like planet hovering in orbit between them. Another one is Zeelich, the &quot;planet of thousand wonders&quot; that is in fact a ball of gas and lava, with only few mountains that stick out of the gas cloud that covers the entire planet. The third known planet of the LBA-Universe is Zirla, the tropical jungle planet, mostly known for its bug-safaris. We could only guess what the time brings to the worlds of Twinsun, Zeelich and Zirla in the near future....
