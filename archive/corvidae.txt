The Christian Order (of) Righteousness, Virtue, Intelligence, Defence And Excellence (CORVIDAE) is a group of Nations with super majorities of Christians in every field. 

The great Nation of Lower Montana created this group to forge an alliance between newly created nations after World War Three. 

The aim of CORVIDAE is simple- to spread the Good News around the globe.
