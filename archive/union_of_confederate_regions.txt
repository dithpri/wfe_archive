The Union of Confederate Regions is a confederacy created by the merger between Aerope, Regime of Ascendancy, Beastkin Imperial Conglomerate of Langor and AUSHER. Any region has the right to secede from the Union. One representative from each region is given access to the Union Council.

Citizens of all regions are equal, as are member regions of the Union.
