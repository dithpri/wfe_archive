The region of [color=red][B][region]Imperial Prussia[/region][/B][/color] is a rich and diverse land, it&amp;#39;s many culture&amp;#39;s and forms of government co-existing in a relatively peaceful environment. The region has both a topographic map, and a political map, with other&amp;#39;s on the way shortly. Nation&amp;#39;s in [color=red][B][region]Imperial Prussia[/region][/B][/color] are open to role-play outside the region, and collaboration with other like minded writers interested in collective world building. Should one wish to join the region, they need only move a nation within and TG the founder with a map claim. Furthermore all inter-regional diplomacy at the current time should also be directed to the founder. Feel free to use the RMB if you have any questions.
