[color=006699]Located just 17 miles off the west coast of Kauai, Niihau (72 square miles) is the smallest of Hawaii&#146;s inhabited islands.
While open to visitors on a limited basis (via helicopter tours), Niihau is a private island that has largely remained unburdened by the influences of the outside world. There are no roads, hotels or restaurants; the 250 residents (mostly of Hawaiian descent) live without electricity. &#151;http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/kauai/niihau/[/color] [hr]
