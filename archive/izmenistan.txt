Izmenistan is a large arabic and islamic region. Qatal and the UIDM protects Izmenistans interests and helps the effort to spread the word of Allah and to fight in the name of Allah. Due to the way Izmenistan is structured, democracy is encouraged but does not pose a risk to safety due to the permanent governing authority of Qatal.
