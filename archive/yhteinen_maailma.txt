 Four years ago a battle between defenders and invaders took place here, a region of just two natives at the time. The original invading force was a rather inexperienced organization although they were later aided by experienced invaders from around the world. This battle, which took place over two updates, saw each sides endorsements at around 24+, bringing the regional population up to over 50 nations. Defenders managed to win by a small margin of UN votes and secured the region from the invaders.
