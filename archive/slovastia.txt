Summary of the Republic of Slovastia
Overview: The Republic of Slovastia is a massive, orderly nation ruled by Rudolf Himmler with an iron fist. It is known for its barren, inhospitable landscape, suspicion of poets, and complete absence of social welfare. The population of 1.134 billion hard-nosed, hard-working, and cynical Slovastians are strictly controlled by an oppressive government that measures success by GDP and refers to citizens as &#147;human resources.&#148;

Government: The medium-sized, moralistic, and well-organized government prioritizes Defense, Law &amp; Order, Administration, and Education, while ignoring International Aid and Welfare. The government meets in the capital city of Rhine-Hart, and citizens pay a flat income tax of 37.7%.
