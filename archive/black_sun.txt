[color=#000][b][i]Deep in outer space in a galaxy, there is a solar system unlike any other. 
In that solar system planets invisible to naked eye spin around a star. 
This star, unlike other stars doesn&amp;#39;t emit light but sucks away all light. 
This star is known as the Black Sun and this region is named after it.[/i][/b][/color]

Welcome to Black Sun, a star darkening the lands of darkness around it.
