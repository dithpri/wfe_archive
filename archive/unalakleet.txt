[i]saffron skies raise the blazing sun
a chance encounter, awkward displays
one day, my love, we&#39;d be as one

with two entwined. A set course, begun
that frenetic, wild, lustrous haze;
azure skies host the radiant sun

above us beaming as we run
down that aisle, a fervent craze
that day, my love, we became as one

with future unfolded - the life we&#39;d won
commitment and duty, for the family we&#39;d raise
cerulean skies ferry the shimmering sun

Buried. Shackled by fate - overrun
by ever-growing resent and malaise
yesterday, my love, we were as one

now you lie here, the life in you gone
in the dark outside of her rays
crimson skies bear the torch; our sun
today, my love, we&#39;ll be as one[/i]
