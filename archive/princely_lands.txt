Princely lands are a region without war, devoted to a quiet life for all states tired of the mayhem of living within a region dominated by superpowers. There shall be no dominant national or political ideology in the Princely lands and everyone is welcome to enter and have a say in how the Prince of San Trifone shall rule over his lands.
