Welcome to the Shibuya Underground, a new, vibrant region filled with music, laughter, imagination, and individuality. The only rule is to trust the other members, and make the most of everything the world throws at you.  

Nations that suppress civil rights or political freedoms (to the point where either score is less than thirty) are generally frowned upon and may be kicked from the region until legislation is passed to boost the score.

Come join the fun because remember it&amp;#39;s a wonderful world~

(Possible forums in the future for playing Reaper&amp;#39;s Games or something :D)
