Greetings, 

The Alliance of Sovereign Islands and Atolls is a political, economic and cultural alliance of islands and atolls in solidarity. Countries tend to protect the seabed, biodiversity, fisheries and island cultural practices. The marine domain is the first cause of gathering. 
The countries are very different and allow for a rich intercultural sharing.

This alliance is a mixed alliance comprising countries with different political regimes ranging from the Sultanate to the Free Land. 

Politics: TO DO
