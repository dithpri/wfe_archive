ASPCA is our name, preventing animal cruelty is our game. The American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is always at work to save the animals. Anyone with open arms and a warm heart is invited to help end animal cruelty.Animals do not discriminate against governments, as long as you are willing to save them.
