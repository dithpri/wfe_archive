The Greater Pacific Northwest Reich was carved out of a vast swath of the Pacific Northwest of North America, out of what constituted the Unites States of America before it&#39;s Balkanization and eventual collapse. The Capitol State of the Greater Reich is the Protectorate of National Socialist Cascadia, located in the Heart of the Bio-Cascade region within the former states of Oregon and Washington. The Greater Reich consists solely of smaller, semi-Authoritarian Nation States, of which represent themselves within the Greater Reich, whom may also be elected by other Nation States to represent the Greater Reich within the World Assembly.
To do so is an Honor to Ones State, Reich and Chancellor.
For Blood and Soil,
Hail Victory!
