[color=gray]Ilirea is a utopian light-roleplay region in which technology has surpassed human-type level, and now, in some cases, has gone on to conquer galaxies without human aid. Safely programmed artificial intelligences roam free and occasionally rule alongside humans, but there are more races out there, of course. Some things you might see is the casual star-energy generator, in which three belts are wrapped around stars to pick off solar energy and signal it back to nations across the Ilirean universe. The technology level is pretty immense, it&#39;s at a god-like level.[/color]
