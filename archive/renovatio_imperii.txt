This is the region of the CCRP Universe [url=https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/33864948/] (current iteration) [/url], home to those in a long-running Scratch-based country RP. However, [color=red][b] everyone is welcome![/b][/color].

Leadership positions are currently [b][i][color=green] Open [/b][/i][/color]. If you have interest, apply in our message board!

Everyone knows the true successor to [color=brown] The Empire [/color] is the mighty [color=green][nation]Fictia[/nation][/color], so please endorse them as WA delegate (for now)!

We are a very new region, so pardon our dust as we form.
