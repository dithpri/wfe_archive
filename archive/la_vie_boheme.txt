This region is run by the Queendom of Energo where dragons are as respected as people.  People are free to hunt the lands as long as they leave the dragons alone.  The dragons are there to protect the queendom and the queen more specifically.

This region is a peaceful region but we are not afraid to fight those who want to destroy our home.  People are free to practice whatever religion they want, but we will not tolerate recruitment for cults or darkness of any kind.
