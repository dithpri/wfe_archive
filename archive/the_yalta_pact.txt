After many years spent as members of the Squadonic Alliance surrounded by turmoil and conflict, the alliance would eventually collapse and descend into chaos as two major members, the Republic of Sillacia and the Republic of Fritzei, would leave. After a year being spent isolated from each other, the nations of Sillacia and Fritzei would open up diplomacy again. With the addition of the Republic of Tyrdoria, on August 12th 2019, the Consultation of Peters would diplomatically tie the three nations together and create the alliance of The Yalta Pact. The Republics stand firm to their beliefs to stand together for victory.
