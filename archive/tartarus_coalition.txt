The Tartarus Coalition&amp;#39;s goal is disputed by outsiders, but we consider ourselves
striving for the future of humanity, especially within our region.Al sorts of dictators, autocrats, monarchs, and general secretaries have enlisted to bring the Tartarus Coalition to final victory.
Even at times we fight each other, but it is expected with such a diverse group.
We reject all democracy and anarchy, we work together when we can
but the glory of one&amp;#39;s own nation is always expected to come first. 

All within Tartarus are striving towards glory. We will shed blood along the way, even with our own
members, but in the end, glory is achieved.
