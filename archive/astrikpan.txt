The temperatures are relatively mild here, with cool summers and very cold winters, with heavy precipitation. Medieval artifacts are sometimes found in the deep woods. Legends and myths circulate about mysterious creatures in the woods, but no evidence has supported them...yet. Seaside towns offer tourist destinations for those who love to visit the deep north.
