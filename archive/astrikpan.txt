This cold, forested landscape sits in the subsection of Scandinavia, welcoming tourists with wonderful sites such as breathtaking fjords, swaths of evergreen, and relics of medieval empires rest among flowing rivers and mossy rocks. The governments of this land are fairly authoritarian, but welcoming to all outsiders. It has generally cool summers and very cold winters, making it an inhospitable place to live.
