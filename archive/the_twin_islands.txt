The holy empire of [nation]Nhaar[/nation] rose up against Ghyrakiaz due to its lack of religion and it&#39;s &#39;too much freedom&#39;, it sits on the Southern tip of the island. The small rich [nation]Gugara[/nation] used to sit North of Nabiastan, before it suffered a economic crash, and The Dark Lord, ruler of [nation]Ogia[/nation] took over from the remnants of Gugara, and is determined to rid the world of men. The Dominion of [nation]Al-Nabira[/nation] rose up against Nabiastan for becoming too Democratic and weak, it is determined to conquer Nabiastan&#39;s lands.
