[region]The Twin Islands[/region] was founded by two social-anarchist islands in the region of the [region]The South Pacific[/region], [nation]Crimela[/nation] and [nation]Ghyrakiaz[/nation], they achieved greatness, but alas, The Isle of [nation]Crimela[/nation] fell into ruin and [nation]Ghyrakiaz[/nation] was left alone, but pressed on and is determined to bring glory and greatness in memory of the great Twin Islands. The ruined nation of Crimela was then taken over by the The Emirate of [nation]Nabiastan[/nation], a very powerful miltary nation which protects the Twin Islands from invaders and keeps the prosperous peace-haven Ghyrakiaz. The city-state called the holy empire of [nation]Nhaar[/nation] rose up against Ghyrakiaz due to its lack of religion and it&#39;s &#39;too much freedom&#39;, it sits on the South West of the island. [nation]Gugara[/nation] sits south of Nabiastan.
