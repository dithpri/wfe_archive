[region]The Twin Islands[/region] was founded by two social-anarchist islands in the large Eriadisi Ocean, [nation]Crimela[/nation] and [nation]Ghyrakiaz[/nation], they achieved greatness, but alas, The Isle of [nation]Crimela[/nation] fell into ruin and was then taken over by The Dark Kingdom of [nation]Ogia[/nation]. But the remnants of Crimela fought back and managed to re-establish their nation. The holy empire of [nation]Nhaar[/nation] rose up against Ghyrakiaz due to its lack of religion and it&#39;s &#39;too much freedom&#39;, it sits on the Southern tip of the island. The small rich [nation]Gugara[/nation] used to sit North of Nabiastan, before it suffered a economic crash, and was incorporated into Nabiastan, helping its economy, but this led to The Dominion of [nation]Al-Nabira[/nation] rising up because of Nabiastan&#39;s new democracy.
