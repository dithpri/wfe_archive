[region]The Twin Islands[/region] was founded by two social-anarchist islands in the large Eriadisi Ocean, [nation]Crimela[/nation] and [nation]Ghyrakiaz[/nation], they achieved greatness, but alas, The Isle of [nation]Crimela[/nation] fell into ruin and [nation]Ghyrakiaz[/nation] was left alone, but pressed on and is determined to bring glory and greatness in memory of the great Twin Islands. The ruined nation of Crimela was then taken over by the The Emirate of [nation]Nabiastan[/nation]. The holy empire of [nation]Nhaar[/nation] rose up against Ghyrakiaz due to its lack of religion and it&#39;s &#39;too much freedom&#39;, it sits on the Southern tip of the island. The small rich [nation]Gugara[/nation] used to sit North of Nabiastan, before it suffered a economic crash.. Recently [nation]Al-Nabira[/nation] rose up against Nabiastan for being to democratic and too weak.
