The Kingdoms of Westeros were united years ago during the conquest of Aegon the Conqueror.  Westeros is now ruled from King&amp;#39;s Landing by &amp;quot;the Mad King&amp;quot; Aerys II Targaryen.  His Grace does not believe in any true freedom, merely the illusion of freedom.  Anyone who acts against the King shall will be punished by death or by taking the black and becoming a member of the Night&amp;#39;s Watch, their choice. Other crimes will most likely result in imprisonment or dismemberment. Aerys II aims to eventually extend Aegon&amp;#39;s conquest to the entire known world.
