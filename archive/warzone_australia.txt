[color=orange][i][B]Travelling in a fried-out Kombie
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie.
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast.
And she said:
Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder?
Can&amp;#39;t you hear, can&amp;#39;t you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover.[/B][/i][/color]
