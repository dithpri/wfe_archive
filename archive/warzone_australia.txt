Welcome to the Security State Warzone Australia.  All nations are welcome, but all must abide by our two regional laws.

1) You must be a member of the World Assembly
2) You must endorse [nation]Ace of Diamonds[/nation], and only [nation]Ace of Diamonds[/nation]


These measures may sound extreme, but please remember that we are a warzone and that these measures will ensure our stability.

Besides that, welcome to WZAU and remember: &amp;quot;Through Stability Comes Community&amp;quot;

Please telegram [nation]Ace of Diamonds[/nation] for more information about joining the Ruling Council of Warzone Australia.
