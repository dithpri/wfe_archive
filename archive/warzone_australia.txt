Warzone Australia is a region dedicated to defending warzone independence. WZA will fight for our own independence and other warzones as well. For to long have warzones been run over and ruined because some region needs to use it as a training ground for their regional military or we&amp;#39;re just &amp;quot;fun to invade&amp;quot;! We will not stand for that!! 
For security reasons, please endorse [nation=Rileyapolis]
WZA salutes those who have [url=http://www.awm.gov.au/]died[/url] for freedom.
