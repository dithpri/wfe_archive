Talos is a new region, founded by those who chose to leave Vaalbara and vowed to return to the principles on which nation states was founded: honest fun, passionate debate and joyous RPs.

All from the hot catholic school-girl to the belligerent and embittered jaded intellectual are welcome provided you are willing to be active and to join in the fun.
