[b][color=red]Welcome to Talos![/color][/b]

A community of fierce, colorful individuals of all sorts call this land home; with a long history of beating off pesky zombies and hopeless Black Riders, it&amp;#39;s safe to assume that the Talosian natives aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere anytime soon.

This region is for socializing, joking, RPing, debating - anything under the sun that doesn&amp;#39;t involve bronies or raiding! After a long dark age, the natives of Talos are ready to rise like a phoenix from the ashes of their foes, and-!...what? That&amp;#39;s not what we&amp;#39;re doing?! Oh, bugger.

If you&amp;#39;re interested in joining, telegram [nation=short+noflag]Nordwalsh[/nation], or [nation=short+noflag]Altaiire[/nation] for the password, preferably with a reason and just a bit of history - have to weed out the raiders and foo&amp;#39;s, don&amp;#39;cha know?
