[b][color=red]Welcome to Talos![/color][/b]

A community of fierce, colorful individuals of all sorts call this land home; with a long history of beating off pesky zombies and hopeless Black Riders, it&amp;#39;s safe to assume that the Talosian natives aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere anytime soon. After a long dark age, the natives of Talos are ready to rise like a phoenix from the ashes of their foes, and-!...what? That&amp;#39;s not what we&amp;#39;re doing?! Oh, bugger.

 If you&amp;#39;re interested in joining, hustle on over to [region]New Talos[/region] and check us out! With the absence of our founder, we decided to recreate the region to better protect it from raiding. We keep old Talos around to preserve our history - and to serve as a storage crate for our members&amp;#39; puppets.
