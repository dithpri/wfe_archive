Are you a searcher of moral truth in this veil of tears? Or are you just a jaded bastard searching for a quiet life? Demagogue or Public Debater, Dictator or Democrat, Pa-tate-o or Poh-ta-toe-you are welcome to Talos. A region full of people who are variously: deranged, xenophobic, imaginative, colourful, embracing, and a joy to talk to in varying quantities and some are all of those qualities at once (like Anthony Delasanta-watch out he bites!)

[color=blue] But I digress: anyone from the jaded intellectual to the hot catholic schoolgirl is welcome in Talos! [/color]
