Your RP population cannot be over 500 million if you wish to join. This is non negotiable. For the most part, everything else is. Our only other real requirement is that you consult with the other members of the region on realism matters - most things here are consensus based and we like to know what everyone else is doing. Because of this, we tend to use offsite forms of communication such as Steam and Skype, though we may begin to use IRC if we expand.
