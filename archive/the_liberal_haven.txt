We are committed to world peace through achieving social justice, non-violent solutions to problems, a healthy environment, and strong democracy.
We welcome all nations regardless of background. We promote tolerance and reject intolerance.

Let us do more than acknowledge and tolerate our differences; let us celebrate our diversity!
