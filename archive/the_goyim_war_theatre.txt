1.Nothing absured or overdone
2.You can only do one offensive and two defensive movements per day
3. You need to send treaties for everything official.
4. All teams must be even no matter what.
5.Do not get off topic on the page. Be off topic in facebook messanger group.
6. Do not rage.
7.When you do something and i dont know it. you must tell me or i wont store it on the map. 
8.You must stay in the game until you are defeated and the game is over. if there is ever civil unrest and you do enough to push the movement, you can do a rebellion, but before you have to do two riots that werent silenced.
