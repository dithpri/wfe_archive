The #1 Spring Break destination for drunken college kids and raider a**holes alike, Southern Malibu Islands now offers complementary drunk-retrieval services! Just tag a friend or loved one you think is consuming too much alcohol, and if we find him passed out on any of our pristine beaches the next morning, we&#39;ll dump him back in your room, free of charge! Everyone else will be deported to the Rejected Realms.

Speak, friend, and enter.
