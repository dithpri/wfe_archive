Welcome to Southern Malibu Islands. Like [region]Malibu Islands[/region], only southern-er. Spring breakers, please confine yourselves to the designated Party Hardy Zones. Any hardy partying outside said zones will be penalized to the fullest extent of the law. This will include mandatory sentences of judging Wet T-shirt Contests and helping us drink all this beer. Please watch for migrating foul-mouthed dolphins, as it is their mating season. Earplugs to be provided upon request (and trust us, you [i]will[/i] want them). It is mandatory that all arrivals chill out, have a Corona, and enjoy themselves. Unless you&#39;re tag-raiders, in which case, f* off losers.
