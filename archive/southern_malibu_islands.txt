A chain of sandy atolls located just south of [region]Malibu Islands[/region], this region, an historic haven for Islanders in distress and so many drunken cruise-goers over the years -- not to mention foul-mouthed dolphins during mating season -- is now reopened for all your puppet storage and puppetwanking needs. Enjoy!
