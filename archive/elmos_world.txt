Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an &quot;L&quot; on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&#39;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what&#39;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&#39;ll never know if you don&#39;t go
You&#39;ll never shine if you don&#39;t glow
