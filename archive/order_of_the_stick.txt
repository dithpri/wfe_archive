[color=blue]RP/tabletop gamer region. Talk about anything D&amp;amp;D, Pathfinder, Warhammer, Esoterrorist or anything RP related under the sun. Particularly D&amp;amp;D. Any edition. I&amp;#39;m betting this region will probably remain empty for the rest of its existence. But whatever.[/color]

[color=red]Just in case anyone was wondering, [i]The Order of the Stick[/i] is an awesome webcomic based in the D&amp;amp;D 3.5 world. See here: [url=http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html]Giantitp[/url][/color]
