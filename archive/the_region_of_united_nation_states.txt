This Region is founded upon the ideals of democracy and liberty. We shall uphold these values through this great collaboration of nations. We shall never be oppressed, neither will the light of liberty which burns at the heart of this region. This region will be a light to those in the darkness and a beacon of hope to those which have not yet tasted the sweetness of freedom.
