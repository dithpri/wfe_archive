This is meant for Totalitarian states only. Keep politics out of this. [i]No democratic nations, extreme leftists, libertarians, moderate right-wingers, and anarchists[/i] (This is because, I reiterate, the Region is a Totalitarian one). Act like a decent person, using [b]at least semi-proper grammar and being a polite person[/b]. If you have any questions, just contact [u]&quot;The Chevron State&quot;[/u] for an answer.

Have a good day, regardless of political affiliation,
