[b][color=black]Howdy! Welcome to Bear Country[/color][color=714833], NationStates&#39; premier bear-centric region for all things bear, bear-related, and beyond! More broadly, Bear Country celebrates the natural environment and wildlife in general, and highly values compassion and inclusiveness. All who share similar values are invited to visit or settle.

Bears of every kind are all over the place, but you truly don&#39;t have to be a bear-lover to belong here. Just be respectful, and we won&#39;t bite ([i]much[/i])![/color]
