[b][color=714833]Howdy! &amp;#128059; Welcome to Bear Country, NationStates&#39; premier bear-centric region for all things bear, bear-related, &amp; beyond. Bear Country celebrates the natural environment and all wildlife, and it values compassion and inclusiveness. All similarly inclined are welcome to settle here or just visit fur a while. Whatever floats your bear!

Bears of every kind are all over, but you truly don&#39;t have to be a bear-lover to belong. Just be respectful, prepare for lots of beary unbearable bear puns &amp; little bear faces &amp;#128059;&amp;#128060;, and we won&#39;t bite [i](much).[/i][/color]
