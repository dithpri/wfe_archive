[b][color=black]Howdy![/color][color=714833] Here in [/color][color=black]Bear Country[/color][color=714833], all who appreciate and respect the health, beauty, and abundance of the natural environment, the wild, and wildlife in general---especially the majestic [/color][color=black]bears[/color][color=714833] for which the region is named---are invited to visit or settle. [/color][color=black][i]We don&#39;t bite (much)![/i]

Bear Country[/color][color=714833] was founded in August 2016. As with any region just starting out, it will be pretty quiet for a while. Plans for the region&#39;s future will develop as it grows, and you could be a part of shaping it. In the meantime, the founder will check in regularly, ready to greet any who enter.
