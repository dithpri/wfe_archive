[b][color=black]Howdy![/color][color=714833] Here in [/color][color=black]Bear Country[/color][color=714833], we value compassion, inclusiveness, and the health, beauty, and abundance of the natural environment, the wild, and wildlife in general. All who share similar values are invited to visit or settle.

[/color][color=black]Naturally there are a lot of bears around, but you don&#39;t have to be a bear-lover to fit in here! Just be respectful, and they won&#39;t bite [i](much).[/i]

[/color][color=714833]Bear Country was founded in August 2016. As with any region just starting out, it may be quiet at times, but plans for its future include polls, maps, contests, art, quizzes, and jokes. This region is intended not to be a place that takes itself too seriously, but rather a haven for friendship, fun, and relaxation.

[/color][color=black]Enjoy your stay, and thank you for visiting![/color][/b]
