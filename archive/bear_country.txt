Howdy! Welcome to Bear Country[color=714833], NationStates&#39; premier bear-centric region for all things bear, bear-related, &amp; beyond! More broadly, Bear Country celebrates the natural environment and all wildlife, and it values compassion and inclusiveness. All who uphold these values are most welcome to visit for a while or settle long-term. Whatever floats your bear!

Bears of every kind are all over the place, but you truly don&#39;t have to be a bear-lover to belong here. Just be respectful, and we won&#39;t bite ([i]much[/i])![/color]
