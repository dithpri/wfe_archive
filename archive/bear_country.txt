Howdy! Welcome to Bear Country[color=714833], NationStates&#39; [formerly-]premier bear-centric region for all things bear, bear-related, &amp; beyond! More broadly, Bear Country celebrates the natural environment and all wildlife, and it values compassion and inclusiveness. All who share similar values are invited to visit or settle.

Bears of every kind [will be] all over the place, but you truly don&#39;t have to be a bear-lover to belong here. Just be respectful, and we won&#39;t bite (much)![/color]
