After a long expedition in the north sea a group of British explorers found 24 islands. The Queen was more than pleased however the land would not come free. As soon as these islands we&amp;#39;re discovered the world showed interest especially the French, Danish and Norwegian. The high chancellor was charged with reaching a deal with the aforementioned nations to divide the islands up. The Queen was so pleased she gave him 8 of the 16 the British got. The British then made it impossible for the aforementioned nations to stay on their islands so they left. The high chancellor refused to take the islands and offered them to anyone who wanted them and provided protection as long as they did the same. Keizer&amp;#39;s empire makes up the last 8 islands.
