Keteria hosts to five planets on a yellow star. Rucia is the central planet that is the base of operations for all Keterians. Vancia is a hyperborean world with year-round mild to freezing temperatures. Eutania is an arid planet with its sun-worshipping cult, the Oracles of the Sun. Kuria is a misty-filled planet with dark brown skies and white fog, and lastly, Yogoria is an alien world with bright red skies and seas.
