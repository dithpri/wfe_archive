In paleogeography, Gondwana is the name given to an ancient super continent. 

Today, Gondwana is a highly interactive geo-political region.   The nation states are diverse in terms of political systems, social welfare, economies, humans rights and diplomacy. Consequently, domestic problems are equally diverse and this often affects how the nation states interact. 

The nation states of Gondwana cover the area of South America, Australasia, southern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and Mudgeeraba.

The Sultanate of Somersetonia, ruled over by the autocrat Tipu Sultan, is the most influential nation in the region.
