We, the nations of Gondwana created our region by breaking a large tectonic plate off of Africa (using unimaginably advanced technology or just a LOT of dynamite - I forget which) and floating it into the Indian Ocean where we can be left alone. 

We are a quiet region where nations govern themselves without interference. There is no regional government, no regional forums, and no WA nations are allowed. Telegram the founder for the password if you are interested in making Gondwana your home.
