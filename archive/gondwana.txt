In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient super continent. 

Today, Gondwana is a highly interactive geo-political region.   The nation states are diverse in terms of political systems, social welfare, economies, humans rights and diplomacy. Consequently, domestic problems are equally diverse and often this affects how the nation states interact. 

The nation states of Gondwana cover the area of South America, Australasia, southern Asia and the Arabian Peninsula.
