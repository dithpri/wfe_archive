Gondwana is a geo-political region stretching across the southern hemisphere. It comprises over 50 nation states with diversity in political systems, social welfare, economic outlook, human rights and attitudes to diplomacy and war.

Many new nations are on the march and power arrangements are clearly shifting. Will Gondwana see the emergence of a new, powerful nation state ready to guide the region to peace and prosperity?  Or will the region descend into its historical bickering and petty rivalry?
