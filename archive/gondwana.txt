We, the nations of Gondwana created our region by breaking a large tectonic plate off of Africa (using unimaginably advanced technology or just a LOT of dynamite - I forget which) and floating it into the Indian Ocean where we can be left alone. 

We are a quiet region where nations govern themselves without interference. There is no regional government, no regional forums, and [b]no WA nations are allowed[/b]. When your nation has &amp;quot;run its course&amp;quot;, consider moving to one of the friendly regions listed under our embassies to end your time in NationStates.
