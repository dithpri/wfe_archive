Welcome to the Socialist Sovereignty of Qygen-Koban! A region unbound by distance and unfettered by greed.
This is a continuation of a nation of about 200 people located in the game of Minecraft. Qygen-Koban has a rich history and a unique government system. Or at least used to, since it has been dead for some time now.

So far the region is under construction, so don&#39;t expect anything too interesting happening here. For now.

If you decide to stay, welcome!
