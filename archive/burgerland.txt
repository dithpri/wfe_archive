Welcome to Burgerland, a place with a lot of burgers.me (nandaek) and simonia don&#146;t really know what to do with this [u]region[/u] at the moment but I&#146;m sure we can figure out something.
[b]There you go.[/b]
[i]Yay. Thank you. Also, I have an idea. Let&#39;s use this WFE for chatting.[/i]
Wfe? What&#146;s that?
[b]World factbook entry.[/b]
[u]Cool, but what about the people just coming here and seeing this mess?[/u]
[b]Um&#133;to be honest I don&#146;t know.[/b]
[strike]Well, I found it on the forums.[/strike]
I love how this WFE is becoming a chat room! :D
[sup]same[/sup]
I also like how this is almost anarchy.
[strike]WHAT DID YOU DO SIMONIA? LOOK AT MAJESTIA NOW![/strike]
Long story.
