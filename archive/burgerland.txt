[color=orange]Welcome to [region]Burgerland[/region], the burger version of [region]Eclipseland[/region]! If you come here, I&#146;ll give you an office. There will be potential bonus authorities if you ping the governor and state your main.[/color]

Strange. Burgerland got tagged/[b]BURGERED[/b]! Nice banner though. In fact, I&#146;m actually happy this region got enough attention to be [b]BURGERED[/b]!
So tag raid this all you want. I&#146;ll give the delegate Appearance. Only consequence is that you&#146;ll be banned.
