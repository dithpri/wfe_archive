[b]Welcome to the Quip Network![/b]
You have chosen, or been chosen, to partake in a mediocre region run by a few friends barely interested in this glorified MMO textventure.
We have 3 main goals:
[list][*]Having fun. (i.e nuclear proliferation) 
[*]Turning little tiny baby defender &amp; native regions into great big defender coalitions someday.
[*]Making fun of the World Assembly.
[/list]
[b][color=#5b92e5]Here are our regulations regarding the boring blue bureaucrats:[/color][/b]
[list][*]Quip Network members are not encouraged to participate in the World Assembly, or vote for a delegate.
[*]Don&#39;t blame defenders for being part of the WA: it&#39;s part of their job, for the reason below.
[*]Always remember that the WA is the horrible weapon of all raiders. Without it, no region would have to live in fear of their destruction.
