Moleton is the underground utopia set up by an ancient mole society eons ago, but was abandoned when the horrible turnip famine struck them. The land was recivilized by the peaceful Treeski people centuries later, and now host it for all to join. Here in Moleton, people need not worry about the harms of the outside regions, for all are free to live their own lives in the depths of inner earth.
