Hey look buddy, I&#39;m an engineer. That means I solve problems, not problems like &quot;What is beauty?&quot; Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don&#39;t work... Use more gun. Take for instance this heavy caliber tripod mounted lil&#39; old number designed by me, built by me, and you best hope... Not pointed at you.
