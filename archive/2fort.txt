&quot;2Fort&quot; is a multiplayer map for the first-person shooter games Quake World Team Fortress, Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2, and for the multiplayer total conversion modification Fortress Forever. Consisting of two similar buildings separated by a short bridge and a moat, each team must fight their way into the opposing team&#39;s building and capture their flag/intelligence from an underground base concealed beneath. A launch map for Team Fortress 2, 2Fort was critically praised as an iconic map for the series and one of the best first-person shooter maps of all time.
