[b]Description of the Region[/b]:

Democratic Unity is an informal region that, despite its name, welcomes everyone regardless of their views and ideologies. We are first and foremost a community of people who enjoy playing and want to share their experiences with others. We are not another typical serious roleplay region where it&#39;s all about political influence. Our goal is to work together, help each other, and enjoy the game. We do not provide strict rules about what you should do or not do.
