tone of [i]STILL ALIVE[/I] FROM PORTAL

This is a triumph 
ripping holes in space time
is so easy
APERTURE SCIENCE
and BLACK MESA is the best place of all
for the good of all NS except the evil raiders
but there&amp;#39;s no sense trying to get them to change
we just keep on defying the laws of physics
because SCIENCE IS FUN
combustible lemons
we will always defend our region!
