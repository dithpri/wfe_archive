Are you ready?
Are you ready?

[Verse]
Adrenaline is pumping
Adrenaline is pumping
Generator. Automatic lover
Atomic. Atomic. Overdrive
Blockbuster. Brain power
Call me a leader. Cocaine
Don&#39;t you try it, don&#39;t you try it
Innovator. Killer machine
There&#39;s no fate. Take control
Brain power

[Chorus]
Let the bass kick
