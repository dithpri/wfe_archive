You should have acted.

They&#39;re already here.

The Elder Scrolls told of their return.

Their defeat was merely a delay,

&#39;Til the time after Oblivion opened,

When the sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.

But no one wanted to believe,

Believe they even existed.

And when the truth finally dawned,

It dawns in fire!

But, there is one they fear,

In their tongue he is Dovahkiin:

DRAGONBORN!
