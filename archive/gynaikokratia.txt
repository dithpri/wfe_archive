This is a roleplay region created for fun, but it will be reflexive of the brutality when ruling a region or having political prominence. We by no means condone these aspects of our nations in the real world, nor do we promote said aspects. We simply enjoy adding darker aspects to our nations. Please don&#39;t report us for offense, as we clearly outlined that we do not mean to offend anyone. The region founder, Lilacium, And Vertigisa are both women who do not mean to offend either.
