[i]&quot;Sunlight is in a certain sense, quite literally, law.
Without sunlight, the Earth would spin off into space,
and the absence of sunlight down here means the absence of a dozen laws.&quot;[/i]

A vast maelstrom rages through the stellar void; a ravenous maw. In the lightless valleys between its surging waves, life and freedom flourish. Here in the absence of radiant tyranny gather those who would seize the skies from the stars and conquer death; to Liberate the Night.
