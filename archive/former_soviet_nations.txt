Not as much of a region but more of a collective of nations celebrating independence from the Soviet Union. (including non-fictional nations)
Made up of former soviet states, Former Soviet Nations is made up of beautiful Nations with pretty landscapes and high mountains, and of course, FREEDOM!!
while some former soviet nations opted to stay under Russian influence, most either opted for neutrality or adapted western ideas, despite the differences of each nation, I hope all former soviet nations can get along here
(There are no requirements to join other than you must be a former soviet nation or former soviet satellite state)
