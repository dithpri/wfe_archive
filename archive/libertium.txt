[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] have a problem: two of their SGTs are flightless. Hindered by evolution, a goose and a penguin hawk are both doomed to be land-bound... Or are they? With the power of [i]technology[/i], such as slingshots, jetpacks, and self-propelled artillery, these two flightless feathered birds will take to the skies! Will they succeed? Will they stay in the air? And can they fly long enough to hit 200 regions?
