A beautiful continent consisting entirely of small, medium and large island nations, Shoulderis is notable for its geographical diversity, with environments ranging from desert to tundra within its boundaries. 

Shoulderis is loosely run by the Shoulderis Alliance for Prosperity, or S.A.P., which makes sure all member states provide their citizens with basic human rights. 

After a coup by Vernarnia, Shoulderis banned Vernarnians from ever coming back.
