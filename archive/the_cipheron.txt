This region is a memorial to the History of what I call the ULU Local Group, which is the large collection of regions involved with the Union of Liberal Nations, Lardyland, and the United Free Nations. (The United Empires of Carson aka UEC is also a main power in this group)

I have pinned my many factbooks detailing several nations&#39; and regions&#39; histories.

[b]Future Plans and Announcements:[/b]

I have reworked nearly all of my histories (except the ULN, which is pretty long and I plan on tackling later).

I previously tried a history of Lardyland, I have considered making a new version, but I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m also considering a history of the UEC.
