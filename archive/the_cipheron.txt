This region is a memorial to the History of what I call the ULU Local Group, which is the large collection of regions involved with the Union of Liberal Nations, Lardyland, and the United Free Nations. (The United Empires of Carson aka UEC is also a main power in this group)

I have pinned my many factbooks detailing several nations&#39; and regions&#39; histories.

[b]Future Plans and Announcements:[/b]

I have reworked nearly all of my histories, most recently the History of the ULN, which I&#39;m pretty satisfied with!

I&#39;ve decided not to write a history of Lardyland, as 99% of its history is just memes and wouldn&#39;t make for an interesting read. 

Still considering a history of the UEC but I&#39;m torn about it.
