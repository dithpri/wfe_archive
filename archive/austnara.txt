Welcome to Austnara a modern tech world that isn&#39;t Earth, but basically is. Tech is roughly early 2000s, with exceptions in tech. There is no UN or EU like figure of this world, Ideology war still rages on, and there are no nuclear weapons. Sure there is more to say and might later but for now this is it.

Oh yeah also still very much against CAIN. They all can bite me. That is if they even still exist. So much for snuffing out anyone that has different opinions then you all huh?
