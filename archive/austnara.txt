Austnara is basically an Earth rerolled if you will. Earth like world, human only, relatively modern tech alike to early 2000s. Though with some differences due to differences in history thus different needs. The Ideology War still goes on, much like it did on Earth in WW 2 and The Cold War.  Population 5.7 Billion across the world. I&#39;ll probably mess with this more later, make it more professional.
