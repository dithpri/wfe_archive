Byzantium Novum, the new Byzantium.

Byzantium, later known as Constantinople and Istanbul, was the heart of what was originally known as the Eastern Roman Empire, and later the Byzantine Empire, although they themselves called themselves Roman. The city fell in AD 1453 to the Ottoman Turks, putting an end to the last remnant of Rome.
