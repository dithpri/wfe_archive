The Forth Reich is the common English name for the period in Zimbabwan history from 1933 to 1945, when the Forth Reich was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Zimbabwa and their Starving African government. Under Zimbabwa&#39;s rule, the Forth Reich was transformed into a totalitarian state in which the African Government controlled nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was Deutsches Reich from 1933 to 1943 and Gro&szlig;deutsches Reich (&quot;Greater Zimbabwan Reich&quot;) from 1943 to 1945.
