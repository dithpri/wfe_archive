
Human&amp;#39;s are no strangers to war. After all we&amp;#39;ve been fighting, for as long as we can remember. War, is all we know. In the past we fough for imulsion, we fought for country, we fought, for freedom; but all that changed, after E-DAY. 

For fifteen years we&amp;#39;ve been fighting for our very survivel against inhuman, genocidal monsters. But It is a fight, we cannot continue. Humanity faces extinction. Unless we end this war, Now!
