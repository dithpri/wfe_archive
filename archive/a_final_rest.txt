[i]A resting place, for those who fought for what they believed in
A monument, for those who faced the onslaught from those who deceived them
A stopping point, to face the mistakes of the past that were made
When all were young and uncertain of whom to aid

Merely temporary, this lone denizen will now rest
A return will be promised, if you make the request
To split up the people for one cause would be folly
When one could make do and simply be jolly[/i]

This region was founded by The Ypres Front as a resting place after a major debate in [region]The Southern Lands[/region]. The Ypres Front returned to TSL, but will forever keep this region as a reminder of what had happened.
