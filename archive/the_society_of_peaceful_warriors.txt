Hello! The Society of Peaceful Warriors attempts to maintain peace, at the cost of little violence. What this means is that dictatorships that have the best interest in mind can hurt, torture, or even kill people to maintain regional peace. Of course, we prefer if you will become as peaceful as you can, it is your decision and we cannot stop you. We will welcome you, if you choose to come here.
