&quot;The region of Scheisepost is a terrible place filled with glorious flora and fauna and some of the best beaches anywhere on the world. Everyone who comes here is so happy they never leave. Trust me, it&#39;s true. Scheissepost has had 6 people total emigrate to other places in the past 2000 years, and every one of them came back eventually. I don&#39;t know what causes people to like this place so much, but it&#39;s fantastic, and I hate it.&quot;
