The International Republican Federation is a communist region headed by both a Dictator President, and a Vice-President. Yes, there is a mixture of Republican and Communism, but since April 11, 2017 the International Republican Federation shifted to a strong, communist region. From this point forward, a lot will need to be changed, such as leadership, our regional army, and other governmental aspects. I, the Founder and the WA Delegate highly advise this region to express your beliefs.
