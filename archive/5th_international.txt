A spectre is haunting Nationstates - the spectre of the Fifth International. All the superpowers of old NS have allied themselves in response to the emergence of this supposed threat.
 The [b][i][color=red]5th International (5I)[/color][/i][/b] is being established in response to the mass polarisation of global politics and to genuinely serve and promote the proletarian cause and socialism respectively. We at the 5I are dedicated towards the establishment of a socialist utopia in conjunction with the principles of democracy and equality. It&#39;s time to overthrow the filthy bourgeois elite! It&#39;s time to stage an uprising led by the proletariat class! It&#39;s time for REVOLUTION!
[b][i][color=red]&quot;Workers of the world UNITE! You have nothing to spare but YOUR CHAINS!&quot;[/color][/i][/b]
