The Chertanian Region seeks peaceful relations with other regions. Acces to the region is limited by a strict border control. Only nations that seek to live peacefully with their neighbors even if those have different ideals and ideologies are welcome in Chertania. The most important goal of the region is to prevent nations in it from being pressured by a higher and maybe ideologized regional government to follow a certain course of action. To achieve this and keep the regional government in check it is regularly renewed and the diversity of nations with different ideas and ideals prevent it from being able to only work for certain ideals or ideologies and follow a perhaps aggressive course of action that discriminates single nations.
