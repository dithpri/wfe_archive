Welcome to the [b][u]&#39;Free nation all Alliance,&#39;[/u][/b] where we discuss International forums and express the freedom to the world. All within completely no qualifications, you are available to join this nation and discuss some topics with other nations! 

So why won&#39;t we limit joining our alliance?

Anyone joining our alliance is viewed as willing to participate in actions for freedom, and oppression against that is a crime under our guidelines.

So for freedom&#39;s sake, the board posts made by nations won&#39;t be suppressed unless any inappropriate content or foul language has been included.
