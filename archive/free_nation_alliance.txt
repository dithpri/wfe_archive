The Free Nation Alliance was founded in 2017 by The Republic of Liber Natio, The Empire of Retz Yelf, The Republic of Northern Greenlands, and The Rogue Nation of Bey Frez Ste. It was founded to be an alliance for small, independent nations, who want to have a voice in the politics of their region. The Alliance enforces very few laws, so member states are left to their own devices.
