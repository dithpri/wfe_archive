A League of Nations based off of 1939 Germany. We do not, however, have concentration camps, and and accept all religions. All members send me or the current Generalfeldmarschall a telegram saying &quot;active and loyal&quot; every Monday to not go on probation. If on probation and does not post, gets ejected. Officers are chosen every day. SWASTIKAS NOT PERMITTED. ONLY GERMAN CROSS
