[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr]

This was an old right-wing region which was previously aligned with fascist forces years ago until it CTEd, but it managed to go unnoticed. To prevent further misuse by fascists or others, this region name has been permanently put out of order by the empire.
