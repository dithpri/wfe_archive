Westreniya was ruled by the Loirran dynasty for centuries, but by the end of King Cassian&#39;s reign, the regime began to suppress freedom of speech and tightened its control over the population. The arrest of respected scientist Mirella Taliro has sparked mass protests across the region. A group of reformers, with the support of part of the army, carried out a quick, bloodless coup, overthrowing the absolute monarchy.

An Interim People&#39;s Council was established, which abolished repressive laws, adopted a new constitution, and held a fair referendum. A year later, the first democratic elections were held, and Westreniya finally gained freedom of speech.
