[hr][b]The Magnus Institute[/b] is an academic institution dedicated to researching the esoteric and paranormal. They are not, and they would like to make this clear, paranormal investigators. They are researchers dedicated to revealing knowledge of the unknown. Nevertheless, there are many mysteries about the Institute itself.

The Institute is associated with the Entity known as The Eye. It is also patronised by other groups such as the Lukas Family.
