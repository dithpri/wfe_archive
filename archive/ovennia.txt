In the Ovennian region, many animals in this region have gained sentience and are willing to form their own nations and empires. Formed by volcanic activity in the middle of an ocean, Ovennia has a mix of deserts, deciduous forests, and tropical regions. Every island in the archipelago was secluded from each other before several went out to sea and found others, and is still secluded from all reaches of outside contact. Most of the nations on the islands only have a positive relationship only to benefit themselves.
