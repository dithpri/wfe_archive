The glorious nation of Montopia, seeking to unite with its surrounding allies, founded the Montopian Allied States, offering it&amp;#39;s neighbors a choice, join freely, or be assimilated. Using the slogan &amp;#39;Resistance is Futile&amp;#39; it convinced various groups to join. It now seeks to grow, and hold great influence over the world.
