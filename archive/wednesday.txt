[b]Wednesday[/b] is the day of the week between Tuesday and Thursday. According to international standard ISO 8601, it is the third day of the week. In English, the name is derived from Old English W&amp;#333;dnesd&aelig;g and Middle English Wednesdei, &#39;day of Woden&#39;, reflecting the religion practised by the Anglo-Saxons, the English equivalent to the Norse god Odin. In many Romance languages, such as the French mercredi, Spanish mi&eacute;rcoles or Italian mercoled&igrave;, the day&#39;s name is a calque of Latin dies Mercurii &#39;day of Mercury&#39;. Wednesday is in the middle of the common Western five-day workweek that starts on Monday and finishes on Friday.[hr][sup]Once again, this region is left open for tagging.
