Not the Soviet Union, The Strabansk Union is a region built to resemble true Communism.

Some nations, Like Yarkuo (A special administrative zone of Repreteop, Sort of like Hong Kong if you get me) have more rights, meaning they have governments like democracy (They just have Autonomy and still must listen), They are under watch and are still part of whatever nation holds them

This resembles the Soviet Union, But all nations in this have their own rights, as states of the Strabansk Union though, You get to vote for the Delegate, just to keep things fresh and in case of issues like misconduct.

Welcome to our beautiful union, I hope you stay.

(We do have a rule book, but you don&#39;t need citizenship, like the other groups.)
