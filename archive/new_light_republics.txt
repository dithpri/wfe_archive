Founded in: 22/5/2018, this region is a copy of our former nation: Light Republics (I forgot the password of the nation that founded that region) 

&quot;This is a place for conservative nations, a place in which they can share their thoughts and feelings, and having a true and stable democracy&quot;

Rules:

1: Respect other members

2: Do not spam

3: If you are a fascist/communist, you can&#39;t join to the region

4: Have fun
