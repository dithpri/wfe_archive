The United Empire of Centralia was established after the fall of the giant imperial government of Diveria. After years of progress, the True Union created districts and lands dedicated to different governance types. Districts were created for every kind of person, ranging from Anarchy to Tyranny. Diveria, which had diverted its resources equally to its districts, fell because of the lack of stimulus and unrest caused by the complete equality. Centralia was created in order to satisfy these needs, and it is shown to be the case multiple times. You can live any way you want here: It is truly a utopia for all.
