The [i]Bismarck[/i], probably Germany&#146;s most famous battleship in WWII, was sunk on May 27th 1941. The Bismarck had already sunk HMS Hood before being sunk herself. 

The Bismarck displaced over 50,000 tons and 40% of this displacement was armour. Such armour gave the Bismarck many advantages in protection but it did not inhibit her speed. She was capable of 29 knots. Launched in 1939, the Bismarck carried a formidable array of weaponry: 8 x 15 inch guns, 12 x 5.9 inch guns, 16 x 4.1 inch AA guns, 16 x 20mm AA guns and 2 x Arado 96 aircraft. The Bismarck had a crew of 2,200. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
