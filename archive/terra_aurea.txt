[B][color=#BF9619]Welcome to Terra Aurea![/color][/B]
In this region, all nations, regardless of their political ideologies or something of the sort, are more than welcome. Terra Aurea is constantly changing, since innovation and improvement are always in the agenda. An important fact that you should always keep in mind is that our region is a realist, modern-tech, earth-based one. However, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what kind of RPs you like the most, since our goal is to become an important role-playing source for all NSers.[hr][B][color=#BF9619]Regional Government:[/color][/B]
