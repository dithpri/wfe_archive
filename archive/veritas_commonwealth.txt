A co-operative of like minded states.  Founded by the Principality of Trieme, the Commonwealth seeks to promote values of faith and freedom, while at the same time providing a supportive network of defence and mutual trade co-operation.

The Commonwealth is led by Trieme but each nation has the right of self-determination.  The Commonwealth operates as a loose confederation, with consensus the principal form of decision making.
