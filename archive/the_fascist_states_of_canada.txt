Germany won World War II,and immediately launched an invasion of North America. Canada was the first to fall, and Mexico and the USA formed an alliance to try to suppress the Nazis, but ultimately failed. When they fell, the smaller nations were so afraid they joined Germany at once. Canada then became ruler of North America, forming a higher fascist council, and thus the FSOC was formed.New recruits make sure to have a back story for your new nation, and endorse Turks . Now have a good time, recruit, have a war and kill your friends cause hey it&#146;s cool in the fascist states of Canada!!!!! Want to suggest a role play topic? telegram adolfeo.
