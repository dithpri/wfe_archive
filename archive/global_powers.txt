Greetings!

Welcome to the [region=Global Powers] a super-region created by the merger of once two great organizations(regions) [region=The Alliance of the Axis Powers], and [region=The Alliance of Grand Powers] once an active region with over 100 member states at it&amp;#39;s peak now the region is back looking to reclaim it&amp;#39;s former glory.

*A reboot is in progress if you would like to help contact either [nation=North African Empire], or [nation=Alexiandra].
