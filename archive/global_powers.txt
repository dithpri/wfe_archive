Greetings!

Welcome to the [region=Global Powers], a super-region created by the merger of two great old regions - [region=The Alliance of the Axis Powers], and [region=The Alliance of Grand Powers]. Once an active region with over 100 member states, the Global Powers is back, looking to reclaim its glory.

*A reboot is in progress. If you would like to help contact either [nation=North African Empire] or [nation=Alexiandra].
