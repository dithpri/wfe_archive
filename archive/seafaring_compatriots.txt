A Rag Tag alliance of Nations who value Naval exploration above all other forms of Exploration. We Honor the great Caravel and its contributions as a navel vessel in the quest for yonder shores. We know and acknowledge that many nations have risen and fallen in such desires. But through sheer grit, determination and the comaradery of this great Alliance we can over come the waves and tempests the world throws at us smaller nations.
