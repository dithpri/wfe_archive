The Specific Islands Forum (SIF) is unique among the regions of the world, drawing together disparate nations united only in their love for kava, cine and carefully crafted placemats.

A central issue in the SIF is that of porpoise hunting. Whereas Nye Kysterians have long hunted the porpoise, incorporating the animal into their diet and fertility rites, the Nixi Kiteriki and Maxstonians emphasise protection of the threatened species. Meanwhile, the Kinosandish Government has charted a more neutral course, calling for greater research into the highly-prized aquatic mammal.
