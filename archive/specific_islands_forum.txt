The Specific Islands Forum (SIF) is unique among the regions of the world, drawing together disparate nations united only in their love for kava, cine and carefully crafted placemats. Decisions are made on a consensus basis, requiring unanimity and a spirit of compromise. A central issue in the SIF is that of porpoise hunting. Whereas Nye Kysterians have long hunted the porpoise, the remaining SIF states emphasise protection of the threatened species. These tensions came to a head during the Great Conflagration. While Nye Kyster continues to controversially dredge reefs in the SIF Common Waters Zone (SIFCWZ), the Specific Porpoise Agreement (SPA) successfully brought the crisis to an end.
