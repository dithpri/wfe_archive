[color=#F9F9F9]WWWW[/color]We now have a forum set up, and an IRC channel to call home! This is really starting to feel like a proper region now, isn&amp;#39;t it? Ooh, you bet it is! Please endorse someone as the WA Delegate, since it seems a bit barren up top there. Come by our forum to join the region and get a constitution written, so we can get Iseori rolling in the politics.
