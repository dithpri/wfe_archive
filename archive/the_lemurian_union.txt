Welcome to [color=green]The Lemurian Union[/color]!

Loosely governed, [color=green]The Lemurian Union[/color] provides a gathering of Nations to discuss issues, defend each other from military invasions, and even occasionally enter into shenanigans.

Nations are encouraged to endorse other nations that support their views, and unendorse those that don&amp;#39;t.
WA Representatives are therefore encouraged to vote for resolutions that the entire nation endorses.
