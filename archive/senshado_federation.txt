Citizens! Lend me your ears!

This [b][i]Federation[/i][/b] unites people from all lands, from all creeds, from all beliefs! We all have diverse backgrounds, but we all find common ground in the joy of smelling spend gunpowder! Hearing the clattering of steel tracks! Seeing steel monsters rumble and roar! And feeling the blast of and raw power of cannonade! 

We all follow...

[b][i]The Way of the Tank[/i][/b] 

This region is primarily for Girls und Panzer fans to find each other and vibe! We&#39;re not a serious group at the slightest, so don&#39;t expect serious roleplay. Participating in the World Assembly is most likely is how far this group will roleplay. 

We hope you enjoy your stay! Panzer vor!

With warm regards,
The General Secretariat of the Borderlands of Las Ventura - AAHW
