I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That&#39;s the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
Then I saw her face, now I&#39;m a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I&#39;m in love, and I&#39;m a believer
I couldn&#39;t leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
The more I gave the less I got oh yeah
What&#39;s the use in tryin&#39;
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
