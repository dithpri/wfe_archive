Welcome to the region of Free Markets, civil liberties, minarchy or anarchy. Here is where we live with our neighbors in peace and don&amp;#39;t fight wars of aggression. If you&amp;#39;re a friend to liberty and an enemy of tyrants, then you&amp;#39;re welcome here. 

If you&amp;#39;re a raider though, you will be given the &amp;#39;murica treatment: Raids Repelled: 3
