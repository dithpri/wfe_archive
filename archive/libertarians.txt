Freedom! Freedom at last!!! After a short but bloody war for independence, the overwhelmed militia of the libertarians have claimed victory over the evil forces of the Black Riders. We celebrate, honor, commemorate, and mourn those who met the Black Riders in combat. Now that they are gone, we will now rebuild the region. That means we need nations.

If your nation love&amp;#39;s freedom, then you are welcome. We are libertarians, and we see freedom in all areas of government. We are a freedom-oriented region and we don&amp;#39;t particullarly welcome totalitarian phylosophies. Come to the land of free people today!
