Freedom! Freedom at last!!! We celebrate, honor, commemorate, and mourn those who met the Black Riders in combat. Now that they are gone, we will now rebuild the region. That means we need nations.

If your nation love&amp;#39;s freedom, then you are welcome. We are libertarians, and we see freedom in all areas of government. So come to the free land today.
