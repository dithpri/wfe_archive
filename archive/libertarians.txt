Welcome to the region of Free Markets, civil liberties, and little to no government, in minarchism or Anarchism. Here is where we live with our neighbors in peace and don&amp;#39;t fight wars of aggression. If you&amp;#39;re a friend to liberty and an enemy of tyrants, then you&amp;#39;re welcome here. A side note, our embassies do not in any way represent an alliance with or support for a region&amp;#39;s ideology or agenda, they only represent a way to maintain friendly contact between regions, nothing more.

If you&amp;#39;re a raider though, you will be given the &amp;#39;murica treatment: Raids Repelled: 3

Anyone who wishes to live in peace with their neighbor nations is welcome here!
