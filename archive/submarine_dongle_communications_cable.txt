[b]Before you reject our embassies, hear us out:[/b]

Much like the Translatlantic Telegraph or Fiber Optic cables, deep under the seven seas, millions of Dongles are connected together, creating a Dongle connected network so that nations might be able to communicate by Dongle.

Join us if you think you have what it takes to participate in our Dongles mission.

Seriously, though, we need help. It takes alot of donglepower to click new embassy for every single region on Nationstates. [b]If you&#145;re really nice (or even if you&#145;re mean) request embassies with us! The DONGLES are on US![/b]

We admit that we&#146;re a knock off of the Embassy, but we think we&#146;re better. Because Dongle.
