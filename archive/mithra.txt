This region no longer recognizes [region]Alcris[/region] as it&#39;s protector and we have chosen to forge our own destinies in [region]New West Conifer[/region]

Mithra was a secessionist movement from the Red Wolf Alliance. Mithra&#39;s members were annexed into the region of Alcris under false pretenses, and they later participated in a secession from Alcris alongside other annexed groups in Alcris, including members of Laraniem, New West Indies, and Conifer, to found New West Conifer.

This region is archived and managed by an alt of [nation]Floyssauu[/nation], to which you should direct all inquiries.
