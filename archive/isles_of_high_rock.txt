Quick Facts

High Rock is a region in the northwest section of the world. Most of the province is inhabited by the Imperians, who have divided the province into multiple city states and kingdoms forming a courageous and strong military alliance. The northern tip of High Rock contains The Phoenix Imperial Empire, the Royal Kingdom of His Royal Highness King Nathan. The rugged highland strongholds and isolated valley settlements have encouraged the fierce independence of the various nations and the Phoenix Channel remains the strongest body of water that few navel forces can maneuver. Nonetheless, High Rock&#39;s culture, traditions, and heroic legends are a unifying legacy.
