[b][region]Free Alliance[/region][/b]
[i]&quot;Freedom is our eternal bastion!&quot;[/i]
   The Free Alliance is a region that holds freedom as it&#39;s core. That means that any nation may join it&#39;s circle. Even your puppets.
While we defend mostly left libertarianism, any other political spectrum is accepted. [i]We believe in dialogue.[/i]
   This is a brand-new region, that is learning it&#39;s way. We need new members, so if you enjoy a small community of nations rather than hundreds of unknown nations in a mainstream region, you are welcome.
