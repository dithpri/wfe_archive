[color=purple]The Free Assembly of Cascadia[/color] was founded when two nations came together to form a Union dedicated to self-empowerment and peace.  We welcome, with limitations, new members to join us.  Our boards may seem active, and we may seem to have some internal turmoil, but I swear we&#39;re friends.  Really.
