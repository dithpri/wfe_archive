The binary star system of Ion lies on the far periphery of the Galactic Outer Rim. It comprises the twin stars Ion and Janus. Of the sixteen-odd planetoids in the star system, only the Class-N planet Cogitatus (Ion I) is habitable. The system is known for its intellectual and cultural achievements and plays a small but nevertheless important role in the politics of the Outer Rim.
