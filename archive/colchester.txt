Welcome to [region]Colchester[/region], the First Town of Britain.

[b]Immigration Policy[/b]
Nations anywhere on the political spectrum are welcome in Colchester, provided that they are to some extent geographically local. All World Assembly members must endorse [nation]Genyria[/nation] or they will be ejected and possibly banned.

[b]Colchester is a duumvirate[/b]
Whilst any member may politely propose changes, the WA Delegate and Founder have the final say.

Abusive behaviour is not tolerated. Perpetrators will be ejected (and may be banned).
