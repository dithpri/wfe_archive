The Fel Empire, also called the Fel Imperium, the Empire or the New Order, was the name given to what remained of the Galactic Empire some time after 44 ABY, following the ascension of Jagged Fel to the throne. It reflected the partial recovery of the Galactic Empire&#39;s former power and prestige, and also the restoration of the Imperial monarchy by the Fel dynasty after decades of interregnum.
