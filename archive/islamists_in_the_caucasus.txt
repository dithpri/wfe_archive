In the Caucasus, in the mountainous areas, there lived Islamists striving to create an Islamic state.  They believed in strict Islamic teachings and were willing to fight for their beliefs.

 Islamists in the Caucasus trained young people, propagated Islamic ideas and called for a struggle for liberation from the &#147;infidel&#148; authorities.  They formed detachments and prepared for armed struggle.

 The region&#39;s authorities began to worry about the growing influence of Islamists and tried to suppress their activities.  However, the Islamists were well organized and ready to resist.
