[b][color=darkblue]The Icelandic Commonwealth, Icelandic Free State, or Republic of Iceland (Icelandic: &thorn;j&oacute;&eth;veldi&eth; or, less commonly, go&eth;aveldi&eth;) was the state existing in Iceland between the establishment of the Althing in 930 and the pledge of fealty to the Norwegian king with the Old Covenant in 1262. With the probable exception of Papar, Iceland was an uninhabited island until around 870.[/color]
