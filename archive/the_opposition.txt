Founded by the nation of Korska, The Opposition is a region of the world where nations of Order, Law, Strength, and Scientific Discovery are not held by the limits of religion, morals, or outer authority. We are nations unified by the outside threats that reach our borders, and by the limitless potential of what has yet to have been reached. As the World Assembly dictates the world and focuses on the disputes between themselves, we will focus on what makes us whole and safe, not what keeps us afraid and angry. We will not be threatened anymore, or will we be broken.
