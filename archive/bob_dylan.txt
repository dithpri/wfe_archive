Bob Dylan is a celebrated, multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter. Dylan was thrust into the spotlight for his folk and protest songs in the early 60&#39;s, some of which have become archetypes of the genre like &quot;Blowin in the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Times They are a-Changin.&#39;&quot; He became disillusioned with the folk movement and switched to a more surreal, existentialist path, producing three highly-regarded rock albums which forever altered the genre, his song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; commonly regarded as one of the greatest songs of all time. Throughout the rest of his career, Dylan would delve into country, gospel, and jazz. Dylan is one of the best-selling musicians of all time and has become a cultural icon.
