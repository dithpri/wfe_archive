[color=orange][i]I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly, I&amp;#39;m crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you&amp;#39;ve been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long[/color][/i]
