Welcome the no pieces era in [color=orange]SHSID[/color], filled with monthly exams and boring math classes. Run by a corrupted principle and ASBs that technically do nothing (yet).

The regional motto is [color=aqua]&amp;quot;YOLO~&amp;quot;[/color], and [color=grass][b]OREO[/b][/color] is known as the region&amp;#39;s best food.
