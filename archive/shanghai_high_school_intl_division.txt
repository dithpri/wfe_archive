Welcome the no pieces era in [color=orange]SHSID[/color], filled with monthly exams and boring math classes. Run by a corrupted principle and ASBs that technically do nothing (yet). Most citizens are Civil War Victims, Secret Asians, Girls and Dinosaur. The regional motto is [color=aqua]&amp;quot;YOLO, YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE!&amp;quot;[/color], and [b]OREO[/b] is known as the region&amp;#39;s best food.
