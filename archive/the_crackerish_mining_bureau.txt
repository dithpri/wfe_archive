This region was once the puppet storage region for [nation]Kakastania[/nation], but it has been succeeded by [region]Kakastania[/region].
No more embassies will be accepted here.

[i]Once did this bureau rule the mines&#146; domain,
Where toiling men did seek the sleeping ore;
Now hollow walls lament their task in vain.

The ledgers moulder, speaking now no more,
While rust hath sealed each long-forsaken door;
No mortal tread doth wake the silent floor.

They&#146;ve gone to labor past the barren plain,
Where mountains climb through mists serene and sheer&#151;
Their gaze is fixed on peaks that cleave the rain.[/i]
