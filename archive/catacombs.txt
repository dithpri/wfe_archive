[b][color=#d2cf89]The Catacombs serve as an ossuary for nations that feel that their time has come. They will be honoured here and given a place for as long as NationStates survives. Nations that are resurrected will be permanently removed from the Catacombs&#39; records, and the Catacombs itself.

When you come to rest here, post your own memorial on the RMB. You will be remembered.[/color]
