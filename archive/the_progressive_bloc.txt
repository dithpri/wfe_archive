The Progressive Bloc is a region, formed on the 12th of March. We welcome many centre-left to left-wing nations, such as social democrats, social liberalists, democratic socialists, democratic liberalists and many more. We fight for the installation of progressive policies, in order to fight for the many and not the few so, are you ready to fight for human rights?
