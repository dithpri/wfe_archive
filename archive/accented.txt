[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and THE OMUKAMA from [region]Sky Haven[/region] decided to visit your region to breathe some fire over it and change your WFE, flag and banner forcefully!

[color=red]We turned into into this shade of Fire to showcase our fire breathing skills!
With the weather getting colder in Autumn, you should remember to stay warm, and stay healthy![/color]
