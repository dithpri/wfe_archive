The creator of this region, [nation]Democratic world[/nation], has given up the power of the regional founder so that this could be a true democracy with no permanent leader.

He has left it to the people to decide how the region will develop, and trusts them to elect a fair delegate, so that this region will have a bright future.

To become the delegate you must:
1. Be part of the WA
2. Not be a raider
3. Make sure people endorse you
4. If you gather the most endorsements, then at the update you will become the delegate/leader!
