An isolated archipelago with a large central island, known for its tropical climate, lush jungles, and ancient ruins. Rayywyne has recently established contact with the world at large. Though a fledgling region, the various nations have quickly struck out into the world economy, presenting themselves as ideal locations for tourism. However, the high prices, distant location and long wait lists discourage most travelers. Though considered primitive, even backwards, the nations of Rayywyne are hard at work modernizing their economies and governments. Regions within are known for their despotic rule, though quality of life and personal freedoms vary nation-to-nation.
