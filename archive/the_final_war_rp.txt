In 1981 the Last War, Letzter Krieg, &amp;#1055;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1103;&amp;#1103; &amp;#1074;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1081;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1072;, or in Latin, Bellum Ultimun, broke out. The end of antiquity has ended and a new world was forged. The tyrants of old had fought for 4 years before their empires collapsed and the people started anew, trying to rebuild civilisation. Some would try to create a time of peace among men and thus The Union of Nations was formed to serve as the new United Nations. This peace was shortlived and rivalries and fighting continued well after the Bellum Ultimun, but a new world order is dawning and it is up to us to decide the path of the earth.
