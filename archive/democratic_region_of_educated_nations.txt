[b]Who are we?[/b]
The [region]Democratic Region of Educated Nations[/region], DREN is a small region whose primary goal is to promote cross-country education and cultural exchange. We believe that education is of upmost importance in a nation, and we can only improve on this by looking to our neighbours and opening our doors to them. Our Flag shows a white cap on a field of black representing the light of education in the darkness and green stars in a Fibonacci curve to represent the growth of states through knowledge.
