Panacea is a world separate from the rest of NS, yet still boasts a variety of nations. Whether you suppress your people or you are the largest democracy around, all are welcome. We are a casual and serious RP group, so just jump in and develop your nation with us. All of our RPs are on the NS forums.

Once we have enough members we will have an election for the delegate, and at that point the founder will be only used as a place holder to prevent any take over of the government from anyone outside the region.
