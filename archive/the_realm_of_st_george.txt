&quot;Religion is the opioid of the people.&quot; -Karl Marx 

A region that is bound together by blood, not religion. The Realm of St. George was created for economic opportunity as well as for the ability for nations to voice their opinions. Countries are expected to support our fearless founder, Greater Ferma, and the appointees he has selected. Nations are also expected to endorse our sharp minded World Assembly Delegate, Veranda Confederation. Opposition will not be tolerated. Issues of immigration are to be taken up with the vice-delegate, Buhsland. 

All issues will be heard as long as the leader, Greater Ferma, is supported and Veranda Confederation is kept as our WA delegate. 

Freedom to express ones opinions is allowed.
