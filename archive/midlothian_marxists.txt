A region recently formed, in the hope of a better future for the nations of the Marxist Midlothian area.

Communication with other regions is not wanted/needed at this stage in our development, but this policy may change in the future.

We wish good things for all Communist, Anarchist, Anti-Fascist and Anti-Capitalist regions of the world.
