&quot;City of the stars&quot; (Hebrew)
A federation of small nearby planets, founded by Yafehami, a planet whose resident&#39;s ancestors came from Earth.  The federation unites together for security from the many nations on the much larger planet Earth and others.  Diplomacy and peace is preferred, but members of the federation will be fiercely loyal to each other and retaliate sharply against bullies.
(A casual and kind community: if you want to be detached from all the chaos on Earth, make your nation a planet and come join the city of stars!)
