&amp;#9734;Join the City as a temporary traveler looking for a more suitable home, or as a permanent resident looking to play casually and detached from Earth.  Either way, you can rest assured that you&#39;ll be welcome.
&amp;#9734;If anyone is browsing regions and is just zipping by, we hope you can stay a while and experience the City of Stars.

&amp;#9734;Welcome to Irkochavim!
