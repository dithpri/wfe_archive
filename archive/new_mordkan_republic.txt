[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region was an old holding of the [region]Raxulan Empire[/region], which they were holding for/against Mordka. This has now been resurrected and incorporated into the green empire. (Heh, get it, since you Raxulans used to be associated with the [i]Yellow[/i] Empire? I&#39;m so clever, aren&#39;t I?)
