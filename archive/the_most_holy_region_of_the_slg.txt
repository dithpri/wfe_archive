[b]From plane of light to plane, wings dipping through
Geometries and orchids that the sunset builds,
Out of the peak&#146;s black angularity of shadow, riding
The last tumultuous avalanche of
Light above pines and the guttural gorge,
The hawk comes.

Hawks being poetic tonight:

General [nation=short]Jakker[/nation]
Sergeant [nation=short]Hired_Contractor_IV[/nation]
Private First Class [nation=short]Maleficaerum[/nation]
