UNAF is a United &amp; Inclusive region. We don&#146;t care what type of country you have or how it&#146;s governed. A Regional poem of &#147;The ones&#148; dictates how UNAF is run.
Places come, places go.
New ones, old ones.
Some dictate an Iron fist,
While others govern democratically.
For the region that allows all, they stay.
The ones who keep a select few,
The region will surely dissolve.
