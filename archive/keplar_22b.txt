Come join for amazing space exploration and defence forces! (And one nation with lots of Recreational Drug Use.)
We are a great region. 
We love talking, so you&#39;ll find some new friends here
You just have to obey a few rules:
No inappropriate posts
No cussing (you can but it has to be in symbols)
Particapate in polls and remain active
One puppet per nation is allowed.
Banning those who have done nothing wrong is not permitted and is punishable by life banning.
Thanks for joining!
