[b]This region is now an RP region[/b]
We love talking, so you&#39;ll find some new friends here
You just have to obey a rule.
No inappropriate posts, and nothing offensive.
We are the death of Trexesel
We are nice but stern, peaceful but warlike, and weak but strong.
Keplar believes in the freedom of speech, but nothing offensive.
We tolerate nations from all over the political spectrum because it is the right thing and you can&#39;t have debates from like minded people.
Our political spectrum count:
1 conservative ([nation]King Scorm[/nation])
3 left wing liberals ([nation]Fat Cow Landia[/nation], [nation]Mamoo[/nation], [nation]CookieGuy123[/nation])
1 unclassified ([nation]Starbreaker[/nation])


PUPPETS:
 [nation=short]Wangul[/nation], puppet of [nation=short]King_Scorm[/nation]
