[b]&amp;#9820; WELCOME TO THE JUNTA! &amp;#9820;[/b][hr][b][color=gray]JUNTA[/color][/b] is a minute and fairly low-intensity military project for a small group of friends to engage in limited-scale military operations. The objective is to [b]Jump[/b], [b]Secure[/b], and [b]Refound[/b] foreign regions to build a steadily-growing empire of once-independent polities. Those who do not maintain governors are inviting hostility; they have brought it upon themselves.[hr][b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1881635]JUNTA Charter[/url] | [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1881670]JUNTA Corps (Military)[/url] | [url=https://discord.gg/z7qWg9Snzb]Discord Server[/url][/b][hr][i]There&#39;s no need to endorse the Delegate here.
