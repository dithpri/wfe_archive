The Rotarium Commonwealth is an alliance founded on the principle of imperialistic endeavour and capitalist ideals.

Our alliance protects each and every member with our superior military might and our common ideologies.

Everyone has a say in our parliament, and any member can run for elections which are unanimously voted for to gain a position of power and representation in Parliament. All MPs, however, must acknowledge and respect the position of our supreme leader who sits in the his palace, The Divine Wind, in the capital of Rotarius.

Viva Rotary and praise be to the supreme leader!
