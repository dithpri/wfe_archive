[color=blue][u][b]Welcome to the Kingdom of Lochac.[/b][/u][/color]

The Kingdom of Lochac was founded on the first of Feburary 2017 by settlers from [region]Calefacta Aquas Piscinae[/region] dissatisfied with the lack of democratic representation in the region following the dissolution of the [b]Jacuzzi Council[/b]. The word &quot;Lochac&quot; is a dutch term for Australia dating back to 1630, however it is commonly used to refer to New Zealand and Australia&#39;s Antarctic Territory too.
