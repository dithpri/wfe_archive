The winner of the April 20th election is RYDER, with CHASE, as his running mate, clearly a victory for the pact party! There will be an election every two weeks for WA delegate and there will be a three term limit on the candidates. There will also be elections for minor positions, on and off spontaneously. Will New United try to run as an independent next time and undercut the pact party, tune in next election and find out!
Also, watch out for the military field guide, comming some time next week, the BLITZKREIG is near!
