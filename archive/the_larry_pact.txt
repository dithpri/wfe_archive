In fear of invasion for our international incompetence and hilarious inefficient government, I have declared marshal law over the Larry pact, no one gets in or out. No one moves without order, at least until we regain our glory. (No more elections until further notice) PRAISE LARRY!  

Prepare for BLITZKREIG boys, we will grow to a war fueled superpower! Hail Larry! 
Larry is all! (Shut down the borders and message board, private telegram and government mandates only) 

(More updates to the Bible later) (change in constitution and government) (invasive military action) (diplomacy)
