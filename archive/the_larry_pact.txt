[i][b]From this point on, all activities and plans will be centrally enacted by the government. To combat a sharper decline in activity than the one that we already face, I implore anyone who wishes to mark his presence over the summer with a daily &#39;Praise Larry&#39; on the message board. I hope to see our community return to its former strength, but as of now, democracy and roleplay are basically dead. Until our next election, Latvion will serve as WA Delegate and Fuhrer. Praise Larry, and have a great summer! This has been LARRY-BLUTZ, signing off.
