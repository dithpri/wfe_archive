Marshall law has been lifted bois, elections will commence soon. Government reforms soon. have fun. Also, no i&#39;m not happy about it. elections begin tomorrow and borders are fully lifted. (use chat again too) (revealing classified information is still a war crime)
Prepare for the invasion of founderless regions boys, we will grow to a war fueled steaming pile of trash! Praise Larry! 
Larry is all! ugh. also its about larryism again, not fascism.
