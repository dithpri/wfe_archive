The People&#39;s Sovereignty Collective is a region united by the belief that the power of the people can reshape the world. We embrace nationalism, communism, and socialism, working for a fairer, more equal future. All member nations have an equal voice and a shared commitment to the well-being of their people. We operate on democratic socialism and collective decision-making, ensuring no nation is left behind. Our core values are unity, progress, and equality. The Collective is a vibrant community where nations share ideas, celebrate traditions, and help each other grow. We focus on mutual aid and create a self-sustaining economy through shared resources and technology.
