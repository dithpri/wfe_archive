[b][color=red]WELCOME TO[/color] [color=gold]THE MUSEUM OF[/color] [color=blue]SOUTH ORKNEY[/color][/b][hr] The Commonwealth of South Orkney is a small, tight-knit community of nations living in good peace with each other. Everyone is welcome except trolls, raiders and mean people in general. Though it looks completely ordinary, South Orkney is in fact, unique in many ways. Not only do we have a fully-functioning, state-of-the-art, democratic government, we also have a currency and a satellite region for medieval roleplay. Furthermore, we are chess-cultured, and we spend time playing and competing in chess. But more than anything, we have fun! We have an active, though sometimes eccentric, RMB and are always eager to see new nations join our community.
