[b][color=red]Welcome[/color] [color=gold]to South[/color] [color=blue]Orkney![/color][/b][hr] The Commonwealth of South Orkney is a small tight knit community if nations living in good peace with their neighbours. Everybody is welcome, except trolls, raiders and mean people in general. Though it looks completely ordinary, South Orkney is in fact unique in many ways. Not only do we have a fully state of the art democratic government, we also have a currency and a satellite region with medieval roleplay. Furthermore, we are chess cultured and we spend time playing chess and contesting in chess cups.  But more than anything, we have fun, we have an active though sometimes eccentric RMB, and we are always eager to see new nations join our community.
