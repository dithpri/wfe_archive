Pulled away from the oppressive nature of other regions, the Hidden Islands encourage the freedom to rule your own nation as you see fit. The rulers of nations within the Hidden Islands do not, and will not, judge other rulers on how they wish to rule, or their beliefs. Within your borders, you have final say.

The Hidden Islands are officially, and will always, be ruled by the God-King Raynor Asger Terrato of the Holy Empire of Umbra Silva, but his Imperial Highness has no intention of controlling the way one chooses to rule their nation.
