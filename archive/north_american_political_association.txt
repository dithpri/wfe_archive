The North American Political Association, NAPA for short, is a new, fun, progressive, and productive organization focused on creating connections that will benefit all of our member nations. Our members come from different parts of the world all with a similar desire: to be the best they can possibly be and make a lasting difference.

With the drive of being our best possible selves, as well as our values on openness, diversity, uniqueness, positivity, and forward-thinking, we can achieve our goal: [i]creating a better tomorrow at home as well as abroad.[/i]
