[color=blue] Welcome to the CT community! A new fast-growing and inclusive region committed to supporting anyone who lands here, whether seasoned nationstates veteran or complete noob. If in the WA please endorse our WA delegate [nation]Criboutit[/nation], if not telegram me for guidance to be able to do so.

We boast some good activities here! Like roleplay, QOTD, plus an active and inclusive RMB. I fully encourage you to get involved and stay engaged to help our region grow and prosper. 
We also have the Terra Defense Force, telegram [nation]Greater Sasmidia[/nation] to sign up. And telegram [nation]Tanzaka[/nation] for input or support on anything else.

Hope this helps, enjoy the CT! [/color] :)
