A long-lost region, dominated by ancient castles a towns that point towards civilization once existing in the region, the land was discovered by explorers sent by the OHS, now seemingly led by mysterious tribes, of unknown origin. After these fertile lands were found, they were colonized by OHS forces, after a mass emigration from [region]The Lost Isles[/region] for better lands. Power is held by the Leader, who rules the lands from a long-abandoned palace in the northern reach of the region, surrounded by a rebuild city in the feet of a once powerful kingdom.
