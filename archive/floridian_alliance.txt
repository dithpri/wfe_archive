The Floridian Alliance was formed in 2057, made up of several new independent republics formed after the crisis in the United States. After the government of the US fell apart, the nation fell into a state of anarchy. Cities around the continent erupted into armed conflict, and many new countries declared their independence. Most of the new nations that came out of Florida, and the surrounding area, joined the Floridian Alliance.
