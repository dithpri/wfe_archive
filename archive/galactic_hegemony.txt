[b]Welcome to the [color=#ffcc33]Galactic Hegemony[/color]![/b]

The Galactic Hegemony, despite its name, is not an IC alliance. This has no IC component to it! It&#39;s simply for OOC chat and OOC region stuff.

We do have a Discord server! It&#39;s used, not only for more OOC chat, but also for IC diplomacy! It has a custom-written bot (written in Kotlin, for those uncultured plebeians who still use Java) that you can use to link your nation to!
