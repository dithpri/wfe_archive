We would love to have you here! We are a region where monarchy rules. This is the place where you belong. In order to become a citizen, either the Prime Minister establishes you as one, or you endorse the Prime Minister and say the pledge of Imperial Britain. (This is the pledge: I do hereby declare that I will be loyal to Imperial Britain.)
