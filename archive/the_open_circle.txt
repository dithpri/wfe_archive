[i]&quot;The only way forward is together. We are building something great here. Something that, in ten years&#39; time, we will look back on and have pride in. Taking the opportunity to come together and build a region; a region that is far superior in every way to the other regions of NationStates. Superior in technology, in community, and in enhancing the lives of those around us.&quot;[/i]
