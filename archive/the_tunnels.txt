Earth, 2030s. Thirty years after a devastating nuclear war in 2013 AD, the remnants of Mankind huddle in the dark of the metro and sewer systems of the cities of the world, a nuclear winter has polluted the air, water, and surviving wildlife on the surface to the point where most people choose to live in the relative safety of the underground, surviving on mushrooms, pigs, dogs and cats, rats, and even each other when supplies run out. Much of Mankind&#146;s knowledge of science has been lost in the nuclear holocaust, replaced largely by myth and religion.
