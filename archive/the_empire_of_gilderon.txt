
[b][color=yellow]We, some adorable hawks, were returning from an [/color][color=green]anime convention[/color][color=yellow], but felt really tired, so we decided to stop by in your region.
In the meantime, we took the liberty to put up some [/color][color=red]fumos[/color][color=yellow], [/color][color=teal]anime posters [/color] [color=yellow]and [/color][color=pink]cool lights[/color]. [color=yellow]In exchange, we took all your cookies (we were tired)
If you want to help us [strike]steal more cookies[/strike] put up more anime posters all around the universe, [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]come say hi![/url]
