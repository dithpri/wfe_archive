Here in the Iron States we have one major, major concern and that is crime safety. Indeed, we are renowned for our highly successful and totally friendly police forces, as well as our entirely not misleading prisoner re-education camps. Now I&amp;#39;m sure you are wondering how our policing is just so good, well we use three simple points, firstly we give all our police offers automatic weapons, thus cutting down of youth crime by 68% in one year alone, secondly we are on of the few places to make use of Zeppelins, both as observation and to move large groups of people around- they work a treat, our third method is that the police have total freedom over the equal population
