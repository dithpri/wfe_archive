Terrestrial living is a ruined concept! So long as we are in each other&#39;s presence, there will be oppression and ruin. Even the most sacred sciences will be abused under the current system.
Our only hope is to run, as fast as we can. We will run free through the stars, bound by nothing. Only then can we escape ourselves. We must all work together, to develop advanced space faring technology! We must cosmoform our mortal frames!
