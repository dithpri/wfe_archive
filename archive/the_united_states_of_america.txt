. . . It&#39;s a good thing you don&#39;t have bus fare,
It would fall through the hole in the pocket,
And you&#39;d lose it in the snow on the ground,
Gotta walk into town to find a job.

Trying to keep your hands warm,
When the hole in your shoe let the snow come through,
And chills you to the bone,
Now you better go home where it&#39;s warm  . . .
