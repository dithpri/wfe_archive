For two days the river keeps you down,
Then you rise to the light without a sound,
Past the playgrounds and the empty switching yards,
The turtles eat the skin from your eyes,
As they lay open to the stars.

The clothes give way the current and river stone,
Delivery trays of who you ever were is gone,
And things of the earth they make their claim,
That the things of heaven may do the same. . . .
