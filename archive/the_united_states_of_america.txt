[color=blue] . . . I saw below me a golden valley,
This land was made for you and me. . . .

One Sunday morning in the shadow of the steeple,
By the relief office I saw the people,
And they were hungry and they were wondering,
If this land was made for you and me.

This land is your land, this land is my land,
From California to the New York island,
From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters,
This land was made for you and me.[/color]
