Jesus Christ was a man who traveled through the land,
Hard-working man and brave,
He said to the rich, &quot;Give your goods to the poor,&quot;
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave. . . .

He went to the preacher, 
He went to the sheriff,
Told them all the same,
&quot;Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the poor,&quot;
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave. . . .
