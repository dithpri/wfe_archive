The road is long and seeming without end,
Well days go on,
I remember you, my friend,
And though you&#39;re gone
And my heart&#39;s been emptied it seems
I&#39;ll see you in my dreams.

I got your guitar, Here, by the bed
All your favorite records,
All the books that you read,
And though my soul feels like
Feels like it&#39;s been split at the seams,
I&#39;ll see you in my dreams
