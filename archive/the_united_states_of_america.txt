Pay me, Oh, pay me, Pay me my money down,
Pay me or go to jail, Pay me my money down.
 . . .
I wish I&#39;d been a rich man&#39;s son, Pay me my money down,
I&#39;d sit on the river and watch it run, Pay me my money down.
 
I wish I was Mr Gates, Pay me my money down,
They&#39;d haul my money in in crates, Pay me my money down.
