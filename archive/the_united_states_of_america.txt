 . . . The Blacks, the Irish, the Italians, the Germans and the Jews,
The Puerto Ricans, illegals, the Asians, Arabs miles from home,
Come across the water with a fire down below.
They died building the railroads, worked to bones and skin,
They died in the fields and factories, names scattered in the wind,
They died to get here a hundred years ago, they&#39;re dyin&#39; now,
The hands that built the country we&#39;re all trying to keep down. . . .
