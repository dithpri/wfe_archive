. . . Out of school and out of work,
Thrift store jeans and flannel shirts,
The lights go down as you face the crowd,
The last man standing now.

Lights come up at the Legion Hall,
Pool cues go back up on the wall,
Pack your guitar and have one last beer,
With just the ringing in your ears.

Rock of ages lift me, somehow,
Somewhere high and hard and loud,
Somewhere deep into the heart of the crowd,
I&#39;m the last man standing now . . .
