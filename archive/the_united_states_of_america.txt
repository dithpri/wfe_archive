I like the way your sparkling earrings lay,
Against your skin so brown.
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight,
With a million stars all around.
&#39;Cause I got a peaceful, easy feeling,
And I know you won&#39;t let me down,
&#39;Cause I&#39;m already standing on the ground . . .
