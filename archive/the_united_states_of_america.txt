It&#39;s a beggars life, said the Queen of Spain,
But don&#39;t tell it to a poor man,
Cause he&#39;s got to kill for every thrill,
The best he can.

Everywhere around me,
I see jealousy and mayhem,
Because no men have all their peace of mind,
To carry them.

Well I don&#39;t really care if it&#39;s wrong or if it&#39;s right,
But until my ship comes in I&#39;ll live night by night. . . .
