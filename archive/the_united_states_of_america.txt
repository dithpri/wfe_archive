[b][color=red]WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA[/color][hr][color=blue]Now playing on The United States of America Radio:  [i][url=]Streets of Philadelphia[/url][/i][/b]

I was bruised and battered
I couldn&amp;#39;t tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window
I didn&amp;#39;t know my own face
Oh, Brother, you&amp;#39;re gonna leave me wasting away
On the streets of Philadelphia.

I walked the avenue till my legs felt like stone
I heard voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain
On the streets of Philadelphia. . . . [/color]
