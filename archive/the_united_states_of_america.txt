I come from down the valley,
Where Mister, when you&amp;#39;re young,
They bring you up to do,
Just like your daddy done.

Me and Mary we met in high school,
And she was just 17,
We&amp;#39;d ride out of that valley,
Down to where the fields were green.

We&amp;#39;d go down to the river,
Into the river we&amp;#39;d dive,
Oooooh down to the river,
We&amp;#39;d ride . . . [/color]
