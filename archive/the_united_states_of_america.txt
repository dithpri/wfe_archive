. . . Where are the eyes, the eyes with the will to see?
Where are the hearts that run over with mercy?
Where&#39;s the love that has not forsaken me?
Where&#39;s the work that&#39;ll set my hands, my soul free?
Where is the spirit that&#39;ll reign, reign over me?
Where&#39;s the promise from sea to shining sea?
Where&#39;s the promise from sea to shining sea?
Where ever this flag&#39;s flown . . .
We take care of our own . . .
