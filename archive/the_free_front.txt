The Free Front exists to provide a sense of immersion and membership within its ranks. It is first and foremost a coalition, and therefore maintains a standing army. Nations are accepted and left to their own devices, but a minimal level of participation is required, as the Free Front is an active region. 

The only nations barred from joining are Anarchists, Fascists, and Communists, as they are the sworn enemy of the Free Front.

If a nation wishes to join to interact with our growing coalition, do not hesitate. We will welcome you with open arms.

The army conducts regular exercises, so any interested parties feel free to join as well.
