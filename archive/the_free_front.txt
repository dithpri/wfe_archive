The FF (Free Front) is a region of peace and it values every nation inside of it, it is a alliance of nations not wanting to start war but will crush their enemies if messed with. You don&#39;t need high military spending to be in it, and you aren&#39;t judged on your political party (Unless you are anarchist). We stay strong in our numbers and we want freedom for all our people and nations. The FF also has a constitution which will be added to the factbook later.
