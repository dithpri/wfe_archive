Palm Paradise has wonderful annual temperatures, summertime highs between 80 and 90 wintertime highs between 65 and 80. Nights never get too cool in the winter and in the summertime too hot. We have wonderful island breezes that seem to detour hurricanes along with the gentle current and many days of sunshine. Palm Paradise has very few days of full rain but enough to be a lush. 
Palm Paradise is a Federation of up to 12 island nations and a prison penal island, we will only fill to 12, and then a password will come back. Palm Paradise is administered by the Prime Minister, Maya Pugnacio and 12 Palm Premiers (Governors). Enjoy your tropical new home.
