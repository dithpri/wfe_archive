Previously a fascist region, The Fourth Era was protected in the name of fascism by [nation=short]Nationalist State of Knox[/nation]. After Knox left the ranks of the Nazis, the region was abandoned. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with other [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascist[/b] forces.

Its remaining occupants are now being evacuated by international relief services and the FJA military. Fascists, if you want the land back, you will have to wait until around January 18th, by which time the innocent people of The Fourth Era will be safe and the resources salvaged.

Hatred has no era; it is present in every part of history. And so is the struggle against it.
