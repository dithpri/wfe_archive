Alcatraz is a region I first discovered in 2003 at the age of 12. Its founder was the United States of Vazquez, though the founding of Alcatraz predated the institution of &amp;quot;founder,&amp;quot; as it were. In its heyday, Alcatraz was home to over three hundred nations and was one of the largest regions--player created or not--in the game of NationStates. Notably, Alcatraz was the point of origin for the notorious defender clique ADN. Since those days, La Familia has grown up and moved on.
