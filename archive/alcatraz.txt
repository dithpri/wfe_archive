[b][color=purple]Goodbye[/color] to Alcatraz![hr]Once upon a time, this region was the co-founding member of the Alliance Defense Network, the primordial ooze out of which emerged defenderdom as we know it today.

Thanks to our [color=purple][i]malicious[/i][/color] benefactors, and despite lazy defender attempts to let the Security Council do their jobs, it is now permanently in the hands of raiders.

[i]Alcatraz&#39;s damnation was sponsored by [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region], [region]Sparkalia[/region], [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=osiris]the Sekhmet Legion[/url], [region]the Black Hawks[/region], [region]Ijaka[/region], [region]Kantrias[/region], and [region]Astoria[/region]. Cheers to our benefactors![/i]
