We are a small group of primarily Socialistic States surrounding the magnificent Suwannee River.  Many of us uphold the tenants of humanism in addition to those of socialism, supporting strong civil rights and monetary equality for our peoples.  There are those among us whose civil rights and monetary equality are less than satisfactory, but we hope to lead them forward with our example.
