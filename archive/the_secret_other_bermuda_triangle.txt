You will never find it.

Do not go looking.

Too many have been lost.

Do not burry the bodies.

Burn the corpses, lest be found from the shadows.

They catch the sent of decay.

They hear the screams of your agony.

They know not forgiveness of sin. 

You will never find it.

Do not go looking.
