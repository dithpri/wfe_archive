Welcome to the [region]The Coudan Territories[/region]. Here you can enjoy free speech, and a founder who wants to work with you.

Elections and other stuff, are held when ever a majority of the voting population wants them to occur, and I will try to vote for whoever the non-voting population wants.

Games and other fun things are freely allowed and encouraged. Even though you can be a psychotic dictatorship, democracy is preferred.

[b]I hope you enjoy your times here at [region]The Coudan Territories[/region][/b]
