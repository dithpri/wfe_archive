The United Nusantara Islamic Confederation (UNIC) is a regional bloc of Islamic states in the Malay Archipelago to pool resources like oil, gas, precious metals, militaries and human resources in order to turn the Nusantara into the most developed Islamic region in the world.

It is made up of a diverse array of ethnicities and races, with member states generally tolerant of other religions despite Islam as their state religion.
