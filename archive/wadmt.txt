Welcome to the [b]WADMT[/b]
[b]WADMT[/b]=[colour=blue]world assembly delegation military treaty[/colour].
The WADMT was founded by [nation]Astro germinasia[/nation] to create a military protection treaty between nations to ensure protection against [colour=red]facsist[/colour] groups or [colour=red]raiding[/colour] groups in nation states
This treaty was founded to ensure that every nation part of it is protected by a joint military group which is called WADMT. It is required that every nation part of it will assist other nations withing the treaty and nations which seek help outside the treaty. It is not a requirement for a nation to send troops into combat straight away but if the world assembly decleares war on a region which causes trouble to other nations or regions then every member is expected to send in troops.
