Canedeau was once a Canadian space colony which has gained its own autonomy. Currently, it consists of 13 provinces and one special administrative region; known as Windbec. 

Windbec, formally the Windsor-Qeubecshire coridoor, is a special administrative region largely due to a a difference in culture and thoughts on the way things should be ran. Windbec does not support Geronticide, whereas in Canedeau, it is simply considered a normal part of life. Civil rights in Windbec generally are higher nowadays too.

Windbec is officially bilingual, with 70% of the population speaking both Old French and New English, whereas Canedeau has a bilingualism rate of only 10%.
