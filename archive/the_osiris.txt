[b]The Egyptians associated the first appearance of the phoenix with a golden age in their history known as Zep Tepi, the &#147;First Time.&#148; They were convinced the foundations of their civilization were established during this remote and glorious epoch.The First Time seems to have been the period during which Osiris reigned as foremost king of Egypt. It was during this era that he established law (maat) and initiated worship of Ra, Egypt&#146;s monotheistic God. Rundle Clark explained: &#147;The reign of Osiris was a golden age, the model for subsequent generations. Maat and monotheism, the &#147;model for subsequent generations&#148; set forth by Osiris, was the driving force behind Egyptian culture for thousands of years.[/b]
