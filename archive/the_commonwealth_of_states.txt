The Commonwealth Constitution outlines membership, institutions, legislative powers, citizens&#39; rights, amendments, and dissolution. Membership is open to nations committed to the Constitution&#39;s values. The institutions include the Council of Ministers, Parliament, and Court of Justice. The Council of Ministers manages the Commonwealth, while Parliament approves or rejects legislation. The Court of Justice enforces the Constitution. Amendments and dissolution require a two-thirds vote from the Council and Parliament and a positive recommendation from the Court. Citizens have rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and religion and equality before the law.
