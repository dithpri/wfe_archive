The CLS League of Morally Debatable States is the 3rd such attempted League after Harry forgot the passwords to the other two.

We are a proud collective of psychotic, consumerist, communist, and generally morally debatable states. 

The League&#39;s government and ruling bodies are fundamentally corrupt and have a habit of handing out random positions to whoever asks first.

Long live the League!
