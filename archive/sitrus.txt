Sitrus is a newly-discovered earthlike exoplanet. It is the galaxy&#39;s most apt environment for the native Sitrus berry, and there is a small colonization fever with ambitions to exploit this new land. Notably, Sitrus&#39;s native ecosystem is home only to flora, and most fauna introduced prospers in the unexplored wilderness.
