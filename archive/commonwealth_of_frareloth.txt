[region]Commonwealth of Frareloth[/region] is not only a region of political unity but also an economic, free trade union which allows members to be independent in governing. The Commonwealth is renowned for it&#39;s strong eco-friednly economies and hold civil and political rights dearly. We believe diplomacy is better with handshakes then bombs and are always willing to barter.
