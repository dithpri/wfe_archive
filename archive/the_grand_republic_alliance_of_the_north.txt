The Grand Republic Alliance of the North consists of the combination of multiple republic nations, most notably, ChristNordland.  Our culture is Celtic in origin, but contains a modern-European atmosphere.  We are strictly a republic based alliance, but we do occasionally accept democracies.  For here in our Grand Republic Alliance, liberty sings it&amp;#39;s song of freedom all through the frost-covered hills of the northern parts of the globe.  This region spans from all of Europe and Russia.  We plan on spreading our region to colonize the New England and New France regions of North America.
