Welcome to the Galaxias Kyklos. The universe&#146;s most cooperative galaxy. The Galaxias Kyklos is famously known for its hundreds of races cooperating and living in peace.
It&#146;s been 14 days since our last invasion within citadel jurisdiction.
The Galaxias Kyklos is run by the United Galactic Citadel, or UGC, who has jurisdiction over almost the entire galaxy with each race holding there own embassy. The citadel is run by a council of delegates from each quadrant. The space era is among us.
