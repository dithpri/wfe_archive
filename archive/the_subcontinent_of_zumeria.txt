Zumeria is a small region buried deep within the West Pacific region. Previously claimed completely by the country of Heimdallr, which collapsed, leading to the fall of the region. It now houses a nation rising from the ashes, Einherfell. 

Einerherfell plans on expanding to the regions&#39; borders.
