A sister region to [region]Apex[/region], we split from Apex to form a region where a few old friends can talk and hang out. All nations are welcome, you won&amp;#39;t be denied entry on religious, political, or racial factors. No matter who you are feel free to join.

If you have any Questions please contact [nation]Acro[/nation], [Nation]Corn[/nation] or [nation]Rackenshan[/nation].

But if you want to stay in this region you have to be polite to others and respect their beliefs. We plan on sharing RP&amp;#39;s with [region]Apex[/region] and that means you must be polite to their members as well.

So have fun my friends and I hope you have a good time.
