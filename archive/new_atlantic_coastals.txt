Our region puts a great emphasis on human rights and freedom. All of the member states are very determined on keeping and/or fighting for our and other countries suverenity. We benefit from the resources of the West-Atlantic region, let them be subsoil resources or anything the ocean has to offer for us. We are open to welcome new members, if they fit all of our requirements and if they swear to uphold our region&#39;s values and to protect the region with all of it&#39;s member states. &quot;Strength through unity&quot;
