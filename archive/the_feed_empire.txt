MESSAGE OF THE DAY:

Democratic elections for non-delegate positions (because delegate positions are already democratic) will begin Thursday at 3:00 until Friday at 3:00.
If you want to apply for a position, telegram me.

Positions:

Vice Delegate x1 (Communication/Polling/Embassies/Appearance)
Communications Officer x1 (Comminications)
Meme Appropriatior, Election Official x3 (Polling)
Diplomacy Officer x1 (Embassies)
Fashion Star x1 (Appearance)

In my opinion, border control is looking for abuse, so it will stay as the unique delegate power... unless this poll changes something!

Hooray for Democracy!
