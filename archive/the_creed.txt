[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by!

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

We took this region with force and we had one lone [nation=short]Isidor C Stark[/nation] all left alone by his lonesome after this night of raiding.

[nation=short]MagentaFairy[/nation] later found out that [nation=short]Joshannia[/nation] was her father. Heartbroken [nation=short]MagentaFairy[/nation] turned into a dragon killing everyone of the Kingdom of [region]Albion[/region]!

Not even the prince of [region]Albion[/region], [nation=short]Christopher Bishop[/nation], was spared!

With that this story comes to an end! Thank you for reading![/b]
