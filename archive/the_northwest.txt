A great place full of the scent of the ocean, mixed with pine needles. Come join in the fun!

[i]Out of the cloud-world sweeps thy awful form,
Vast frozen river, fostered by the storm
Upon the drear peak&amp;#39;s snow-encumbered crest,
Thy sides deep grinding in the mountain&amp;#39;s breast
As down its slopes thou plowest to the sea
To leap into thy mother&amp;#39;s arms, and be
There cradled into nothingness...[/i]
