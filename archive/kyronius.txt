The wonderful region of Kyronius was founded by our glorious f&uuml;hrer Adolf bin Laden after he discovered that, in almost every other area of the world, these disgusting things known as &#39;political freedom&#39; and &#39;civil rights&#39; existed and, indeed, were generally welcomed. Vowing to do something about this, he set up his own region, which sought only to juice as much as it could from the world. 
The best employment options are the widely embraced military or, for those who want a better-lined pocketbook, the large and just a teensy bit corrupt government is the place to be. All in all, Kyronius is a lovely place for all you iron-fisted, ruthless tycoons to reside. Move here! We love more assets - I mean citizens!
