As the name suggests, Pure Evil is a land of the kind of evil decent people pretend doesn&#146;t exist, tyrants of every stripe are found here wantonly indulging themselves, laughing over them are incredibly powerful dark gods who relentlessly persue their own ambitions whatever they may be without even the slightest thought towards their lessers.
A land of malice and unspeakable cruelty, of tyranny and death, it&#146;s even said Death itself lives here in the dark, consuming every soul that passes through eventually.
