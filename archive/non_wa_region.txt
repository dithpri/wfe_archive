Non-WA Region is the region where you guessed it, you don&#39;t have to be WA to be citizen or whatever all the other things. You just become a citizen when you join the region. WA nations are welcome to join aswell.
We do not restrict what your nation ideology can be.
Rules: 
No Bullying. Bullying is bad, and will result in an ejection the first time, and a ban the second time.
No Racism. This is the same as Bullying.
No Begging For Regional Officer. This will result in a warning.
No Spam. Spam is annoying, and will result in ejection.
No Trolling. This is basically all of the above.
No Homophobia. See: Bullying. 
And All the NS rules apply.
Since I have forgotten all the passwords to my puppet storage region nations, feel free to take it over, raiders!
