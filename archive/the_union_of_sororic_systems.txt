[b]The Union of Sororic Systems[/b]

We, the undersigned, hereby declare a union of systems and planets, ruled in their own way.

We acknowledge the existence of pantheons, magic, mythological creatures, and the opposite.

We will unite to discuss the issues in the WA to come up with a uniform decision on how we wish the Omniverse around us operates. After all, the only bad vote is one that is made uninformed.
