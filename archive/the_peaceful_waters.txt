The Peaceful Waters is a region for those that don&#39;t wish to be in a region. A loose alliance with a small international organization to represents it&#39;s various member states, exerting little to no authority over them, with only a single rule: don&#39;t be an ass.

Obviously you&#39;re free to use the board, again the only rule being the one stated above. There are no offsite groups, forums, etc., only the board.
