the UTSR came forth after the Kovn&euml; revolution against the oppressive Ognev&euml; fascists who drove the Kovn&euml; people to near extinction in a massive genocide.  Led by Yukavi, the supreme leader of the PRK, the Union has the best economy, civil liberties, and political freedom of any Union known to humanity.

In order to join, a republic must contact Yukavi at the People&#39;s Republic of Kovnyezh.

Hakar&auml;vd Yukavi Div&auml;lve!  (Long live Yukavi Div&auml;lve!)
