A small, isolated land incorporating several burgeoning nations.  While there is little that unites any of the member nations, time will serve to see if they grow closer together or segregate into unique niches.  Either way, it is the hope and dream of each of Providence&amp;#39;s member states that this region ultimately serve all of its citizens, regardless of where they call home, in one form or another, as they see fit.  The nation states of Providence believe in supporting one another arbitrarily, regardless of their individual natures and any potential disagreements regarding methods of government.
