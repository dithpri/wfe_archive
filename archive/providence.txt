[b]Providence[/b] is the capital and most populous city in the U.S. state of Rhode Island, founded in 1636, and one of the oldest cities in the United States. 

Providence was founded by Roger Williams, a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of &quot;God&#39;s merciful Providence&quot;, which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River, at the head of Narragansett Bay. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
