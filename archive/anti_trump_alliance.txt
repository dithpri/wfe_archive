Welcome to the Anti-Trump Alliance (ATA for short)!

We are a collection of nations from across the political spectrum united in one core belief: Donald J Trump [u]cannot[/u] become the next occupant of the White House. Whether you&#39;re a diehard fascist or your friendly neighbourhood communist, if you passionately follow our core belief, you can find your home in the ATA. 
By the way, the ATA is not North America-based. It is a free, international coalition.

We do not officially &#39;endorse&#39; any political candidate for the US presidency. However, to make anti-Trump opposition as unified as possible, we [i]suggest[/i] that people vote for Hillary Clinton.
