Welcome to the Anti-Trump Alliance, a casual union of nations united by one core belief: Donald Trump should not be President of the USA. It doesn&#39;t matter what your other political opinions are - whether you&#39;re a [colour=blue]diehard fascist[/colour] or [colour=red]your friendly neighbourhood communist[/colour], if you share our core belief, you can find your home in the ATA. 

[b]In the aftermath of a disastrous election result, we call for unity within the anti-Trumpists: no blaming it on Stein, or the Bernie-or-Busters, or Hillary. There is more that unites us than divides us. Only united can we have any power against Trump and his government.[/b]
