Welcome to the Anti-Trump Alliance, a casual union of nations united by one core belief: Donald J Trump [u]cannot[/u] become the next resident of the White House. It doesn&#39;t matter what your other political opinions are - whether you&#39;re a [colour=blue]diehard fascist[/colour] or [colour=red]your friendly neighbourhood communist[/colour], if you share our core belief, you can find your home in the ATA. 

The Alliance does not specifically &#39;endorse&#39; any candidate for US presidency. However, to keep anti-Trump opposition as unified as possible, we [i]suggest[/i] that people vote for Hillary Clinton.

[b][u]Please endorse our WA Delegate, [nation]Aurea Una Liberales[/nation]. The more endorsements our Delegate has, the more powerful the Alliance is.[/b][/u]

&quot;United we can take a stand against evil&quot;
