Welcome to the Anti-Trump Alliance, a casual union of nations united by one core belief: Donald Trump [u]cannot[/u] become the next resident of the White House. It doesn&#39;t matter what your other political opinions are - whether you&#39;re a [colour=blue]diehard fascist[/colour] or [colour=red]your friendly neighbourhood communist[/colour], if you share our core belief, you can find your home in the ATA. 

We don&#39;t specifically &#39;endorse&#39; any candidate for US presidency. However, to keep anti-Trump opposition as unified as possible, we [i]suggest[/i] that people vote for Hillary Clinton.
