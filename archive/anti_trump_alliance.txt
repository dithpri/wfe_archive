Welcome to the Anti Trump Alliance, a casual collection of countries concerned about Donald Trump&#39;s distasteful travesties. It doesn&#39;t matter what your political opinions are - whether you&#39;re a [colour=blue]friendly fascist[/colour] or a [colour=red]cuddly communist[/colour], if you share our disdain for the Donald, you can find your home in the ATA.

[b]In the aftermath of a disastrous election result, we call for unity among anti-Trumpists: no blaming it on Stein, or the Bernie-or-Busters, or Hillary. There is more that unites us than divides us. Only united can we have any power against Trump and his misdeeds.[/b]
