Welcome to the [b][color=purple]Anti-Trump Alliance[/color][/b] (ATA for short)!

We are a collection of nations from across the political spectrum united in one core belief: Donald J Trump [u]cannot[/u] become the next occupant of the White House. Whether you&#39;re a [color=blue]diehard fascist[/color] or your [color=red]friendly neighbourhood communist[/color], if you passionately follow our core belief, you can find your home in the ATA. 
By the way, the ATA is [u]not[/u] North America-based. It is a [color=green]free, international coalition[/color].

We do not officially &#39;endorse&#39; any political candidate for the US presidency. However, to make anti-Trump opposition as unified as possible, we [i]suggest[/i] that people vote for [color=blue]Hillary Clinton[/color].
