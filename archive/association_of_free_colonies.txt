The Association of Free Colonies (AFC) represents an effort of post-colonial nations to forge strong states and diplomatic relations on an international scale. The founder of the AFC, Ile St. Jean, was a former colony of France whose War of Independence resulted in the desire for their people to aid other post-colonial states or current colonies to throw off their shackles and join a free association based on liberty, justice, equality and fraternity.
