&amp;quot;All Under Heaven&amp;quot; is perhaps a more conventional translation of the Chinese tianxia, but they ultimately mean the same thing. Either way, the phrase represents a claim to rule all that is on Earth with Imperial authority. There can only be one Emperor, one link for mankind between Heaven and Earth, and that is the hero destined to restore peace and tranquility to All Under Heaven.
