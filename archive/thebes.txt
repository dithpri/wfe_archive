The previous region named &amp;quot;Thebes&amp;quot; was created to honor only the Greek city by that name, giving no respect to the original Thebes, which was the capital of Egypt for nearly a thousand years.

To correct that mistake, the Refounded Region of Thebes will be culturally Egyptian, but will pay homage to all cities named &amp;quot;Thebes.&amp;quot;

We plan to open the region someday, but some other matters have to be addressed first. In the meantime, please telegram the founder if you&amp;#39;re interested in joining.

Praise Pharaoh.
