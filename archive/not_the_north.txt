Once, long ago, seven proud nations stood triumphant upon the shining fields of hope, unified as one.

We etch the names of the sacrosanct seven into our region&#39;s history books, so we may never forget that which brought so many differing ideologies together:
The United Kingdom of [nation]Awelaidenerragardell[/nation]
The Rogue Nation of [nation]Cuppa land[/nation]
The Allied States of [nation]Hurmflurg[/nation]
The Nation of [nation]Lilithorne[/nation]
The Queendom of [nation]Sunarius[/nation]
The Empire of [nation]The auroran vale[/nation]
The Empire of [nation]Yeetoofus[/nation]

In celebration of the first governing coalition of the fledgling [region]Not The North[/region], we remember our first motto:
[i]&quot;The best Nations, all the Nations, Mexico took our Nations, those were the people&#39;s Nations.&quot;
