[color=43478C][b]Eastmarch[/color][color=B86E61] is a volcanically active area, plains with steaming gas leaking in between cracks in the ground, colorful, mineral filled bodies of water, and geysers. The far west of the hold resembles much of the rest of central Skyrim, and to the north a mountainous tundra, where the hold&#39;s capital Windhelm lies.[/b][/color]

[color=3B8169][b]Cross the White River and follow it to Windhelm. Then you can swing south to Kynesgrove. There&#39;s an inn near Kynesgrove -- the Braidwood. I hear they serve a nice dark ale. Nothing on the Sleeping Giant, of course. I&#39;m glad you were willing to trust me. I know it probably wasn&#39;t the best way to introduce myself. But old habits.... you know.[i]-Delphine[/i][/b][/color]
