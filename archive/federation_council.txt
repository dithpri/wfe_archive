FCDA (Federation Council Defense Administration)
To ensure the safety of all the members of the Federation council I have Created the FCDA (Federation Council Defense Administration) which&#39;s sole purpose is to keep members of the Federation Council safe from all threats external or internal by pooling together our military resources. We will also participate in offensive action if we deem it necessary.
