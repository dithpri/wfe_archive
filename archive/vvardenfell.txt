[i]When earth is sundered, and skies choked black,
And sleepers serve the seven curses,
To the hearth there comes a stranger,
Journeyed far &#39;neath moon and star.


Though stark-born to sire uncertain
His aspect marks his certain fate.
Wicked stalk him, righteous curse him.
Prophets speak, but all deny.


Many trials make manifest
The stranger&#39;s fate, the curses&#39; bane.
Many touchstones try the stranger
Many fall, but one remains.[/i]
