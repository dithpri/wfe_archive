&amp;quot;Empire&amp;quot;

Take off all of your skin
I&amp;#39;m brave when you are free
Shake off all of your sins
And give them to me
Close up, let me back in
I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
And my heart beats

Like the empires of the world unite
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
You&amp;#39;re my wildfire every single night
We are alive
And the stars make love to the universe
And you touch me
And I&amp;#39;m like and I&amp;#39;m like and I&amp;#39;m like
Ooh ooh
And I&amp;#39;m like ooh ooh
And I&amp;#39;m like ooh ooh
And I&amp;#39;m like ooh
