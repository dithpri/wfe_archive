Oficially Missing You Remix

[Talib Kweli]
Everytime I walk up in the spot the corks pop
Got the floor hot, we goin&amp;#39; to rock until 4 o&amp;#39; clock
We used to keep a trick up my sleeve to get a chick to leave
Now we&amp;#39;ve got another one of them calling me
All eyes on you when you walk by
Your guy is doing stunts like the four guys
I know you make me feel like a six million dollar star tonight
The type to make every nigga holla

[Tamia]
All I hear is raindrops
Falling on the rooftop
Ooh baby tell me why&amp;#39;d you have to go
Cause this pain I feel
It won&amp;#39;t go away
And today I&amp;#39;m officially missing you
I thought that from this heartache
I could escape
But I fronted long enough to know
There ain&amp;#39;t no way
And today
I&amp;#39;m officially missing you
