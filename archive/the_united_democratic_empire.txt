The United Democratic Empire is a fledgling region, under control of an emperor nation (currently Xtoshtia, 1st Emperor of the UDE). The region is under control of a direct democracy, under executive control by an Emperor, then the Archduke, the two Earls, and finally the people. The people decide many of the actions of the empire, through actions of regional polls. They can decide on actions of the Emperor, such as how to vote on W.A. activities, and elect the Archduke and Earls (unless the population isn&amp;#39;t large enough to sustain an election). Join the United Democratic Empire, and begin your democracy, with a side of royalty! (For more info feel free to ask an executive or check the regional Factbooks).
