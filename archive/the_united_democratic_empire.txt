The United Democratic Empire (not to be confused with the political party, Democratic as in Democracy) is a nation of both royalty and democracy. Member nations control the legislative process and elect each other into higher-ranks alongside the regional Emperor (currently Xtoshtia). Though a fledgling region, the UDE believes it can become a free and traditional location for nations of all kinds to settle and live in. It is worth noting, that activism is very crucial, so make sure to vote and run for a government position! For more information see the dispatches, as they provide both regional information, and nation entries.
