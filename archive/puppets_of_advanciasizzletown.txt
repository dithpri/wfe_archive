[color=green] This is where, I, [nation=Advancia-Sizzletown] put some of my puppets here.

This is also where I would Self-RP, because im bored. [/color]

And also, please don&#39;t mind the fact that i use my puppets to talk to each other, since that might look like I&#39;m weird. 

The actual name for this Region is called Meme Realm, but I can&#39;t change it. 

I came back to check in my puppets, and behold, this region was raided. I will not name them, but bruh, why did you decide to raid a puppet storage region?

(Seriously, why do you raid a puppet storage?)
