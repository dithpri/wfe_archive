[B]It looks like you&#39;ve stumbled onto the wrong side of town, buddy. If you know what&#39;s right for you, you&#39;re going to turn back now because you don&#39;t have what it takes to keep going. Even if you did, how could a lousy two-bit chump like you expect it ever become part of a family like ours?

Our family operates on honor and loyalty. Do you know anything about that? I didn&#39;t think so. If you think, by some miracle, you do qualify to join our family, join our [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/NSMafia/index/]forums[/url] and [url=https://discord.gg/zNrWewK]have a conversation with us[/url] and we&#39;ll see if you can handle the life: the life of a mafioso.[/B]
