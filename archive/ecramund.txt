[b]The Concept[/b]

Ecramund is an alternate Earth, it&#39;s main distinguishing factor being World War Two never won, but instead plunged the entire earth into a technological dark age.. save for military technology, which seems to be the only sort of tech that advances. Ecramund is a graveyard world, where nothing changes except frontlines and casualty rates.
