The Confederation of States of the Sabrina is a confederation of states united by a common reliance on the Sabrina, a 180-mile long river that follows a roughly semi-circular course stretching through each polity. 

The primary goals of the Confederation are preservation of the environment, the eradication of intersabrine differences, and the overall peace and prosperity of all those lands which the Sabrina washes.
