We are a collection of islands, that freely vote on regional laws, along with trying to establish relations on the world stage.
We are fine with any types of government as long as they abide by our laws and procedures.

Our Website is: https://sites.google.com/view/tcoei/home

Our discord is: https://discord.gg/E9M69Ds

Our main representatives would be anyone on the council but for foreign affairs please talk to our ministry of peace.

Our motto is &quot;HAIL TO THE CEI&quot;

And our regional animal, is the Toucan
