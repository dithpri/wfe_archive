All under the alliance of the Matthenian States shall abide by the ruler, Lord Matthew VII.  After the fall of the Euro-Chartters Treaty and the fall of Matthenia there was The Neo-Matthenian Revolution, which resulted in the creation of the Grand Republic Alliance.  With a strong bond forming between those two regions, we will have an increased amount of wealth for all nations under this united rule.
