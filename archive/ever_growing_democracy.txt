We are a Region of Partial-Democracy. Citizens choose which issues get passed up to the Founder, and the Founder will make the final decision, and take your votes into account. With a rich history, Ever Growing Democracy was founded by The Dem. Rep. of the American Atlantic Islands, which is the President and Founder. All are welcome here!
