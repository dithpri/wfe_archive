We are a Region of Half-Democracy. Citizens will vote and the President, Vice President, and WA Delegate will make the final decisions, but we will take your votes into account. With a rich history, Ever Growing Democracy was founded by The Dem. Rep. of the American Atlantic Islands, which is the President and Founder. Beekayland is the vice president and Steampunk Nation is the Secretary of Region.
