In the early 16th century the famous  navigator and polymath Attalos Cavallonios, son of Greek merchant, who used to trade with the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire, and a Genoese lady of venerable noble descent, explored hundreds of Isles of different size in the Atlantic Ocean. Some of them were huge and others were just as tiny as a single footprint. And they were totally unknown by man and so far unpopulated. In his endless wisdom Attalos Cavallonios claimed these new lands and founded the Republic of Cavalliona, which has become the most powerful hegemonic power of the Great Isles after having undergone the &amp;quot;Glorious Liberation&amp;quot;-called reform, from which the current United Socialist States of Cavalliona developed from.
