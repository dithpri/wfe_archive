The Geniocratic coalition is a group of nations with a goal in common:
Let the smart people decide.
Unprepared people can&amp;#39;t fully understand the macroeconomic, social and international  implications of government actions, and therefore, they wouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to have a go on deciding what&amp;#39;s good for them. That&amp;#39;s the issue: They don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;ll be good for them.
