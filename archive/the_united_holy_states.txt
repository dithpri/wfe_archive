Are you tired of feeling left out with the ones who you feel have forgotten their place in the world?
Do you want to be around other nations who think like you?
And by think like you, I mean ruled by holiness.

Welcome to The United Holy States. Each nation here joined our union in harmony to last forever. Together we serve.
