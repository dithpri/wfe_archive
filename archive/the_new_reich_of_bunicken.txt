This is definitely a knock off region of the [region]New Reich of Bunicken[/region]. I am told [region]The Holy Reich of Bunicken[/region] has forsworn and forsaken contact with [nation]QueenMorrighan[/nation]; and then back stroked and they [b]ARE NOW MERGED[/b] so  [nation]High Priestess Morrighan[/nation] is in control of 12 regions now. Beware of the one called Morrighan, as the below dispatch explains. [nation]Skyonder[/nation] and [nation]Selven[/nation] are suspected to be run by the same nation. BEWARE!

[b]Basically, cheesy Wehraboo Club.[/b] Lycan Imperium is no longer considered part of this mess.
