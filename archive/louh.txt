The Land of Unified Happy People

Welcoming all people

National Anthem (Google Translate Version)

Someone once told me the world will carry
I&#39;m not the sharpest tool token
As thumbs
Forehead form
In good years go by, and they will come
I got up and ran down the rules
It does not make sense to avoid a lot of fun
Your brain gets smart but your head is silent
So many things to do, see
What happened with the adoption of the corners?
If you do not go in the shortest possible time
Token never if you do not Paril
Hey, you and all you are stars, play, letting the game go
Hey, now you you are stars rock show, take, take responsibility
All this gold
Only shooting stars break
