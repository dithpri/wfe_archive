The EESLC is the Eastern European version of the EU. After sensing the more moderate direction the EU was heading in, several progressive socialist eastern European nations split off to form their own coalition. Their ideological goals are not one of social democracy, like the west, or conservative capitalism, like the east, but of a balanced, liberal, and democratic socialist society focused on the extension of rights to marginalized groups, and making social mobility easier for those of lower economic statuses through state ownership and extensive social welfare programs.
