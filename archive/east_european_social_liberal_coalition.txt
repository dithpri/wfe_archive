The EESLC is the Eastern European version of the EU. After sensing the more left-wing direction the EU was heading in, several semi-progressive eastern European nations split off to form their own coalition. Their ideological goals are not one of social democracy, like the west, or conservative capitalism, like the east, but of a balanced, centrist social liberal democracy focused on the extension of rights to marginalized groups, and making social mobility easier for those of lower economic statuses. Rather than making huge social safety nets like the west or getting rid of all progressive economic policies like the east, the EESLC focuses on making mobility easier through work programs and reducing costs on necessary goods.
