The Kingdom of Egaje is a fledgling, socially progressive nation, renowned for its irreverence towards religion. The compassionate, hard-working, democratic population of 5 million Egajeans enjoy a sensible mix of personal and economic freedoms, while the political process is open and the people&#39;s right to vote held sacrosanct. The medium-sized government prioritizes Welfare, with Education, Healthcare, and Law &amp; Order also on the agenda, while Spirituality isn&#39;t funded at all. Citizens pay a flat income tax of 29.6%.
