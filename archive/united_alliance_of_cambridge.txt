A region where all the students of Cambridge can play together under a Constitution which respects the sovereignty of every nation, and the opinions of every player.

A warm welcome to all new members! This game is a great tool to get the different grades of Cambridge communicating with each other. Let&#39;s all plan on meeting some Friday during lunch to ratify a Constitution!
