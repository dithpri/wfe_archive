[b]WE ARE THE UNITED ALLIANCE OF CAMBRIDGE.[/b]

A region where all the students of Cambridge can play together under a Constitution which respects the sovereignty of every nation, and the opinions of every player.

A warm welcome to all new members! This game is a great tool to get the different grades of Cambridge communicating with each other. [b]World Assembly members are not welcome in this hallowed organization.[/b]

For Cambridge! For the Alliance!
