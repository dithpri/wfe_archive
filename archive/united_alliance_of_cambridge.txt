A region where all the students of Cambridge can play together under a Constitution which respects the sovereignty of every nation, and the opinions of every player.

A warm welcome to all new members! This game is a great tool to get the different grades of Cambridge communicating with each other. Let&#39;s all plan on meeting some Friday during lunch to ratify a Constitution!

Five other office positions have yet to be assigned. As soon as we have more members, we will hold elections for them.

1) Secretary of the Interior
2) Secretary of Defense
3) Secretary of Communications
4) Secretary of Diplomacy

For Cambridge! For the Alliance!
