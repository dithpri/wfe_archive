[b]Welcome to the city of New Angeles[/b]

Business would be your primary concern in New Angeles. After all, this city is uniquely favorable to businesses not only because it&#39;s the site of the Space Elevator (or &quot;Beanstalk&quot;), but also because the city enjoys the privileges associated with being an unincorporated, special commerce zone of the United States. It benefits from most U.S. federal laws, but fewer Constitutional demands, meaning that its inhabitants&#151;and its corporations&#151;enjoy more freedoms than those within the United States proper.
