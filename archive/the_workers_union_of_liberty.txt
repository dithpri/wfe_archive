Conditions they are bad,
And some of you are sad;
You cannot see your enemy,
The class that lives in luxury,&#151;
You workingmen are poor,&#151;
Will be forevermore,&#151;
As long as you permit the few
To guide your destiny.
CHORUS

Shall we still be slaves and work for wages?
It is outrageous&#151;has been for ages;
This earth by right belongs to toilers,
And not to spoilers of liberty.

Workingmen, unite!
We must put up a fight,
To make us free from slavery
And capitalistic tyranny;
This fight is not in vain,
We&#39;ve got a world to gain.
Will you be a fool, a capitalist tool,
And serve your enemy?
