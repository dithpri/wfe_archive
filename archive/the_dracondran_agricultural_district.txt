[i]Welcome to The Dracondran Agricultural District![/i]

Field of lush green as far as the eye can see, abundant in crops. Every season our farmers harvest their card crop for the benefit of Dracondra, to which the best produce is sent. The rest is either locked away in storehouses or sold to the world for [b]MASSIVE PROFITS[/b].

Anyway, outsiders tend not to be welcome here (sorry, but some people just don&#39;t change). On the other hand, if you were to provide their union with a gift, I&#39;m sure all hostility would be immediately forgotten.
In other words, if for some reason you want to move here, gift a Legendary, Epic or Ultra-rare to the founder (and telegram them to let them know) or you&#39;ll probably be ejected.

Happy Farming Folks!
