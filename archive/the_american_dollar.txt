&amp;quot;When Mexico sends its people, they&#146;re not sending their best. They&#146;re not sending you. They&#146;re not sending you. They&#146;re sending people that have lots of problems, and they&#146;re bringing those problems with us. They&#146;re bringing drugs. They&#146;re bringing crime. They&#146;re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.&#148;- Donald Trump
