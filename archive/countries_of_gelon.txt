Welcome to Gelon, where you can live life the way you want to. Enjoy your stay!

We are a region of brotherhood. Aligned with hope, prosperity, and unity. Never phased by war or conflict, as we fight through as one. 

Rules:

1. Don&#39;t be a loser.

2. Be kind, and welcoming to all nations (except for Christiville)

3. Have fun! This can be a RP if wanted, but it&#39;s your choice.


If all rules are followed, then you will get a huge block of Jacobvillian Cheese.

If not, you will be sent to a Christivillian labor camp.

As always, Glory to Gelon!
