Visitor&amp;#39;s notice: This is the counterpart of the [region]Chingchong Coalition[/region]

Welcome to the Chongyist and Chingyist coalition ever to traverse the forty-nine continents.

[color=lime]The Flag of the Coalition:[/color]
The Chongching Coalition was made on the ideals of South Korea, really freaking reasonable. This flag of ours (very, beary, beautiful) consists of a star enclosed in a palm. Each point of the star represents one of the 5 qualities required to wear Purrham Furbottom&amp;#39;s hat, while the palm represents the kind of reward you will receive for doing good according to regional standards.
