Project Horizon is a Post Apocalyptic region.
There are no rules here, except that we all use the same currency, The Bottle Cap.
We speak a lot of Dutch here, so sometimes you won&amp;#39;t understand a thing. :P
Have a good time in Project Horizon!

P.S.: We have cookies!

P.P.S.: I lied! MWUHAHAHA!!!
