We are against the World Assembly. Hence the name. It is useless. Why make international law if all the countries can be the same? That&#146;s the point. All under the same Empire, we&#39;ll be United. No WA delegate. Upon joining, you must resign from your membership in the WA, or you&#146;ll be forcibly ejected to the Rejected Realms. If you do resign, Welcome to the Great Empire!
