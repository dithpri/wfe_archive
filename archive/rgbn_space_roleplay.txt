do you hate physics and boring earth stuffs, well good for you then! this region allows you to own massives starships and galaxy spanning civilizations , and the rules are so lax that you can do whatever you want (with some limitations to godmodding.) you can have a galactic war or even mine moons for all their resources and build dyson spheres.


THE FUTURE IS YOURS TO BUILD

WILL YOU RISE LIKE THE GREAT KHAN OR FALL LIKE THE ONES BEFORE YOU

BECAUSE THIS IS THE Region of Galactic Badass nations
