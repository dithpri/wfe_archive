The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), is a transcontinental country that spans much of Eurasia from 1922 to forever. A flagship communist state, it is nominally a federal union of republics; in practice, both its government and its economy are democratically centralized. 

World&#39;s first constitutionally guaranteed socialist state. 

Republics organized into socialist states and created the Soviet Union in December 1922. Rapid industrialization and encouraged collectivization led to significant economic growth and saved millions.
