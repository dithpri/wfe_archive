The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), is a transcontinental country that spans much of Eurasia from 1922 to forever. A flagship communist state, it is nominally a federal union of fifteen national republics; in practice, both its government and its economy is democratically centralized.
