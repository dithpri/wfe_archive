[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] went shopping for coffee mugs when we found a mug with your region on it! Being the kind souls they are, the hawks set out on a flight to deliver them to you as a gift of good will. Unfortunately, a bunch of mischievous avocados poked the hawks with a needle, causing them to drop their mugs all over the ground. The mugs were broken, but the hawks decided to continue the flight and instead do the next best thing : RAID!
