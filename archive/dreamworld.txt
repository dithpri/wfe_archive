The Dreamworld is the realm from whence all dreams and memories are born. The terrain within the Dreamworld is built of thoughts thought by minds, perceptions of the material plane. However, few of these thoughts are strong and detailed, so the lands withing the Dreamworld are shifting and hazy.

The Dreamworld is based off the [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/Pseudolonewolf/mardek-rpg-chapter-3]Dream Realm from MARDEK RPG[/url]. If you do play, remember to start from [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/Pseudolonewolf/mardek-rpg-chapter-1]chapter 1![/url]
