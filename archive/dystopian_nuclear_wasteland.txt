The Dystopian Nuclear Wasteland is a barren wasteland, the only area with greenery being the few nations in the region. The radiation causes travel between nations to be extremely dangerous, hundreds being killed by horribly mutated creatures each year. Citizens of this wasteland usually die from radiation poisoning.
We are happy to accept new nations! (-:
