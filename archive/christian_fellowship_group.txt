My name is Rezene. I am a former Muslim and now a child of God, trusting in His Son, Jesus Christ, for my salvation.  

I have failed to find a place in NationStates where I can fellowship, learn, and grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord.

I am hoping that this group will attract other Christians with whom I can fellowship and from whom I can learn.

For the record, I am a Reformed Baptist, and a cessationist.

Welcome!
