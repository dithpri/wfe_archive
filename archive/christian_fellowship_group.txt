[b][u]PRAYER FOR THE UNSAVED[/u][/b]
[b]We pray for the nations in regions whose doctrines prevent them from entering God&#39;s Kingdom, that God would open their eyes and hearts to His truth and bring them to the salvation that comes only by repenting of their sins and submitting their entire lives to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, His Son and Second Person of the Holy Trinity. We are currently praying for the nations in [region]Christadelphia[/region].[/b]
