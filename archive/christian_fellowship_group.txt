This region was founded by [nation=short]Rezene[/nation], a former Muslim and now a child of God, trusting in His Son, Jesus Christ, for salvation.  

Troubled by Muslims and rejected by Christian regions, he founded this group with the hope of attracting other Christians with whom to fellowship and from whom to learn.

For the record, Rezene is a Reformed Baptist, and a cessationist.

Welcome!
