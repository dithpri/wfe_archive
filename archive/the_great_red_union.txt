Hello, fellow comrades and workers of the world! Welcome to The Great Red Union, or TGRU for short! We are a group that separated from The Communist Bloc due to us not being able to RP on the RMB and not being able to post memes on there, either! Come to join us! Just make sure you&#39;re not a fascist or capitalist!

Otherwise, have fun and go wild!

Make sure you endorse our WA delegate [nation]Pakishta[/nation], and our founder, [nation]Achain[/nation]!
