The island of Insula Derpa is a large island with large forests, mountains, and a few deserts. The very existence of this island is a question of science as the whole thing is floating 2000 meters in the air. Scientists are still trying to find out why this is the case, but as of now several religious groups have claimed that the formation is of &quot;Holy Nature.&quot;
