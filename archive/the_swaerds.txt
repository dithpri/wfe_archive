The Swaerds is a small region comprised of only a few countries, all of which share a common heritage, currency, and language. Their cultures are heavily related, as the entire region was once one great kingdom, and takes its name from its most famous leader, King Swaerd the Great. However in the past 200 years various revolutions, both ideological and military, have produced a wealth of vastly different nations, ranging from totalitarian kingdoms to near-anarchic bastions of freedom. These nations have a council, the council of Swaerd, which is comprised of all leaders of the various states.
