Pools closed. For the lulz. John Freeman, who wus Gorden Frohmans brother was one day an office, typping on a computer. 

Our National Anthem in Honor of Our Great Leader Sanic:
Gotta go Fast 
Gotta go Faster Faster Fasterfasterfaster! 
Moving at the speed of sound 
I&amp;#39;m the quickest hedgehog around 
Got ourselves a situation 
Start getting a new location 
Without any explanation 
On top of relaxation! 
Go- Go- Go- 
Don&amp;#39;t blink 
Don&amp;#39;t think 
Just Go go go go G-g-g-g-go go! 
Sonic, he&amp;#39;s on the run 
Sonic, he&amp;#39;s number one 
Sonic, he&amp;#39;s coming next 
so watch out for Sonic X! 
Gotta go fast, gotta go faster 
faster faster fasterfasterfaster 
Go go go go go go go go go! 
Sooooniiiiic X!! 
Gotta go fast! 
Gotta go faster faster fasterfaster Sonic X!
