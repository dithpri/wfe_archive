Pools closed. For the lulz. John Freeman, who wus Gorden Frohmans brother was one day an office, typping on a computer. 

Our National Anthem in Honor of Our Great Leader Spuddermun:
Living on the edge, 
Figthing crime, 
Spinning webs 
Swinging from the highest ledge, 
He can leap above our heads. 

Ahhhhaaahhaaah. 
Ahhhhaaahhaaahaaahaahaah. 

Villians on the rise, 
And the city&acute;s victimized. 
Looking up with no surprise, 
Arriving in the speed of time. 

Ahhhhaaahhaaah. 
Ahhhhaaahhaaahaaahaahaah
