Our National Anthem in Honor of Our Great Leader Jack Skellington:
SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS
SEND SHIVERS DOWN YOUR SPINE
SHRIEKING SKULLS WILL SHOCK YOUR SOUL
SEAL YOUR DOOM TONIGHT
SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS
SPEAK WITH SUCH A SCREECH
YOU&amp;#39;LL SHAKE AND SHUDDER IN SURPRISE
WHEN YOU HEAR THESE ZOMBIES SHRIEK
CAUSE SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS
SHOUT STARTLING SHRILLY SCREAMS
THEY&amp;#39;LL SNEAK FROM THEIR SARCOPHAGUS
AND JUST WON&amp;#39;T LEAVE YOU BE
SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS
ARE SILLY ALL THE SAME
THEY&amp;#39;LL SMILE AND SCRABBLE SLOWLY BY
AND DRIVE YOU SO INSANE
STICKS AND STONES WILL BREAK YOUR BONES
THEY SELDOM LET YOU SNOOZE
SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS
WILL WAKE YOU WITH A BOO!
