Our National Anthem in Honor of Our Great Leader Massah Splinter:
Teenage mutant ninja turtles
Heroes in a half shell, turtle power
They&amp;#39;re the worlds most fearsome fighting teens
[ we&amp;#39;re really hip ] Teenage mutant ninja turtles
They&amp;#39;re heroes in a half shell and they&amp;#39;re green
[ hey, get a grip ] Teenage mutant ninja turtles
When the evil shredder attacks
These turtle boys don&amp;#39;t cut him no slack
Teenage mutant ninja turtles
Teenage mutant ninja turtles
Splinter taught them to be ninja teens
[ he&amp;#39;s a radical rat ] Teenage mutant ninja turtles
Leonardo leads, Donatello does machines
[ that&amp;#39;s a fact, Jack ] Teenage mutant ninja turtles
Raphael is K00L but rude
Michaelangelo is a party dude
Teenage mutant ninja turtles
