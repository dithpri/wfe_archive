[b]Slowenien, (Slovenia), a country in Central Europe, is known for its mountains, ski resorts and lakes. On Lake Bled, a glacial lake fed by hot springs, the town of Bled contains a church-topped islet and a cliffside medieval castle. In Ljubljana, Slovenia&#146;s capital, baroque facades mix with the 20th-century architecture of native Jo&#158;e Ple&amp;#269;nik, whose iconic Tromostovje (Triple Bridge) spans the tightly curving Ljubljanica River.
