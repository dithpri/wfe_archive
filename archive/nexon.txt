Welcome to the region of Nexon, where [nation]New Nexon[/nation] reigns supreme. We are against the World Assembly.

For isolationist reasons, I&#39;m not allowing anyone to move to my region on a permanent basis. I intend for it to be my personal region. However, I&#39;m totally cool with embassy requests since, you know, just &#39;cause I like more private space doesn&#39;t mean that I am anti-social. :P
