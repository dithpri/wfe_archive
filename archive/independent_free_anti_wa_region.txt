A region that does not follow the rules of the world assembly. A region that acknowledges the WA as a international body but does not submit to its laws for nations refuse to follow laws of the WA can freely join but must follow of this newly formed region. The foundation of this region is based upon fair and free values separating laws govern by the WA and regions who are part of the WA. Just because we are a Anti WA region doesn&#39;t mean we promote terrorist attacks. We stay out of their way and nations who are part of the WA, willing to join our region should not promote WA rules or be permanently suspended.
