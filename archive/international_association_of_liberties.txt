The International Association of Liberties (IAL) asks that people shall be made equal. When born, a citizen must have the equal rights and opportunities as every other citizen until he/she can make independent decisions. We believe that people should focus on contributing to society, rather than acting out of self motivation. Wealth is mostly in the government&amp;#39;s control, so it is required that we always maintain a democratic and selfless political system.
