The Divided Conjoined Lands was formed in 2626 after a long civil war between the Red Faction and the Holy Followers of the Moon.  None of the leadership for both sides was left at the end of the conflict and a rebel group called the Imperial Police State formed one conjoined empire.  However, many did not like the iron fist of the Imperial Police State and started a second civil war. Nations that were a part of the empire took sides and the region is now known as the Divided Conjoined Lands.
