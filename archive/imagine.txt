Imagine there&#39;s no heaven
It&#39;s easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there&#39;s no countries
It isn&#39;t hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I&#39;m a dreamer
But I&#39;m not the only one
I hope some day you&#39;ll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I&#39;m a dreamer
But I&#39;m not the only one
I hope some day you&#39;ll join us
And the world will be as one
