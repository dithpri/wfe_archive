Will probably not have much action, but we will see. It is based around 1900s, more specifically 1930s and 40s, so now it would probably be say 1939. Tech is a bit better than real earth 1939, but in general its really the same. No plans, but rp if you like. Please do try to keep it semi-serious (fun is fine but be realistic).
