Subject: Secret operation.

Today is the day that we execute the plan. It&amp;#39;s going down during
study hall. Shirom is going to eject game and any inactive people. And
then restart a new region. We need all participating members to leave
the region so Shirom dosen&amp;#39;t use influence to eject you. Hopefully by
this noon the UKI will cease to exist and we can refound without
Gabriel as founder. Good luck and get out of the region before study
hall. Thanks.

Your plan will fail!
