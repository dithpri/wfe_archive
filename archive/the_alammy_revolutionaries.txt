This is a democratic region, and therefore starting on the 1st of each month there will exist an election process for certain roles within our region. I will create several polls, each of which the citizens of our region will then vote upon for elected officials. The first poll will have all the nations in our region as options to choose, and (variable depending on the current population of our region) 8 of those will become representatives. Another poll will be created on the 2nd of each month, with those 5 nations as options to elect. The top 3 will be the executive council. From there, on the 3rd of each month, one final election will be held to decide the President of our region is for that term from a pool of the executive council.
