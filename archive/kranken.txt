Salutations from the Kranken. 
       
        Nearly all humanoids are free to join, young or old. We attempt to be cooperative in any way possible. The Kranken do not believe in freedom and we believe that peace is unachievable. We shall conquer, lead, and rule. We will grow stronger. We will become united.
