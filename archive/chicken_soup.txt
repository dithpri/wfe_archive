[b][color=red]Howdy!

Welcome to [region]Chicken Soup[/region], a good ole home grown region, just looking for some good community members to learn and grow with!

We are looking for nations who are wanting a community of countries, all here to aid each other and ready to learn. If you&#39;re fairly new, or aren&#39;t too familiar with the politics of NationStates, then you&#39;re in great company![/color][/b]

[b][color=blue][region]Chicken Soup[/region]&#39;s WA Delegate is [nation]Tranman[/nation], so if you do join, we would like you to consider joining the WA and endorsing Tranman. The more endorsements, the more power our region has in the World Assembly![/color][/b]

[color=green][u][b]We do have one main rule:[/b][/u]

[b][u]Use some common sense and don&#39;t be a jerk![/u][/b]
