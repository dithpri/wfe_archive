Uptoncore is a small island region in the Atlantic Ocean. At its smallest, Uptoncore was composed of two nations. Uptoncore and Restored Time. Uptoncore was an oppressive, corrupt country, and Restored Time was a primitive paradise. The World Assembly annexed a small part of the Uptoncore because of human rights violations, and now New Uptoncore is equal to the size of Uptoncore. The Islands are expanding every hour as it seems so there could eventually be room for more than the original three.
