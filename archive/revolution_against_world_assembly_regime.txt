RAWAR is a fierce rebellion against the rule of the World Assembly. We believe that the glorious leader of the Hapaloogean Empire should rule over all of the countries of the world, and therefore make all of the decisions about global laws and international safety. The World Assembly is a corrupt, democratic, pansy of a government that is failing to keep world peace, and therefore it must be eliminated. Anyone who opposes the terrible rule of the World Assembly is a welcome ally and friend, and should thus join our alliance to bring peace and order to the whole world. We promise that if our glorious leader is in charge, there will be no more starvation, poverty, or sickness, and the world will become a beautiful place.
