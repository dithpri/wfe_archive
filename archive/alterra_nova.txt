Alterra Nova is a planet formerly known as Earth in the system of Sol, however, that was in the years before nuclear war brought an end to most of the human race.

The world was deemed uninhabitable, however, few survived to reproduce and continue on the human race throughout the age known as the Reconstruction. Soon enough though, the radiation died down, and humanity once again took to the surface of a changed planet. The continents had changed, and new plant life now grew amongst the old.

Humanity lived as equals for a short time until government was re-established, leading to war. After a hundred years or so, there was peace.
