We are dreamers who believe we can create a world where people will always be of greater value than profit or power.  Where pacifism extends to daily courtesy, not just refusing to go to war. 
Where technology must be evaluated based on it&amp;#39;s possible negative impacts as well as the possible good ones and choose whether or not it gets developed. 
Where the environment gets treasured, not just managed.  
Where people are of equal value and not classified by biases and bigotry.
Where nation/states are judged by their fact book, not just the code.  
Where businesses must be a &amp;quot;good neighbour&amp;quot; before they consider profit. 
Where a higher power is put first before self, whether in your mind it&amp;#39;s divine in nature or the collective community.
