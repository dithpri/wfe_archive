[u][b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[i]Taken: 02/06/14[/i]

[color=red]Once a fascist and racist region, led by &amp;quot;United Aryan Socialist&amp;quot;, this region now serves as a living museum against hate. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere! The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing!.[/color]
