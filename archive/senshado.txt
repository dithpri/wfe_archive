Males do have some schools, such as &quot;Koningsburg Boys High School&quot; or &quot;Naples University Highschool.&quot; Which represents Germany and Italy.  The sport Sensha-do is a sport based around tanks. Easy per say is &quot;Tankery.&quot; Tankery is a sport about using WW2-Early-Post War tanks. Certain tanks though, do come from WW1, such as BC Freedom Academy&#39;s Renault FT-17. The schools are great at tank warfare, using unique tactics against each other. Theres been over 70+ NATIONAL championships to compete for the Senshado cup. Will you be able to prosper?
