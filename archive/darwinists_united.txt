We here, at Darwinists United, believe that no man, woman, or child should be coddled, and that everyone should have the right to do as they please. If you believe the sick, elderly, and disabled from birth should be coddled, this is not the region for you. If you believe the army should be abolished, and that flowers and soft words will fix everything, this is not the region for you. But for those of you who will flex all your power, and will leave your citizens to fend for themselves, with you only being a influence from afar, join today.
