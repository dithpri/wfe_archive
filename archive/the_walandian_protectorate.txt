The Walandian Protectorate is a group of nations banded together for mutual benefit and defense. Our main focus is on technology, for both military and peaceable purposes. We are also keenly interested in space and spaceflight, with our space station WA-02 put into geostationary orbit three years ago. We are gearing up for interplanetary travel with our newly built WSC-Argonaut, a Walandian Space Cruiser that should take us to Europa and beyond.
