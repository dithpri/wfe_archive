[spoiler=Notifications][color=lightblue][list][*]Finally we have elections; [url=https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WFQ9KBB]here[/url]. Don&amp;#39;t vote twice. Tell Militant Grammazis when you have voted. The lines close at midnight on 13/11/15. Password is butts2015. Thank you to [nation]Regional Elections Minister[/nation] ([nation=short+flag]Major League Stargate[/nation]) for helping to organise the candidates.[*]Constitutional Discussions WILL take place Friday in E2. It shouldn&amp;#39;t take long. I have the opinions of various people on some topics (Luke, Chris, other Luke, Nerdfighteria Island (forgot your name)) and these will be taken into account should you fail to contribute, however you will have little if any power to support your suggestions if they are disputed. Not there = assumed apathetic.[/list][/COLOR][/spoiler] [color=red]&amp;lt;---- IMPORTANT[/color]
