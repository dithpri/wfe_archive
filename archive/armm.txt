[color=#447984][list][*]Finally we have elections; [url=https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WFQ9KBB]here[/url]. Don&amp;#39;t vote twice. Tell Militant Grammazis when you have voted. The lines close at midnight on 13/11/15. Password is butts2015. Thank you to [nation]Regional Elections Minister[/nation] ([nation=short+flag]Major League Stargate[/nation]) for helping to organise the candidates.[/color][*][color=lightblue]I have the outline for a constitution, but I refuse to write it all. If you want a clause added, telegram it to the Holy Administrative Moonk (the whole thing, not the title), I will spell check/grammar check it, and add it. When we have a council, we will vote upon it.[/COLOR][/list]
