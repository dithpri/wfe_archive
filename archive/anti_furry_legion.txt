Welcome all of our anti-furry fighters to the AFL! If you are one of ours we will gladly accept you great servitude against our nemesis, the furries. However if you look upon us in spite, just know, we are many and we come from every crevice of the earth to keep our ancestor&#39;s former glory as fighters for a cause much greater than them. They gave their lives to continue their lineage for the strength on mankind, yet furries refused. They show weakness in becoming one of them. If you yourself are a furry, then change your mindset to a more righteous cause rather than being in a fursuit and sinking into the modern age of offense. Join us and redeem yourself. Hail to the AFL!
