If the Working Class is to Survive we must unite. We fight off the Persecution and Unlawful killings of the Working Class from the Corrupt bourgeoisie. The Empires and kingdoms of the world are scared as the Red Tide Grows Closer.....and Closer......and Closer to there Borders. The end of the Old order grows near and the Workers will unite into one State. FOR THE WORLD REVOLUTION, FOR THE WORKERS AND FOR THE FREEDOM OF ALL PEOPLES UNDER EVIL TYRANTS. (RP)
