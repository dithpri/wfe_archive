Hello and welcome to the region of Aurelia!
The founder, Cleopatrastan would like visitors to know that the laws of Aurelia are a bit strict, but we have had a war years ago, so to rebuild the 5 nations of Aurem, the laws were created. The WA delegate,  Cilegona also welcomes you! The region is small but we will grow! 

LONG LIVE AURELIA!
