Hello and welcome to the region of Aurelia!
The founder, Cleopatrastan would like visitors to know that the laws of Aurelia are a bit strict, but we have had a war years ago, so to rebuild the 5 nations of Aurem, the laws were created. All nations get a job to help rebuild Aurelia. 
To see the nations with jobs go to Cleopatrastans Factbook. To see available jobs go to Cleopatrastans factbook.
