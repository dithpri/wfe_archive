The Regency is a land for all nations created in faith and respect of their citizens(apparently). Nations are restricted entry, and only particular nations are given the covenant of the region password. If any nations wishes to be a member of the WA, log on as little as possible at St Laurences College, our regions meeting area, as the moderators will condemn our region. The current flag is just temporary; feel free to discuss options for nondiscriminatory, un-insulting flag, which portrays all nations of the Regency. [nation]Alynor[/nation] and the regional delegate reign supreme, but nations may debate on the regional board about their political ideals.

Yours Truly
