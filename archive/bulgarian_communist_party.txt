The Bulgarian Communist Party was the founding party of the People&#39;s Republic of Bulgaria from 1946 to 1989. The party had dominated the Fatherland Front, a coalition that took power in 1944, late in World War II, after it overthrew the Bulgaria&#39;s tsarist regime in conjunction with the Red Army&#39;s crossing the border.

The BCP modelled its policies after those of the Soviet Union, transforming the country over the course of a decade from an agrarian peasant society into an industrialized socialist society.
