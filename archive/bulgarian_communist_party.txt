The Bulgarian Communist Party had dominated the Fatherland Front coalition that took power in 1944, late in World War II, after it led a coup against Bulgaria&#39;s tsarist regime in conjunction with the Red Army&#39;s crossing the border. It controlled its armed forces, the Bulgarian People&#39;s Army.
