The LSC Empire is a strong Gaming Community looking for players like you to be apart of our brotherhood and tradition. We care about our members. Most of us are Christian gamers who support the military one hundred percent and use military tactics in the games we play.  I&amp;#39;ll main goals are to get support for the troops overseas and to spread the LSC creed of Strength, Honor, and Loyalty. Every one of our members has some relation to the military. Whether it be they are in the military, planing to join, or had a family member in the military. We allow no trash talking or team attacks on fellow soldiers of the LSC, for we see ourselves as brothers.  Now do you feel up to the challenge?
