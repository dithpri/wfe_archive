A cluster of stars near the edge of the galaxy, hidden behind the Magnus Murus, a massive nebula that spans Just over a hundred lightyears long.  It shields the cluster from the rest of the galaxy, and nearly all space travel must past through.  While broad, the nebula isn&#39;t very wide, with the narrow point being only .4 lightyears accross.  This serves as the primary point for most traffic heading into the cluster.

Politically, the star cluster is controlled by the Federation of Confederate Planets, an alliance of nearly two dozen worlds from fully developed to mining and agriculture colonies.
