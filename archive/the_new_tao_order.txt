[b]OLD WFE[/b][hr][b][color=purple]The New TAO Order[/color] is NationStates only true [color=purple]Anti-Marsupial[/color] organization and has been in existence since 2004. 

[color=green]Our mission is to transition DeadWood regions into new and active regions with an active founder through allowing DeadWood region names to be recycled. 
We also endeavor to close Deadwood regions to keep them from being the playthings of the pointless yet ongoing Raider-Defender conflicts.[/color] 

The NTO welcomes WA-nations willing to assist in the execution of these missions.

[color=red]The NTO celebrated its 100th region transitioning Saturday, OCT 29, 2011.[/color]
