[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region was a former embassy region/ally of the [region]Edmundian Empire[/region], and due to their involvement with the &quot;Anti J o J Coalition&quot;, this region has been seized and exterminated. It appears to have been some sort of puppet dump before it died. Oh well, mine now. Don&#39;t like me refounding your old embassy regions? Too bad, your allies tried to pull that same move on me, I&#39;m just returning the favor!
