[color=silver][b]39 protons! This region is Yttrium.

Yttrium is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a &amp;quot;rare earth element&amp;quot;.[2] Yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element. The most important use of yttrium is in making phosphors, such as the red ones used in television set cathode ray tube (CRT) displays and in LEDs.
