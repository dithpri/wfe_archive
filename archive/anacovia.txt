[color=darkgreen]Anacovia was a former region that when the founder ceased to exist, the citizens left. Therefore the region was deleted. In honor of a once great region do I hereby refound this region as it was one of the first regions I was ever in.
(Refounded:3/29/18[/color])
(CTE: Late 2016)

[color=red]This region is property of His Majesty of [nation]Compound Light Microscope[/nation] who is the founder of [region]Union of the Kind Ones[/region][/color]
