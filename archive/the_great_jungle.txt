The Great Jungle, a land of intellect. Most creatures here seem to be smarter than their outside counterparts, with animals like primates forming their own nations. Due to this there has been interest by European and Asian nations with heavy influence from both continents mainly Asia due to how close it is with The Great Jungle being in the Pacific Ocean. We hope you enjoy your stay in the Great Jungle.
