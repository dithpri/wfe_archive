The Great Jungle, a land of intellect. Most creatures here seem to be smarter than their outside counterparts, with primates being the main type of animal affected. With other animals seemingly being dumber, such as humans who have been reduced to how outside primates act, as if reversing the roles. We hope you enjoy your stay.
