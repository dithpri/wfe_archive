[b]We are a close-knitted community that discusses anything revolving Chinese politics, international politics, Chinese culture, and economics. We have LMaoists, KMTards, Hippie Commies, CPC apologists and all other degenerate ideologies you can imagine (JK). Despite our ideological differences, we are largely receptive to all people as we all have a common destiny! We are very welcoming and would like to extend our hand to having you into our server.[/b]
