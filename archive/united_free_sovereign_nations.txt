The United Sovereign Nations was founded by the Socialist Union of Citizens and aims to create an alliance for independent nations to work together, and fight for freedom. Anyone may join the United Sovereign Nations, but you must allow many freedoms to your people, both personal and political. We are currently new and not very strong, but we aim to grow much stronger and have more sovereign and free nations.
