[region]The Black Hawks[/region] love the crisp autumn air. 

[color=lightcoral]The weather becomes better, the searing sun stops killing us, and the leaves become prettier. In this weather, we decided to bring some young hawks out for their fledging flights! 

We flew left, right, up down and into your region! We then painted the WFE to suit a more autumn theme.[/color]
