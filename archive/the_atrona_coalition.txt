Date Founded: December 9th, 2025

When [nation]Neostaingon[/nation] left their original region, they set out on their own, to create their own region, one in which they are in control, however, they were able to make it democratic, just with themselves as Governor. They created The Atrona Coalition. Soon, they recruited a fellow nation in their region, [nation]Alexandreda[/nation], to join them, and they have been growing ever since. This is a glorious place, and if you have joined, Welcome!

We create polls to vote on things here, so all voices can be heard.

Capital: West Stain City

Current Governor: Neostaingon
