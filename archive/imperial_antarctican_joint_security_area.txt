Welcome to the [region]Imperial Antarctican Joint Security Area[/region], once upon a time headed by [nation]ImperialAntarctica[/nation]. IAJSA&#39;s responsibility was to ensure security of [region]The Commonwealth Empire of Antarctica[/region] and preserve the territorial integrity of its member states. That was until the IAJSA was absorbed by dark forces from an unknown, faraway empire.

Today, the area around the IAJSA headquarters is a demilitarized wasteland. The only human activity in the region consists of a meteorological station and a bowling alley.
