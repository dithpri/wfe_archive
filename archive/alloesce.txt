Alloesce; Freedom.

Be the nation you want to be.

There are no restrictions on what you can or can&amp;#39;t do to your people, we don&amp;#39;t care about environment, or liberty, and we don&amp;#39;t care if you do care. You have the freedom here to oppress your people or politics, destroy your environment or propagate religions. We don&amp;#39;t care if you don&amp;#39;t care about caring, or if you care about not caring to care.

So cuddle your prostitutes, kill your citizens, and drink and drive. Or don&amp;#39;t.
