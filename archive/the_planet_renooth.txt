[color=DarkCyan]Renooth is a planet with many tiny islands on it. These islands were formed with special lava that gave the soil unique qualities. Plants that grew in this soil were special and gave animals that ate them powers. Magical animals and plants are everywhere for you to explore.[/color]

[color=LimeGreen]The Planet Renooth is full of nations focused on making the most money and finding jobs. We make custom flags for you if you request (telegram [nation]Namoon[/nation] or [nation]Nova Sphere[/nation]). The most used currency is &quot;Nutz&quot;.[/color]
