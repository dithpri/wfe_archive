A land of magic for all to enjoy. For the old and the young, for the great powers and the smallest fledglings alike. For you and for me and for everyone and no one. For the world. For the win. For he&#39;s a jolly good fellow. For love. For life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. For goodness sake. For ever and ever. For the love of Violet! For the last time. For us, and for them. For a new day. For now, and forever.

One rule, keep it simple: respect. No matter who you are, no matter how you think, respect.

Thank you! P.S. Brownie points for people who entertain us with Eric Matthews references.
