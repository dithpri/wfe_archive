The Federation of Free Sovereign States is a libertarian region that allows nations to choose their own path, as long as they support civil rights, have some form of capitalism and respect the sovereignty of other nations in this region. 
Other than that nations have the power to set their own taxes, fund as much or as little of a military as they want, protect the environment or not and so forth without any regional repercussions.
