[color=blue][b]Welcome to Lucerna[/b][/color]
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy is the mostly harmless planet Lucerna. Separated from the rest of the NS world, Lucerna is home to a multitude of nations.

Casual and serious players welcome. Focused on the NS forum. Balanced role-play and realism oriented. Don&amp;#39;t be shy!
