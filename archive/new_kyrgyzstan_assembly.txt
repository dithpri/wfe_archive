Why I left old one; No one joined he old Assembly, and so no one had executive authority because I removed mine.

The new assembly also has a new goal; To replace the World Assembly!

Believing that some limits for The World Assembly are ludicrous, and the rule that 2 endorsements are required to add, repeal, etc. is unfair.
Also Believing that Kyrgyzstan-themed nations are automatically more awesome then other ones.

Thus stating that anyone in this assembly can make amendments that can be voted on, unless stated otherwise

Kyrgyzstan Empire has executive authority, but is forced to put amendments up, even if they do not agree with them.
