The UMD is an underground region specifically for military-ran nations and dominions, plus dictatorships and other semi-totalitarianist regimes.

Located in a technologically-advanced and cooled area of the upper mantle, somewhere below the Eurasian continent, the UMD is the perfect place to plan a world conquering. One condition: all members of the UMD are not permitted to attempt invasion on other UMD members&amp;#39; territories.
