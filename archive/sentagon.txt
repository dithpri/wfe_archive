[color=blue][b]You have entered Sentagon. This is an autonomous branch of government. Within these walls we will create our own Sentagon Policies without interference from the Delegacy or the Lunar Council. The Delegate and Lunar Councillors are free to visit anytime and in the spirit of free expression may offer their ideas and perspectives. However, it must be understood that we, the member nations of Sentagon, and one of the three branches of government of [region]The Mystical Council[/region], will determine what is best for ourselves in terms of how we run this branch.[/b][/color]
