Masduulaagii is a land populated by mythical creatures. The largest stretch of land is the Strip of Fire, inhabited by the empire of Habena Autem Yol. The natives that founded a civilization here highly value spirituality- violent, sacrificial, and devoted, no less.
If a country was to move to Masduulaagii, they would immediately be contacted by Habena, and then left alone. These isles are a place to be at peace, uninterrupted by notifications, roleplay, and harassment from other regions or message boards.
