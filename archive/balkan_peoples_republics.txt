The Commonwealth of the Balkan Republics is a left leaning, although officially centrist, loose union of democratic, populist and proto-capitalist states that have united for purposes of military security, sovereignty from globalist power blocs and economic co-operation.

A Balkan People&amp;#39;s Republic should maintain a good social welfare system, not offended the People&amp;#39;s God-given rights, strong agriculture and industries, an excellent education system and no foreign co-operation. We stand independent and solve our own problems.
