We represent [b]the Legitimate Government-In-exile of [region]Soviet Democracy[/region][/b]. Our democratic system was overthrown by our Ex-Founder Siege, who, in a short-sighted and totalitarian, maneuver, planted a mole in our administration to spy on the democratic government, prior to launching a purge without trial of the legal residents and administration of Soviet Democracy. We still control the discord, and will maintain it. We still recognize our commitments abroad. [b]For now, we will rebuild the reform movement. Soviet Democracy has been reborn from the ashes of a fire. Current Standing Orders are as follows:

[list][*]Endorse [nation]Rakivland[/nation]
[*]Stay Calm and Take A Breather
[*]Report all Suspicious Activity[/b]
