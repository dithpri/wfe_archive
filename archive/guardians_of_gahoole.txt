Welcome to the Great Tree of Ga&#39;Hoole! How went your trip over the beautiful, yet ever treacherous, Sea of Hoolemere?

By become a true Guardian, you must take up The Oath: [b]I am a Guardian of Ga&#146;Hoole. From this night on, I dedicate my life to the protection of owlkind. I shall not swerve in my duty. I shall support my brother and sister Guardians in times of battle as well as in times of peace. I am the eyes in the night, the silence within the wind. I am the talons through the fire, the shield that guards the innocent. I shall seek to wear no crown, nor win any glory. And all these things I do swear upon my honor as a Guardian of Ga&#146;Hoole until my days on this Earth cease to be. This be my vow. This be my life. By Glaux I do swear.[/b]
