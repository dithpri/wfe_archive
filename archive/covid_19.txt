Welcome!
Founded March 23, 2020
Named because of the epidemic going on, wash your hands before joining the region! You know, sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; twice, at least 20 seconds yada yada...
Relatively new, government system still in the works! We are looking for officers, friends, and hopefully this region grows!

Please endorse Cotindus, our founder and planned WA Delegate. This builds regional stability and security, and lets us hear your voice in the WA!

Please tell any other nations you know to join our region! We are welcome to all nations!
