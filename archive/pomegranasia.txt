Dear participants of Pomegranate,

Welcome to Pomegranasia, your digital home for the simulation game we&#39;re about to play this week. Pomegranasia is a continent in a farway corner of the world. In a neighbouring continent, Pinaprica a war has broken out and Pomegranasia is facing an influx of Pinaprican refugees. During this game we will build our own nations and try to find a common approach how to face this situation.
