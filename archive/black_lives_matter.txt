Black Lives Matter is not an organization with the goal of protecting black people in mind, it is evil and full of ulterior motives, deceiving black people everywhere. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyMgQS-Hi3w&amp;t=209s]I do not disapprove of BLM because I hate black folks. I disapprove of it because of these things[/url]. The phrase &#147;Black Lives Matter&#148; is fine, because all lives matter to me, but the organization by that name is abominable.
