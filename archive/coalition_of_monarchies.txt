The [i]Coalition of Monarchies[/i] represents the interests of states ruled by hereditary bloodline. For what is ordained divinely cannot be destroyed by the common ignorance or temptation. Our goal is definite : support monarchies in all forms, be it total or constitutional, command or parliamentary. We also strive to support conservative philosophy while advancing rational thought. God Bless the King! God Save the Queen!
