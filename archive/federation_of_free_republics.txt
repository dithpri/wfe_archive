A region for republics, charter societies and protectorates of the Federation of Free Republics set in the reality where they still exist and conquered a number of nations including most of the NS Sports community. All &quot;nations&quot; in this region are ICly subject, in some form or another, to the Federation Government in Republica.

Pre-emptively reserving this region for a possible future RP region. Not sure whether that&#39;s actually going to happen though.
