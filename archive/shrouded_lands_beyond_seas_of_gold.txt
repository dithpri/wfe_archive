In Glass are secrets held, in light is truth. We, the emissaries of the Saints and of the Splendour shall guide the faithful to their incandescent redemption. We shall burn as a candle, we shall reflect as a mirror, we shall obey as the Seasons. Our Lord shall show us the illuminated path to our salvation. Amen. 

- High Priest Mithra of the Most Serene Republic of Writhing Glass
