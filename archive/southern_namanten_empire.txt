Welcome to SNE! This is region controlled by [nation]South Namante[/nation], but any nation willing to embrace South Namanten overlordship is welcome, and you may even get a position in government! (No Border control though, I&#39;m scared of raiding)

This region is strongly opposed to [region]The Great Storm[/region], and it&#39;s dictator [nation]The Hurricane[/nation], so don&#39;t even think about coming here if you&#39;re affiliated with them. Oh, and TGS people, don&#39;t be petty and come here, and then complain when others do the same to you, okay?

*Note: This region is heavily a work in progress*
