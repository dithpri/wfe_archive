Say &quot;Hi&quot; on the RMB!
[color=brown]Welcome to [region]Southern Namanten Empire[/region]! [/color]
[color=green]These are the lands administered by [nation=noflag]South Namante[/nation], but all nations that aren&#39;t:[/color] 
-[color=brown]Fascists[/color]
-[color=red]Communists[/color]
-[color=orange]Raiders[/color]
are allowed, if they accept South Namanten Suzerainty. 

[color=red]All who wish to help administer the empire are welcome to come, become a RO, talk in the RMB chat, and more![/color]

[b]*Disclaimer: To all people, especially people who suffer from real world imperialism, this region does not reflect my real world political beliefs. This is just a region where people can roleplay colonialism, and it DOES NOT support:
-Slavery
-Oppression
-Exploitation
Or anything else like that from any standpoint other than a RP one. Thanks for understanding[/b]
