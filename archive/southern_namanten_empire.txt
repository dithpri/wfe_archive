[color=brown]Welcome to [region]Southern Namanten Empire[/region]! [/color]
[color=green]These are the lands [/color] [color=blue]administered by [/color] [color=yellow][nation]South Namante[/nation], but all nations that aren&#39;t:[/color] 
-Fascists
-Communists
-Puppets of [nation]The Hurricane[/nation], [nation]Idinist Imauggland[/nation], or [nation]LlamaLore[/nation]

[color=red]All who wish to help administer the empire are welcome to come, become a RO, talk in the RMB chat, and more![/color]

[b]*Disclaimer: To all people, especially people who suffer from real world imperialism, this region does not reflect my real world political beliefs. This is just a region where people can roleplay colonialism, and it DOES NOT support:
-Slavery
-Oppression
-Exploitation
Or anything else like that from any standpoint other than a RP one. Thanks for understanding[/b]
