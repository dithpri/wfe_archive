THE CELESTRUM HEGEMONY: PROSPERITY THROUGH ORDER

Welcome to a region where the standard of living is absolute and the streets are paved with gold. Under the eternal guidance of The Empire of Celestrum, we have achieved what democracy could not: total security and uninhibited wealth.

The Mandate:

Economy: Our corporations are the engines of the world. Trade flows freely; poverty is a memory.

Security: Crime is non-existent. We do not tolerate chaos.

Social: Citizens are provided for. Contentment is mandatory.

Loyalty is rewarded with luxury. Dissent is met with silence. Enter the Gilded Cage.
