[b][color=#483D8B]Vardenfold is a vast empire that began within the Skundgalar Mountains, ever expanding to encompass new territory. Ruled by benevolent emperors who spread their culture far and wide, building great works and many monuments throughout their lands. As the ever flourishing empire gained more land and cultures it was split into multiple Principalities to better make it manageable. Each Principality is watched over by an Archduke and each Archduke is answerable to the Emperor.[/color][/b]
