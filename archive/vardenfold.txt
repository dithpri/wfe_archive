[b][color=#483D8B]Vardenfold is a vast empire that began within the Skundgalar Mountains, ever expanding to encompass new territory. Ruled by benevolent emperors, it was split into multiple Principalities to better make it manageable. Each Principality is watched over by an Archduke and each Archduke is answerable to the Emperor.[/color][/b]
