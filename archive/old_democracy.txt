[b][u]We, the Democratic High Council, dissolve ourselves of our own volition so as not to overshadow the world with our greatness. 

We were too extraordinary for this place. 

However, we will return every October 31st to remind everyone that no one can escape us. 

Democracy is our greatest virtue.[/u][/b]
