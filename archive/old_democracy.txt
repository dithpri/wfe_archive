This is 102.7 KIIS FM we&#146;re going to commercial break, this is Ryan Secrest here. &#147;[region]Old Democracy[/region] used to be a threat to our democracy (quite weird not gonna lie because of their name) and our constitution. They kept trying to make some of their members part of our government. Now they&#146;re gone. GET OUT&#148;
Alright we&#146;re going back to live music it&#146;s gonna be Kendrick Lamar next up on KIIS FM
