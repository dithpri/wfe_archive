ome to The Virtual Roman Catholic Church
Ordained, 18th January, Anno Domini Nostri Iesu Christi 2015.

TVRCC hopes to be the new seat of Catholic religion in the NS world, and is a separate organization to the VRCC, but nevertheless would like to maintain cordial relations with the latter organization. TVRCC seeks to evangelize the people and nations of the world by spreading the good news of the Lord Jesus Christ, and foster cordial relations with those not in communion with the Faith.
