RULES:
1. I&#39;m not forcing anyone to be super nice to everyone, but don&#39;t be a total scumbag.
2. I&#39;d prefer if your nation was based of a maymay, but all nations (apart from the ones violating site rules, of course) are allowed to join.
3. I&#39;ll try my best to give everyone apart from anyone who has a history of being a raider here an important position. Each person with an important position will start with 10 points, if you don&#39;t follow the rules and your point count goes to 0 you&#39;ll either lose your position but stay here and have the ability to gain it back or, if your offenses were severe, be kicked out. Now, here&#39;s a list of things that you shouldn&#39;t do and how much points they take away. Ejecting an innocent nation: 4 points WIP
