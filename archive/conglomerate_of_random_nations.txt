Welcome to the CORN! We are random nations led by [nation]Monakko[/nation], but they have been inactive recently, so me, [nation]Sverige-Norge[/nation] and [nation]The Sherbet Land[/nation] are currently managing this region.

Since most of our nations are not and don&#39;t plan to become WA members, [nation]Singaporean Isles[/nation] and [nation]Mesogean Republics[/nation] decided we should strip most powers from the Delegate position to keep a balance of power. This may change later.
