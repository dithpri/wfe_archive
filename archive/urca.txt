[i]In Lair of the Dragon born and raised
On the tagging fields was where I spent most of my updates
Chillin&#39; out, raidin&#39;, pillagin&#39;, all fair
And all hoarding gold in deep in the Lair
When a couple of fendas who were against having fun
Started making trouble in my tagging run
I got in one little flame war and the raid lead was fumin&#39;
They said, &quot;You&#39;re spending a week in NS Forum 7&quot;. [/i]
