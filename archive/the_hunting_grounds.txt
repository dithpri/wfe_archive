This is a roleplaying region based on the Mortal Engines series by Philip Reeve. Mortal Engines is set in a post-apocalyptic world where cities drive around eating each other, known as Municipal Darwinism. The main series has 4 books, plus prequels and a son-to-be-released movie. If you&#39;re not familiar with the books, feel free to join; we&#39;ll help you out, just make sure you roleplay! By the way, we accept all types of cities from the universe, even anti-traction ones.
