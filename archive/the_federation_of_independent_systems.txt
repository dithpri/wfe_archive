&quot;It is an honor to stand before you, for you represent the freedom and the future of our world. The once-great United Nations have become victims of their own ambitions, and the Security Council is no more than a pawn of corporate monopolies. As a people you called out for change, you called out for leadership, and I humbly answered that call. Together we challenged the system. We asked for equality. And how were we met? With war!
