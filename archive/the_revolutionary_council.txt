The Revolutionary council was established through Revolutionary Thinking, Friendship and Leadership. Diversity is the cornerstone of our esteemed region, where all are equal under law and democracy.

Through collaboration, loyalty and respect we have established the council as a global juggernaut.
 
We work together towards promoting our ideals and furthering the position of our member nations and The Council. The Council has seen the rise and fall of many, yet it remains unmoved, undeterred and unbound. The Council is, was and forever will be.
