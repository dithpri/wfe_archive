[color=red][i]&amp;quot;The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall.&amp;quot;[/i][/color] - Ernesto Che Guevara

[color=blue][i]&amp;quot;Not the torturer will scare me, nor the body&amp;#39;s final fall, nor the barrels of death&amp;#39;s rifles, nor the shadows on the wall, nor the night when to the ground the last dim star of pain, is hurled but the blind indifference of a merciless, unfeeling world.&amp;quot;[/i][/color] - Roger Waters
