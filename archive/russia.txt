This is Russia!

[color=red]Those that want to post in Russian may post in Russian. Those that want to post in English can post in English.* If anyone wants to telegram me or post something on the RMB that is addressed to me, you should take note of the fact that I do not speak Russian and must take one of the following steps: 1. Post in English so that I can read it. 2. Teach me Russian.**

*Those that want to post in any other language will be chastised in both Russian and English.
**This is a bold option, yet, possible with much determination and a pledge from me that I at the very least will not resist your efforts.[/color]
