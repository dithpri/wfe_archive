[i]&#148;Protecting the People at a Minute&#146;s Notice.&#148;[/i]

[b][color=blue]Welcome to the Minutemen Empire![/color][/b]

[b]Note that this is set in the Fallout universe[/b]

While we are an empire, we are a military democracy of sorts. We have high standards of living, much personal freedom, lax chem laws and a powerful army. We are the dominant power in the ashes of New England and the Northeast, spanning from New York City to Bar Harbor, Maine. The region was founded by my old account, [nation]The Minutemen Empire[/nation], on June 1, 2018 but refounded under the current account on June 10, 2018.
