While we are an empire, we are a military democracy of sorts. We are the dominant power in the ashes of New England and the Northeast, spanning from New York City to Bar Harbor, Maine. The region was founded by my old account, [nation]The Minutemen Empire[/nation], on June 1, 2018 but refounded under Rebuilt Boston on June 10, 2018.
