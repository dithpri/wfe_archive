Addolis Cartalas, the benevolent dictator of The Republic of Sadaon, founded The Allied Isles to protect the smaller island nations which surround the continent of Aedris where his nation is the dominant power.  The nations of Quara and Varphon are Sadaon&#39;s northern neighbors, and also fall under the &quot;Father&#39;s&quot; protection.
