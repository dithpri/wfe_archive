[b]Why are [region]the Black Hawks[/region] so cool? Just be-caws. 

For those who mess with us, it can get hawkward. After all, we&#146;re just hawk this way. So stop hawking your cheep wares, because tonight we set out, hawked and loaded, ad hawk, to hit some targs. And we did, complete with hawk and roll. You can&#146;t hide the sHawk and awe. Call us fowl play but we walk the walk and hawk the hawk. We are hawkt sauce baby, and we take it all, hawk, stock, and barrel. Feather your [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]nest[/url] hon, but know that we rule the skies. CAW!
