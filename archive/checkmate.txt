This region has ground covered in marble, and plants are almost impossible to grow. Night is much longer than day, and many who visit the region never actually see sunlight, only those who&amp;#39;ve lived here for months or years at times. It is seasonless at night, and weather often does not occur. A majority of all light is artificial, and when these lights are on, it is called &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; unanimously by all who inhabit the area. The first civilization was established here when refugees fled from the old Neo-Chicago, in a region that shall not be spoken of. The rulers in Checkmate still occasionally glance out their windows, in fear of a large army arriving. This is the unofficial region of the Klei Entertainment Forums.
