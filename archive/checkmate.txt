Checkmate is, as described by [i]101 Regions Not To Visit[/i] by Francis Perdant, [i]&amp;quot;...the closest you can physically get to visiting hell.&amp;quot;[/i] The mental hospitals all over the region are abandoned and/or condemned, as the insane are almost always found dead, covered in a particularly viscous dark liquid. The region arguably gets less sunlight than most regions near the Poles, and most citizens who claim to have seen the sun are committed to aforementioned mental hospitals. There is no grass, and the ground is paved with black and white tile, to make citizens feel as though they are insignificant pawns.
