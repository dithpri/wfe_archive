This region has ground covered in marble, and plants are almost impossible to grow. Night is much longer than day, and many who visit the region never actually see sunlight, only those who&amp;#39;ve lived here for months or years at times. It is seasonless at night, and weather often does not occur. A majority of all light is artificial, and when these lights are on, it is called &amp;quot;day&amp;quot; unanimously by all who inhabit the area. This is the unofficial region of the Klei Entertainment Forums.
