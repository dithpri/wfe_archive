Checkmate was once a pretty okay region. Covered with marble ground, and seeing a minute amount of sunlight, they were perfectly fine. The Black Riders came, and tried to destroy it all. But, seeing as the founder had executive power, and they didn&amp;#39;t even ban him, they just kicked him, so he rejoined. He then fixed everything, and scoffed at the notion of taking over a region in such a pathetic way. Checkmate is the unofficial region of Klei Entertainment Forums.
