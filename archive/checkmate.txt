Checkmate. Where to start, where to start. Decades ago, the medium-sized region was invaded by the Black Riders, who proved no match for the superior intellect of the Checkmatites, as they&amp;#39;re colloquially referred to as. The region is exposed to light once or twice a year, and weather never breaches the blackness of the sky. The inhospitable landscape is covered in marble tile, and the inhabitants are routinely terrorized by automatons, pretending to be chess pieces. There are nightmarish beasts roaming the landscape that seize the insane, and drag them into their unholy realm, the said insane never seen or heard from again. All in all, a pretty nice place to live.
