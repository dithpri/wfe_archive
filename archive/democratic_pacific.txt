We are the sovereign region of Democratic Pacific. Nations can only join if they are given the secret passcode via telegram. We are a nation of laws and you must respect the laws and customs of this great region

Democracy is the foundation of representation, freedom, and Sovereignty.

&quot;We will no longer surrender [Democratic Pacific] or its people to the false song of Globalism&quot;
