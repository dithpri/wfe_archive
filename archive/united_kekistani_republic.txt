The United Kekistani Republic (U.K.R.) was founded to bring together ethnic Kekistani people after the Great Meme War caused the once prospurous Kekistan into chaos, with the country splitting off into diffrent nations during the last half of the Great Meme War due to poverty and oppression, and caused mass Kekistanis to flee their home for other countries. With the end of the Second Meme War coming to a close, former Kekistan nations came together once again to start planning a Federation, which later turned into the United Kekistani Republic.
