&amp;quot;All have their worth and each contributes to the worth of the others.&amp;quot;
-J.R.R. Tolkien

Salutations to all! We are the region of The Lands of the Valar, a free, and open land. We take pride in our free speech, and offer equal opportunities and second chances to all nations that join! As such, all tyrants and cruel despots will be overthrown (including myself as founder, if ever that occurs!). 

But if this land does not feel applicable or right for you, I have attached documents from a father region The Genevian Empire. Eru, the One, bless you in all your endeavours!
