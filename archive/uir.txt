[i]The Union of Inter-Dependent Reactionaries is an aggressively defensive socialist paradise, focused on the well-being of its own. The UIR has now been converted to a puppet storage region for the Gusrandra Group. We are open to any suggestions you may have; we appreciate your time.

For any questions, comments, or concerns please contact the region&amp;#39;s founder; have a nice day.[/i]
