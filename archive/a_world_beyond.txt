1940 - A WORLD BEYOND...
[hr]
Are you looking for a place to share your steampunk/dieselpunk fantasies? Do you want a great, friendly community with constant, interactive, fluent RP? Do you long to be part of a mature region? Do you prefer democratic regions with elected officers? Well look no further! 

The year is 1940 - and alternate histories are highly welcome. We do not have an offsite forum, as trends in the past have shown that players use RMBs more than offsite forums, as they are a pain to sign up to - it&#39;s just much easier and more accessible and it keeps things close to NationStates.[/b][/color]
