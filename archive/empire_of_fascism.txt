This region was founded as a parody of Fascist ideology and a set-up by the now disgraced nation of V*vl*r to gain fake points for &quot;raiding&quot; a Fascist region. The too-disgraced Frostland seized the region before V*vl*r could refound it after letting his puppet founder CTE. Frostland, prioritizing the development of Seized regions at the time, reopened this region and even granted self-government to the fledgling community that had settled here, under Frostish protection. Alot has changed since then, but this region remains perpetually Frostish and Polish.
