We seek to have a high-quality, fair, and unique science fiction roleplay experience through learning from other regions, through our own ingenuity and ideas, and through well-moderated and regulated roleplaying guides.

We [i]aspire[/i] to roleplay better than most regions on Nationstates, which is not a tall order, all things considered. 
We are not afraid to kick those who don&#39;t meet our standards, and will not kick those who meet our standards, rules, and regulations .
Respect one another, and treat each other well.
Those who join and fail to introduce themselves will be kicked. Raiders will not be tolerated, not even jokingly.
