The Greatest Home
Anthem of Newlandian union

o newlandia
Our land whom our ancestors bled and died

But with strength and will power we overcame

To restore Newlandian union pride!
God save our land,
against those whom seek our doom

We loyal our sons and daughters all

Do hereby make it known

These fields and hills beyond recall

Are now our very own.

Pressing onward, march together

To a common goal;

March on, Newlandian union.

To our Queen, the Great Defender,

Grant us wisdom from above.

Teach us true respect for all,

Stir response to duty&#39;s call.

how great are our people.

They replenish our hopes and pride!

Your qualities can never be denied!

For Newlandian union on the behalf of the great ancestors.
