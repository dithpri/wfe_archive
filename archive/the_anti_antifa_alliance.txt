[color=red]Failed Nazi/Fascist alliance against ANTIFA consisting of [region]London Pact[/region], [region]The Iron Order[/region], [region]The Royal Order[/region], [region]Union Of The Fascist States[/region], [region]Byzantine Roman Empire[/region], [region]Federation of Greater German Republics[/region], [region]The Black Sun[/region] and most recently protected by [region]Farkasfalka[/region].

It has now been captured by the mighty Anti-Fascist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and [region]The Red Fleet[/region], it shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]
