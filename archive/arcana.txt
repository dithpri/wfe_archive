Arcana is a new region focused on and dedicated to its community. It is intended primarily as a role play region, set in a fantasy world equivalent to the year 1700 allowing for both magic and the real life technology of that era. The magic system within Arcana is heavily inspired by the game Genshin Impact, though perspective roleplayers can choose to not follow said magic system if so desired. Arcana is an inclusive region to all discriminated against groups, including the LGBTQ+ community, and all bigots will be banned on sight.

Another thing to note is that our region is primarily discord based (though roleplaying will take place on the RMB), so here is the link: [url=https://discord.gg/hp9rGtKU] Arcana Discord[/url]
