Brelgernarrie is a region originally comprised of settlers from a now-defunct nation seeking virgin land to enact their &#39;perfect&#39; system of governance. Of course, less than a decade passed before factions appeared, and Brelgernarrie is now a vibrant and mostly-amiable collective of nations whose primary goal is to remain independant from the terrors of the outside world.
