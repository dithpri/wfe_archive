[color=red][b][i]WELCOME, TO THE MANDATE OF HEAVEN![/i]
Get comfortable, because our motto is: &#147;You here Forever,&#148; that means You here forever!
[/b][/color]
[b]The Mandate of Heaven is a more Casual, Laidback region for Roleplay and Connection. We don&#146;t really care that much if you&#146;re a Hyperfascist nation with a Rotten structure or a Bolshevik Empire with a collapsing economy. You are all citizens of the Mandate of Heaven, you are all under Imperial Law. 
Try to have fun with it, stinky.[/b]

[b]Make sure to [i]FOLLOW THE RULES![/i] Rulebreakers are no fun! Nobody is gonna pay attention if you break rules anyways.

We (will, eventually) have our own Roleplay map! So you can roleplay on the Regional Messaging Board!

And yes, Dual citizenship is legal, READ THE RULES!!![/b]
