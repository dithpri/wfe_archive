[b][color=Green]Welcome to the Arditi! Just like our namesake, we are a military force fighting for our homeland. Unlike our namesake, we are an interregional military with members across the globe. We work hard to help our member regions grow and flourish in the world of NationStates.[/color]
All members of this region must also have a puppet nation in one of our member regions! Failure to do so will result in expulsion. If you need help, just ask!
Our member regions:

[url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_forgotten_lands_of_hilemm]The Forgotten Lands of Hilemm[/url]
[color=Red]Don&#39;t forget to join our [url=https://discord.gg/S5mBDrN]Discord Server[/url] so you can participate. This can be done on mobile or PC. You won&#39;t be able to participate in the military if you aren&#39;t on the Discord Server. 
Please contact the Founder upon joining, and have fun![/color][/b]
