The Freeland of The Atlantic (or TFTA) is a region located in the Atlantic Ocean. It is made up of islands with one nation called the Republica de Libertad. It is mostly a hispanic region, but any race can be found. It is a freedom region, meaning hardly any laws and regulations. The natives of this region (now a nation) are the Republica de Libertad, or also known as &amp;quot;Los Timbuas&amp;quot;. Los Timbuas speak an almost spanish-type of language called the &amp;quot;Taimbu&amp;quot;. The language is slowly, but surely, dying and the natives are trying their best to keep their language alive.




Remember the motto!: Voilon A&amp;#39;Libiore (Fly Free in the &amp;quot;Taimbu&amp;quot; language)!
