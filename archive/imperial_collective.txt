The Imperial Collective is a supra-national and regional confederation, established for the purpose of supporting monarchist and other centralized governments which seek to homogenize their sovereign states under principles of unity, faith, authority, and government for the good governance of national integrity. Within the Imperial Collective its sovereign states subscribe to the Imperial Articles of Confederation, which primarily seek to provide for inter-dependent, regional governing and a specialized regional defense force (the Imperial Collective Security Organization).
