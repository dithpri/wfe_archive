The [region]Global Slaver Federation[/region] (GSF) has been founded to grow the slave trade to it&#146;s fullest potential. 

Do you want to trade slaves around the world for a nice profit? So do we. There is no good reason you should miss out on a booming industry just because the World Assembly doesn&#146;t like it.

The World Assembly (WA) has grown to overstep its boundaries time and time again, so any time they call any of the GSF&#146;s members out, it is pure hypocrisy. Besides, despite what so many nations say about how much they oppose the practice, they secretly have an interest in our industry.

Let us make money through this lucrative enterprise together!
