Welcome to Kether.  

[b]Kether[/b] is a medium-sized continent on the planet [b]Athaelon[/b].  The current technological level is roughly equivalent to mid-late 21st Century Earth (c2032CE).

Kether is home to an abundance of life forms, including a variety of sentient species, as well as some large creatures.

The climate across much of the continent is relatively cool, owing to its location in the southern hemisphere near the southern polar ice.
