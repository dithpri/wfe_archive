Founder:Easton Island 
WA Represenative: 

This region of the world is not owned by anyone. New Pine is a section of the world that got the name because all of the islands here are mostly Pine trees. You own your own country, and can talk with other countries in the Region. If there is a war in between to countries in the Region message me and the WA Rep. 

Hope you have fun. 

If you have any troubles message me, or the WA Rep.
