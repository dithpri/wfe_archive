The Allied Republics for Freedom (TARF) is a small fledgling region with a rather weak delegate compared to more powerful regions. We fight to guarantee independence of any free nation and its people, regardless of race, culture, language, or location. We are open to embassies with any and all regions, as we promote peace , not war.

Note: To be nice and equal, we run on GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).
