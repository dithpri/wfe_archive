Founded by independent anti-regulation, non-bureaucratic rogues and renegades as a safe haven for memers (lovers and participators in the unholy meme), trolls, miscreants, and the like.

The Council will grow and evolve as the members wish it too, but there are expected to be many internal debates, wars, and bloodfueds that can only end in cannibalism. After all, we are a loose alliance of eccentrics that hate bureaucracy. Chaos will reign, but every once in awhile, against our better judgement, we might get something done.
