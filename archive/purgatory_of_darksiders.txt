Purgatory, according to Catholic Church doctrine, is an intermediate state after physical death in which those destined for heaven &quot;undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven&quot;. Only those who die in the state of grace but have not in life reached a sufficient level of holiness can be in Purgatory, and therefore no one in Purgatory will remain forever in that state or go to hell. This notion has old roots.
