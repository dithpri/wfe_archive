The Witcher series take place on an unnamed planet referred to by its people as the World, the Earth or the Globe.

Approximately 90% of land is on the northern hemisphere. The southern hemisphere is mainly covered by vast ocean. During the nothern hemisphere&#39;s winter the hot air masses from the southern hemisphere flow along the sea currents to the north, where they condensate and subsequently freeze, causing snowfall. It is not much known about the lands located there though some of the Far South lands may be partially located here. The northern hemisphere has much more land than the southern one. The most known is called the Continent and comprises of Northern and Eastern Lands, the Nilfgaardian Empire and the Far North.
