Many moons ago, there was a region known as SBARGia. This eventually decayed and was abandoned; however, it is being reborn. Welcome to the Reborn Region of SBARGia!

This is a silly region where we roleplay nations created by the players of SBARGv2. Post on the regional board messages from your nation&amp;#39;s equivalent of a diplomat directed at others freely, and have fun developing a nation that is interesting to interact with. ICly we&amp;#39;re running nations we made from crap brought over from the Incipisphere into an abandoned galaxy of the universe we made, and put nations there for fun.

Magic, non-human species, and any technology level are allowed. Puppet accounts / multiple accounts are not allowed [i]unless[/i] there is an IC justification.
