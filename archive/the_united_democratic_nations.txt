Hello and Welcome, to [b][color=blue]The United Democratic Nations[/color][/b]!

[i]&quot;United We Stand As One&quot;[/i]

It is our belief that every nation in the world should be both [u]fair and democratic[/u]! As we are currently a very small region. We have many openings within our [u]regional goverment[/u], if you believe that your would fit one of these roles, then please don&#39;t hesitate to [url=https://forms.gle/Viby4iNxEsgjFfAs8]apply[/url]. You can also join our Discord server [url=https://discord.com/invite/HYu2k5V3EX]here[/url]! Any [b]nation[/b] is welcome to [b]join[/b]!

Please make sure that you join the [b]World Assembly[/b] and endorse our [b]WA Delegate[/b] [nation]Gillivieseihinn[/nation], this not only strengthens our voting power in the [b]World Assembly[/b], but it also gives our region extra [u]stability[/u] and [u]peace[/u]

Finally, [u]thank you and welcome[/u], we hope you enjoy your stay here!
