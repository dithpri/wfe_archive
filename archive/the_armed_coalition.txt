I am thrilled to announce the promotion of [nation]MolRihan[/nation] to Corporal in The West Pacific Armed Forces.  He joined the WPAF thirty five days ago and has held the rank of Private.  

He does not bring a wealth of experience to his new role, but we are excited about his new role in the armed forces.  

Please join us in welcoming him to the army and congratulating him on his promotion.

Best Regards,

God-Emperor
Field Commander, WPAF
