Lordaeron is the northernmost subcontinent of the Eastern Kingdoms. The same name was used for a former human kingdom, the Kingdom of Lordaeron (aka Lordaeron Empire[2]) which dominated most of the subcontinent up until its fall in the Third War. The name Lordaeron comes from the three main Alliance race languages: &quot;lorn&quot; (in Dwarven) that means &quot;land&quot;, &quot;daer&quot; (in Common) that means &quot;people&quot; and &quot;ronae&quot; (in Thalassian) that means peaceful.[3] The former kingdom&#39;s capital, usually referred to as Capital City, was also formally called Lordaeron City.[4].
