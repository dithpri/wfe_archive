The [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=american_continents][color=blue]American Continental Union (ACU)[/color][/url] Convention on Human Rights is an international treaty to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in the American Continents. Drafted in 1956 by the then newly formed Council of The Americas, the convention entered into force on 3 September 1958. Any person who feels his or her rights have been violated under the Convention by a state party can take a case to the Court.
