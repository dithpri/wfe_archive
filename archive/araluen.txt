For all lovers of The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice
If you are in the WA, you get a chance to be in the ranger corps. 
First to join is the WA delegate
Rise through the ranks in our growing military, become a battle school apprentice or ranger&#39;s apprentice,
Become a [b][color=green]Knight[/color][/b] or a [b][color=green]Ranger[/color][/b] after persistent activity
The best, most active players become a [color=red]baron[/color] and get charge of a fief.
