[b][i][u]This region has been dominated by [nation]J o J[/nation]![/u][/i][/b]

Upon reviewing [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region]&#39;s [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=like_a_rock/detail=factbook/id=732530]list of acquisitions[/url], J o J came across another undefended region. Take care of what you own, [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region], or I will have to do a little bit of a [color=red][b]repo operation[/b][/color] due to your carelessness like I have done here. Well, I never owned it in the first place, but you get the idea.

[hr]Property of [nation]J o J[/nation].[hr]You know, I really like candy too. That was what this take over was like; taking [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=candy] candy[/url] from a [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=blitzkrieg] baby.[/url] And this was a double-whammy takeover at that, I helped myself to [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_united_kingdom_of_breutchesland]this[/url] as well. [u][b]I could have made it a triple or quadruple whammy[/b][/u], but I don&#39;t want the other 2 they have undefended. Somebody else can mop those up.[hr]
