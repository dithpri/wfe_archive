In 2015, a crack eco-unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn&#39;t commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Winchester underground. Today, still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire Bin Squad!
