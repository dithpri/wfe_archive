&quot;And the tempter came and said to him, &#147;If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.&#148; But he answered, &#147;It is written, &#147;&#145;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.&#146;&#148; Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.&quot; - Matthew 4:3-6
