The Union of Yeek and Gree is a military pact formed in response to the aggressive actions of Gleef. Several nations situated between the great rivers of Yeek and Gree joined this pact for protection against the Gleef menace, and found themselves financially dependent on the major players of the region, unable to exit the agreement after the destruction of Gleef.
