As we combed the multiverse to find a safe place away from [region]the cult of boo the dog[/region] we discovered the world of [region]DEATHMURDERCLOWNSINTHEFOREST[/region]. We met[color=red](read:murdered)[/color] the natives and have now settled[color=red](read: conquered)[/color] the region and claimed it as ours.

This nation is for our people who chose to leave the [region]cult of boo the dog[/region] or would just like to participate in a friendly, casual region.

Here is our [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/16DrKbuu9eDRKYnQ0sEVS35hSUpD2mw3YZ727uywfr94]regional map[/url]. Contact [nation]Qonon[/nation] for your place on the map. Please do not request huge amounts of land.

Our official regional colors are [b]black[/b], [color=purple]purple[/color] and [color=red]r[/color][color=orange]a[/color][color=yellow]i[/color][color=green]n[/color][color=blue]b[/color][color=indigo]o[/color][color=violet]w[/color] and our official regional animal is the [color=blue]narwhal[/color].

This is not too serious of a region.
