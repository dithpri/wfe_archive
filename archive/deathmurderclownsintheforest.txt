The remains of a quiet little empire, DEATHMURDERCLOWNSINTHEFOREST has returned because one of its old members got nostalgic in the middle of the night recently.

[color=purple]Clowns and non-clowns of all sorts are welcome to wander these woods, friends old and new. Government positions may become available depending on regional population growth.[/color]

Our official regional colors are [b]black[/b], [color=purple]purple[/color] and [color=red]r[/color][color=orange]a[/color][color=yellow]i[/color][color=green]n[/color][color=blue]b[/color][color=indigo]o[/color][color=violet]w[/color] and our official regional animal is the [color=blue]friendly clown[/color]. Don&#39;t ask.

[color=purple]We&#39;re not really roleplayers or gameplayers, but you&#39;re welcome to do whatever floats your boat.[/color] [i](As long as it&#39;s family-friendly. If it&#39;s not, you will be purged by chainsaw-wielding clowns. c:)[/i]
