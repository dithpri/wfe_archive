As we combed the universe to find a safe place away from [region]the cult of boo the dog[/region] we discovered the world of [region]DEATHMURDERCLOWNSINTHEFOREST[/region]. We met[color=red](see:murdered)[/color] the natives and have now settled[color=red](see:conquered)[/color] the region and claimed it as ours.

This nation is for our people who chose to leave [region]the cult of boo the dog[/region] or would just like to participate in a friendly, casual region.
