The Ex-European Collaborative emerged from the ruins of the former Europe, after the great collapse. Who will still prevail here? 
If you wish to join just go for it.
It doesn&#39;t matter if you are a psychotic Dictatorship or a New York Times democracy, you have complete freedom in how you handle your State.
The name can also be anything you wish since Europe broke down and there are no rules how the new rulers have to name their country.
