The Sea of Small Nations is a Roleplaying Region where nations are expected to follow these simple rules.

[b]Modern Tech:[/b] All nations should be modern tech. No nation can be of a higher tech level. If the tech level is lower than modern tech, it is assumed that the nation was just recently discovered with the level of technology they now posses. 

[b]Realistic Numbers:[/b] All nations should use the stats given by www.nstrackers.net. Which are quite realistic. Population and Military can be toned down. But not up.
