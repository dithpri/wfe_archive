The Continent of Fisyn is a resource-rich and biologically diverse land-mass roughly double the size of Australia. The Holy Empire of Belenoch, the Republics of Varnd &amp; Terfn, the Rekanian Union, the -justin&#39;s nation here-, and the Federated States of Balin compromise the political boundaries of the region. The Holy Empire exerts considerable influence over the rest of the continent, though the Federated States of Balin and the Rekanian Union are less susceptible to the demands of the fanatical Belenochian government.
