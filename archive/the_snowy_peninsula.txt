[b]Peninsulas are surrounded by water.  Without defenders, Natives will continue to be surrounded by Raiders.  Two Wolves prowled through this snowy field, seeking their prey.  Silently, they stalked on [region]The Snowy Peninsula[/region]. The pair of them working together, demonstrate the concept of [region]Lone Wolves United[/region].

These two will prowl again soon, and the rest of the pack will join them.  Defenders are fully expected to continue their somnolence.  Have you heard the howls at night?  Take your place in the pack; Join LWU today.[/b]
