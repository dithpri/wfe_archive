Be optimistic, happy and calm 
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors
Your patience will be justified
Everything is for him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For it&#39;s a point of no return for almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servant
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy 
The great Satan

BE AFRAID

Bombs to set the people free
Blood to feed the dollar tree
Flags for coffins on the screen
Oil for the machine
Army of liberation
Gunpoint indoctrination
The fires of sedation fulfill the prophecy
