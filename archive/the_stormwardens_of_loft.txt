The StormWardens of LoFT was a region established by the members of the LOFT Guild to roleplay our power fantasies as the leader of nations. Please visit our offsite forum thread at [url=http://www.lotsoffunthings.enjin.com/forum/viewforum/5091519/m/24624486]Nationstates LOFT[/url].

As a few ground rules:

1. Only [b]1[/b] nation per person in Stormwardens of LOFT.
2. Read the Roleplay Dispatch before involving yourself in Roleplay aspects.
3. Keep it fun!
