A confederation of Holy Orthodox Countries whose aim is to propagate the holy orthodox Christian religion throughout the world, rescuscitate the glorious Byzantine Empire and overthrow the perfidious west and the menacing east.
The confederation was founded by the Emperor Gordius of Upper Cappadocia upon him managing to liberate his kingdom from Turkish rule. His message of extreme Orthodox Christianity spread to all the regions of the known world, causing sundry nations to flock to his godly banner in defence of the orthodox way of life.
