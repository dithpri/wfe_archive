MEDU is an anti-communist economic and defensive organisation founded by the Republic of [nation]Mareastereans[/nation] and is named after it as the original treaty was signed there. We accept embassy requests from all except communist regions.

MEDU was founded after a neutronic exchange that destroyed much of civilisation. However, there were few survivors, including the Republic of [nation]Mareastereans[/nation], who founded MEDU to unite the surviving nations under the banner of anti-communism.
