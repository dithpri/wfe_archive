MEDU was founded after a neutronic exchange that destroyed much of civilisation. Although it was a devastating event, there were few survivors, including the Republic of [nation]Mareastereans[/nation], who founded MEDU to unite the surviving nations.

MEDU is an economic and defensive organisation founded by the Republic of [nation]Mareastereans[/nation] and is named after it as the original treaty was signed there. We accept embassy requests from all except communist regions.
