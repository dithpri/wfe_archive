The Union of Kazi Republics is a region that discriminates 
against fascism, nazism, and imperialism. Nations that rule 
under these systems are not welcome. Center-right conservative 
nations or center-left liberal nations may join but this region
is mostly socialist and communist.

Kazi&amp;#39;s philosophy is military priority, opposition to reactionary
politics, and liberty.

Center-right, center-left and far left nations, join us!

The more the merrier!
