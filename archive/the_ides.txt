[b][color=red]THE RULES[/color][/b]

You get 11 stabs to stab people with. You must use ALL OF THEM. This will be done in story format. (Doesn&#39;t have to be best seller stuff, but more than just &quot;I stabbed Altino 11 times&quot;) The timeline in your story must start on the 15th of March, but can extend into wherever you want. Be creative!

In a spoiler or TL;DR at the bottom tally your stabs of people.&nbsp;[b]ENTRY SUBMISSION WILL BEGIN ON MARCH 15TH[/b]. Post the story on&nbsp;[region]The Ides[/region]&#39; RMB [b]by March 19th[/b]. Only [region]Karma[/region] Locals can be stabbed.
