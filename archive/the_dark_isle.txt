An island chain located off the coast of Peru, it is covered in a thick mist for almost all of the year. This makes satellite imagery impossible. In 1997, a group of 20 Russian explorers attempted to map the region. The connection was severed when the explorers approached the mist. No traces were ever found. Analysis of the last bits of data transmitted show that the mist contains an unknown element capable of blocking most types of communication, the only type of rays able of penetrating the mist are lasers, sunbeams and microwaves.
