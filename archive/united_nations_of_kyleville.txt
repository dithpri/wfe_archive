Minecraft is a sandbox construction game created by Mojang AB founder Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson, inspired by Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and Notch&#39;s past games Legend of the Chambered and RubyDung. Gameplay involves players interacting with the game world by placing and breaking various types of blocks in a three-dimensional environment. In this environment, players can build creative structures, creations, and artwork on multiplayer servers and singleplayer worlds across multiple game modes.

As of May 17, 2019, Minecraft has sold 176 million copies across all platforms, making it the best-selling video game of all time, and the ninth best-selling video game franchise of all time.
