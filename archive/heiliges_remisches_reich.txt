[b][Color=brown]Europe at the eve of a new era![/color][/b]

[i]It is 1815. Napoleon has been defeated. The Holy Reman Empire has been restored but is estranged and fragmented. The new emperor, elected by the prince-electors of the empire, has limited powers and resides in the new imperial capital of Frankfurt. You are the leader of one of the many realms of the empire. Will you defy the upcoming storm?[/i]

This is an alternate history roleplay region. [u]We prefer diplomacy rather than wars.[/u] Telegram to [nation]Heiliges Remisches Reich[/nation] for a claim.

[b]WA members will be appointed to regional officers (Prince-electors / Electoral Princesses)![/b]
