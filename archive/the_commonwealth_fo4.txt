A powerful force in the history, industry, and culture of the United States, Massachusetts was one of the original Thirteen Colonies.[Non-game 1] Massachusetts became a hotbed of secessionist sentiment. The conflict between colonists and the crown was only aggravated by attempts to tax the colonies without giving them representation in the parliament, resulting in the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party. The powder keg finally ignited in 1775, when the Thirteen Colonies openly rebelled against the crown during the American Revolutionary War.[1] The battles of Lexington and Concord were the first engagements of the war, which spilled across the colonies.[Non-game 2]
