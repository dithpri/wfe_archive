In this place all magic believing countries are welcome to join. We believe that we show create a fair equal land, where we are one with the land, we take only as much as is needed. We are also level headed in times of great depression. But when are honor is in need of protecting, we will protect it without hesitation. We are mainly quiet people, who have little experience with political matters, and little want to. We like to keep to ourselves as much as possible, gathering strength and intelligence or impending threats in case we should ever be at risk of attack. Though when we hear of something that requires our attention, either in peaceful ways or violent, we will attend to it with all resources at our disposal.
