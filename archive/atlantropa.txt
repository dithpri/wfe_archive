Atlantropa was once the Mediterranean Sea. In 1953, a dam would be built in the Strait of Gibraltar. Over the next 10 years, The Mediterranean&#39;s sea level would fall by 200 meters/660 feet, causing many regions, including the Adriatic, to dry up. The effects of this project would only cause the Sahara to creep ever closer to Europe, and not bring land to settle. The desertification of southern Europe would lead to water shortages, a refugee crisis, and even the collapse of Yugoslavia, Spain, and Italy. The Gibraltar Dam would come under an independent administration, where the only rule is to protect the strait, no matter what. If the dam is lost, the sea shall return, wiping out countless settlements.
