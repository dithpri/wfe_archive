The max. number of Lords is: 9, of Captains: 15, of King: 1 (per the election period) and 5 ships per captain
Captains build and name their ships, and our pirates join whichever ships they want. If a pirate has been good and if there is still room for captains, a superior Captain can name a new Captain.
