In the Liberal Democratic Union, countries are encouraged to be open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values.
 While our primary ideology is liberalism, we accept countries with other democratic ideologies (conservatism, socialism, progressivism, libertarianism, ect.).
 Polite political debates are encouraged since debates can open our minds to new ideas.
 Our region was created to strive for peace, liberty, equality, and prosperity.
