Edutopia is founded on the principle that the better educated people are, the better they can decide for themselves what to do.  As such, it is encouraged that all governments of countries in it do as little as possible other than provide for education and research.  Let free markets take their course and let people suffer or celebrate the results of their decisions... or not, do what you want.  Decide for yourself.  We don&amp;#39;t care.
