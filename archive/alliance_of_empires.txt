The Alliance of Empires was first made by the notorious Faroenian Empire-which controlled 29% of the world at one point-to secure other,smaller states dominance in the world.

However,all empires come to an end.Faroenia was no exception to this rule,and with the loss of one of the greatest countries in the world,the Alliance had to pick a new leader.The result was this-

The Empire of Amichana-39%

The Federal Republic of Nariso-27%

The Union of Iberia-23%

The Soviet Empire of Siberia-8%

The Republic of Australia and Papua New Guinea-3%
