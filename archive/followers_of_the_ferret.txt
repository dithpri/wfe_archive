[b][i]Come to us, praise your almighty DEFINITELY-rodent princes. [/b][/i]

All hail the mighty [b]ferret[/b], the only animal no one in Europeia is associated with in any way, shape, or form. The [b][color=red]Europeian[/color] [color=blue]Republican[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color] ([color=red]E[/color][color=blue]R[/color][color=green]N[/color])[/b] has come to meet its master in the rodent prince. We bow down to our ferret lords in awe of the creatures of dominance they have become, and look forward to scheduling a meeting with the rodent king of this land. We will work swiftly to spread [b][color=red]Neo-Ferretism[/color][/b] across the region of Europeia. 

If you wish to see [color=red][b]Neo-Ferretism[/b][/color] flourish, come check out [region]Europeia[/region].
