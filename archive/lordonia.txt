[b]A [color=green]Goose[/color], a [color=brown]Bear[/color], and a [color=purple]Witch[/color] (all residents of [region]The Black Hawks[/region]) walk into your region. The [color=brown]bear[/color] says to the [color=green]goose[/color], &quot;Wow, this regions current WFE is un[color=red]BEAR[/color]able!&quot; The goose looks at himself and says &quot;I&#39;m [i][color=blue]game![/color][/i]&quot; And so, with the help of their magical friend, decided to take over your region.
