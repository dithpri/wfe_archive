When its founder ceased to exist, this region was taken over by a Marxist and opponent of [b][region]Right to Life[/region][/b].  The [b]Right to Life Army[/b] has retaken control of this region by refounding it.  We will not tolerate attacks on our region or our allies.

This region is currently a protectorate of Right to Life.  It will be returned to its original founder [b][nation]Der Laufeland[/nation][/b] if he returns to NationStates.

Anyone who is conservative, libertarian, or centrist may reside here.  The password to enter the WCC is [b][color=blue]tradition[/color][/b].
