Lethe was the spirit (daimon) of forgetfulness and oblivion. She was often associated with the eponymous underworld river. Here, Lethe causes drinkers to forget their past and bathe in the warmth of its waters, forever freed from the burdens of conscience. This, we applaud. 

For Lethe never stops flowing. Wherever you are, whatever state you&amp;#39;re in, you are welcome to fade into the sweet darkness that is Lethe&amp;#39;s oblivion.
