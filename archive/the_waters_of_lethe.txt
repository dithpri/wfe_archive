Lethe is the spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion. She was often associated with the eponymous underworld river. Here, Lethe causes drinkers to forget their past and bathe in the warmth of its waters, forever freed from the burden of conscience. This is what we applaud. 

For the river never ends. Whoever you are, whatever state you&amp;#39;re in, everyone will to give in to the sweet darkness that is Lethe&amp;#39;s oblivion.
