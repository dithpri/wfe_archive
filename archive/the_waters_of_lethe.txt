[i]Lethe is one of the five rivers of Hades. It flows around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld, where all those who drink from it experience complete forgetfulness. [/i]

All are welcome in this wonderful place dedicated to the arts of self-inducted mental revelation and the alteration of one&amp;#39;s mind. Wether it be natural or artificial, whenever you&amp;#39;re feeling down or high, there&amp;#39;s always someone, somewhere on this earth tripping his balls off to the extent of pure oblivion.

Drink, and relish the calm, glistening waves of Lethe.
