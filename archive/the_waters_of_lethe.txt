All are welcome in this wonderful place dedicated to the art of self-inducted mental revelation and the alteration of one&amp;#39;s mind. Wether through natural or artificial methods, whatever state you&amp;#39;re in, whenever you&amp;#39;re feeling down or [i]high[/i], there&amp;#39;s always someone, [i]somewhere[/i] on this earth tripping his balls off to the extent of temporary nescience.

[color=brown]&amp;quot;Empty yourself of everything. Let the mind rest at peace. The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return. They grow and flourish and then return to the source. Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.&amp;quot;
-Lao Tzu[/color]
