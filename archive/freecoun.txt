The Free Countries (or FreeCoun) is a collection of independent nations who banded together to guarantee the freedom of their citizens from external forces.

While FreeCoun&#39;s military is quite small and its weaponry is bordering on obsolete, they have first-in-class training, and are rapidly growing their military&#39;s industrial capabilities to better combat threats in a modern age. However, their combined governments have sworn to only use this military for defensive purposes, and to provide relief aid in distant countries.
