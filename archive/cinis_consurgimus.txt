Cinis Consurgimus is the phoenix that shall never die. We rise from our ashes, we may shed tears, but while we do that we help heal those who need it. We are not a ruthless region. Instead the region is vast and has to behold riches to it. You make the region what you find it to be. No one will conquer this region. (Mostly since there has been a password placed upon it.) It shall only a pace for the weak to hide and the strong to help. Those with different or similar ideas come speak in a well manor tone on things.
