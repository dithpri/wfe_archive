[color=green]This region is dedicated to democracy and freedom of all forms of governments. All beliefs will be tolerated.[/color] (Now you might be asking, how you say freedom of all governments when the region is of democracy? Everything that is to be elected and/or placed as laws will go through a form of democratic process (voting).  We don&amp;#39;t care how you run your individual nation.)

A regional government will be created once we reach a sufficient amount of nations. Thanks!
