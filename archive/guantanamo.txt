[b]Guant&aacute;namo[/b] is a municipality and city in southeast Cuba and capital of Guant&aacute;namo Province.

Guant&aacute;namo is served by the Caimanera port near the site of a U.S. Naval base. The area produces sugarcane and cotton, the traditional parts of the economy. About 15 km away from the city lies the Guant&aacute;namo Bay, a superior natural harbor which has been militarily occupied by the United States since 1898, when it was captured from Spain in the Battle of Guant&aacute;namo Bay, and was subsequently leased from Cuba in 1903 by the Cuban&#150;American Treaty. It is the site of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
