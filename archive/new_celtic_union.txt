[b]Welcome![/b]

This is the [b][region]New Celtic Union[/region][/b], where former British nations have forged a new, [i]democratic[/i] alliance.

We hold democratic elections every month to elect a Chancellor. Decisions made by Senate (appointed by Chancellor). I also intend to make a map once some nations have joined.

[u][b][color=blue]Vacant Senate Posts[/color][/b][/u]
- Chancellor &amp; Senator for the World Assembly (WA Delegate)
- Senator for Foreign Relations
- Senator for Boards &amp; Dispatches

Oh and by the way its KEL-tic [u]not[/u] SELL-tic

[b][color=cyan]Please join the Celtic Union and [i]together[/i] we can make the region a place for great things.[/color][/b]
