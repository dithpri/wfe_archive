A small region that keeps to themselves, Mauritnius was once part of The Great Empire of Gekton, after the Allied Powers overthrew their tyrannical rulers, Mauritnius seceded to form their own land. While not completely perfect, Mairitnius is one of the prime examples of an open-minded society. The Federation is a very free region too, people here are calm and relaxed. Musicians play on the streets, while you can frequently see boats on the Mauine River full of tourists from near, and far. Mauritnius is the place people flee when seeking asylum from unjust rulers, and freedom from religious nations.
