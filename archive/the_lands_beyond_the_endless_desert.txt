[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region].

With speed and precision, no region is safe for the imperialist juggernaut. All shall tremble in fear at the sight of wings and talons!

Praise the Kaiser! Long live the Emperor! Glory to the King!
