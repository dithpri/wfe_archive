A realm of oppression and despair, where might makes right.

Here, the Covenant of Thorns rules, all other nations must support the Covenant. The Covenant will protect all nations within the region from being summarily expelled and banned by usurpers in return for this support. Other than this, all nations may do as they please.

Join the WA and Endorse the Covenant of Thorns, or face the consequences. Other than that, we will work together to make a solid, secure region, that will never be overcome
