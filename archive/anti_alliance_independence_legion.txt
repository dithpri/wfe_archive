The League and their leader Gagium is a puppet and mouthpiece of the Democratic Party. We call on all those who oppose this organization to join us. We are committed to serving our nation and helping the voiceless rise up to live dignified lives; we oppose all forms of separatism. We oppose all drugs, cults, LGBTQ agendas, and illegal immigration advocated by the Democratic Party. We will uphold the core tenets of Bible-based conservatism and continue our struggle. We support any unification, including China&#146;s unification of Taiwan in 2027&#151;though we hold no particular goodwill toward it. We will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.
