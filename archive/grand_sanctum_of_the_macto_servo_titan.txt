---REGIONAL NEWS---
Tarulias and other esteemed delegates have begun their transition into our new Region: [region]Eriathien[/region]. Those who want to join this region will have to become a fief or state under the sovereign ruler, [nation]Eriathien[/nation]. Failure to do so will result in the ejection from that region. If you do not want to join (it is okay), then depart from this region and enjoy your life on Nation States. I will be here until Friday if anyone wants to telegram or post on the forum. After that, the region will close down. Thank you for your time and Godspeed.
