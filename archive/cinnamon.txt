Welcome to [colour=#7B4B3A][b]Cinnamon[/b][/colour], a laid-back sanctuary for (displaced) nations, puppets, and card farmers. As an Embassy Collector, we&#39;re here to offer a space where you can do whatever you want&#151;because, frankly, we don&#146;t care what you&#146;re up to. Whether you&#146;re here to farm cards, grow your nation, or just chill in peace, Cinnamon is the place where you can focus on yourself without anyone bothering you.
