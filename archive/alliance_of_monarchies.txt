Dear fellow Monarchies from all regions,

Welcome to this, an alliance of fellow monarchies, be them Duchies, Kingdoms, Queendoms or Principalities. An alliance of strength and integrity, where Monarchies far and wide can join together to collaborate and make each other strong. An alliance where diplomatic relations can thrive and flourish, and nations can make lifelong allies.
