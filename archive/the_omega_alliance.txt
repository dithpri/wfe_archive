Once defeated, the Omega Alliance was once a strong region. A region full of hope of a better tomorrow, a region full of the determination to bring about that tomorrow, and a region full of men and women who would sacrifice all to bring about that tomorrow.
Now that the Remnants of Omega has been siezed by an evil foreign power drenched in the belief of a united world into which all must join, or those who fight for their freedom die.

Welcome to the Omega Alliance, let us rebuild our strength, our unity, and our freedoms together.
