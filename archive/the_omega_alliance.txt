Once, the Omega Alliance was a quite nice region. Well, it wasn&amp;#39;t really very nice, but it was OK. It worked, kind of. Unfortunately, due to a great deal of reasons, it fell apart and was destroyed. It got refounded at least once, we think, but then it fell again and ceased to exist for a while. UNTIL NOW! It has been refounded by [region]Argantia[/region] as a quiet place of memory and contemplation due to its historic link with that region.

No-one can come in at the minute because I barely ever log on to this account. It&amp;#39;s just here so no-one else can have the region (not that they&amp;#39;d want to).
