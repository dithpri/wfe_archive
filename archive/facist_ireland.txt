[color=forestgreen]Luck o&#39; the Irish! Us naughty antifascist leprechauns went looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and we found some fascists making a mess. Even though it wasn&#39;t Saint Patty&#39;s Day, we decided to prank them and we sprinkled our gold and shamrocks over their ugly mess. We then proceeded to beat them with our boots and chased them to [region]The Rejected Realms[/region].[/color]
