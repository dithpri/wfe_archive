Kek rules all. Kebabs are enemy of the state. All Nations in The UNUK must embrace Kek fully by ending all telegrams with either &quot;praise Kek&quot;, &quot;as Kek Wills it&quot;, or any other variation of that. If you would like to join our region, telegram the WA delegate, the vice delegate, the president, or founder.
