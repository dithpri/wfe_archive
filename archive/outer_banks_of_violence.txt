Anarchy, Death, and Violence is a good day in this region. Prepare to see the skies raining with liquid metal and blood. Dinosaurs run rampant after a large meteor crashed resurrecting them and animals have mutated. The sky glows a neon pink during the day and a dark purple at night. Everyone hates everyone else, riots and executions happen quite often.
