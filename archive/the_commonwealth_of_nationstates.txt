Welcome to the Commonwealth of NationStates!

Do you not like the hustle and bustle of the North Pacific, but still want to be a member? Good news! The Commonwealth of NationStates is for you! We are a small, inclusive community of North Pacific nations, where EVERYONE gets a role in the decision-making process of the region. The Commonwealth is also integrated in North Pacific politics, with the Founder being a member of the North Pacific Forum. We hope to become a medium-sized region that shares most of the common North Pacific culture, and we are always looking for new members. Join today!
