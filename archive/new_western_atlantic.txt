[color=0d5eaf][b]It was a quiet, pleasant Friday afternoon in Thaecia when [nation]Andusre[/nation] and [nation]Brototh[/nation] happened upon the realisation that the New Western Atlantic could be raided!

Exhilarated by this realisation, they quickly set out to organise a fun afternoon with their fellow Thaecians, with the goal of tagging the NWA!

Sincerest thanks to the NWA for allowing this advertising space for Thaecia! We shall be sure to return again soon ;)
