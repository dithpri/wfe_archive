Founded by the strong nation of [nation=long]Solailse[/nation], this flourishing region will accept only the most devoted the cause of communism. Most of the other nations in this region were either created by or conquered by The Dominion of Solailse. [nation=long]Marxist-Leninst Land[/nation] and [nation=long]The Communist land of Stalin and Marx[/nation] are the only nations in The Great Union of the Socialist Realms to have arrived out of free will. They were puppet nations sent by our arch-nemises [nation=long]The Aumenlends[/nation], leader of [region]The United States of The Lands[/region], along with [nation=long]Henringdom[/nation]. These nations broke away from the control of the tyrant The Aumenlands eventually and are now proud members of our Great Union.
