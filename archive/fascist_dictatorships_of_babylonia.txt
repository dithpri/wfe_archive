[b][i]Hello![/i][/b][hr]We saw your toy, dropped on the ground, alone. So we decided to [strike]shred it all up[/strike] take care of it! Besides, fascism is yucky anyway. We&#39;re gonna clean this rusty toy and prevent it from getting the diseases of Nazism and Fascism ever again. Ain&#39;t that right, [nation]The sneaky shadows[/nation]? Ain&#39;t that right?[hr][b]This region got raided THREE times. Here were the regions who raided it:[/b]
- [region]Fatal discords empire[/region] (along with [nation]fort trenton[/nation])
- [region]Osiris[/region] (S.M, that wasn&#39;t [region]ijaka[/region], that&#39;s [i]Osiris[/i]! and s.m took this region back as a colony for fde)
- [region]Coyphusian Anti Fascist Action[/region][hr][b]Note:[/b] this isnt really a fash bash it already got bashed by FDE. we just wanted to change a little stuff
