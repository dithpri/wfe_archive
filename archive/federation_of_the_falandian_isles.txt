A federation composed of independent dominions under the Falandian Crown. Each constituent dominion within the federation governs its internal affairs, including currency, whilst the Federal Commission, composed of representatives of the governments of each respective constituent dominion, is responsible for external and inter-dominion affairs. The Federal Commission is governed by a Chief Commissioner as well as a Deputy Commissioner from each constituent dominion. Upon admission into the federation, constituent territories spend a period of time as &#39;protectorates&#39; of the federation before transitioning to full dominionhood.
