The Constitutional Monarchy of East Bordeaux has elected to start its own region in an effort to boost its economy out of its struggling depression. This region takes after the dearly departed founding leader&#39;s, Louis de Lafayette III, old French heritage, but with a new twist as East Bordeaux makes it&#39;s way into the Modern Age. All joining nations in this region must work together in partnership with East Bordeaux to insure the success of their nations.
