We attempt to distribute the power amongst the officers. No one may hold more than two positions at a time, they must surrender an office to gain another. Anyone who attempts to seize control of the region will be immediately expelled and banned from re-entering. Period. If you own more than one nation, then one may have two offices or each may have one, but no one can have two nations or more with more than one office apiece. Anyone discovered to be doing so will be expelled. And banned. Have a nice day!
