The Southern Collective represents four nations that are located in the Southern half of the world. (These nations being: The Dictatorship of Mollettagascar, The Borderlands of Floppaslovia, The Empire of The Antarctic Conglomerate, and The Armed Republic of Shockenawhe.) 

The Southern Collective is still mostly unknown by most factbooks, so information is scarce.
