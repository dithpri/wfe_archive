You must be wondering, what is this? Well, this is [b]Emirates of Futurnia[/b], the best NS Sports puppet region around... though that&#39;s not really a title to be that proud of. In all honesty, this region is mostly the brainchild of [nation]Northern Sunrise Islands[/nation] and [nation]Dainer[/nation] and the Emirates name doesn&#39;t really fit with the region&#39;s theme, but eh, whatevs. Every sort of nation lives here, funnily enough, and we&#39;re always open for other puppets if they feel like popping around. 

Embassy requests will be promptly accepted, because... we still don&#39;t know what&#39;s the use of it.
