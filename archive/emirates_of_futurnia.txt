Emirates of Futurnia is a part-project/part-hobby/part-Puppet Storage region. RPingly saying, Emirates of Futurnia is a region formed by small areas of known RL countries who decided to separate themselves from their original land because of the fact that they are richer than their old lands. This is a MT region, so most participating countries will make use of said epoque&amp;#39;s tecnology. It isn&amp;#39;t full of compromise though. It&amp;#39;s open to participate by TGing [nation]Northern Sunrise Islands[/nation], the puppetmaster of [nation]Barra e Janeiro[/nation] and if you want to participate, you can TG NSI for the password. This also works if you are a featured region follower and this place, for some reason, gets featured!
