All nations in this region must all bow before The Great and Powerful One, He Who Knows No Limits, His Infinite Majesty, The Enlightened One, the Lion of Belzoni, The Jamial Joe I.
     All must obey the legislation of Edeberi, the capital. 

The Kingdom of Jordania, after which this region is named, is merely ceremonial after the absence of The Jamial and the following abolition of the title.  It is a holy site and must not be entered by commoners.
