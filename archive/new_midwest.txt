 Formed up of several secessionist entities founded after the Great Dissolution, the New Midwest is a largely libertarian, agricultural haven. Heavily armed soldiers and militiamen from all secessionist nations constantly patrol the contested borders with the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of America,  patiently awaiting the day those communist bastards try to invade.

UPDATE: Militia President Schrader has declared all the former United States the New Midwest in an attempt to piss a buncha people off.
