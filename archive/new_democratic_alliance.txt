Welcome, friend, to the [b][color=red]New Democratic Alliance[/color]![/b]

The NDA aims to be an independent, friendly and social region of the NationStates Leftist community. We are committed above all to openness and transparency in regional activities; equality between all members; democracy in decision making; and independence when dealing with other regions. We accept all members on their own merits, and hold that everyone can contribute to the region in their own way, to provide a richer and more fulfilling NS experience for all.

Why not stop by for a visit?

Please, no fascists.
