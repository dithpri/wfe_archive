[b][i]Welcome to Felden Grove, heroes![/i][/b]

This ancient forest is a refuge from the surrounding nuclear fire enveloping the world. Ghor has come here to relax and be one with the Wyld while the Apocalypse happens to everyone else, not realizing that the land will be delivered from this hell soon enough. For although he is a powerful mage, Ghor is a child at heart and in mind as well and he is severely frightened.

Whichever Clan scores the most points here will calm Ghor down and gain a powerful ally, along with this region! HAPPY NUKE DAY!
