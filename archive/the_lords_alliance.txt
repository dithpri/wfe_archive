The Lords&#39; Alliance (TLA) is a mainly democratic region supporting civil liberties and political freedom, we strive to change the world for the better. Founded in 2020, elections for government positions in the region are held regularly. As leaders of this world we have a responsibility to change it for the better. Because of this, while we have only one appointed delegate, the delegate will be part of a council that makes decisions unanimously on the issues of the world assembly.
