[b]LEGAL NOTICE OF SECURITY CONTRACT VOID[/b]
[hr]
Regional claim of security from [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]Osiris[/region], and [region]The Ragerian Imperium [/region] has been made VOID due to the following issues:
[i]*False claims that no one connected to raiders has entered the region
*False claims that Minister of Regional Security can prevent raids
*Failure to keep a founder[/i]
[hr]
Due to failure to meet terms of security issued upon regional founding, it is my joy to inform you that your regional rights are now VOID. As you missed in the fineprint, VOIDing the contract requires all members to submit to questioning by the raiding lawyers.
