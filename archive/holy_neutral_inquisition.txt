&amp;quot;Our ideology of neutrality is key to the identity of our region. Without it, we are nothing&#151;a region with no standard, no identity. With it, we are everything. Neutrality, tolerance, and acceptance. That is what makes The East Pacific unique. If we lose our neutrality, we lose our very identity.&amp;quot; - Ramaeus Montresor
