                  -Everyone&#146;s life is governed by an internal code of conduct. Some call it morality. Others call it religion.                                               But Bros in the know call this holy grail the Bro Code. Historically a spoken tradition passed from one generation to the next. By                      upholding the tenets of this sacred and legendary document, any dude can learn to achieve Bro-dom.
