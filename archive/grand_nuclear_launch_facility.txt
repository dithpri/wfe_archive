The Grand Nuclear Launch Facility is a small continent dedicated to nuclear missile silos, with multiple nation-states taking individual ownership of each the 20,000+ nuclear warheads currently stored there. They have collectively invented and produced a market for the diplomat-away, an acid spray used to repel diplomats and nuclear technology experts so that they don&#39;t have to answer to the World Congress (who they believe to be their direct antagonists). If one wants to live where &quot;nuclear force authorized&quot; is the phrase most commonly used by government officials, or is simply looking for a great place to strike up rich as a mercenary, then the Grand Nuclear Launch Facility is for you.
