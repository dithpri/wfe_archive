The region is a magical chaos where reality itself is unstable. The inhabitants of Invertereon face three constant existential threats:

Unstable Magic: Fragments of land float and the laws of physics are distorted.

Waves of Zombies: The rupture event awakened a plague of undead (&quot;The Pale Tide&quot;) that threatens to infect the surviving nations.

Dragon Threat: The mana spike in the environment attracted and awakened powerful Dragons that dominate the skies, making communication between islands extremely dangerous.

It is a land of survivors, fighting against fragmented nature, biological horror, and the fury of winged beasts.
