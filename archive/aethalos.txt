Set on Aethalos during the waning years of the Age of Darkness, 134 years after the Fall of the Auzorian Empire, your nation stands on the precipice of a new age, an Age of Dawn. As technology continues to advance and magic slowly withers away, will your nation stubbornly resist change and cling to the ways of old or will you embrace the Dawn, becoming a power to be reckoned with? 

Aethalos is a fantasy-based region.
