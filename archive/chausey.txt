[b]After dinner I take a walk alone. The tide is as high as I&#146;ve seen it, water lapping determinedly at the shore. It may be the wine, but there&#146;s something ethereal about the night, a strange stillness in the air. The 19th-century chapel looks like a 2D cut-out, moonlit against a star-studded sky. There&#146;s no one else around. All is quiet, bar the eternal motion of the dark, dark water, the world beneath it a closely guarded secret.[/b]
