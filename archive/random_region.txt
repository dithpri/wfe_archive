When the zombie apocalypse begins, all members are required to either research a cure or kill off the zombies. Siding with the zombies will result in being removed from the region until the end of the event. [b]Curing the zombies is preferred, but feel free to exterminate them. Curing may even destroy the infection all together.[/b]
