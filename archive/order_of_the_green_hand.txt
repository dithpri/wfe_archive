[colour=green]The Order of the Green Hand is a knightly order dedicated to protecting the Earth from extinction. Our main aim is to raise awareness in NationStates about the growing threat of extinction of life on Earth.

The name has been taken from the book series A Song of Ice and Fire.

Every member of this region will be addressed as knights and will get the title of &quot;Ser&quot; before their name (following the Westerosi custom).[/colour]
