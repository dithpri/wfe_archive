Welcome to the [color=red]Communal Confederacy[/color]!!! The [color=red]CC[/color] is an alliance of nations bent on [b]spreading the revolution[/b]. What revolution you ask? Nobody knows. Not even our founder. 

If you&#146;re a little confused, then you&#146;re off to a good start, because you&#146;re going to be confused a lot during your time in the Communal Confederacy. The Communal Confederacy is all about wondering, and often your wondering won&#146;t result in you figuring out a clear answer, and you&#146;ll discover that the wondering is often the end product.
