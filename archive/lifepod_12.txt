[i]I&#39;m not really a doctor. I know that&#39;s what my ID says, but I never have been. Cheated the medical exams. What does a doctor these days need to know about manually resetting bones? When was the last time a top surgeon actually cut someone open? That&#39;s what the robots are for!

Doctors these days read diagnoses off of computer readouts. For that, I&#39;m perfectly qualified.[/i]
