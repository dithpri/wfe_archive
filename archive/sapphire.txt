Welcome to Sapphire!
Our region is one that is built heavily upon history and lore, countless petty land disputes, and a never ending war between the forces of Good versus random Soviet Union stand-ins. This region isn&amp;#39;t set to any specific time period, so you&amp;#39;ll get a little taste of everything here. If you wish to join Sapphire, shoot a telegram to the current delegate, [nation]The Sarudin[/nation] and ask for the password. [nation]Registug[/nation] is our regional Cartographer and Historian, and he can be contacted for questions regarding our timeline or regarding map edits. Thanks for stopping by!
