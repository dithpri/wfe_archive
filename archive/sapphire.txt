[i]October 19, 2013

At major update this morning, The Black Hawks, the Sekhmet Legion of Osiris, Lone Wolves United, Pantheon, and the [violet] syndicate raided [region]Sapphire[/region]. This raid of a region that incorrectly thought it was protected behind a password displaced a native Delegate who had been in place for 758 days and had 7 endorsements. Word has it that the raid confounded defenders who were prepared for the raid but came up empty when they didn&#39;t have the superior intelligence gathering skills of The Black Hawks. Nonetheless, it&#39;s good to see that defenders do in fact still exist and we look forward to their liberation attempts.[/i]
