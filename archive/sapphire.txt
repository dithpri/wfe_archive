The region has participated in a number of wars, including four separate counter-terrorism campaigns. Including the 4th AGA Uprising, various regional forces have fought in two extra-regional conflicts.
Recent tensions within the region have led to one armed conflict (fought largely at sea and in the air) and resulted in buffering demilitarised zones on the regional map.
