Welcome to Corporate Heaven, Welcome to Hell for the common person!

We are setting up RP and other games for members.
A gathering for Corporate States, Corporatist States, Extremely Capitalist States and any combination of these or similar at heart. 

Roleplay is encouraged and to be based of Shadowrun loosely. Think of mega-corporations that control a nation with an ineffective national government. That is the nation for RP. Trying to transition the founding nation that way.
