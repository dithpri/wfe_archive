Just a bunch of smart people making our way in a dumb world. We are people of culture, both popular and niche, who just want to have fun shaping the fictional world of tomorrow. Anybody is welcome to join provided that they eat food and have read at least one book in their lifetime. We hope to one day use our political power to force everybody to eat food, and even in extreme cases, drink water.
