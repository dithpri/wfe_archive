In insisting it&#39;s a political simulation, NS ignores its reality as a political simulation [i]game[/i]. Games have boundaries, and modern roleplaying games have safety tools, such as Session 0, X-Card, Wrap-up Meeting, etc. NS has neither boundaries nor safety tools, leaving it stuck as a badge-collecting pay-to-win where causticness is excused as &quot;character,&quot; griefing/raiding is &quot;just politics,&quot; new players learn venom from the examples set by veterans, and F7 is more courteous than General Assembly.
