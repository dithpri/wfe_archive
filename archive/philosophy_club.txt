      During the turmoil of Belli Scientiam, four intellectuals, each of a school of thought entirely of their own, decided to unite into a single conglomerate. Their goal was to create a land free of the tyranny of conformity and precedent. For eight months they toiled to gain land and followers to liberate from such tyrannies, and on the 25th of May, now known as &quot;Libertas Opinionis&quot; Day.
      Now the Region upholds its standards of acceptance and free will, with each member there is a unique history and set of beliefs. The original founders include Libertatem Animi.
