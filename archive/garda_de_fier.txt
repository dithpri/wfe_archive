[region]Garda De Fier[/region] is a stalwart defender of the faith and dedicated to the protection and liberation of Christian regions across Nationstates. We are a signatory of the [region]Berlin Pact[/region], an agreement between sovereign nationalist regions to stand against common foes in mutual support in time of war. We promote Christian Fascism, traditional family model and structure, condemn deviant lifestyles and interracial relationships as immoral and against our Christian values, and condemn those that support Bolsheviks, Anarchists, Holy Cross Deniers, and other threats to a nation&#39;s or region&#39;s ethnic unity.
