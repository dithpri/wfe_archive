Carter serves as a loosely-regulated location for foundling nations to gain their footing in the world. Anyone who is not ready to found their own region or does not want to reside in a region under the influence of a dictator or authoritarian leader may peacefully and freely exist in Carter, devoid of oppression. It is helpful for one to learn the basics of participating in regional politics without the pressure of having one&#39;s say swept away by the overpowering number of nations that inhabit other regions.
