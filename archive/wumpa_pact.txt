Deep within the heart of Wumpa, an authoritarian regime cloaked in shadows, a pact of mutual interest has been forged with the self-governing state of TSG (The Superior Germans). At its helm, the indomitable figure of Charlie, an authoritarian ruler who mirrors the autocrats&#39; iron-fisted approach, wields absolute power over TSG. This clandestine alliance bolsters the autocrats&#39; grip on power, extending their reach and enforcing their oppressive policies throughout Wumpa.
