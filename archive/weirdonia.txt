Another of [nation=short]Manitoulin[/nation]&amp;#39;s group of Allied Regions, referred to as [region=Royal Alliance] (because [nation=short]Royal House of Windsor[/nation] is my main caretaker nation) or by several other names over the years because of our former Invader/Defender status. We no longer participate in either or any WA functions. We collect regions, and operate thousands of puppets throughout the game. This region and the Alliance in General is not affiliated with [region=The Royal Alliance] (if it still exists), [region=True North] (and it&amp;#39;s affiliated regions and puppets) or the many other puppet holders in this game.[/color][color=800000]
