[list]Note:[list][hr][I]It seems that at least one moron has taken exception to us using the American Stars and Stripes as our regional and national flag. To remedy that, and ignoring the moron really was not an issue as we planned to change the flag anyway, we&amp;#39;ve decided to adopt a Nordic Cross styled flag to replace all of our United States styled flags, and this may take some time to achieve, but it will be done.[/I][hr][/list][/list][/color]
