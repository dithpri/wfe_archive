Replacement for the NS United Nations, which has fallen to pieces in recent weeks. I, [nation]Neo Mockellia[/nation], am asking for all regions to send official and active ambassadors to the NSUA. 

OUR FORTHCOMING TARGETS

To get 20+ regions involved, and to create a peacekeeping force to defend member regions.

[b]NOW OPEN!!! AMBASSADORS MAY JOIN, BUT REGIONS WON&amp;#39;T BE RECOGNIZED UNTIL THEY FINISH THE MEMBER REGION APPLICATION[/b]
