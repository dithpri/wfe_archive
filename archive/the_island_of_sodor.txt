Hello. Welcome to the Island of Sodor, the wonder place where all the steam locomotives are still alive today. Sodor also has some diesel locomotives as well. Sodor is an island in between Great Britain and the Isle of Man.

We&#39;re accepting locomotive fans and Thomas the Tank Engine fans. We accept other people, too.
