Hello and welcome to The Secular Union, a region dedicated to having fair elections and banter.
We have several rules:
1. No puppet nations (owning one results in instant banjection for both the puppet and owner)
2. No direct abuse or threats (instant banjection)
3. No abuse of delegate/officer powers (put on trial with possible ejection/banjection)
4. The Delegate must have 3 more endorsements than anyone else in the region (to hopefully prevent raiding)
5. Anyone caught planning raid is put on trial

Aside from that we hope you have fun here!
