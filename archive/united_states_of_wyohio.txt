On 10/10/2015, I founded this region to gather people together, to make fun of other friend&#39;s countries, because we think they run their country wrong. Except there is no &quot;wrong way&quot; to founding a country. Government is so convoluted, that there is really only a social contract. Between people, and I want to thank you all for being here, as in the end, everything, is all about the people.
