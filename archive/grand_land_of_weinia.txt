Although our name is the Grand Land of Weinia, our Official name will be:
The Federation of Weinia.

Reason for the change is because the original Weinia, in Oh Bongan historic records, was the supercontinent that was protected and governed by a single power.  That power was the Federation of Weinia.  To revive that history, this region will be known, from now on, as the Federation of Weinia.
