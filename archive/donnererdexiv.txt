[color=#088A85][b][i]&amp;quot;Death is but a temporary inconvenience&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no time like the present, to think about the future&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Computers will advance us, yet computers will be our downfall. All in all, I will never stop using them&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;As long as there are two people on the world, no one is happy&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Question everything&amp;quot;
