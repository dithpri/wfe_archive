[color=#088A08]April 23rd, 2015, Everyone has to put tally marks on their arms and hands
to celebrate the first episode of Dr. Who in which the Silence appeared in.[/color]
[color=#088A08][b][i]EDIT:[/b][/i] People were complaining that they [i]have[/i] to put tally marks on 
themselves. I just want you to know, that this is completely voluntary. 
It is appreciated if you do, but I, nor anyone else, will make you do it.[/color]
