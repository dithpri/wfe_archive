Chernarus is a new, small and (currently) quiet region. We are open to new members (except raiders and nations with evil intent, except if it is for role-playing reasons) and welcome anybody who has interests in RPs, debates etc.

Our fledgling [url=http://chernarus.freeforums.net/forum]forum[/url] is still new and RPs are open!

We do not require you to wait for the forum just to be accepted as a member, we are not very strict in the region and you need no requirements whatsoever to join. Once you join the region, you are officially a member and once you join the forums, you&#39;re immediately allowed to post accordingly.
