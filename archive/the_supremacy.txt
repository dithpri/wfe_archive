The Supremacy is a coalition of enlightened states, focused on the creation of a peaceful and ever advancing world. It is the self assigned goal of the Supremacy to add to pre-existing knowledge, to revolutionize the care and treatment of the human body, and to fashion a better understanding of spiritual and religious truth. Any states which wish to join will be examined and judged on their ability to continue these pursuits.
