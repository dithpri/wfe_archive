Although all are welcome, this is mainly a place for ejected nations to find a [u]safe haven[/u] while they recover and find their bearings. Founded on 22 March 2013.

A region free of campaigning, raiding, roleplaying, etc. Just [u]sanctuary[/u] for as long as you need it.

[b][color=red]Feel free to make this your permanent home or just a brief resting place on your journey through NationStates.[/color][/b]

Whether you choose to socialise or keep to yourself, you are most welcome here.
