[b]Welcome, one and all![/b]
[color=purple]Tonight, two assassins from [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] thought it&#39;d be a jolly good time to host a miniature art expo of two brand-new pieces of positively [i]malicious[/i] artwork. 
As such, we are delighted to announce we have chosen your region as the venue for our pop-up art gallery! We hope you enjoy our thoughtfully-composed works while they&#39;re on display.
