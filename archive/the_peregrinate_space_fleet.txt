         Peregrinate Fleet is, as the name suggests, Peregrinate in nature. It travels throughout the universe on  mostly reusable and renewable energy sources. The main ship at the center of the fleet features a mobile wormhole generator that allows easy access to any part of the universe. The fleet is composed of 250 ships that act as the many places for people to house themselves. The main ship and sibling ships, (which are smaller but still enormous), are the size of small moons. The ships are occupied by several small nations, which are completely unrelated to the ships functions. Join the fleet today!
