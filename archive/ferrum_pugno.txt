Ferrum Pugno (meaning The Iron Fist) and its nations are all about politics, rising and conquering.

This is the same region of Ferrum Autem Piscium, but we wanted to rename it. If we had an embassy with you please accept again.

However, as any good region leader knows, in order to conquer you need allies. The Iron fist is very open to allies. Ask and you shall receive.

The Leader, Praefectus Dion, is a benevolent and considerate (perhaps not modest though :/) leader open to ideas about the government.

Elections are held once 5 have requested one. The default WA Delegate is The Empire of Fremoore.

If you have joined you are required to read the rules at:nation=praefectus_dion/detail=factbook

Welcome to The Iron Fist!
