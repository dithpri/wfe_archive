Ferrum Pugno has been attacked. We are sorry to anyone who has been ejected. Please rejoin. The ban list has been emptied. The traitor, as most of you know, is [nation]Freymoore[/nation], who acted as not only a good nation states partner, but a friend. He exploited our friendship and used my trust to make a small and reversable attack, which will now only make worse the fate of the regions we are warring with. I hope it was worth it Freymoore. You dont know who you are up against, and I am not talking about just Ferrum Pugno, but something bigger. Way bigger. You better watch your asses Freymoore and your allies, because you are dead.
