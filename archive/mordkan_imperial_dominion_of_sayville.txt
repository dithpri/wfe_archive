[color=#FF0000] [region]The Mordkan Imperial Dominion of Sayville[/region] (MIDS) was a Dominion of the Mordkan Empire and a member state of the Federation of Sayvillian Regions (FSR). The MIDS was created to establish diplomatic contact between the Mordkan Empire and the Commonwealth of Sayvillian Regions but they decided to kick out everybody except the Kingdom of Sayville and the Kingdom of West Sayville so we are at war with them now.[/color]
