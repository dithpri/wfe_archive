[b][region]National Socialist World[/region]

[region]Kassel[/region] is a city located on the Fulda River in northern Hesse, Germany. The city&amp;#39;s name is derived from the ancient Castellum Cattorum, a castle of the Chatti, a German tribe that had lived in the area since Roman times. 

In 1567, the Landgraviate of Hesse, until then centered in [region]Marburg[/region], was divided among four sons, with Hesse-Kassel becoming one of its successor states. Kassel was its capital and became a centre of Calvinist Protestantism in Germany. Strong fortifications were built to protect the Protestant stronghold against Catholic enemies. The former capital of the state of Hesse-Kassel has many palaces and parks, including the Bergpark Wilhelmsh&ouml;he, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
