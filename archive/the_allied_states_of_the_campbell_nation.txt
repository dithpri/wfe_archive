This region was for a small group of friends, formerly Invite Only, but as of June 2012, we&amp;#39;re now open to everybody. A safe haven for nations of all types. 

Featured Region of October 10th, 2012. Hooray!
We&amp;#39;ve survived every apocalypse so far!
Visitors are welcome to stay as long or as short as they like.
