Hiya!
This region was for a small group of friends, formerly Invite Only, but as of June 2012, we&amp;#39;re now open to everybody.

Do you want a place to chill out?
Want a break from the hustle bustle of the big regions?
Fleeing a psychopath delegate-dictator?
Need to hide after a botched invasion/ coup d&amp;#39;&eacute;tat?

Then you&amp;#39;re welcome here!
Feel free to pop in, leave a message, or just hang for awhile. Recruiters are welcome. Offensive posts will be deleted. Embassy requests more than welcome.

Featured Region of October 10th, 2012. Hooray!

[b]ATTENTION[/b]: We are on temporary lockdown until the zombie plague is under control. We are making significant progress. Password will be removed after zombies are eradicated. Or after the plague dies of its own accord.
