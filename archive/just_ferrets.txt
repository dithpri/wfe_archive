[color=red]Huzzah![/color] [color=blue]Huzzah![/color] [color=green]Huzzah![/color] The [color=red]Europeian[/color] [color=blue]Republican[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color] ([color=red]E[/color][color=blue]R[/color][color=green]N[/color]) has come to see some ferrets after a long day.

Being a sailor is hard work, and what&amp;#39;s better than taking a trip to see some ferrets to relax? Are there any [color=green]turtles[/color], [color=blue]krakens[/color], [color=purple]mouses[/color], or [color=orange]pandas[/color]? We really like those in Europeia...

Feel free to come check us out [url=http://s6.zetaboards.com/Europeia/index/]here[/url] and be the first ferret to enter our land.
