[b][color=00ff00]Welcome to The Land of the DuckCrocs![/color][/b]-The sole place in the world where DuckCrocs have not gone extinct.

If you are not already a resident of The Land of the DuckCrocs, you are quite welcome to join.
We are a group of mostly friendly nations always welcoming new nations. 
We may argue, but we are united as one region. Somewhat.

We are a defender region. Just ask for help and help + an embassy request is what you will receive.
