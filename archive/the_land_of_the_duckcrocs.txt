Welcome to The Land of the DuckCrocs (LoD)!- No, we are not a part of [region]The Union[/region], but we do have a defender half, [region]The Cavalry of the DuckCrocs[/region]. 
[hr]This region is meant for roleplay and learning about the ancient crocodiles. Roleplay will be set up in the near future, as will the archives on ancient crocodiles. 
[hr]Just kick back and enjoy some metaphorical internet chocolate bars for now.
