Daardus is a multilingual region accepting participation in English, German, or Dutch. Members are expected to be able to read these languages with or without the help of machine translation. Daardus is a realistic, past-tech world. The focus of Daardus is on OOC interaction and collective worldbuilding rather than IC role-play. Every two months a new issue of the [i]World Periodical[/i] (name t.b.d.), reporting on events in nations on the map, is published. With publication, those events become &quot;fact&quot; and time in Daardus skips ahead half a year. In between publication, time stands still.
