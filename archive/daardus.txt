[i]Daardus[/i] is a multilingual &quot;region&quot; (planet) accepting participation in [b]English, German, or Dutch[/b]. Members are expected to be able to read these languages with or without the help of machine translation. [i]Daardus[/i] is a [b]realistic, past-tech world[/b]. The [b]focus[/b] of [i]Daardus[/i] is on [b]OOC interaction and collective worldbuilding[/b] rather than IC role-play. Every two months a new issue of the [i][b]World Journal[/b][/i], reporting on events in nations on the official map, is published. With publication, those events become &quot;fact&quot; and time in [i]Daardus[/i] skips ahead half a year. In between publications, time stands still.
