[i]Daardus[/i] is a [b]multilingual[/b] &quot;region&quot; (planet) accepting participation in English, German, and Dutch. [i]Daardus[/i] is a [b]realistic, past-tech world[/b]. The focus of [i]Daardus[/i] is on [b]OOC interaction and collective worldbuilding[/b] more than than IC role-play. Interaction between nations is [b][u]not[/u] in real-time[/b]. Every two months a new issue of the [i][b]World Journal[/b][/i], which reports on events in nations on the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=2717262]official map[/url], is published. With publication, those events become &quot;fact&quot; and time in [i]Daardus[/i] skips ahead half a year. In between publications, time more or less stands still.
