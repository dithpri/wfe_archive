United Middle Slavia, or Zdru&#158;na Sredina Slavia as it is known in Baggo-Beggnigian, is a small collection of Slavic nations. The region is mountainous and desert filled, with some areas of temperate forests. It is remarkable that civilisation has survived in such a desolate area. The region used to be lush and green, but continued use of groundwater raised the salt level, turning on luscious forests into barren wastelands.
