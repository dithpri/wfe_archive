THE BOYS was founded by me, upon the belief that the current governments of NationStates are corrupt and unwilling to change. It is full of dictatorial regimes that preach freedom, armies that preach peace, and shameless propaganda that preaches free thought. It is not reasonable to be a part of the corrupt society that preaches such values as liberty, justice, and equality without sufficient action to back it. These are the foundational values that will be upheld by THE BOYS.
