Fascists seek to unify their nation through a totalitarian state that seeks the mass mobilization of the national community.

Fascism denounces capitalism not because of its competitive nature nor its support of private property that fascism supports; but due to its materialism, individualism, alleged bourgeois decadence, and alleged indifference to the nation. Fascism denounces Marxism for its advocacy of materialist internationalist class identity that fascism regards as an attack upon the emotional bonds of nationality and thwarting the achievement of genuine national solidarity.
