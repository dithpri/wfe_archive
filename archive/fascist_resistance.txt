This fascist region was particularly devoted to Croatian ultranationalism, specifically the kind exhibited by some Bosnian Croats during the Bosnian War. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

&amp;quot;Fascist Resistance&amp;quot; is dedicated to victims of the Yugoslav wars (1991-1995), especially the Bosnian War (1992-1995) in which genocide, mass rape, and other crimes against humanity were committed, mostly by Serbs and to a lesser degree Croats, although Bosniaks also committed atrocities. Here&amp;#39;s hoping for a stable Bosnia and Herzegovina and a friendly relationship between the three main ethnic groups!
