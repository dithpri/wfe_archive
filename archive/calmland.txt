This region was founded after a series of diplomatic disagreements and difficulties in another region that ceased to exist by dissolution.

In this region, everything is different: we do not fight for fun, but keep the peace. Here you can feel safe and not worry that someone will invade your country or apply other pressure measures. Otherwise, the regional administration will always be on the side of the truth and apply the necessary sanctions against the situation.

The delegate and founder of the region is Mikhiliya. The World Assembly Delegate, Vice Delegate and other offices are elected every month, and may not be elected for more than two terms.

Peace, comfort, Calmland.
