[color=purple]The Orange Order is a fraternal order of nations intent on protecting and pursuing the interests of our members. Our regional union prides itself on the togetherness and solidarity of a mutual supranational identity. The order takes its name from William of Orange, who fought for the people of Great Britain to retain their culture by deposing the incongruous monarch James II in 1690 at the Battle of the Boyne.[/color]
