[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] brought out some new hawks to fly about on a raid. 

We did some slow loops, drank some tea and tried on some party hats while floating along the winds.

The winds got stronger during the start, and blew us off course several times, but we found our way to your region in the end!

If you would like to fly with us, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
