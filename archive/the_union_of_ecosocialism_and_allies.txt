We are a region and community that embraces Democracy, Equality, Environmentalism, Peace, and all living things. LGBTQIA+ people and people of colour are welcome and any discrimination against both groups will be side eyed. In fact any marginalized group is welcome and will be defended from all discrimination. We are an anti-capitalist region, meaning we also aren&#39;t huge fans of Social Democrats or Liberals, however they&#39;re also welcome. https://discord.gg/PUF9TWK
