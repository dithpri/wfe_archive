[colour=#77DD77]We are a region and community that embraces Democracy, Equality, Environmentalism, Peace, and all living things. LGBTQIA+ people and people of colour are welcome and any discrimination against both groups will be side-eyed. In fact, any marginalized group is welcome and will be defended from all discrimination. We are an anti-capitalist region, meaning we also aren&#39;t huge fans of Social Democrats or Liberals, however, they&#39;re also welcome.[/colour]
