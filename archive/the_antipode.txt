Welcome to the Antipode.

The Antipode is an intergovernmental military alliance founded in 1974 by the Communarchy of Astillero. Opposing Western hegemony, the Antipode, spearheaded by the Communarchy, aims to foster camaraderie between member nations, build national and political security, and create vast economic opportunities for members. The Communarchy has enacted two enforced legislations, which are explained below.

1. All member nations must endorse the current Delegate.
2. The Queendom exercises the inalienable right to eject, strip, or remove a member of its ranking in the Antipode as it sees fit.

Cooperate with your comrades and enjoy yourself.

&#39;Lethal grand design!&#39;
