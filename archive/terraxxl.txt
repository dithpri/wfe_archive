TerraXXL is a parallel world that is similar to ours, but with some major differences in history and politics. TerraXXL has the same continents, oceans, and natural resources as our world, but its human civilizations have developed differently.
One of the most notable differences is that TerraXXL is still dominated by monarchism and fascism, two forms of government that have largely disappeared from our world.
