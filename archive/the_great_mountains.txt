The Empire of Anduvia dominated the Great Mountains for many years, until a civil war broke it into several pieces. 

1. The largest, The Republic of Turkokyrgyarmenikastan, holds most of the territory in the inhospitable mountains, and is ruled by a authoritarian but compassionate dictator. It is a communist country, but foreign business is allowed in some areas, and elections are a possibility in the future.

2. The Empire of Anduvia, now just a collection of small cities, continues with its opressive ways.

3. Sylvania occupies the lowlands in the center of the Great Mountains and, unlike the surrounding countries, embraces democracy and free market capitalism.
