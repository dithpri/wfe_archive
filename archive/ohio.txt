Welcome to Ohio, the heart of it all. Gateway to the mid-west. With the Allegheny Plateau to the east, the Cumberland Plateau to the south, the honorable state of Indiana to the west and to the north on the beautiful shores of Lake Erie. Carriers of many firearms, hunters harvesting and home to a bunch of mediocre presidents. The Birthplace of Aviation. Serving 88 Counties, 5 states, 2 countries and you.
