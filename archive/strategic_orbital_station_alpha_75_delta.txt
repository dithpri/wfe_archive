Follow the red stripe along the wall to get to the armory. The green stripe denotes the path to the crew quarters. The yellow stripe leads to the mess hall. Blue leads to the medbay. Orange leads to the airlock, which is where you go to enter the station from a transport shuttle, or where we throw you out if you&#39;re not supposed to be here.
