Aci Trezza (Sicilian: Jaci Trizza) is a small village on Sicily&#146;s Ionian coast. It lies about 10 km north of Catania and is a [i]frazione[/i] of the comune of Aci Castello. Around 5,000 people live there.

Just off the coast are the Faraglioni dei Ciclopi. According to Homer&#146;s Odyssey, these rocks were thrown by the Cyclops Polyphemus at Odysseus.

The village was also the setting for Giovanni Verga&#39;s [i]I Malavoglia[/i], considered one of the greatest Italian novels of all time.
