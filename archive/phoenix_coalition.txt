Progress will be made. We will rebuild and we will be better. A phoenix [b]always[/b] rises from its ashes, even if what burnt them was themselves. Fortunately, a small victory was the fact that those who assisted aren&#39;t welcomed here any further, they themselves were burnt and they cannot rise from their ashes They will fall and fall.. Those who didn&#39;t? You&#39;re welcomed back if you find us interesting.

You may think we won&#39;t, or it will take us months to do so, but it won&#39;t. You&#39;re weak and under the leadership of someone manipulative in many degrees. Karma always strikes the person at true fault, it just depends on whose fault outweighs.
