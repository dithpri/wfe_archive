Thank you for being in our region. It has been closed down by the Founder for an unknown amount of time to reform and bring up another region from the ashes that this current one sits in. Former members may message you and deceive you as Phoenix being the bad guy here, but if you weren&#39;t on Discord throughout the time the region has been around, you wouldn&#39;t understand. There three sides to a story. One side of BS, another side of BS, and then the truth. Oh boy, let me tell you, the truth would hurt all sides involved. It&#39;s just a point in time where you get tired of the BS and have to end it.
