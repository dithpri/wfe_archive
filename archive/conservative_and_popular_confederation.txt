[b]Territory of [region]Austria and Hungary[/region]![/b]




[region]Austria and Hungary[/region] attacked this region for one very good reason: it was a region that was not at fault and was not fascist. I fear that [region]The Red Fleet[/region] attacked it only because it was abandoned and then bragged about it. It does not attack without good reason, it is immoral!
