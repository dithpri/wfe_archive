The confederation of imperial German states was found to spread the knowledge and culture of imperial Germany and its legacy. Anyone may join our group (you do not need to be an empire kingdom or anything in between) however political correctness, anti German remarks (or pointless hate speech in general) outright anti kaiserzeit smering and attacks on German soliders or victims of expulsion is taboo and may be grounds for reprimands or punishment (or in extreme cases removal)
Feel free to discuss politics, history, culture or anything in between.
And most importantly enjoy yourself :)
HEIL KAISER DIR!!
