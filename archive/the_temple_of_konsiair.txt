[color=blue]The Legend of Konsiair[/color]

[i]Once in a region far far away,
There was a lost soul that went astray
He searched for the right place
but they all fell from grace

Now here he lies
all those goodbyes
so he could just close his eyes

And let the world go black
never going back
no more light
for all this plight

And yet here he is
For maybe someday, 
the world would be his[/i]
