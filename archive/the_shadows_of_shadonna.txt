The Shadows of Shadonna is a region of the ones who find their ways to be more corrupt and dark. For killers and thievery, death and mourning. It is a gloomy region, nothing but dark clouds and thunder storms. Rivers flow with tears and trees moan of sadness in the sad wind, and citizens stay hidden in the shadows. We are a region to be respected, our military is one of the best and we truly deserve that spot on the most wanted.
