Hell-oo, I&amp;#39;m New Matawan. And I&amp;#39;m founding a region for all the good little nations that need somewhere to turn.

This will be a roleplaying region, but not the serious, intense kind. It&amp;#39;s no fun, and it locks out younger users from playing. Creativity encourages silliness, imagination and, well... creativity! There will be a regional government to keep things running smoothly, though not until Creativity has enough members to actually set one up. We are accepting of all nations of all kinds, and don&amp;#39;t subscribe to any philosophy other than openness. We do, however, request any regions wishing to invade us to politely bug off.

If you feel like joining this region, please do so!
