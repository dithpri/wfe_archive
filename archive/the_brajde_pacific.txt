The Brajde Pacific is a sovereign maritime region situated across the central expanse of the Pacific Ocean, composed of strategic island chains, vibrant trade hubs, and protected ecological zones. Founded by The Sovereign Federation of Al-Qamar, the region was established to promote stability, economic cooperation, and naval security throughout the Pacific sphere.

The region operates under a centralized executive framework, with the World Assembly Delegate holding executive authority to ensure swift governance and coordinated regional policy. This structure allows for rapid response to diplomatic matters, economic disputes, and regional security concerns.
