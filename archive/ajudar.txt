 Ajudar is a large island off the coast of Catalonia, discovered in antiquity. The Ajudar War, in 1649, was a major turning point in the region&#39;s history. The two sides were the Catalonians and the French, and were trying to win the island for their own countries. The 7 month war was eventually won by the Catalonians, who created several new countries on the island.
