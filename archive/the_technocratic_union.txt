A Technocracy is a meritocracy where one is judged not upon superfluous things such as their race, religion, sex, or orientation, but rather what they have actually contributed to society. For example, if a shoe maker comes up with a new method of stitching leather that conserves thread, then the shoe maker would get a merit when he shared his knowledge with others.
Another change is cities would become obsolete. Replaced with Urbanates, pre-planned structures that fulfill all the needs of the people living within them.
