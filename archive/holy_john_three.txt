Everyone in this Region follows the religion of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1766698]John Three[/url], a June bug. No other rules, mainly just a region for friends to mess around in. At our peak we had amassed a total of 52 individual nations. 

Make sure to join the World Assembly (WA) and endorse our WA Delegate and Founder, [nation]Zhensheng Xue[/nation] to increase our regional power. After that, endorse our Vice Delegate (Assembly Master), [nation]The Tony Paporordia[/nation] to further strengthen our regional power. However, DO NOT make 2 accounts with the same email as you will get ejected from the World Assembly. Member nations have no endorsement cap, but raider nations have an endorsement cap of 0.

To all Delegates:
Please approve &#151;

We are open to all embassy proposals.
