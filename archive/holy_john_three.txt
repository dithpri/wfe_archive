Hello and welcome to the [region]Holy John Three[/region]!

Everyone in this Region follows the religion of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1766698]John Three[/url], a June bug. There are other [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1786440]rules[/url] that all members must read, but it&#146;s mainly just a region for friends to mess around in. At our peak we had amassed a total of 52 individual nations. 

Make sure to join the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly (WA)[/url] and endorse our WA Delegate, [nation]The Tony Paporordia[/nation] to increase our regional power. However, DO NOT make 2 accounts with the same email as you will get ejected from the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url].

We are open to all [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=region_control/region=holy_john_three#embassies]embassy proposals[/url].
