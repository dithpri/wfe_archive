[b]History &amp; Information[/b]
Founded by The Meridonsreich on the basic tenets of unity; the EAF promotes good intentions between members states, and the idea that nations stand stronger together. 
Role-play encounters are highly encouraged, but not mandatory. We will, eventually, stage wars amongst nations over land claims and politics.
The current year in alternate-history is 1935.
