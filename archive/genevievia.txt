From the northernmost corner of the known world on the Unggoy Isles, to the scorched plains of Firewind and Gilneas, the fecund lands of Archeuland and Prussia, and the contested and wartorn land of Baughistan, all the way to the southernmost Mountain Isle; stretching five thousand miles from northwest to southeast, and three thousand miles from east to west, is [b]the land of Genevievia[/b] (and many a surrounding territory and nation). Thirty some nations fill this all-too small world, and many have sought to enlarge their boundaries in many a war and many a peace treaty.
