A forgotten order of religious folk that lives by a creed, &quot;Sub Dei, libertas et iustitia omnibus&quot;, or under God, justice and liberty for all. Primarily conservative, the order is dedicated to helping others, and maintaining the most basic unit of a community, the family. We strive to maintain peace and push forward the notion the freedom of the individual to practice their human rights endowed to us by God.
