We who once stood alone, crushed by oppression and hardship, now stand united for freedom and justice.  We are the people of Ingsoc.  The hard working populace who rejected our former government&amp;#39;s tyrannical rule.  The party of Orbolistan tried to hold us down, but we shook free, and we will fight to defend that freedom.

Resolution I: The free people of Ingsoc are working to build a fair and unified government.  One of the most important aspects of this unification is a common economic basis to stand on.  Therefore, the free people of Ingsoc do declare that our regional currency will henceforth be the &amp;quot;Dollar&amp;quot;.  Please make any adjustments necessary to comply with this new law.
