[b]Right now, our little garden is small, but you can help the scarlet bloom grow and spread![/b]

A resting place.
Here, come not to dwell for your final sleep, falling into oblivion, but a quiet rest, a pitstop. 
The flowers bloom here, the grass is a scarlet red, and the flowing waters are calm and quiet.
The Gatekeeper watches over the outside world carefully, and The Tenderer spends eternity, growing their little garden to bloom.
Freedom in rest.
Those who wish for respite are accepted in, and those who help the Gatekeeper maintain the walls are integrated.
