[b]Right now, our little garden is small, but you can help the scarlet bloom grow and spread![/b]

[b][color=green]A resting place.[/color]
[color=purple]Here, come not to dwell for your final sleep, falling into oblivion, but a quiet rest, a pitstop.[/color] 
[color=orange]The flowers bloom here, the grass is a scarlet red, and the flowing waters are calm and quiet.[/color]
[color=red]The Gatekeeper watches over the outside world carefully, and The Tenderer spends eternity, growing their little garden to bloom.[/color]
[color=brown]Freedom in rest.[/color]
[color=blue]Those who wish for respite are accepted in, and those who help the Gatekeeper maintain the walls are integrated.[/color][/b]
