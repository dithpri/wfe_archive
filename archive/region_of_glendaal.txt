As President and Leader of the Democratic States of Glendaal, I hereby announce that our nation will be moving out of the North Pacific and into our own separate one. The Region of Glendaal will, as of now, be home to one country. If other nations wish to unite, we shall grant them permission unless rejected or removed by popular vote. By joining this region, you agree that you will respect our way of life, and Executive authorities will always be elected every two years, unless nobody runs or if the leader is removed by Popular vote. Thank you for reading this!
