The added feature of [b]war[/b] is something I would love included into Nationstates and it is something I have decided to incorporate into this region. The formula for this is kept secret as this is a unique thing for [b]this region only[/b]

1. Two nations [b]MUST[/b] agree that they are in war and agree what the punishment for the loser will be.
2. Then sending that information to [nation]planet x32-536[/nation] via TG.
3. A poll will be put up allowing other nations to vote for who they want to win the war.
4. Then using info from the poll and analysis of the two nations the winning nation will be calculated.
5. The punishment will be bestowed upon the losing nation.
- Any questions about the feature of war send a TG to [nation]planet x32-536[/nation]
