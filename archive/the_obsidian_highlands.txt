As its name suggests, the sometimes mountainous terrain commonly houses Obsidian below the surface. There is a sea towards the east, and one active volcano to the west. Across the north are the Zeus Mountains, and to the west are the Burning Mountains. In the south it becomes flat, almost farmland. Lakes are large but rare and there are only three major rivers.
