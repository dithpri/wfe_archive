Guided by the desire for freedom and helped by our revolutionary armed forces, [region]Dacea[/region] has become an independent region, waving the red flag at the top of the Carpathian mountains.

After the expulsion of the raxulan troops, the Dacean Soviet Socialist Republic (Dacean SSR) now unwaveringly aids the socialist cause to free more oppressed regions from the tyranny of religious imperialism.

After 61 days of cruel raxulan oppression, their patriarchat has been abolished and their churches and banners torn down. Also, in [region]Dacea[/region] the raxulan discrimination of women and non-heterosexual people has come to an end.
