[b]Regional Information:[/b]
Equilibrium is a splinter off of the former glorious &amp;#39;Gatesville&amp;#39;, and will continue on her path towards the ultimate destruction of the nefarious World Assembly.

Equilibrium will participate with HME (Raider), GoE (Defender), and Cingeta (Conquer &amp;amp; Release) in military functions, while maintaining neutrality towards each.

Please feel free to call any of them home. Gate of Evil, Holy Moosean Empire, Cingeta or here.
