[i]It&#39;s the year 1930. Just over a decade ago the world witnessed the greatest military conflict in the history of mankind &#150; The Great War, the war to end all wars. This was a long and bloody war, and ended with the young and powerful German empire, together with its allies, standing as the victors. This marked the beginning of German political, technological and cultural influence all over the world. [/i]
