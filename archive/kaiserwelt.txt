Welcome to Kaiserwelt, a casual rp region based on an alternate 20th century dieselpunk timeline.

[i]The Great War, the War that&#39;d be over by Christmas, the War that would end all wars.

Clearly, this would not be the case. After years of fighting, disease and death, the war came to an end with the signing of the treaty of Petrograd between France, Britain, Russia and Germany. And with the end of the war begun an era of absolute German colonial, political and cultural influence. For the worse, an era with even more ambitions for independence. An era of constant fighting fueled by nationalism and the ethnicities of the people fighting it.
