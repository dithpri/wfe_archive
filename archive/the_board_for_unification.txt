Greetings from The Collective For Good.

We have always stood independent, since our start in the South Pacific. We have seen many grand events pass us by, unable to shaoe the world in the way we want. That changes now. Now, we will rise. We will bring with many nations we have met along the way, who have been developing in their own right. Many are now ready to make a scene on the world stage and we wish to support them on their way to becoming more like us, a rising beacon of progress and beauty. The Collective wishes to create this space to cultivate fellow nations, who share our outlook.

Independent, we rise. Together, we soar.

Chaurtarian, independent together.
