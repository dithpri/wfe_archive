This region&amp;#39;s name is Latin for the English word &amp;quot;greatness&amp;quot;. It can also mean &amp;quot;dignity&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;majesty&amp;quot;.
This region is for all nations who have a great vision for not only their own nation, but for all other nations as well. Our common goal is to make NationStates a better place, and to oppose those who seek to ruin it.

Please join me in an effort to make a positive impact on NationStates.
