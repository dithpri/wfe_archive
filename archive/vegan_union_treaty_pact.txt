The Vegan Union Treaty Alliance (The V.U.T.P.) is a diplomatic faction made up of entirely vegan states. The V.U.T.P. aims to spread animal rights, veganism and eco-friendliness et cetera throughout the world. Together we can save animals, promote environmentalism and battle against climate change. Additionally we strongly believe in the use of renewable energy sources and we are extremely against the use of fossil fuels. We believe that all war is not justifiable in any way and we strive to solve any international feuds diplomatically and peacefully.

Soya Facon, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Vegantropilis.
