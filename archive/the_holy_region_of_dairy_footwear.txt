Think you&#39;re really righteous? Think you&#39;re pure in heart? Well, I know I&#39;m a million times as humble as thou art. I&#39;m the pious country the little Lands wanna be like. On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife. So don&#39;t be vain and don&#39;t be whiny. Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie.
