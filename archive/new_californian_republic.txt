The New Californian Republic was formed after a brutal civil war in the western portion of the United States. The young Californian Pedrois Hernandaius was enraged at President Obama&amp;#39;s decision to destroy the coal industry. Hernandaius rallied several Californians and seceded from the United States. Dale Sweigart was able to capture the county of Tucson in Arizona for Hernandaius, and he ceded the territory to the New Californian Republic. The NCR seeks to establish a foothold on northern Mexico and Oregon, while maintaining a strong presence in its capital province - Civitate in Angelorum.
