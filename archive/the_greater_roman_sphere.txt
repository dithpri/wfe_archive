Begin Dispatch:

[nation]Grand Marshal Akiko[/nation] reporting on 19 August 2020, arriving in [region]The Greater Roman Sphere[/region] under the flag of the [region]Imperial Japanese Armed Forces[/region]. Little is left of this desolate place except for the graves of fascists and the blood of our enemies. The Imperial Japanese Armed Forces seeks to rid the world of fascism and hate, being the sword of the Emperor and guard the Great Empire of Japan and her allies under the Imperial decree.

This region is now under the control of the IJAF.
