Zallaria:
&#149; Terrain: a large region located on a mountainous section of the continent and facing the sea. The population is mainly concentrated on the mountain slopes and rare valleys along the rivers
&#149; Morals: the population of the region generally considers high social stability and welfare to be important, instead of the country&#39;s self-defense forces. People are quite liberal, but adhere to order
&#149; Religions: historically, there were various religions on the territory of the region, but over time they faded into the background, giving way to science
