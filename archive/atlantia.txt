[color=397a9c][u][B]Behold Atlantia![/B][/u][/color] 

[color=397a9c][u][B]Atlantia[/B][/u][/color] is the new region for those escaping the raid of [color=397a9c][u][B]St Abbaddon[/B][/u][/color], a region that has existed since the first days of NationStates, before founders were even added to the game. We don&#39;t know if we will ever get our old region back, so we are setting up camp here. [url=](More about the St Abby situation here)[/url]

This region is founded and administered by [nation=short]Topid[/nation], the native delegate of St Abbaddon. Our regional government will be known as the [color=397a9c][b]Native Republic of St Abbaddon and Atlantia[/b][/color]. Our region will be lead by a senate, we will hold our first elections in a couple weeks. [url=](More about the Native Republic here)[/url]

[color=397a9c][u][B]Atlantia[/B][/u][/color] is a democratic defender region, we stand opposed to raiding. We support the WA Security Council!
