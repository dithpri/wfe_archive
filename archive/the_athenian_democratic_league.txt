Lily was the last region to possess this territory, as of 4/19/2018.

The Messengers of Truth usually like to retire regions, but we&#39;ve decided to try to keep this one for a little while longer since we like the name (and for other reasons).

We will continue to retire other trophy regions as we come across them, if we can. Thank you.
