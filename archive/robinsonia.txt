The Robins and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Robinsonia. During the interwar years, having rejected a federal system, the new country&amp;#39;s predominantly Robin leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Slovaks and the Ukrainians. After the WW II, a reunited but truncated Robinsonia  fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968 the country&amp;#39;s leaders tried to liberalize communist rule and create &amp;quot;socialism with a human face,&amp;quot; Robinsonia joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.
