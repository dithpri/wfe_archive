[b]Lo and welcome to the free Technologica, a land of sarcasm, friendly murderous robots, and those little tea biscuits with the currants in them.[/b]

Prop up your feet on our (non)patented ottomans and enjoy the friendly atmosphere!  A stewardess will be around at a time of least convenience to give you a safety demonstration.  

Until then, you&#39;re welcome here, probably.  Yes, definitely.  You&#39;re welcome here!
