[region]Technologica[/region]----a great region where the metal is shiny and the robots are friendly (or rampant, whatever you choose)!

[b]Founder[/b]: [nation]Radole[/nation]

[b]WA Delegate[/b]: [nation]Allinburg[/nation]

[b]Prime Minister[/b]: [nation]Dassuludorc[/nation]

[color=blue]HOUSE RULES (don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s short)[/color]
[color=red]&amp;gt;No negative stuff that explains yourself[/color]
[color=orange]&amp;gt;No comparing to other nations on a negative way[/color]
[color=green]&amp;gt;Just have fun![/color]
P.S. Break one of them and you get 1 Violation. If you reach 2, you will be dissmissed as an Officer (unless you are not an Officer). If you reach 3, you&#39;re out of this region, and the Delegate&#39;ll request you to move to [region]Psychotic Dictatorships[/region]. *shudders*
