Lo and welcome to the free Technologica, a land of sarcasm, friendly murderous robots, and those little tea biscuits with the currants in them.

Prop up your feet on our (non)patented ottomans and enjoy the friendly atmosphere! A stewardess will be around at a time of least convenience to give you a safety demonstration.

Until then, you&#39;re welcome here, probably. Yes, definitely. You&#39;re welcome here!  For it does not matter why you&#39;re here be it raider, defender, hermit, diplomat, friend or foe, there&#39;s time for fun to be had here, just don&#39;t try to be un-fun towards others.
