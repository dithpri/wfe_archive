Lo and welcome to the free Technologica, a land of sarcasm, friendly murderous robots, and those little tea biscuits with the currants in them.

Prop up your feet on our (non)patented ottomans and enjoy the friendly atmosphere! A stewardess will be around at a time of least convenience to give you a safety demonstration.

Until then, you&#39;re welcome here, probably. Yes, definitely. You&#39;re welcome here!  Just coming off our latest (up to seventh! We await our lucky number eight!) attempt at invasion!
