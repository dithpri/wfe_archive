Welcome to the Galactic Union! Founded June 3, 2015, we are a FT role-playing region. Just create a planet and go! We offer a Galactic Senate where planets can settle disputes between each other and trade with each other. We hope you like it here.

[b]Please don&amp;#39;t come here if you aren&amp;#39;t FT, but you can create a FT puppet and send that over.[/b]

Anybody can be the WA Delegate, as long as you are contributing to the region.
