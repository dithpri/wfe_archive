As humanity reached into the stars, founding their first interstellar colony on the planet of Poseidon in 2130, they found the remnants of an older, far more advanced civilization that had died millions of years ago. They learned that they were not alone in the universe, and an effort of unforeseen proportions led them to search as far as their small, primitive Live Ships would take them, desperately searching for anything that could understand the universe as humanity did. 

They found nothing, but in the process they founded many other planets, and many others split off from the control of the original human government, the United Human Planets.
