[b]This is the region exclusive to any nations whose founders hail from the world-renowned Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics (OSSM).[/b]
Founded March 10th, 2011, by some computer nerds from OSSM, this is a small area of relative stability. Only OSSM students may join, so we don&#146;t have to worry about invasions from corrupt foreign dictators.

[i]If there are any nations you believe qualify to join this region, please send a telegram to the founder, [nation]Palaeno[/nation], or the Regional Delegate.[/i]
