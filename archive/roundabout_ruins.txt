Roundabout Ruins is an ancient city. It has been abandoned, discovered, and re-built on. Through it runs the River Swings, dividing the region into Lower Roundabout, or Parkton, and Upper Roundabout, or Sandy-pit. The rules are simple: stay on your side of the River, Obey the rules of your Nation, and don&amp;#39;t venture down the wrong street into the wrong Town. Above all, Live.
