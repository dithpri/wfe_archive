Region Goal: have all 27 World Assembly government classification types in our region!
We&#39;re open to all non-invader nations and are currently seeking multiple WA members as potential WA delegates. (WA delegates are appointed by endorsement, which is limited to WA members.)

Edit: I can&#146;t join the WA as Nouveau Yathrib since I already have another nation in the WA. -Khuzifenq
