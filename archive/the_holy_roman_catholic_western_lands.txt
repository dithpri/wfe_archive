The Holy Catholic States of Lanomia hereby declares supreme power over the region of The Holy Roman Catholic Western Lands. We are a religious nation, however, we exercise free will, including speech. Any nation wishing to join must be or must become Roman Catholic. The leader does not, however, hold supreme power over religion. The Pope makes all religious decisions for the nation. We do not accept war, however we are ARMED. We welcome new nations always, as long as you accept and follow these laws. God bless all of you.
