Following the disbanding of The Coalition of Humanist Nations, several nations formed The United Coalition of Gamers to promote gaming culture and an equal and just society for all. The coalition looks down upon dictatorships and praises more liberal and eco - friendly nations. However, no nation will ever be banned for their political views, but will also never become part of the High Council (Officer) so long as they disgrace the sanctity of democracy.
