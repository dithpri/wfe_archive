Today marks a special day for our great German Empire. We are here to celebrate the remarkable accomplishments and progress we have made since the establishment of our beloved fatherland. No longer are we a divided people speaking different languages with no unity or common goals. Through hard work and dedication, we have joined together as one nation, embracing our history while looking ahead to the future. Now, with a strengthened economy, infrastructure, military, and government, our nation stands tall and proud. We celebrate our togetherness, encouraged by the ability for our industry to rise to the opportunities of growth and change.
