[b][color=red]Welcome to Wintermoore! A place full of waffles, with a lack of people and a great name.  We accept everyone, and will try to find you a spot, here in the mostly happy region we call home.  [/Color][/b]

[B][color=orange]Take part in our Regional Government and make sure to speak to our founder. Most of us are friendly and we will all happily help you by answering questions, comforting you, and offering our wisdom, even if we don&#39;t have much of it.[/color][/b]

[B][color=green]Well that&#39;s, that! Go forth and win the hunger games or kill Darth Vader or whatever it is you&#39;re into. Enjoy your trip through Wintermoore and hopefully you&#39;ll make it your long term home! (: [/Color]

[color=blue]P.S. We hope you invite your friends.[/color]
