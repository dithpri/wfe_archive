We honor Southfield&#39;s Founder.[/color][color=blue]Wintermoore[/color] [color=green]with the name and we hope to be a safe haven for all nations. No rules or government yet. So just sit here and be lazy! We do advocate for RP and have a map so just TG the leaders and we will find a spot for you. Enjoy Wintermoore.[/b][/color]
