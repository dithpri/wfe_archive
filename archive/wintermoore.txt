[b][color=blue]Welcome to Wintermoore a place where you can come and forget all your regrets, mistakes, and we have waffles! I know, we have kind of a weird name, but I was hoping this region will be full of weird and different people so let&#39;s see how it works out.[/color] [color=green]:3[/Color][/b]

[B][color=purple]Our [u][I][url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=foxilan/detail=factbook/id=843315]Government[/url][/u][/I] is a little weird but not as weird as our name. Every month, 3 people are elected to serve on the Region Council. Kind of like a city council. You must be a [u][I][url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=foxilan/detail=factbook/id=843308]Citizen[/url][/u][/I] to run or even be WA Delegate.[/color][/b]

[B][color=red]Our RP will be a Modern/Fantasy thing. That we can have cool stuff like dragons but also have a modern nation. Fun right? We can add some Post Modern into it too. A map will be made soon! And our discord is cool, invite your friends.
