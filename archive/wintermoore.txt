We have a direct democracy meaning you will vote on all resolutions in the region. We do advocate for RP and have a map so just TG the leaders and we will find a spot for you. Enjoy Wintermoore.[/b][/color]

[b][color=red]Right now, we are working on somethings like a book of resolutions and the RP itself. So go ahead, make yourself at home, and help out if you want. And if you&#39;re new and don&#39;t know how to play Nation-States yet, we will teach you![/color]
