[b][color=blue]Welcome to Wintermoore! A place full of waffles, with a lack of people and a great name. All the people (including myself) have joined [nation=short]Wintermoore[/nation] in [region]Southfield[/region], so come stop by and say hi to us! We accept everyone, and I enjoy waffles very much if you haven&#39;t noticed. [/Color][/b]

[B][color=purple]There is no longer a Government but there is a founder. Hi, I am [nation=short]Foxilan[/nation]. I will answer any questions you have and even listen to suggestions you give.[/color][/b]

[B][color=green]Well that&#39;s, that! Go forth and win the hunger games or kill Darth Vader or whatever it is you&#39;re into. I probably won&#39;t care unless waffles are involved. Like I said before, join us in Southfield, even if it is a pit stop on your long NS journey. (: 

If you speak Greek, you are the best person ever and we want you here.[/Color][/b]
