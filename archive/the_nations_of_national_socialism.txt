We have our political beliefs and you have yours don&amp;#39;t discriminate us because of our beliefs just accept us as we have accepted you. We are peaceful and don&amp;#39;t want war and aren&amp;#39;t at war but i believe war is bound to happen it is but human nature to fight even for stupid reasons. Don&amp;#39;t cross us and there will be no bloodshed.
