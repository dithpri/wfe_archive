[b]What is a Neography?[/b]
Neography is the art and craft of creating new writing systems, often called constructed scripts. They can be used for English, other languages, or even constructed languages called conlangs.
[hr][b]Why create new writing systems?[/b]
There are many practical reasons why people construct scripts, and why you might want to make your own:
1) To write secret messages without others understanding
2) To build detailed sci&amp;#8209;fi and fantasy worlds.
3) To learn about linguistics through creativity.
4) To write faster, more easily, and more compact.
5) To fix the chaos of English spelling.
6) To explore aesthetic and symbolic possibilities.
