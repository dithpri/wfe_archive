[b][color=black][region]The Ostmark[/region] was the name used by [region]The Germanic Reich[/region] from 1938 to 1942 after the Anschluss with Germany to replace that of the formerly independent Federal State of Austria or &Ouml;sterreich. &Ouml;sterreich meaning Eastern Reich.

From 1942, as the term &quot;Ostmark&quot; was still too reminiscent of the old, independent state of Austria, the chosen official name was Donau- und Alpen Reichsgaue, or Danubian and Alpine Reichsgaue. A Reichsgau was a new, simple administrative subdivision institution which replaced the federal states in the otherwise completely centralized Reich[/b][/color]
