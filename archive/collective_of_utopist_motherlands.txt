The Collective of Utopist Motherlands (CUM Union) is a loose confederation of politically divergent but historically associated, all of course being successor states to the Great Pogchamp Federation and its subsequent but short-lived autocratic Confederation of the Cat-Girl. United for defence and varying levels of economic and travel ties, the CUM Union is together a rising regional power but also a political paradox of bipartisan co-operation.
