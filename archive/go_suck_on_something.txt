The new tribal confederacy, it&amp;#39;s a number of tribes that once again decided to not war so much anymore. Since the last tribal confederation got thoroughly asswiped by the black riders, they decided to 1. Regulate the citizens of Go suck on something, and 2. Name the confederacy a little thank you message to the pesky black riders.
They have once again decided to share one leader, but they reduced the term period to 2 years. One economy, one religion, one language, all that jazz.
