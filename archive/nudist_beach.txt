Humanity originally designed and created clothing to keep themselves warmer during colder times, but nowadays things have gotten out of hand! Models for clothing, clothing with accessories, next thing you know edible clothing! See clothing has gotten out of hand! Clothing is taking over society and taking away something most precious that humans have and that is showing our gorgeous bodies that God himself created! This region was created out of the purpose of people coming together and standing up against these oppressive rags called clothes!

That is our main belief anyways, but outside the topic of clothing we accept and are open to any political ideology except for ideologies that believe in hurting other human beings like Nazism.
