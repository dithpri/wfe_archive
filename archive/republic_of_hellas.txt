Welcome to the Republic of Hellas, also known as the Hellenic Republic, Hellas, or commonly as Greece. 

With other regions of similar names under occupation by various revisionist, and invader groups, this region is open to all former native residents of Greece, and everyone who wishes to call this region home. 
Unlike those groups controlling Greece, Republic of Greece, etc, this region&amp;#39;s borders will remain open.. 

So come in enjoy some lovely ouzo, sip on a frape, and relax.
