A large, sprawling continent of large flowing rivers, and huge mountain chains, and political turmoil. Terrorist groups, dictator ships, and large areas of volcanic eruptions and landslides are all prevalent. The head delegate, Sytherias, sits atop the continent at a large island, connected to the mainland by a thin, shaky land-bridge. The rest of the continent is mainly divided by huge sprawling tundras, mountains, and the occasional volcano eruption.

This land isn&#39;t for people with weak heads.
