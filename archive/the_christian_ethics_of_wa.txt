The Christian Ethics of WA is a group focused on the sole aim of spreading the ethics of Christianity, whilst still being a regional superpower and dominating over the WA.
 
We oppose the WA for trying to establish a ONE WORLD ORDER and ONE WORLD RELIGION. 
The right to free speech and freedom of beliefs is our priority.

Our nations are exempt from the following:
(1) No nation has to follow christianity to be apart of the region
(2) Nations do not need freedom to be apart of the region (i.e Dictatorship)
(3) WIP
(4) WIP 
(5) WIP
