Germanic Midland (Otherwise just referred to as &quot;Midland&quot;) was recognized as a region in August of 2021. The area is settled in what used to be known as Central Europe. The ruins that resulted from the Great Revolt have since been inhabited by empires, republics, and other various entities. 

The region is stricken with war and internal conflict, unable to resolve its problems diplomatically due to foreign subversion. The general ideology of the people is derived from Libertarian school of thought. 

Midland was officially founded and united by The Holy Empire of Royal Liberabia, following various peace treaties.
