The Industrial Sector is a barren landscape, dotted by large factory cities, rocky crags, dry lake beds, and sandy dunes as far as the eye can see. Ruins of dead nations are scattered across this wasteland, where small bands do people eek out a living. The beasts that roam here prey on what little life exists, even eating their own kind when needed. What nations remain live behind massive walls, wary of gangs and raiders that scour the land. Time has left its mark on the people here, where water is more valuable than gold.
