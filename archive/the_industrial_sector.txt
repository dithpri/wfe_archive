The Industrial Sector is a barren landscape, stripped of its resources and dotted by massive factory-cities. Smoke belches from smoke stacks constantly, leading the Industrial Sector to be under a constant layer of smog. Animals are only carnivorous, leading to a constant cycle of a dog eat dog system. People who live here are either exceptionaly rich, or more likely, extremely poor. There are no laws to govern this world, other than the ones made by the cities themselves. Human&amp;#39;s are simply resources, often traded for something more valuable.
