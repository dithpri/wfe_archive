[color=#e71838]We are the Crimson Foxes. We are a new, small sized raiding organization that knows the secrets of these ancient lands. We are on every corner, watching. We know what occurs, we see targets. We do not rest. We are the ones who are the scourge of natives, the raider of new age. We will bring on new tactics, ones never seen before which shall help us in our bounds of conquest which have no borders. We are raiders. We are one. We shall last until our regions disbands, members leave, or cease to exist, but that..that sort of tragedy of disbandment shall not happen for a long time.[/color]
