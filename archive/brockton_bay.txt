Brockton Bay is a fictional coastal city in which most of [url=https://parahumans.wordpress.com/]Worm[/url] takes place. It houses PRT Department ENE. 

Brockton Bay is located in the north-east of the United States, north of Boston. The Atlantic Ocean borders it on the east, while mountains or hills border it on the other sides, especially to the west. The state it resides in is never mentioned.

Being a coastal city along with its surrounding geography, Brockton Bay has a fairly mild climate. The summers are comfortably warm and the winters are one of the mildest in the Northeastern States. This may be one reason people in costume congregated there.
