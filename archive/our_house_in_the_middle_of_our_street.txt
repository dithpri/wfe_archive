[b]Father wears his Sunday best
Mother&#39;s tired, she needs a rest
The kids are playing up downstairs
Sister&#39;s sighing in her sleep
Brother&#39;s got a date to keep he can&#39;t hang around
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our
Our house it has a crowd
There&#39;s always something happening
And it&#39;s usually quite loud
Our mum she&#39;s so house-proud
Nothing ever slows her down and a mess is not allowed
Our house, in the middle of our street
Our house, in the middle of our
Our house, in the middle of our street 
Our house, in the middle of our (something tells you that you&#39;ve got to get away from it)
Father gets up late for work
Mother has to iron his shirt
Then she sends the kids to school
Sees them off with a small kiss[/b][i][/i]
