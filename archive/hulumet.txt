Hulumet is a wild world, where magic is birthed through stories and powered through belief. Seven mighty Demons have dominated the world for some 777 years. However, their once insurmountable power is waning, and some whisper that it may soon ... slip.  

Wrath wreathes realms in red rivers of fiery blood,
Gluttony gurgles and groans, dragging all into the mud.
Greed gloats o&#146;er his glinting gold, bought with his soul,
Envy drags down the drowned who do not pay her toll.
Sloth seeks slumber in vain, surrounded by restless bones,
Pride putrefies, paralysed and pitiful among crumbling thrones.
Lust lingers longingly upon lovers&#146; loins, bound tight by rope,
While the people pray for the Seven&#146;s demise with desperate hope.
