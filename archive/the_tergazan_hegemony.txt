The Tergazan Hegemony was founded to provide a political home for the polities who joined the Tergazan Customs Union, and thereafter granted suzerainty to Tergaza. Tergaza itself has only exercised control over the foreign policy of it&#39;s dependent polities, preferring to allow its satellites total domestic control.
