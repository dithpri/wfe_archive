We are Federations that through the fires of revolution have been liberated from oppression. Non-federation nations are welcome too.

If you would like an office in our regional government then send a message to The Liberation Federation.

The WA Delegate is chosen based on who has the most endorsements. You must be a WA Member to receive or give endorsements to other nations in our region. If you want to be the WA Delegate then message other people asking them for their endorsement.
