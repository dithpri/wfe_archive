The Holy Roman Empire of the Palatine States is the collection of sovereign entities in personal union under the absolute monarchy of Charles XX, Holy Roman Emperor. While each state is an independent sovereign entity, they all share common foreign affairs, defence, financial and trade interests, and all aim to spread the influence of the Royal and Imperial House of Harrowstorm. The Capital Territory of the Holy Roman Empire is the Palatine Citadel, from which the Palatine States take their name.
