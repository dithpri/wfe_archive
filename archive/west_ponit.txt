Welcome to West Ponit! We&#39;re a more laid-back region with interesting things to do and decent people. Feel free to join, unless you&#39;re a spammer, raider, or other scumbag of the sort.

Join our associated forum, [url=http://politicshub.boards.net/]Politics Hub[/url]. It is a forum for historical RPs and Politik discussion, which I highly encourage all interested to join.
Update by Transfermium: [i][color=red]Yeah no, it&#39;s dead. If you want to play Dippy or something else, telegram me and I&#39;ll figure something out.[/color][/i]

For further information, look at dispatches.

PS: Oh, and try to keep the drama to a minimum, no?
