Welcome to West Ponit! We&#39;re a more laid-back region with interesting things to do and decent people. Feel free to join, unless you&#39;re a spammer, raider, or other scumbag of the sort.

Our current associated forum is [url=http://thesmallrealm.proboards.com/]The Small Realm[/url]. We encourage you to join, but it is by no means mandatory.
Update by Transfermium: [i][color=red]New forum! Anyhow, there&#39;s a Dippy game going on there.[/color][/i]

For further information, look at dispatches.

PS: Oh, and try to keep the drama to a minimum, no?
