Welcome to West Ponit! We&#39;re a more laid-back region with interesting things to do and decent people. Feel free to join, unless you&#39;re a spammer, raider, or other scumbag of the sort.

A cooperative RP, based on Operation Market Garden, will be taking place soon. [url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O9TF4AYSelVxlRPb-zpqWoY6rK8&amp;usp=sharing]Here is the map[/url].
[i][color=red]Note from [nation]Transfermium[/nation]: The RP is now on an associated forum, [url=http://politicshub.boards.net/]Politics Hub[/url],
 a new forum for historical RPs and Politik discussion, which I highly encourage all interested to join.[/color][/i]

For further information, look at dispatches.
