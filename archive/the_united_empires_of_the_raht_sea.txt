Recently, this region was left defenseless, and fell prey to some parasitic ruffians.

This region has since been reclaimed from The Black Riders. Our Founder asks that you please do your part to help this region recover from this tragedy by recruiting trusted nations and forging diplomatic relationships. Please? A special thanks goes out to those who stayed through the dark times. For their loyalty (stamina? faith? laziness?) they shall be rewarded at a later date.
