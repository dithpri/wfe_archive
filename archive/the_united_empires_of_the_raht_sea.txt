Regretfully, during a period of the Founder&amp;#39;s absence, this region was left defenseless, and fell prey to some parasitic ruffians.

This region has since been reclaimed from The Black Riders. These cowards&amp;#39; den is located [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Riders/index/]here[/url]

The team of these so-called &amp;quot;Riders&amp;quot; that gutted us like a fish consisted of:

[nation=short]Corvus Corax[/nation]
[nation=short]Gest[/nation]
[nation=short]Victor Savage[/nation]
[nation=short]Getti[/nation]
[nation=short]NoblePhnx[/nation]
[nation=short]Albioney[/nation]

May their names never be forgotten, and may we grow stronger from this experience.

Our Founder asks that you please do your part to help this region recover from this tragedy by recruiting trusted nations and forging diplomatic relationships. Seriously, please.
