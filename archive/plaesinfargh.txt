Three different worlds in one. Hot damn. Enjoy your life here in Plaesmaea -- err I mean Infestua -- scratch that, Vienfarghin. Dammit, I mean Plaesinfargh. If you don&#39;t, well that&#39;s just too damn bad, because nothing is going to change anytime soon. Previous residents of Uskos are especially welcome, and will be given a free officer position upon relocating to Plaesinfargh.

To himself, myself, and possibly others,
