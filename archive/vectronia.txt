Vectronia was founded in 1824 by Lord Thardsbury in response to a trade blockade orchestrated by various countries on the eastern seaboard. Various countries were affected, and decided to band together and share technologies. Now, Vectronia is one of the largest Commonwealths in existence, and possesses technologies and education that the rest of the world is just beginning to comprehend. They are not many though, and have less population per country than most. Most of the population is cybernetically enhanced in some way or another, and these augmentations are considered a sign of high class. Vectronia has a bright future, but needs more countries in it&amp;#39;s sphere of influence.
