[b]YOU[/b] have just danced your way into the Neverending Dance Party, where we don&#39;t really care what kind of people you are, and only care about how you groove!
-Do you move people with [color=purple][B]Dance[/B][/color]? Hey, me too!
-Do you move people with [color=red][B]Missiles[/B][/color]? Dangerous, but cool!

The list goes on when it comes to movement, but the most important principle this region promotes, is [b]FUN![/b]
Don&#39;t come here to be all [B][color=brown]SHARTY[/color][/B]... Come and join the [color=purple][i][u][B]Neverending Dance Party[/B][/u][/i][/color]!
