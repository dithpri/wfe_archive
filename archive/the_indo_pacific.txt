Mostly peaceful seas, punctuated in the austral summer by the occasional cyclone in certain parts. Rogue waves and tsunamis are another potential hazard, and of course we include the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, known for its volcanism and earthquakes... But generally an awesome place to live.

Paradisaical weather, amazing biodiversity both on land and at sea. And the chillest atmosphere to be found in this damn place.

Did I mention yet; there&#39;s plenty of space for everyone!
