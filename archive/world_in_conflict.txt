[list][b][color=#31779c]WELCOME TO THE WORLD IN CONFLICT[/color][/b][/list]

[list][list][color=#31779c][sub][b]|[/b] It&#39;s 1960, and the world is recovering from the Second World War. The United States and her allies slowly build up and prepare for the eventual demise of the Axis powers, who rule with impunity after their conquests. In Europe, there is increasing conflict inside Germany as Hitler lies on his death bed. Italy&#39;s alliance with the Spanish and Turkish is quickly dissolving over territorial squabbles between the three nations, and Japan&#39;s situation continues to worsen amidst political dissent in both it and the other nations of the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.
