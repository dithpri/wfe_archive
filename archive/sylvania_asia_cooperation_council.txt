The Sylvania-Asia Co-operation Council (SACC) is an organization committed to the unified success of its member states. These states include the Republic of Pleroma, Republic of Korea, &quot;Empire&quot; of Japan, Republic of Formosa, and the Republic of Brasil (also known as Hy-Brasil). The organization is named as such because of its member states only being a part of the continents of Sylvania and Asia. Its administrative seat rotates every 2 years between the various capitals. It was last in the capital of the Republic of Korea (Seoul), and as of the year 2020 resides in the capital of the Republic of Pleroma (the city of Ys).
