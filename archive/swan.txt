Welcome to SWAN!

SWAN stands for Southwest Allied Nations. SWAN is a new and developing region where countries are able to have their opinion voiced. We will appoint regional officers to successful and respectful nations. We will band together and trade, invade, and do anything else in unison. 

Come Join SWAN!
