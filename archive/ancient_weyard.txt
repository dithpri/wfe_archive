This region is inspired in the pre-Golden Sun series games, the four lighthouses are not lit and the Stars are kept in a secret place. We have a regional map, that is basically a blank Weyard map and any member can ask for a place.

Basically this world is created with four elements: Fire (Mars), Water (Mercury), Jupiter (Wind) and Earth ( Venus) and people who can use one of them are called adepts. Read the Golden Sun Lore if you are interested. However, this region is in an alternative Universe, so the characters, countries and events from the games don&#39;t exist here.
