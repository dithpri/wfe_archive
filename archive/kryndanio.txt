Engrish: Welcome to Kryndanio! If you have &quot;anio&quot; (or a variant of it), congratulations(!), claim your passportanio by [insert method]. If you don&#39;t it&#39;s fine, (you never really needed the passport anyway but whatever). All we want is to stay out of drama and conflict (except for internal ones). If you need any (serious) help, TG [nation]Littleanio[/nation] for it, (or [nation]Lotanio[/nation] if it&#39;s inactive.). For random QnA question, (please don&#39;t TG) ask [nation]Anio[/nation]. Thank you for even reading this in the first place, it took about 6 months to think about this [i]and it&#39;s tiring to be asked in godanio knows how many posts what this even is[/i].
