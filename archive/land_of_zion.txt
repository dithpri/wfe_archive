Welcome to the land of Zion!
Here to fight Nazis and protect secularism and freedom.

Masada will not fall again&amp;#65279;!

[b][color=blue]The national home of the Jewish people. This region is officially Zionist, so anti-Semitism (including anti-Israeli/anti-Zionist sentiments) will not be tolerated, just like all other forms of racism. We are a mostly Jewish region, but our members may also belong to any ethnic/religious group they wish.
