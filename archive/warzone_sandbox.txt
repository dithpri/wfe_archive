Following our swift campaign, this Warzone is now under the control of North Herken Armed Forces. We will try not to resort to violence, but if violence is required, we&amp;#39;ll be polite about it. NHAF extend their thanks to an ally in this operation, [nation]The Peoples Confederation[/nation] from [region]The greenlands[/region]

If you want to play an active role in the creation of a region, [region]North Herken[/region] may just be the place for you! We are a young region, but we&amp;#39;re great in every other way. Our first elections are taking place this December - it&amp;#39;s a great chance to make your mark.
