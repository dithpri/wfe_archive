[b]You did not truly think that a warzone could contend with the will of [nation=short]Evil Lord Sauron[/nation]? There are none who can. Against the power of [region]Mordor[/region] there can be no victory. We must join him, [region]Warzone Sandbox[/region]. Join with [nation=short]Evil Lord Sauron[/nation]. It would be wise, old friend.

Mordor has seized yet another warzone, all re-tags and other such nonsense are futile against the power of the ring! There can be only one. 

Join [region]Mordor[/region]. Save yourselves.[/b]
