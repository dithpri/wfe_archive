Dear whoever is reading,

Maybe one day WZSB is going to be awesome, but it isn&#39;t going to be today. At least not from me. I can&#39;t stomach actively supporting this site and I don&#39;t have the time for manual recruitment anyway. In fact my stomach is full of disappointment. I&#39;m planning to maybe stick around until some org deigns to boot me out, but I don&#39;t want to build a community on this site anymore knowing that this place I&#39;ve dedicated so much to is ultimately run by people who are just... uncaring. I&#39;d say do better but I guess I just don&#39;t care anymore either.

toodles,
Ayu
