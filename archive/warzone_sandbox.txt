[B][color=blue]Now the delegacy is empty
Let the natives take the stage
Pack it up and tear it down
They&amp;#39;re the first to come and last to leave
Working for that minimum endo count
They&amp;#39;ll set up a new gov&amp;#39;ment another time

Tonight the soldiers were so fine
They waited there in line
And when they moved into the region they made the show
And that was sweet...
But I can hear the sound
Of slamming doors and stirring natives
And that&amp;#39;s a sound they&amp;#39;ll never know[/b][/color]

[B][color=red]As the moon rose on Halloween night, [nation=short]Pauline Bonaparte[/nation] left the region. Rumor has it that next Halloween, if a virgin lights the black flame candle, she will return. If the AoI is still around in a year, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be too hard for them to fulfill the prophecy.[/b][/color]
