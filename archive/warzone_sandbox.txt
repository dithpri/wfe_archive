[i]As the sun starts to set, a few rays momentarily crest the horizon, throwing the caves before you into relief. For a moment, all that can be seen is the edges in the sand. Suddenly, one by one, oil-lamps begin to flicker, revealing just inside the caves regal, carved archways. Not many, but a few. They are alone, but they are alive, at least for a beautiful moment. 

They seem to beckon to you.[/i]
