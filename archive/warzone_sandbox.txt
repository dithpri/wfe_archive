[b][u]BREAKING NEWS: Valtarre leads worst raid ever: asked to leave raiderdom.[/b][/u]

This major, [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], [region]The Communist Bloc[/region], [region]Osiris[/region], [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]Sparkalia[/region], [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], [region]Lily[/region], and [region]Ijaka[/region] all banded together to loot, pillage, and burn regions across the MetaNationStatesVerse. 

Unfortunately, there is a limit to how many cats even the most skilled raiders can herd at once, and the resulting catfight has led us to your region.
Valtarre would like to take the opportunity to take responsibility for the cat-astrophic brawl, and will be paying for any veterinary bills incurred.
