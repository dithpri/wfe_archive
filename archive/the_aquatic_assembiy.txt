-- &quot;One Ocean, Many Voices&quot; --

The Aquatic Assembly is an international forum composed of the representatives of various underwater societies, cultures, and states. It is not limited to a set number of representatives to a political body, but rather each country may have many representatives depending on the diversity of their populous.

There should be three types of representatives: political representatives of a government, spiritual representatives of a religion, and cultural representatives of a nation. Each government, religion, and nation are limited to only ONE representative.
