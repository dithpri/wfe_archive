[i]As you discover an Anlandian territory for the first time, you see the joy of life of the inhabitants. You are carried away by this joy and decide to settle on this promising continent. [/i]
Welcome to Anlandia! A continent recently founded by [nation]Kargis[/nation]. We hope you will feel comfortable here! [region]Anlandia[/region] is more than a region: it is a community, albeit a new one, but we need it to grow with people like you. 
Here is the link to join the regional discord: https://discord.gg/
Anlandia will have to draw up a map and it would be a shame if there were only two countries, so the discord will allow to make map proposals for the region (be careful, if a country covers too much space, half the continent for example, its proposal could be rejected).
