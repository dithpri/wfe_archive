The [b]ExoSpheres[/b] are a conjunction area located  deep inside the subspace where three otherwise completely isolated extra-dimensional Civilizations are able to get access to our space-time reality. Therefor the three Empires of the [b]ExoSpheres[/b] are among the most remote and isolated Civilizations ever existed. 

There are some very limited contacts to the [region]SICON[/region]-Alliance and the [region]GDI Alliance[/region].
