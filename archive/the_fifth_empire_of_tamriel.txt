Welcome to the Fifth Empire of Tamriel!

Are you a fan of the Elder Scrolls series? You are in the right place. There is certainly a region called Tamriel Empire, which is also a very good region, but I would also like to make my Empire, or rather OUR Empire. The region is not very developed but it will become so. In the meantime, you can come to this region and tell me what needs to be improved, what is good or not, well, help me develop the region. There may also be a map.
