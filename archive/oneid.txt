[nation]Oneid[/nation] is a great empire, the pinnacle of hundreds of annexed peoples in hundreds of years under one ruler and a culture to supply the homeland. 

Imperial states have only one purpose: conquest. We also protect nations that have sought sovereignty and defense from other invading states. If one of us is attacked, he will be constituted to attack us all, and the answer will be irresistible. The system is based on a union in which all states have one ruler and the same foreign affairs, while everything else can be decided by themselves. 

The owner of all nations here is [nation]Oneid[/nation]
