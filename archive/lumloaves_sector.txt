[b]Origin[/b]
It all started years after the great fall of the TSA empire. The world was shattered and small groups of people clamored together to form small nations that will grow into the nations we see today.

It took decades of rebuilding, thousands of deaths, and millions of dollars. One man stood above all, he became the greatest international diplomat. He unified the sector and every nation remembers him as a hero. After years of arguing why Nick is the best. A small but everlasting group of friends banded together through thick and thin. They lived together in a state of peace with each other&#39;s weapons trained on one another.
