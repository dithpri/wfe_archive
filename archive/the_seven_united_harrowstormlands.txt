The Republic of the Seven United Harrowstormlands, alternatively known as the Seven United Provinces or the Harrowstormlandic Republic is the collection of 7 Provinces under the collective protection of the Harrowstorm Republic. The Republic also consists of territories directly governed by the Government in The Palatine Citadel. While some criticise the Harrowstormlands as a Monarchy, it is more accurately a Aristocratic Republic under the Presidency of the Elected King.
