(Alternate History) Welcome to the Global United Front. The year is 1921, and the world has entered a new era. After a German victory in the WeltKrieg, and the collapse of France and Russia, a new kind of conflict has been brought upon the world. A conflict not fought in gigantic battles, but in political manipulation and proxy wars. A &quot;cold war&quot;, if you will, between Germany, under the banner of the Kaiser, and Britain, waving the red flag of Marxism. We, as the Global United Front, can only hope to organize the nations of the world and let them dispute there differences diplomatically, and not on the battlefield.
