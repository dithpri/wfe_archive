Background: As the dominant industrial and maritime power of the 19th century, the United Kingdom of Great Britain played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith, the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth&amp;#39;s surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK&amp;#39;s strength seriously depleted in two World Wars.
