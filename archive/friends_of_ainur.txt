This can be a place to stay until we can return to Ainur.

Friends of Ainur is an organization working to protect the interests of Ainur, domestic and abroad. This can include anything from attending foreign cultural festivals as citizens from Ainur, helping an ally of Ainur with holding it&amp;#39;s delegacy, or working role-play or legislative ideas in Ainur.

A link to a manifesto and description will be up soon.
