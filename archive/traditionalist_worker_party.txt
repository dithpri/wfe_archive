[region]Traditionalist Worker Party[/region] is America&#146;s first political party created by and for European working families. Our mission is defending our Faith, Family, and Folk from the global capitalist system of mass immigration and anti-white &#147;anti-racism&#148;. Globalism&#39;s clear goal, as with Marxism, is the complete replacement of our people with an endless supply of alienated peoples, cut off from ties of blood, soil, religion, and identity; who can be more easily controlled and exploited by the enemy.

To combat this we need local leaders who will lead European-Americans toward a peaceful and prosperous future
