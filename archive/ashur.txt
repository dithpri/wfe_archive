The original Assyrian city and spiritual jewel. All but one of the great kings were buried at [b]Ashur[/b], from the earliest days of the [b]Assyrian Empire[/b] down to the last, no matter where the capital was located.

[i]The city of Ashur was built on a rocky limestone cliff that forced the fast-flowing Tigris into a sharp curve. The main stream was also joined by a side-arm in antiquity, so that an oval-shaped island was created with a shoreline of 1.80 kilometres (1.1 miles). Rocky outcrops rose some 25 metres (82 feet) above the valley floor, with steep sides. This naturally sheltered position had strategic importance as it made the site comparatively easy to defend, besides forming a landmark with a wide view over the valley.[/i]
