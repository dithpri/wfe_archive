This region was captured from fascist forces by [region]The MT Army[/region]. Much later it became one of [region]White Pride World Wide[/region]&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;expansion regions.&amp;quot; It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] and is now being handed back to [region]The MT Army[/region]. The Homeland will be home to people of all colors and creeds.

&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m comin&amp;#39; home, I&amp;#39;m comin&amp;#39; home, tell the world I&amp;#39;m comin&amp;#39; home.
Let the rains wash away all the pain of yesterday.
I  know my kingdom awaits, and He&amp;#39;s forgiven our mistakes.
I&amp;#39;m comin&amp;#39; home, comin&amp;#39; home, tell the world I&amp;#39;m comin&amp;#39;... home.&amp;quot; - slightly altered lyrics of &amp;quot;Coming Home&amp;quot; by Diddy - Dirty Money
