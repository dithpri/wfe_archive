[i][color=red]E.A for life![/color][/i]

[u]*This is a message from your glorious government*[/u]
First of all we would like to welcome all the nations who want to live in this Great Region.
Sadly some of our good friends and allies couldn&#39;t survive and their governments collapsed. May there nations be never forgotten.
