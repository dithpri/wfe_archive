This region is the onsite Headquarters for the Allied Forces of Kantrias. Within the walls of this fort of the storied Kantrias region, we store our armies, and discuss possible targets and battle plans.

Store any of your AFoK puppets here. They must adorn the Kantrian banner. This region is password protected, and said password will only be accessed by the AFoK and the Supreme Chancellor.

Note: Do not, under any circumstances, discuss battle plans in the RMB. The RMB should be utilized for ease of communication and for tips/help, or OOC things, though OOC chatter should be kept to a minimum. Keep battle plans to the forums and telegrams.
