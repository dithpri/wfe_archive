&quot;Comparing Vide Noir to Rainbow is like comparing a spaceship to a greyhound bus, they can take you to strange places, all that matters is where you get off.&quot;

After a few drops of Vide Noir, you found your way here. THE ASTRAL PLAIN. 

Weather your here to call upon ancient names, or follow the Emerald star, this is your home now, and this is where you will stay.

Don&#39;t get blackbrained.
