[color=teal][i]The Philippine Empire, officially the[/color] [color=aquamarine][b]Bisaya Empire of Philippine Federation[/b][/color][color=teal], is a[/color] [color=aquamarine]constitutional monarchy[/color][color=teal] and[/color] [color=aquamarine]global superpower[/color][color=teal] that gradually emerged in the late 22nd Century. Comprising[/color] [color=aquamarine]18 pioneering states[/color][color=teal], both from the home archipelago and through the greater Asian mainland, the empire unites over 1.5 billion citizens under a decentralized yet cohesive federal system. Governed by an AI-augmented but human-led bureaucracy, the Rajah of the Philippines serves as the symbolic sovereign, while the Imperial Council and regional parliaments ensure dynamic governance. Anchored in Cebu, the capital, the empire dominates trade, technology, space colonization, and diplomatic influence, shaping the 23rd-century global order.[/i][/color]
