In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious and Merciful. 

All praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of Alamin. 
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 

The Only Owner of the Day of Recompense 
You (Alone) we worship, and ask for help. 

Guide us to the Straight Path. 
The path of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray.
Quran 1:1 to 1:7
