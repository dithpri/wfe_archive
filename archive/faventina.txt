The island itself is large and is home to only one country, The Kingdom of Faventina. It is of a temperate climate, has large mountains in the middle and is very beautiful. The island boasts great infrastructure with airports, highways, cities, ports, underground railroads and roads linking every settlement, whether small or large together. A long the coast line, there are numerous natural harbors where the Faventinians have built ports, both civilian and military. There are also beaches scattered over the island&#39;s massive coastline but the majority of it is covered in steep cliffs reaching upwards from the ocean.
