A Gigantic floating landmass in orbit above the Pacific Ocean, Qwertyville is home to all that seek freedom. However, while the Founder is a kind and just person, he is NOT to be messed with, or his God-like power will smite thee....or be used to eject you, whichever is less boring.

P.S. - Trust the Funkonaut! The Funkonaut is your friend. Failure to trust the Funkonaut is treason. Treason is punishable by death!
