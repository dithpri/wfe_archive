The Region of Boldovia is home to the first seasteading nation Breakwater Bay.

Here in Boldovia we strive to maintain a happy and friendly environment for like minded people to discuss the forming of nations, living on the high seas and various other related topics.

The goal is to have a place for all sea based nation to band together and make a sure that our nations and our people can thrive while still keeping the oceans clean and free of pirates, I of course refer to modern day pirates like the ones that once tried to take of my nation and use it as their base (this was when my nation was still small and contained only 250 people).
