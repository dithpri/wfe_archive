The Empire of the Blade is a region that forms itself around two ideologies. One, that governnance should be in the hands of the people and all should have a shot at power and rank. Two, that all our member nations are free to pursue their own destiny. The goal of our region is that, regardless of your individual goals or purposes, all our member nations can live together in relative peace and harmony. 

We believe in democratic elections. While our region is new and small, all who join will have a shot at power when we inevitably set up elections as soon as we reach 15 members. Heck, those who join soon will have an even greater chance by building connections with those already here.
