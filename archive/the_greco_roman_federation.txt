Hail, and well met kinsmen. I, the Supreme Chancellor of the Speartan Republic, humbly welcome you. The Greco-Roman Federation is a beautiful land, but do not let her beauty fool you. In this Past-Tech world, all who embrace the ways of the Ancient Ones, be it Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Persian, or any form of Barbarian tribe, such as Visigoth, are welcome. All are free to join, and all are free to participate in friendly, yet destructive, RP.

If you feel yourself drawn to the life of glory on the battlefields of old, then come join us.
