We fought for the future destroyed the invader and brought to our homeland the laurels of fame - Paul Robesen
This is what people are chanting down the streets when we destroyed and crushed our fascist imperialist invaders. The Black Riders, Ayumi Hamasaki, and Winged Hussar 07. If they thought they could invade us they had another thing coming. They are fascists! 

Debout left damnes de le terre!

We are a very strong nation we annihilatiated our &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; oppressors the black riders!
