[color=red]How did it get started? After the war, our small nation struggled for a good economy, civil rights, and more. We decided to search for an union. We had no luck though. Our minister and I decided to create one on our own. Unfortunately he passed away. I finished creating it in his honor. All he wanted was a better world full of peace and love. With this union, It may become possible. [/color]
