Note from admin: Please remain respectful while in this region and be a positive influence on fellow nations. Non compliance will result in banning of being in The BRONTE Democracies. 
The Bronte admin team stress that changes may not be made unless there is approval of each member either by telegram proof or message board. It is not in the regions interest to ban people unless there is sufficient evidence that these things have not been obeyed, please don&#39;t argue with founders or any one for that matter.
