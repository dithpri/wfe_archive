Ahoy, maties. Gay Pirates is a raiding region dedicated to LGBT liberation and the LGBT community. We welcome all lesbian, gay, bi, and trans people, as well as allies. So hoist your rainbow jolly roger and prepare to have a good time, ya scalawag!

While we&#39;re a silly region and appreciate jokes, those who indulge in virulent, nasty homophobia will be banned and tutted at it. That&#39;s not fabulous, sweetie, and I will bless your heart so much.
