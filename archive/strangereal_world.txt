[color=red]Strangereal[/color] is the name of the alternate universe within which most Ace Combat games take place. 
Strangereal is almost identical to our real universe, but its version of Earth features entirely different landmasses and historical events.

&quot;[It] is a very &quot;accommodating&quot; world, so to speak. But it allows us to do it [with] a sort of sense of reality, 
it&#39;s not completely out there to the point that it doesn&#39;t seem at all realistic. It&#39;s a balance with fiction with experimental weapons and massive airship carriers.&quot;
