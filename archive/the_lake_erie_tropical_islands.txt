This long lost group of islands in the middle of Lake Erie has a tropical climate due to a freak meteorological condition and has grown tremendously due to a freak para-dimensional paradox that allows many countries as large or larger than the entire United States to easily fit within Lake Erie.

This Region was originally founded by the nation of Sammsylvania June 20th, 2003. Initially comprised of people from The University of Akron, it once contained over 40 members from all over the United States. 

Refounded by Nimzonia on January 2nd, 2022.
