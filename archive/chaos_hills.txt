You venture forward through the vivid portal locked in a forgotten basement. You&#39;re immediately met by a sinister world. You find yourself in almost complete darkness, were it not for the echoes you wouldn&#39;t even know you were underground. It&#39;s hard to take everything in in such a harsh environment, but there&#39;s so much to see.
The landscape is astonishing and you can&#39;t wait to explore it all. This world is clearly manageable, but even so you still fancy your chances in this world.
