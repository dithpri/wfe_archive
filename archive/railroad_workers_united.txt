[b][color=red]Railroad Workers United (RWU) formerly known as Railroad Operating Crafts United is a cross-union rail workers&#146; reform group[1] that was started as a result of a push by workers from the United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen to merge unions. They are now a cross-craft organization that supports all non-management railroad workers.[/b][/color]
