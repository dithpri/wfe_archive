[nation]New Central Iowa[/nation] [color=009DFF]from [/color][url=region=Thaecia][color=009DFF][b][u]Thaecia[/u][/b][/url] came today with us to train! Altys&#39; trigger sheet was a bit wacky, with them ranging from 12 seconds (he swears the site lagged) from 1 second or less. Oh and that time he didn&#39;t read he had set up a 2 minutes trigger... though he made sure to inform defenders about his mistake![/color] [url=https://discord.gg/RYgzby8][color=009DFF][b]Join Thaecia here![/color][/url][/b]
