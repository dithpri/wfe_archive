The [b]Cotton Club[/b], Harlem&#146;s most prominent nightclub during the Prohibition era, delivered some of the greatest music legends of the Jazz Age.  Some of the most iconic songs in the American songbook made their debut at the Cotton Club or were popularized in performances here.

But the story of gangster Owney Madden&#145;s notorious supper club is hardly one to be celebrated. The club enshrined the segregationist policies of the day, placing black talent on the stage for the pleasure of white patrons alone. Even the club&#146;s flamboyant d&eacute;cor made sure to remind people of these ugly admission practices.

This is the home of Harlem late night &#151; of hot jazz and illegal booze, of great music and very bad mobsters.
