Cristo is an entire world. It is one of magic, one of elves, dwarfs, halflings, gnomes and more! It goes through stages. The pre-age, before time existed, the Dark Times, a time of great malevolence, and the Industrial Age, the current age.
It is an entire realm, deeply inspired by the one we live in, just more vibrant. It exists on various planes, gods, monsters, realities, and demons. (It was originally just a D&amp;amp;D setting.)
