This is M&auml;llo&#39;s Academy. It serves as an in-between where nations can spend their time to meet the requirements of the Statute or where nations can spend time if they have been expelled from the region until they are admitted again when they meet the requirement set by the Regional Council. This essentially allows a nation to not be in another region unconnected to M&auml;llo, hence unprotected or bound to follow rules not in line with M&auml;llo&#39;s core value. 
This region hence shares the same Statute as M&auml;llo with the clause that all the points are an objective rather than binding requirements.
