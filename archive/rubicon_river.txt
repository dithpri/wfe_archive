[i]&amp;quot;The Rubicon (Latin: Rubico, Italian: Rubicone) is a shallow river in northeastern Italy, about 80 kilometres long, running from the Apennine Mountains to the Adriatic Sea through the southern Emilia-Romagna region, between the towns of Rimini and Cesena. The Latin word rubico comes from the adjective &amp;quot;rubeus&amp;quot;, meaning &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;. The river was so named because its waters are colored red by mud deposits. It was key to protecting Rome from civil war.&amp;quot;
