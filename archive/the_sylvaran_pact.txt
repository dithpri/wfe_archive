Welcome to the TSP (The Sylvaran Pact). I am the [nation]Sylvorian Republic[/nation]. We are looking for new members...take your time but consider joining the pact.


  Please Consider endorsing someone else that isnt me, I need another nation to be the WA delegate.
Also...keep conversations in the Region board as far away from topics such as sexual orientation or anything related to avoid controversy.
People who don&#39;t follow will be specifically warned either by me or by the Minister of Foreign Affairs ([nation]Har Valentiounofrist[/nation]) or by the High Security Councillor ([nation]Malsovor[/nation]).  Thank you for your attention
