The [b][region]Oort cloud[/region][/b], named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, sometimes called the &Ouml;pik&#150;Oort cloud, is a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun to as far as somewhere between 50,000 and 200,000 AU (0.8 and 3.2 ly). It is divided into two regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud (or Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud. Both regions lie beyond the heliosphere and in interstellar space.
