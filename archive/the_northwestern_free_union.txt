The Northwestern Free Union is a group of nations, kingdoms, etc. We are primarily focused on our citizens having rights to do whatever they want within reason. If it involves killing and/or harming (emotionally or physically) a citizen, then it will not be allowed. If it is a non-harmful practice, than it should be fully endorsed. We will pass international laws to protect these, but any other laws not covered would be completely up to your country.
