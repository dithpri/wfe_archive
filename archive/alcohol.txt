Depending on who was in class, resigned WA too early, or was just lazy, some of
[nation]QuietDad of TNP[/nation],
[nation]Bobberino[/nation],
[nation]Konar[/nation],
[nation]Praeceps[/nation] (who did the work),
[nation]Palutenia[/nation],
[nation]Krevt[/nation] and Dinoium (who will not tell me his name) came by to visit this region since we were bored and wanted to discourage any drinking. Don&#39;t drink. Alcohol is bad for you.

We just came by for a short visit and will be leaving soon.
