A cruise of majestic geographical features covered by an [color=pink] eternal light pink sky [/color] and nested by an [color=blue] Eriochromic blue sea [/color], the region is inhabited by nations full of freedom-loving people. Each nation abides by the rules of mutual respect and cooperation on inter-regional and intraregional goals. Fun and idleness appear to be a mainstay of the culture here, as locals welcome strangers with the local cuisine like [i]meth orang[/i], [i]edtacetate[/i], and the aptly named [i]Winkler&#146;s final breath[/i] which is to die for.
