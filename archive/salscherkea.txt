Anyway, [region]Salscherkea[/region] is founded by me, [nation]Ardenswije[/nation], your [b][color=cyan]local racing driver![/color][/b]
[hr]
Salscherkea is a nice place to rest your feelings, or, like me, do a few laps around the track! Grab the headphones and telemetry with you, and start the day in this region! Or just chillin&#39; around, and talk with the other folks in this region!
[hr]
If you happens to be a WA member, then we&#39;re in need of people like [b]YOU[/b]! (Anyway, please, join the WA!)
[hr]
Also, there is [color=blue]a RP region for you[/color], [region]The Workshop[/region], for all of your role-playing activities!
