The Old Lyme National Congress came about from a small band of recently discovered racial countries were in the midst of a series of feudal wars. After several years, when all the fighting had subsided, the countries stopped to look around them...The world was changing right before their eyes and they needed to figure out a way to catch up. They signed a pact, The Old Lyme Treaty, to stop the violence and cooperate. Soon other nations saw this as an opportunity and joined them. The OLNC still grows today, gathering more and more nations over time.
