[b][color=darkblue]&amp;quot;It was the dawn of the third age of mankind &#150; ten years after the Earth-Minbari War.

The Babylon Project was a dream, given form. Its goal: to prevent another war, by creating a place where humans and aliens can work out their differences peacefully. It&amp;#39;s a port of call &#150; home away from home &#150; for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers.

Humans and aliens, wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal . . . all alone in the night.

It can be a dangerous place, but it&amp;#39;s our last best hope for peace.

This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5.&amp;quot; [/b][/color]
