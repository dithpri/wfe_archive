Most of the landscape The Republic of &amp;quot;Congo&amp;quot; is a nearly uninhabited, rain forest, populated by silver gorillas with a thirst for blood and a lack of empathy. The silver gorillas have been known to break a man&amp;#39;s back with one blunt, animal-like swing of their giant arms, fueled by rage and animal strength and they gang up on you in groups of 11 or more.  Also there is a regular gorilla named &amp;quot;Amy&amp;quot; who communicates through sign language. For some weird reason, Amy scares the piss out of these terrifying silver gorillas, even though they quite literally outnumber her 200 to 1, and attack much bigger groups of armed humans with no hesitation. I know, it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.
