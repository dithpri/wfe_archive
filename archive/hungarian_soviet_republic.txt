The Hungarian Soviet Republic, literally the Republic of Councils in Hungary and also known as the Hungarian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was the state of Hungary from 21 March 1919 until 1 August 1919 (133 days), succeeding the First Hungarian Republic. The head of government was S&aacute;ndor Garbai from the Social Democratic Party of Hungary, but the influence of the foreign minister B&eacute;la Kun from the Hungarian Communist Party was much stronger.
