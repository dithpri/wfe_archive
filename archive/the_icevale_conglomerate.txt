The Icevale conglomerate is a conglomerate of nations, founded, created, or under the protection of Icevale Islands, the group of large islands that create a frozen area between them, at first due to a natural phenomenon, but now generated by technological means year round. The nations within the conglomerate keep their sovereignty and merely reap the benefits of protection from the Islands. The conglomerate is, for the most part a centrist group with little political bearing on its members.
