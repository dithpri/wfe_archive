Welcome to the Habitat of Misery, where the world&#39;s most uninhabitable, unpleasant, and egregiously corrupt countries reside. To join this region, you must embrace your inner dictator. All members of this region are supporters of the #BrownEarth campaign, because fresh blue water is gross, and we want to fill the sea with garbage and undo MrBeast&#39;s work. Do not enjoy your stay, because God knows you won&#39;t.

(You will be evicted if your civil rights and / or political freedoms are over &quot;some&quot;, because how can it be a dictators&#39; paradise if the people arent oppressed?)






(Yes, this is entirely a joke)
