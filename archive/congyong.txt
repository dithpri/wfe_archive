The region of Congyong is a region based on democracy.

In the city of Mancheon on 819, the people of the region signed the Treaty of Mancheon, which set up the government we have today. 

However, this is not where the region began. There is a long line of history before this, and here you can find it all. 

We are accepting of all ideologies and are always looking for new members! So feel free to join!

We are also a proud member of the FRA.
