[b]Welcome to Arthentagia[/b], a place where nations aren&#39;t oppressed by silly &quot;Regional Governments&quot;, which completely ruin the point of running your own nation. Here, you can form alliances, make enemies, and control (a lot of) the realm! There are a few rules though, but none of them prohibit RP or conquests. Those of you who want to stay neutral can trade with any nation you have access to! We have do have a voting system, which usually just decides RP events in the region. No government, good roleplay, and a great community!
