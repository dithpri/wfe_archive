Used to cry &#39;bout some crazy sh*t before
I used to feel so [B]obligated[/B] to be so much more
I used to let some [B]people[/B] tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can&#39;t be me, then what&#39;s the point? No...

I don&#39;t care about it anymore, oh
I don&#39;t care about it anymore

Now I laugh about the things that [B]used[/B] to be [B]important[/B] to me
[B]Used[/B] to have a hold on me, [B]used[/B] to have a hold on me
Like what do [i]you[/i] think
And what [i]he[/i] thinks and what [i]they[/i] think
But [i]I[/i] love me

I don&#39;t care about it anymore, oh
I don&#39;t care about it anymore

Yeah
I-I-I don&#39;t care about it anymore
I-I-I don&#39;t care about it anymore
