Lord of the Rings versus Harry Potter. Clarynland, the founder, votes for LOTR. Maguirea, the co-founder and Officer of Harry Potter business (obviously) votes for HP. Who knows what the Armed Republic of the Hudson Islands (administrative position known as Ben Coco, don&#39;t ask) votes for. That kid&#39;s kind of weird. (It&#39;s okay, Hudson Islands. We&#39;re okay with that.)
