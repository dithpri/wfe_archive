Harry Potter versus Lord of the Rings. And Band vs Strings. We like to argue in this region! Our founder, Clarynland, who also happens to be the amazing first-chair flute, meaning she votes band, prefers LOTR. Maguirea, a violinist, the co-founder and Officer of Potterheads business (obviously) votes for HP. Listen, people. We don&#39;t take NationStates very seriously. It&#39;s more of a social thing for us than anything else. Move to our region, and you can expect some, well, interesting polls and conversations. I&#39;ll tell you this, though. We have some fun.
