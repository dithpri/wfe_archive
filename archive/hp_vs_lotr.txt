Lord of the Rings versus Harry Potter. Clarynland, the founder, votes for LOTR. Maguirea, the co-founder and Officer of Potterheads business (obviously) votes for HP. The Armed Republic of the Hudson Islands (administrative position known as Representative of Potterland) votes for HP. That kid&#39;s kind of weird. (It&#39;s okay, Hudson Islands. We&#39;re okay with that.)
