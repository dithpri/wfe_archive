[color=purple]I am Mistress of the Night~The Three and the One 
I am the Moon, the  Sea, and Mother Earth 
I am all that was, and is, and ever shall be. 
I am the gentle breeze and the rain which nurtures all living things 
I am all these things and more. 
I have been with you from the beginning 
 and I shall be with you at the end of time~[/color]
