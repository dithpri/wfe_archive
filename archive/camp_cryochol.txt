[color=red]Since everybody is making a region about themselves, I suppose it&#39;s my turn[/color]

[color=blue]Homeworld region of [nation]Cryochol[/nation], blah blah blah, yada yada yada[/color]

[color=orange]Anyways, in case somebody not familiar with NS finds this nation or if this region is featured, this is not a real region in the traditional sense[/color]

[color=purple]I&#39;ll do some shameless advertising and I will recommend the following regions:[/color] 

[region]Osiris[/region]

[region]Lone Wolves United[/region]

[region]The Black Hawks[/region]

[region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region]

[color=brown]Note to fendas: Yes, these are all raider regions, yes I am biased, deal with it[/color]
