Deyrotus is a region that is quite ancient, with much history behind it. However, it was just recently discovered by archeologists. Despite Deyrotus&#146; troubled past of chaos and havoc, it is pretty chill now and you can do pretty much whatever you want as long as you don&#146;t raid us. I am an executive Founder, so if you raid us you will disappear without any explanation. 

Join Deyrotus today, and if you vote for Coarpily in the WA election you can get 25% off! (It&#146;s free I&#146;m just kidding, but not about the voting part, you should do that).

Umm so go do whatever it is you do&#133;
