Hey a reader! Look at that! Welcome to Hetalians Unite. We are a young, fledgling region with lots of untapped potential. As part of a normal democracy we hold elections, however it shall be every other year instead of a normal four year term. At this point we do not have any elected officials for we need more members and support. But you can help change this! So join? Maybe?
