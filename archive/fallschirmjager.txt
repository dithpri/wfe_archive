The [b]Fallschirmjager[/b], the German paratroopers of World War 2, made the first airborne infantry assaults in history. When Germany invaded Western Europe in 1940, the German paratroopers parachuted and landed with gliders and captured strategic positions. A year later, in May 1941, in their greatest operation, they invaded and conquered the big island Crete in the Mediterranean solely by airborne troops. &#151; [url=http://www.2worldwar2.com/fallschirmjager.htm][color=990000]Fallschirmjager[/url][/color] [hr]
