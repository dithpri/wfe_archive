I created this region because I was on the lookout for any regions whose nations roleplay around the later 1800s-early 1900s and couldn&#39;t find any. A region&#39;s leader suggested I make my own region. 

This region is set roughly in the Victorian type time period (generally late 1800s and early 1900s) and will use an alternate (not real Earth) map. I would like to get some roleplaying type stuff going within the region eventually. 

Tasks:
