Sinisterra is made up of two subregions, Terra and Sinis. Terra is run and governed by humans, with its superhuman Mythou mainly serving as guardians and vigilantes, while Sinis is dominated by warring Mythou who have mostly subjugated humanity to use as pawns in their power struggles. Only a few Sinian nations ([nation]Corazo[/nation], [nation]Santeras[/nation], and [nation]Yanhu[/nation]) are free of the widespread corruption.
