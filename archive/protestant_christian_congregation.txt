Protestant  Christian Congregation is dedicated to the teachings of Scripture, and not how &amp;quot;Mother Rome&amp;quot; see&amp;#39;s it as a &amp;quot;dead letter&amp;quot; and a church full of paganism. No, this is a region for True Bible believing Christians. I also advise everyone to visit the site, www.remnantofgod.org its a great place to learn the Word of God especially as it pertains to prophecy.
