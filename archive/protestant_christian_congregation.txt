protestant  Christian Congregation is a region dedicated to the teachings of Scripture as it is written and not how &amp;quot;Mother Rome&amp;quot; see&amp;#39;s it as a &amp;quot;dead letter&amp;quot; and a church full of pagan values. No, this is a region for the True Bible believing congregation. I also advise everyone to visit the site, www.remnantofgod.org its a great place to learn the Word of God undiluted and where the Bible is preached.

The Leader of This region is [nation]Vallakova[/nation]

No WA Delegate due to the fact we do not support a &amp;quot;One World Order&amp;quot;

The Regional Government will be set up soon.
