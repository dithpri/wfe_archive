Juneteenth (a portmanteau of June and nineteenth) is a holiday celebrating the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the United States. Originating in Texas, it is now celebrated annually on the 19th of June throughout the United States, with varying official recognition. Specifically, it commemorates Union Army General Gordon Granger announcing federal orders in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, proclaiming that all Slaves in Texas were free.
