Now, war is happening, the Zohianians are constantly nuking the Shibe&amp;#39;s force-field. We do not know how long the force-Field can last; the nuking is putting on a great light show for the shibes, in fact we can see it from Ocysmaria and and it is cool, there are so many colors. The voting on the region&amp;#39;s capitol will happen soon.
