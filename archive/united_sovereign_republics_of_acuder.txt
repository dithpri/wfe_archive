I&amp;#39;m done with you all idiots in this region. All of can do what you want, I&amp;#39;m sick of dealing with this nonsense every single day. I&amp;#39;m sick of all of you, North Libya, Archiana, Yuketobaniac, Barbradian. All of you are idiots. I try to make our GOVERMENT HAVE A POINT, and people call me a Jerk and Dumb and all that immature nonsense.

I&amp;#39;m so sick of dealing with the constant whining and complaining about simple things. Good riddance, all of you. I hope you all have fun in New Brannack.
