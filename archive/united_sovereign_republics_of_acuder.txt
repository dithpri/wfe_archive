The United Sovereign Republics of Acuder was originally founded on the 6th July 2014, but fell into decline after internal strife, and wars with [region]New Brannack[/region]. The former inhabitants had no common ideology until the last few months, when they turned either fascist or communist. A rebellion began after the previous founder&amp;#39;s government failed to prevent decline, and allowed many coups and raids to occur. After a long struggle, the Rebellion prevailed, and liberated Acuder from the totalitarian Barbradian-Free Peoples regime.
