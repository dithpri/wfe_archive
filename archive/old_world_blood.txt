A Region based in a world with 16th century technology in the Old North, where sagas were made, Vikings plundered, and Kings almost never died in bed.

Though this is a fictional land, their will be &amp;quot;Historical&amp;quot; things in it, the technology is in the Norman age, so the technology in this will be Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and Norman. The Irish are the most barbaric in our timeline, they wore less armor than all the other peoples. Guns are going to be in here, but the Irish have more limited than the Scottish &amp;amp; Normans have, due to lack of contacts. But basically our cultures are based on that.
