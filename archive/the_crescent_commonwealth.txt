Players passionate in discussion of law, morals, ethics, debate, and geopolitics are invited warmly and fear not to discuss as all debate is welcome for discussion including those of slightly more controversial topics. After all, you only provide power to that which you fear. Aftanistan is operated by multiple users but the socio-political views of these characters do not differ significantly either. We welcome those of the passive good, of justified action and of passion. Do not wear your social characteristic like a badge.
