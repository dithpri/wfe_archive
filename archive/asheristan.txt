[color=red]Hello there, and welcome to Asheristan! Asheristan is a meritocratic region guided by our Sages to do what is right, what is reasonable, and maybe slightly evil because sometimes that&#146;s what it takes. On the RMB we can talk about anything, although please keep political debates to telegramming! [/color]

[color=blue]There are three rules in Asheristan though:

-No Bullying
-No Racism, Sexism, or Homophobia
-No Spamming

Other than that, just have fun![/color]
