Welcome to Common Europe. In short, this is an alternate history Europe map, with bits of North Africa and the Middle East. All the nations of Common Europe have come together in the Aequss Concilium, an international, neutral, council, to discuss matters of international importance. Basically, it&amp;#39;s a roleplay region where nations can fight wars, make trade agreements, and vote on issues your nation would deem important. Telegram me if you want to set out land for a country or have suggestions. The Map of current nations can be found here: http://imgur.com/0fKOiVZ
