Welcome to Common Europe. In short, this is an alternate history Europe map, with bits of North Africa and the Middle East. All the nations of Common Europe have come together in the Aequss Concilium, an international, neutral, council, to discuss matters of international importance. Basically, it&amp;#39;s a roleplay region where nations can fight wars, make trade agreements, and vote on issues your nation would deem important.

NOTE: Because Nationstates Forums can be restrictive, the region as a whole has an off-site forum, found here: http://aequusconcilium.freeforums.org/.
If you want to claim land for your country, you must
1. Join the Common Europe region
2. Join the regional forums and claim land on the land survey thread
