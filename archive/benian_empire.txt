The great and glorious [region]Benian Empire[/region] was founded on [b]Ben&#39;s Day[/b] (Aug. 10, 2020) by the [nation]Islands of Ventro[/nation].

We are a Democratic Communist nation, meaning we are free and hold open elections, but share all of our resources. [b][i]The people come first![/i][/b]

Benunism is our ideology, he is our kind and benevolent leader, and watches over us all, in exchange, you must obey the laws of the region, or face ejection.

New members must make it their duty to help the region by endorsing the World Assembly Delegate ([nation]Beani[/nation]), the Communications and Border Ministers ([nation]Jeff Men[/nation]), and all other regional officers.

[b][i]For the People! For the Empire! Long Live Ben![/i][/b]
