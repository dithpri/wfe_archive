The great and glorious [region]Benian Empire[/region] was founded on [b]Ben&#39;s Day[/b] (Aug. 10, 2020) by the [nation]Islands of Ventro[/nation].

We are a Democratic Communist region, meaning we are free and hold open elections, but share all of our resources. [b][i]The people come first![/i][/b]

Benunism is our ideology, he is our kind and benevolent leader, and watches over us all, in exchange, you must obey the laws of the region, or face ejection.

New members must make it their duty to help the region by endorsing the World Assembly Delegate, the Founder [nation]Islands Of Ventro[/nation], and all regional officers ([nation]New Pontiac[/nation], [nation]The Top Hat Ducks[/nation]). Member states should be sure to vote in polls to help make the region a better place!

[b][i]For the People! For the Empire! Long Live Ben![/i][/b]
