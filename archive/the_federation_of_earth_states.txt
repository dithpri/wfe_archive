The Federation of Earth States (FES) is a federation of the remaining free, democratic states of Earth - the USA, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Sweden, Finland, South Africa, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.
Each state retains sovereignty of government, but comes under the influence of the Earth Council (EARTHCON), at which each nation is represented.
The primary purpose of the FES is to defend and extend democracy by defeating totalitarian regimes and aiding small and developing nations.
