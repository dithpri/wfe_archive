Feeders have gone too far. TWP is some stupidly large raider region now, while TNP manages to be both raiders and defenders. TEP has it&#39;s own defense program, as well as a &quot;welcome guide&quot; that pings every new nation in it. TP has some &quot;New Pacific Order&quot; which seems to be R/D as well as roleplay, super confusing. TSP was much better when [nation]Tepertopia[/nation] was delegate.

This quote was from the raid on Solidarity by The League. I do not think they realize how goofy ahh this sounds. TNP is a literal feeder.
[region]The Kerberos Collective[/region] was raided by THREE DIFFERENT PACIFIC REGIONS, all working together.
The top 12 most endorsed nations, with the exception of [nation]Kethania[/nation], are ALL FROM TNP.
