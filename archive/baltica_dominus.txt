Baltica Dominus is the region of the Baltics, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe.
Baltica Dominus historically was a very vibrant region of culture and warfare which has recently began to pacify since the People&#39;s War in 2015, which resulted in 3 million casualties on the Bali alliance and 2 million on the victorious Defence Bloc of Anarchism alliance.
