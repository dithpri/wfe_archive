The idea of Paradise is to be a place above what is this world, a place where problems and turmoil do not exist. This concept has been transformed into a place to which hopes for a calm and cool environment for those who seek a way to hangout with others, the server while strict along the basic nine rules allows for many freedoms to its members and has both experienced staff and those starting off to being something interesting rather then simple. With this being said all is fine with compliance to the rules, so feel free to kick back and enjoy, perhaps sip a cup of tea.
