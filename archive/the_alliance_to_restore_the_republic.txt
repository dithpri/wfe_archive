[b]&quot;We, the Rebel Alliance, do therefore in the name&#151;and by the authority&#151;of the free beings of the Galaxy, solemnly publish and declare our intentions:
To fight and oppose you and your forces, by any and all means at our disposal;
To refuse any Imperial law contrary to the rights of free beings;
To bring about your destruction and the destruction of the Galactic Empire;
To make forever free all beings in the galaxy.
To these ends, we pledge our property, our honor, and our lives.&quot;
&amp;#8213;Declaration of Rebellion[/b]
