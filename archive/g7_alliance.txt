&quot;The G7 is composed of many of the regions we have been so tightly tied to since our beginnings as a region and I do believe it&#146;s a wonderful pact. It&#146;s useful and straightforward for everyone involved&quot; 
&quot;The G7 provides a structure and unity between diverse regions with common goals&quot; 
&quot;This alliance is what we need around here; a unified group of regions working towards common goals. Communists beware!&quot; 
&quot;Alone, our regions are strong. Together, we are invincible&quot; 
&quot;This alliance is what we need, a more united community among ourselves. Communists better watch their backs!&quot;
