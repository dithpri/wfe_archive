
[color=blue] [b]Welcome to True New Israel, a small but diverse region that is home to a fascinating array of cultures.
The history of Israel, the Holy Land, goes back thousands of years, with the rise and fall of numerous empires and cultures. Its heart was always Jerusalem, Israel&amp;#39;s eternal undivided capital.
It is also where the Jewish people rebuilt its home, after almost 2,000 years of diaspora.[/color]
 
Jews, Christians, Muslims and all others are welcome here, and you must respect the beliefs of the inhabitants. Understand, however, that this is a Zionist region.
