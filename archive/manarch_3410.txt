The land of Manarch, where renewing will cost you $650 a month and men named Chad randomly walk into your apartment.

 Our primary means of defense is throwing rotten pumpkins at our enemies in order to defend our borders from the attacks of estranged beer bottles. 

When victories are won, exit signs are broken. 

When disputes break out, doors are shut. 

In the end, we will rise to be the strongest region in the Tri-Cities area. 

&quot;Make Manarch Lift Again&quot;

&quot;Wanna renew?&quot;

&quot;Big Time&quot;
