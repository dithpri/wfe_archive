Fibromyalgia is a chronic illness, characterized by chronic muscle pain throughout the body. Its other symptoms include:

[b]Allodynia:[/b] Pain response to non-painful stimuli
[b]Hyperalgesia:[/b] Amplified pain response to painful stimuli
[b]Brain fog: [/b]The &quot;fog&quot; of the mind that makes it hard to carry out cognitive acts

The reason for this illness is not fully known. It is thought to be autoimmune, regarding the latest scientific studies.

There is no cure. Treatments differ from person to person. Some things help some people&#39;s pain. For some people, painkillers don&#39;t even work at all.
