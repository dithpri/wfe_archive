[b]Welcome to Azathoth.[/b]

Things happens, friends come and go, life goes on. Due to events, as sole remaining citizen and of the original three founders, I am hereby declaring Azathoth out of function and closed down. You may still move your nations in to store as a puppet storage or whatever you wish, but there will be no further activity from the Regional Goverment for now. Thank you for your attention.

Azathoth is put on ice while the Founder works on other projects.
