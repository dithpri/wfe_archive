&amp;#8776;The most natural region&amp;#8776;

[color=#ff893a]&amp;#10706; [b]Originally founded by ChigaLaRiga, this region is fresh, new, and will be kept under the wing of Patunia Kingdom. The border is open, so anyone can come in. Embassy offers may be accepted. Serendipity is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for luck; more careful usage, particularly in science, emphasizes specifically &quot;finding something when looking for something else, thanks to an observant mind&quot;.
The term was virtually unknown until the 1870s, and gained currency in the early 20th century. It became popularized at mid-century, and is now widely used.[/b][/color]
