[i]City&#39;s breaking down on a camel&#39;s back
They just have to go &#39;cause they don&#39;t know whack
So while you fill the streets, it&#39;s appealing to see
You won&#39;t get undercounted &#39;cause you&#39;re damned and free
You got a new horizon, it&#39;s ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep[/i]
