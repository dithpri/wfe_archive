[b]ATTENTION ALL RESIDENTS OF SOL CONFEDERATE
[color=red]ENDORSE [/color][nation]Omniverse[/nation][/b][hr][color=purple][i][b]Welcome to the region of Sol Confederate. Feel free to stick around.[/b][/i][/color]
The Sol Confederate was once under control of the Black Hawks. however, it they lost control, and have not reconquered it as of yet. We are not the original inhabitants of this region, but we are the ones in control now, and we hope to preserve this region for posterity. To ensure the smooth running of the region, please endorse the nation specified at the top of the World Factbook Entry, which is currently [nation]Omniverse[/nation].

We request aid to keep [b]THE BLACK HAWKS[/b] out of Sol Confederate, as it appears the only reason they have not conquered us is that they are unaware they have lost control.
