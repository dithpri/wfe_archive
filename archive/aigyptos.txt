Aigyptos, a land linking northeast Africa with the Middle East, dates to the time of the pharaohs. Millennia-old monuments sit along the fertile Nile River Valley, including Giza&#39;s colossal Pyramids and Great Sphinx as well as Luxor&#39;s hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple and Valley of the Kings tombs. The capital, Alexandria, is home to Roman and Ancient Greek landmarks like the Library of Alexandria and Saint Mark&#39;s Cathedral.
