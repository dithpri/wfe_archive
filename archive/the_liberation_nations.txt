We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all citizens are created equal unless they say skibidi, that they are endowed by their founder (Mushroom Kingdom) with certain unalienable rights, among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
Our governments shall derive their just powers from consent of the governed, and whenever any government is ruling without such, it is the job of the people to alter or remove it, and to institute a new government founded on such principles.
