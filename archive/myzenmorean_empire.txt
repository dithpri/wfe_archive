We are the keepers of peace. We are the last line between barbarians and civilization. Around us, great empires fall, and others rise. One day, we shall be among the rising. We, the Myzenmorean Empire, shall liberate the world of hostilities, and unify it under one banner. If you choose to join use, we welcome you greatly. We will pledge support to you, and help you in any way possible. If you do not join us, it will not be us who vanquishes you, but the consequences of your actions.
