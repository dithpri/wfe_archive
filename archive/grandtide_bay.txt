[I] Hello new nation! [/I]

Welcome to [b] Grandtide Bay! [/b]
This is a region that I, Tidecrest, made.
I&#39;m pretty new so if you&#39;re here, joining me, I guess we can learn how to play the game of Nationstates together!

&amp;#78237; &amp;#78239; &amp;#78238; &amp;#78237; &amp;#78239;

[b]Grandtide Bay[/b] is a huge gulf found near Tidecrest, the beach of Tidecrest, if you will.

Not tainted one bit, beautiful cerulean waves across the perfect horizon as the bountiful sun rises, falls and watches.
I hope I&#39;ll eventually make a map or smth, I don&#39;t have discord so yeah... I guess TG me if you need citizenship or whatever!
