Scavengers Union is a barren wasteland where scavengers, criminals and people who don&#39;t know what to do make countries to feel powerful there are not many real countries in this area. It is a massive area with not a lot of government control and many border disputes. There are a lot of native tribes who turned more modern because of the wasteland and colonization. Many ethnic groups hold illegitimate claims to different areas of this wasteland. Many countries formed around oasis&#39;s which caused a lot of wars for more oasis&#39;s.
