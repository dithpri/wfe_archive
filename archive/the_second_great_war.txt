An alternate history world where Adolf Hitler was killed before invading Poland and thus caused the expansion of communism in europe and a massive change in history. Split from reality in 1936.

Feel free to join if you are a nation that existed in 1936 that has not been absorbed by another join nation. e.g. China, Mongolia, Tannu Tava, Finland (by the Eastern Soviet Republics). Your borders cannot be massively larger than they were in 1936, and major nations cannot have different ideologies, e.g. UK cannot be facist. Exeptions: France is communist, Spain is communist, Germany is not an extreme left or right. These rules are so that you fit into the storyline I have written and will post here at some point.
