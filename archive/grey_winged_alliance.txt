Founded by Lanessiera in response to aggression from hostile nations to the north, the Grey Winged Alliance consists of nations of all ideals. As a result, the leaders meet every day to complain about policies the other nations made which they don&amp;#39;t agree with, which usually results in nothing more than vague military threats. Despite this, any hostile actions taken against any member of the Alliance will be treated as a hostile action taken against every member of the Alliance, and will be dealt with appropriately. Exceptions exist for Telnaior, as they do not have a military and therefore relies on everyone else for protection, and Mentality, as they are so politically confused that an attacker could probably win them over anyway.[hr]Map
