[b][u]It is recommended that you read the Thrawn books - if you haven&#39;t already - to better understand the region.[/b][/u] Telegram [nation]Tigslarlowducken[/nation] or [nation]Tigslarlowducken-Clone Nation 1[/nation] (preferably [nation]Tigslarlowducken[/nation]!) for the access code for the region, as I wish to protect this region from raiders. The passcode changes each time someone joins, so do not try to re-use it.
