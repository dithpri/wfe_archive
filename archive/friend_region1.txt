region for me and friends
[B]===RULES===
1.Sort out PvP wars on the forums. Not everyone prefers to put up with it. http://forum.nationstates.net/viewforum.php?f=5&amp;amp;sid=9cdd44e7e10ee0157b1623703a46e3a9 [Do not allow anyone from outside our region to RP in the thread, specifically point that out.]
2.Nobody likes an imperialist. If you&amp;#39;re invading loads of nations, you&amp;#39;re bound to suffer a revolt and international intervention.
3.I control the time. I will be fair, however.[/B]
