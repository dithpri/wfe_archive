Well, we were raided. But, thanks to defenders, our region was saved! They were bad raiders and didn&#39;t password the region nor take off dispatches. If they did, welp, region&#39;s screwed. I&#39;ll try to make things normal in a week, on vacation. Precautions will be made to prevent raiders for now.
