Welcome! Check out our master dispatch (which is outdated in the embassy department) and have fun!

[b]****NOTICE****[/b]
1. The BiWeekly games are cancelled, as the dispatch shows. However, in the StrawBerry Hill Discord server, someone said (can&#39;t recall their name) they will try to host it in a bit!
2. We were raided a month ago. Not everything thing is normal yet, and I can&#39;t get our region flag (my nation flag) to fit the requirements.
