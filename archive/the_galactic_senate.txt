The Galactic Senate, also referred to as the Congress, is the governing body of the Galactic Republic. It consists of hundreds of senators who represent the many worlds of the galaxy, and is led by a Supreme Chancellor that is elected by and from the representatives. Its primary concern is mediating disputes between varying worlds and dictating the laws and regulations necessary to maintain the Republic.
