A magical place where there&amp;#39;s so much red, no one would change a thing, and no one would understand why you would want it to, anyway. Populated by an abundance of avians, and fugitives of the law who formed their own nation here a handful of years ago.
Also known as the borderlands of New York and New Jersey.
