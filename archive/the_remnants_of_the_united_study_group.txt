After the destruction of the The United Study Group at the hands of rebels, the survivors of the modpocalypse left for space unknown.  The Remnants of Kobol, one of the largest surviving members, started this region as a safe haven for other survivors.

This region will accept any nation that so chooses to join.  Traitors to the USGP will be treated with the utmost caution until the situation is resolved in its entirety.

Our inhabitants include:  Humans, Jaguars, and Intelligent Penguins

We salute the fallen from [region]The United Study Group[/region].  So say we all.
