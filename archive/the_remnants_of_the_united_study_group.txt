[b]After the destruction of the The United Study Group at the hands of rebels, the survivors of the Modpocalypse left for space unknown.  The Remnants of Kobol, one of the largest surviving members, started this region as a safe haven for other survivors.  Today, we fight to keep our very sovereignty intact as the Revolution threatens to spill out of hostile lands.
