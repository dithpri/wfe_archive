As the smoke billows away, we find ourselves with a blade in the back and and but a single question on our lips; why?  Though unanswerable, the damage is done and for us, this is the end.  Falling to our knees, as the dark seeps in around us and our vision fails, we sink into the cold embrace of the unknown.

I wish us all well on our future adventures, but this chapter is the last in our book.  Though we may all have sequels to write, our story here has come to a close.  Shall we meet again in the pages of another book?  Possibly.  But with these words, the final chapter in this edition comes to an end.

Good bye my friends.
