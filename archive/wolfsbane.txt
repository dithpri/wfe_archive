Welcome to the end. 

The you and a few other nations are going through a huge climate change, where the seasons and go on for years. Right now we are going through a Forever Winter. The lands are covered in snow, and the oceans are almost completely frozen in ice, thick enough to walk across. Nations are trying to gain control of each other either by, force, manipulation, or by being a peacemaking country. Right now Ninaria has taken control. Ninaria used manipulation to get to the top, it&#39;s Vice-Delegate, Hoelt, is one of Ninaria&#39;s few allies. Hoelt is trying to change the way Ninaria is leading, but since the Ninarian leader is thick headed, it&#39;s happening very slowly.
