Located in Quebec Canada, Anticosti Island sits astride the St. Lawrence River in the Gulf of the St. Lawrence. The island is the 20th largest island in Canada and is 135 miles long and between 10 and 30 miles wide. The island is designated as a Provincial Wildlife Reserve. About one and a half times the size of Price Edward Island and almost the same size as the island of Jamaica, Anticosti Island is unrivalled with its natural attributes. Rivers cut through deep canyons, limestone cliffs tower over the sea and crystal lakes dot the sub-boreal landscape.
