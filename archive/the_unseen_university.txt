The Unseen University is a magical place where dreams can come true, which is all well and good until you dream that you are being dropped off the edge of the world in the cause of astro-chelonian gender studies, or that a failed attempt to seize the position of Archchancellor has turned the librarian into a large ape (not monkey, and please don&#39;t say &quot;monkey&quot; out loud).

Death stalks the corridors, at least when he isn&#39;t taking care of his white horse, Binky. Death of Rats has given up stalking the corridors, now that all the rats have become sentient and left to practice plaguing small towns in Uberwald.

Come in, you might learn a thing or two, or you might be eaten by Bel-Shamharoth!
