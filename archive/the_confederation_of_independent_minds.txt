Congratulations to [nation]United Muthurteristan[/nation] for deftly balancing your economy with welfare spending, of which you have the highest in the region. As for [nation]JTOP[/nation], I would normally recommend you place more focus on welfare spending, of which you have the lowest in the region. However, given your surprisingly slight wealth gaps (which are in fact roughly equivalent to [nation=short]United Muthurteristan[/nation]&#39;s), congratulations to you as well! I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re doing it, but so long as your citizens are safe and happy, I am satisfied.
