Today [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to visit your regions to play with some lost kittens at the local pet shelter!

We expected to find normal animals, but instead found wild cups, dustballs, and some cute toys! Being really upstanding hawks, we like our regions tidy.

We cleaned up the your place, and as a bit of fun, left you this WFE telling you to stay hydrated and to keep your region neat and tidy!

If you would like to visit and tidy up regions with us,[url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
