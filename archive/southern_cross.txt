A frigid, beautiful mass of land and ice at the southernmost region of the world. Settled by Erubonian explorers, the Southern Cross has become the nation&amp;#39;s new homeland. It&amp;#39;s captivating beauty and striking night skies almost make up for the amount of people who freeze to death every day. This region is not for the faint of heart, and be warned: The word of Erubon is not to be defied.
