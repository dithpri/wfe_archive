[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were feeling [color=teal]Beautiful[/color], so they decided to check out a [color=teal]Candy Store[/color]. They yelled [color=teal]Freeze Your Brain![/color] while grabbing Ice Cream. This was [color=teal]Big Fun[/color], but made them feel like a [color=teal]Dead Girl Walking[/color]. Feeling a little [color=teal]Blue[/color], they bought [color=teal]Seventeen Lifeboats[/color] and set sail for the next region.
