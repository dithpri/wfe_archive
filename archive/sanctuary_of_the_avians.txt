If I could paint,
I&#146;d paint a hummingbird
Hovering in the sunlight,
Darting through the shadows,
Sipping from the sweetest flowers.

If I could write,
I&#146;d write a poem
About the hummingbird&#146;s delicate grace,
Its iridescent feathers shimmering in the breeze,
Its wings a blur of motion and magic.

If I could sing,
I&#146;d sing a song
Celebrating the hummingbird&#146;s flight,
A symphony of joy and wonder,
A melody of freedom and beauty.

But since I can only dream,
I&#146;ll close my eyes
And imagine the hummingbird,
A tiny miracle of nature,
Bringing light and love to the world.
