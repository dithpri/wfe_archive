The Imerium was shattered late in the life of its first incarnation by a brutal civil war which tore it apart, but the nation of Drominus survived. I would like to rebuild it and rebuild our reach, our industries, our army, and our people. We welcome all but if you stand in our way we will not hesitate to crush you. We are an open and free region and we want anyone to join us and help rebuild the Imperium.
