All nations that join and belong to the Swore Alliance agree not to engage in warfare with any other member nation unless a reasonable cause can be proven in which case the alliance will approve of the action and remove the first aggressor from the alliance and also eliminating any threat posed by the nation. We swore not to go to war, hence the name of the alliance. We accept nations of all cultures and respectful debate and discussion are encouraged in the regional message board.
