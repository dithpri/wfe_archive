Limbo is a friendly region for homeless nations to stay while searching for a new region. Or nations who are regionless by choice and don&amp;#39;t want to be bothered by WA-sponsorship requests or recruitment telegrams.

To find oneself in Limbo is to find oneself in a world of sheer void. You are in a realm that is spaceless, timeless, matterless, spamless. Limbo confounds the laws of physics and reason, and makes sock puppets of angels, gods and mods. All who wish to sojourn or dwell in this queer plane are most welcome, but strange things tend to happen in Limbo, so do watch your step.

Enjoy your stay!
