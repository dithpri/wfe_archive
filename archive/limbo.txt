[b]Limbo[/b] (fr. Latin [i]limbus[/i], &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;boundary&quot;) is a speculative idea about the afterlife condition of those who die in original sin without being assigned to the Hell of the Damned. Though not an official doctrine of the Catholic Church, it has been long been posited as the repose of young children who die unbaptized, and is described as a place of great [i]natural[/i] happiness albeit without the [i]supernatural[/i] happiness of the Beatific Vision.
