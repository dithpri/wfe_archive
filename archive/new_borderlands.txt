In the haze of a new dawn, refugees far from their desolate homeland seek to find shelter to rebuild their lives. The landscape is tender and crumbling in the dry heat yet the water reservoirs deep under the surface are plentiful. Political order is often misguided but the safety of the people remains a top priority. 

New Borderlands is a young region in the midst of many older ones. We welcome nations seeking refuge from their home region and those who prefer a new beginning.

Regional forums will be created soon. If you come across this region please consider making it your new home, or you may store a puppet here.
