The seventh bio-dome created as an experiment to see what would happen if humans were sent to a rural bio-dome with no recollection of their former personal lives. It has resulted in the formation of small communities and three major countries, Flatsylvania, Icelangintina, and Orlasko. This experiment has been in operation for 2030 years.
