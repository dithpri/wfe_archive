We are now in the 2nd dynasty of Mu, which began when the original founder ceased to exist and the Rulers of Mu was made to re-found the region.  Mu is no longer ruled by the Evil Doctor Lugubrious.  Mu is the new Scioly region, but all nations are welcome.  WA nations may endorse whoever they want, but raiders will receive no mercy.  Mu stands FOR the Security Council and Freedom of Speech.  Profanity is NOT ALLOWED.

[b]College Nations (you know who you are!): Only one nation!  Any more are spam and will be banjected.[/b]

The_Magikal_Genieland_of_Mu maintains a left-wing, capitalist, defender ideology despite the unfortunate shortage of WA nations.

Have fun!
