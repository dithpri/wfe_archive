Welcome to World of Boleia! 

Following rules are in place, while the legislation is being drafted:
1. RMB posts have to be in English, and connected to RP (IC/OOC).
2. RP posts cannot just be one liners. Insufficient RP will be marked as SPAM, and supressed. The events taking place in such RP will be voided. 
3. Realism is not to be taken lightly. It is supervised by [nation]Nordlandenn[/nation]
[b]Please endorse [nation]Decolorean Islands[/nation][/b]
Thank you, your regional officer team.
