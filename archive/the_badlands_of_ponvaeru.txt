The &amp;#39;TUBP&amp;#39; is a vast region made up of tribes. These tribes were seperated before the &amp;#39;Indikou-Noug&uuml;&amp;#39; tribal wars which took place between the tribes in the Indikou and Noug&uuml; regions.  The tribes in the Indikou region believed in the god Humunt. The tribes in the Noug&uuml; region believed in G&uuml;sef. The Indikou tribes formed an alliance and the Noug&uuml; also as both sides saw the other God as an imposter. They fought for hundreds of years until there were close to 2 billion casualties. The Indikou and the Noug&uuml; alliances knew it was time to stop as they had lost too many brothers and sisters to the war. The 2 regions formed into one leaving nothing but a scorched earth, and these lands are now known as the Badlands of Ponvaer&uuml;.
