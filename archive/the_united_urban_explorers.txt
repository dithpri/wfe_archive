Urban exploration or &amp;quot;UE&amp;quot; is the examination of the normally unseen or off-limits parts of urban areas or industrial facilities. Urban exploration is also commonly referred to as infiltration, although some people consider infiltration to be more closely associated with the exploration of active or inhabited sites.
As United Urban Explorers, we seek for abandoned structures and places around the world.
