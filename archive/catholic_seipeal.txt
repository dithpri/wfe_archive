The Catholic Alliance was formed when the lack of a proper Catholic region was seen. We welcome people of all religions, races, genders, and LBGTs. We do believe in the teachings of Christ though, and expect members to be respectful of each other. As a new region we want to grow and spread with the blessings of the Holy Spirit. Together we will face the dangers of the world, and through our WA delegate we will help change the world. Peace be with you.
