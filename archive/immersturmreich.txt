Welcome brothers and sisters to Immersturmreich, the Kingdom of the Eternal Storm. I, your faithful K&ouml;nig, am working on getting a forum set up. I plan to have a constitutional monarchy as a government, with a private sector where you can buy property or start a business. I also plan on starting regional role plays as soon as I get some other nations in the region. Become a citizen and vote in elections, or run for that matter. After all, what good is a K&ouml;nig without people to K&ouml;n over?
