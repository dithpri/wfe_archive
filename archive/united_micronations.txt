We are a small and new region.

[region]United Micronations[/region] gives voice to all those who want to participate.

Government:
- WA Delegate: [nation]Cashlouwna[/nation]

Legislation is pinned by despatches and is always democratically ratified and written.

We are a democratic region. But, non democratic region can also be here
Everybody is welcome.

We ask you to not do bad things in the region and specially do not argue with others. Do not desobey our law.

We ask you to endorse [nation]Cashlouwna[/nation], our WA Delegate to have a stronger region.

Everything is done via the resources offered by the game so it&#39;s easier for everyone to play.

Welcome to our democracy, welcome to the [region]United Micronations[/region]!
