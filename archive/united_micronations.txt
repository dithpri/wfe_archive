We are a small and new region.

[region]United Micronations[/region] give voice to all those who want to participate.

Government:
- President
[nation=long]Aliski[/nation].
- Vice President: [nation=long]Sibero[/nation]

Legislation is pinned by despatches and is always democratically ratified and written.

We are a democratic region.
Everybody is welcome.

We ask you to not do bad things in the region and specially do not argue with others. Do not desobey our law.

The WA Delegate has been democratically elected and is the maximum authority, any action against him will be condemned. (Electing a new WA Delegate is democratic so this is not an act against him).
