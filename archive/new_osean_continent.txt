The entire world of Strangereal has been entangled in wars ever since the start of mankind. Our nation was forged from the &amp;#39;Hope For the Unification of Strangereal&amp;quot; act, or H.F.U.S. neighboring country Osea has granted us land ownership and has allowed us to secede from them in the least hostile way possible. Multiple countries in Strangereal apply to this act which unifies the great nations of the planet. However, the &amp;quot;Strangereal United Fascist Nations&amp;quot; or S.U.F.N is the pact that goes against everything we believe in. So, in order to combat this plague, the Federal Republic of Osea has granted us a 1,256,897 square mile plot of land to bestow our nation.
