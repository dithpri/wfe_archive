The entire world of Strangereal has been entangled in wars ever since the start of mankind. Our nation was forged from the San Selinius Revolution 200 years ago. Our country is set on a huge continent in the NEO-Pacific ocean. We are on the planet Strangereal, in the same solar system as Earth, and identical culture.
