The entire world of Strangereal has been entangled in wars ever since the start of mankind. Our nation was forged from the San Selinius Revolution 200 years ago. Neighboring country Osea has granted us land ownership and has allowed us to secede from them with no anger or prejudice towards our country. The Federal Republic of Osea has granted us a 1,256,897 square mile plot of land to bestow our nation.
