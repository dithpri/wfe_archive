Kegawa is a region located around 45 degrees north latitude. It is essentially a large island divided into many countries of varying governments and people. Kegawa is largely unexplored and the people currently there want to keep it that way - unsettled. Countries joining Kegawa must agree to several environmental protection treaties because of this.
