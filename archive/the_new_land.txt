This world is comprised of a collection of countries, which I hope
All can prosper and live peacefully in this world. Any issues should
Be sorted out accordingly, and all internal issues inside of a
country will be sorted to the country&amp;#39;s wishes. The only rules are that
Any issues involving two nations should be sorted out between the two
Nations. If another country is involved, they must act according
To the affected country&amp;#39;s wishes, and no country can force another into a
Conflict that does not immediately affect the said country.
