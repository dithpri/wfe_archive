If you are LGBTQ+ this is the gay place for you. If not, it is still the gay place for you. We accept all people and allies of the LGBTQIA+ community and promote kindness and compassion. We enjoy debating about varied topics, so if you want to join a friendly debating community that is also gay but excepts anyone we are the region for you
