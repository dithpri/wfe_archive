&amp;#8658;Welcome to the MAU!
The Moderate Allied Union is exactly what it sounds like: an allied union for moderates. To classify as a moderate, you don&#39;t need to be dead center. You can be a conservative moderate, vice versa, a liberal moderate, or vice versa. Radicals not allowed. Yes, this alliance is radically moderate.
