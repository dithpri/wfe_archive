&amp;#8658;WELCOME TO THE MAU!
The Moderate Allied Union is exactly what it sounds like: an allied union for moderates. To classify as a moderate, you don&#39;t need to be dead center. You can be a conservative moderate, vice versa, a liberal moderate, or vice versa. Radicals not allowed. Yes, this alliance is radically moderate.

&amp;#8658;ATTENTION ALL FOREIGN OFFICERS:
Send in your embassy proposal! The only regions not accepted are fascist, communist, malicious invader regions, or anyone allied with them. A region who has an embassy with one of them because they want an embassy with everyone is accepted.

&amp;#8658;Border will temporarily close due to incoming zombies. Sorry for the inconvenience.
