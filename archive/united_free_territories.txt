We are a group based upon the work of Nestor Ivanovich Makhno and the Black Army. As such, we are anarchists. The founder has executive authority in order to prevent this from getting taken over by non-anarchists. The shared army of the territories, which is to only be called together when needed, is the Second Black Army, with its elite units being called the Phoenix Fleet. We believe that technology is the way to anarchism.
