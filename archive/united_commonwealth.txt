The United Commonwealth (UC) is a political and economic union of member states. The UC has developed an internal single market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one. Commonwealth policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade and regional development. For travel within the Richmont Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 2019 and will come into full force in 2020 and is composed of member states which use the Union currency.
