[color=blue]We are a republic! Being involved in government has never been easier! We allow political parties to roam North Bavaria, seeking whom they may buy over! We are not a one-party state. Our national religion is Christianity. Our official church is the [/color][color=red]Eastern Orthodox Church of North Bavaria &amp;#9766;[/color].[color=blue] Seated in the eastern hemisphere; and a sister nation to Germany, North Bavaria is the perfect place for any traditionalist and/or nationalist.[/color]
