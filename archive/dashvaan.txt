Dashvaan is a Nordic island region in the high northern hemisphere. Snow is year around in many places and the animals are fierce. Some say the region possesses a spiritual feel and that many strange things happen there. 
To the North lies the mountains of Balgruk where it is said a number of mountain tribes live that worship evil gods, mate with daemons, and even eat the flesh of men.
In  the eastern forest lie the Kemtraks, an alliance of several tribes that wish only to conquer Dashvaan and turn it into an independent nation.
Finally, in the west is the Principality of Bellaton, a number of mercenary companies that had decided to band together and settle on Dashvaan.
