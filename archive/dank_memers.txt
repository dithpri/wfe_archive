What is a dank meme?

A dank meme is a picture with text. Dank memes often involve things like &quot;ayy lmao&quot;, the gnome child from RuneScape (see flag), or are just crappy dank in general.

Dank Memers is a community of nations united in the act of preserving dank memes. Only the stronkest of nations may rise in Dank Memers.
