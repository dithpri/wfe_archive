Welcome to Wolf-Reiser, a distant solar system home to 5 different planets, each with their own types of environments! A human government coalition known as the Terran Federation controls the system to ensure that no harm comes to any of the planets, but they leave the settling nations govern themselves. Come and settle a nation, a colony, or an empire, and interact with other nations on other planets!

(This is a sci fi RP region so of course sci fi and futuristic nations and the ones that would fit in here. Although humans are the main species here, any and all species are also allowed as long as they are reasonable. A traits system is used in lieu of NS stats.)
