Welcome to [region]The States of Union[/region]
This is a place where countries come together in Union (as set by [nation]Junglelands[/nation] RIP)
We don&#39;t care what type of nation you are, as long as you are polite in the Message Board, this means no swearing but targeted offense is tolerated.
Join the World Assembly and endorse [nation]The Kingdom of Lunae et Stellae[/nation] as WA Delegate, and a reminder that multiple accounts are not allowed to join the WA, so only use one account for endorsing [nation]Lunae et Stellae[/nation]. If you want power, first endorse [nation]Lunae et Stellae[/nation] as WA Delgate and send [nation]Linglong and Melissa[/nation] a telegram as to what position you wish for and why you should have it.
