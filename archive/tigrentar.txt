The region of Tigrentar is a small landmass stretching out over the planet of the same name. Among the largest continents located here are The Baglands, Exfol, Cront&ecirc;lena, Ghlen, Fr&euml;hilvernd and Of Redenyelisch, which has permanent Executive authority here. Tigrentar was founded to give Of Redenyelisch a home of its own, but also so that strong alliances with other sovereign nations can be built, if said nations desire to move their locations. Of Redenyelisch is a newly settled area, and as such it has yet to establish its government, but it is expected that all nations within the larger region shall be treated with the same amounts of respect.
