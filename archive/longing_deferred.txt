I don&#146;t know what they are called, the spaces between seconds&#150; but I think of you always in those intervals. In the flash between moments when the world breathes in and out of being, I feel the warmth of your being having graced my life. In every space between letters, every blank page and silent moment is filled with my love and desire for you. In the quiet, behind all things I yearn to touch you and trace every gentle curve. To savor your thoughts as I know the taste of your lips sweeter than ambrosia is a desire ever beyond.
