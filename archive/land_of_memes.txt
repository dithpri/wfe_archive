We are isolationists, we prefer no contact with you lowly lifeforms.
We have evolved, to live and own on the moon.
We don&#39;t need you earthlings. 
We even have great companionships with our moon cats, which have also evolved with us.
I&#39;m sure we have some moon mice also.
But we don&#39;t have any moon cockroaches, screw you earthlings.
