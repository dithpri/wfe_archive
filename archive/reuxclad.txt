The continent is divided into two parts. To the north is the Free and Equal People of Reuxclad. They run a strict communist/meritocracy. In their eastern/port provinces The Army of Reuxclad, a militant organization that wants more freedoms (but currently runs a dictatorship) is battling for control. In the south is the United Peoples of Reuxclad, a very democratic and conservative nation run on the principals of self rule. To the west is the Kingdom of West Reuxclad, a feudal, religious, and isolationist kingdom. To the east of the United People of Reuxclad is Sittuad, a new nation that has recently gained independence.
