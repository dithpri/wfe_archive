Duskater (Traminska: Duska &#147;twilight&#148; + Ter &#147;land&#148;) is a remote microcontinental region located in the central Pacific Ocean, straddling the International Date Line. Geographically isolated and surrounded by deep oceanic trenches, Duskater occupies a unique liminal position between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, where one calendar day ends as another begins.
