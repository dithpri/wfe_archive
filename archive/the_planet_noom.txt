This is an ever growing planet comprised of asteroids that have been grappled in, nations who have detached from earth to connect with it, and, in the center, a core that is actually a nuclear fusion reactor. The original planet noom used to be a part of the earth until a terrible explosion blasted it into orbit. The reason that no one knows about said explosion is because it was so large that it ripped a hole in space-time, and therefore erased itself from time, and caused noom to have always been orbiting earth since only recently.
