Congratulations to our newest Forum Mod, Unibot III! With over ten years of experience playing NationStates across 3 main nations, we look forward to having this one-of-a-kind player as part of our team, helping to keep you safe. Be sure to give him all the appropriate condolences, commiserations, and tokens of mourning for the loss of his immortal soul.

Congratulations, Unibot III!
