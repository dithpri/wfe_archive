[color=green]Welcome to the [B]Learned Elders of Zion[/B]![/color]

A land as old as history, and a remnant of a long forgotten civilization.

Zion was once a prominent home for many, by due to the incompetence and failures of its reckless founder, Zion was left vulnerable. Now we hide, hoping, waiting. And when the time comes, we shall rise again. [hr]

[i][color=orange]May you find peace and hope wherever you go.
