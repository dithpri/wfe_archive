[color=green][B]Welcome to Zion![/B][/color]

This region was assembled in the spirit of fraternity and aid to Jewish nations. Of course, we are an open community, accepting people who are friendly to us. But one of our goals is to advance Zionism and combat anti-Semitism. We are always ready for alliances with regions which share our beliefs.

We are in the process of rebuilding our regional government. Interested in a government position? Apply for it by posting your application on the regional message board. In the meantime, please join [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=un]The World Assembly[/url] and endorse the delegate, [nation=feeder weeder].
