The Laniakea Cosmic Supercluster is home of the Laniakea Supercluster. 

The cosmic galaxy supercluster is home to the Milky Way and approximately 100,000 other nearby galaxies.

This region is founded specific to establish:

COSMIC SUPERCLUSTER GALACTIC FEDERAL RESERVE BANK:
(to establish monetary policy)

COSMIC COMMODITIES MARKET:
(to exchange commodities, products and services)

COSMIC FOREX MARKET:
(to exchange national currency)

Whereas, there is a desperate need for a commodities trade platform and a substantially fair medium of exchange especially for nations who have limited access to imports, exports, commodities, transportation and other required skills and supplies, we hereby establish these galactic markets for fair trade.
