A region with no responsibilitities or rules on how to run your nation. Just don&#39;t use foul language, but other than that have fun making a nation!



All nations that join will be given the ability to make embassies as long as they do not remove embassies.

This region will not only always be a place where nations can be free from rules and responsibilities, but also from invaders. Because only I will ever have border control and executive authorities this region is impossible to invade.
