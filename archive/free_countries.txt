Feel free to do whatever and have fun here.

If you can, try to recruit people but don&#39;t feel pressured to.

All nations who join will be immediately given power over communications, polls, and embassies. These powers will only be revoked if you spam with polls (constantly creating meaningless polls)

You may also be given higher level authority if I think you should have it (you can ask for it if you think you should by messaging me) or if you send out a poll and the vote says that the majority of regions think you should have it.

Invaders from other regions will be tolerated but will have higher level authorities made inaccessible to them.
