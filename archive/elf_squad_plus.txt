[i][b] Welcome to Elf Squad [color=green] (+) [/color] ! [/b][/i]

Founded July 17th, 2017, we are a humble community specializing in basket weaving, elections, and medieval warfare. Here in Elf Squad, we strive to maintain an appropriate level of uncertainty, while also upholding firm anti-discrimination values. Our citizens have been found to have disproportionate amounts of good luck. Unrelatedly, many practice black magic on the side. Although a small region, we have big goals, big hearts, and big trebuchets.
