[color=Bisque][u][b]Stories of The Fog![/b][/u][/color] &amp;#128128;&amp;#128591;

This is [region]nevoeiro[/region]&#39;s art season, which means you&#39;ll get to write your own original stories and share them here! Now while it is entirely up to you to decide whats going to happen in your story, the setting of said story will be pre-defined, this way we won&#39;t have any huge disconnect between all of them. The setting, which was suggested by [nation]Nova ango-bosnia[/nation] and agreed with unanimously, is: [color=Aqua]Crime City![/color]

Expect [i]bullets, bombs, knifes, heists, Etc[/i]
The action can be extreme, wacky and nonsensical if you want to, but theres is [i][b]NO[/b][/i] magic or supernatural occurrences

Let&#39;s see if letting you cook was a good idea, so go make you story!
...or don&#39;t. I&#39;m not your mom
