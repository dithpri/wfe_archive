[color=turquoise][b]Welcome to the Cergisia Assembly of Nations (CAN); where the lands are prosperous, and its peoples are particularly cultured. The C.A.N. was formed through the efforts of [nation]Krilgox[/nation], and loosely oversees ten smaller sub-regions. Each sub-region is home to nations of a particular governmental arrangement, ranging from Democracies to Dictatorships to Monarchies; though the sub-region of The Nurathenysian Empire is the only officially established sub-region with a single C.A.N. member nation residing within it: [nation]Krilgox[/nation].
