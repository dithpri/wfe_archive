[b]The Misty Swamps are a large area in the middle of nowhere. Somewhere in The Misty Swamps there are a Inn, where everyone are welcome, to either get a room for vacation or just chill. Numerous creatures lurk in the murky waters, some the size of an island others as small as a simple frog. A place for them with the most courage, or just remember to bring a gun...

Any nation (and embassies) are welcomed with opened arms, make yourselves at home.[/b]
