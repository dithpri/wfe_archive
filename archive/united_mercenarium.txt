[color=red]Military Chieftain:[nation]Confederated Mercenaries[/nation][/color]

[color=purple]All mercenaries should use this region as a HQ and Base of Operations. Plan your next military campaign here, or come here to hire mercenaries. If you are a mercenary, you can be sold here. This region is generally not a permanent settlement - just a stop-off or selling point - but any mercenary nations looking to find a home, or flag to fight for, are welcome.[/color]
