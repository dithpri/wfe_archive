[b][i]Just because you think you&#146;ve found
The system that we know ain&#146;t sound
Don&#146;t you go throwin&#146; your weight around?
No, no Joe

Now you got tanks some fair size tanks
But you&#146;re acting like a clown
Cause man we got Yanks don&#146;t mess with Yanks
And you might get caught with your tanks down

Don&#146;t go throwin&#146; out your chest
You&#146;ll pop the buttons off you vest
You&#146;re playing with a hornet&#146;s nest
No, no Joe

You know you think you&#146;re somebody we should dread
Just because you&#146;re seeing red
You better get that foolishness out of your head
No, no Joe

And you might be itching for a fight
Quit braggin&#146; about how your bear can bite
Coz you&#146;re sitting on a keg of dynamite
No, no Joe [/i][/b]
