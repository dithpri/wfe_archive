[color=green]Agora is a fun, eccentric region where we like to have fun and frolic about in the confluence. We also find it fun to eject people who try and ruin our fun. 

To avoid this, please [b]introduce yourself on the RMB[/b] and go to the [region]Customs of Agora[/region] to have your papers processed for immigration. Please see to the Immigration factbook located below for your convenience.[/color]
