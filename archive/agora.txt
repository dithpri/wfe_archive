[b]&quot;We&#39;re seriously silly, and silly about our seriousness&quot;[/b]
[hr]
[color=green]Agora is a fun, eccentric region where we like to have fun and frolic about in the confluence. We pride ourselves in our inclusiveness, openness to new ideas, and the diversity of nations we have from around the world. That being said, we are in [b]&quot;Indifference Period&quot; where we are somewhat open to outsiders.[/b][/color]

[color=blue]If you would like to join us, please move your nation to the [region]Customs of Agora[/region] to have your papers processed for immigration. Please see to the Immigration factbook located below for more information. After Customs, please [b]introduce yourself on the RMB here.[/b] We would love to get to know you.[/color]
