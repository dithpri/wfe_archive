Centered around the large landmass Nevarica, this region seeks to survive by economic strength. By uniting under a common banner, the Council of the Capitalistic Guardian Logging Megacorporation, the Technocratic Akagura, and the Socialist Wrighteland, form an unusual alliance against those that would seek to harm their lands.
The land is highly militarized, especially with the fallen land of Cobrito littering it&#39;s advanced technology across the world, and factories and space ports are commonly seen even in the furthest reaches of the land.
