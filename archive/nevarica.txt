Centered around the large landmass Nevarica, this region seeks to survive by economical and technological strength. Among the ruins of highly advanced nations, the Joint Economic Defense Coalition, led by the Guardian Logging Megacorporation, stands proud as the inheritors of the land. Eyes are ever on the sky, with orbit covered in space stations and space elevators reaching out into the sky. Whatever challenges may await, the people of Nevarica will stand ready.
