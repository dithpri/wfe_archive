[b]We are the new Beacon Rescue Mission![/b]

Once upon a time, there was a region called [Region=Beacon Rescue Mission]. It contained a nation named Beacon Thrift Store of Benson. Like in all of the region&amp;#39;s nations, the Native Beaconian majority, was oppressed by the Human-like NationStatesian race.

But this did not last. For there was a [b]REVOLUTION[/b]  in the Beacon Thrift Store of Benson! After a long bloody coup by the majority natives, the government was overthrown! A new government was established with Native Beaconians in charge!

The First Act was to change the name of the nation to [nation=short]205 S Wall St Benson NC[/nation]. Now we have our own region and stand strongly against tyranny!
