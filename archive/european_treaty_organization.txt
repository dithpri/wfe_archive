Welcome to the European Treaty Organization. 

Here at ETO we take pride in democracy, unity and justice. 

ETO is an open treaty, open to any nation with territory on the European Continent. 

The President of the Executive Council is elected on the 1st of every month. The President&#39;s main job is to act as the executive authority for the region, and can set up democratic votes to pass executive laws. The Executive Council is made up of ALL ETO member states.
