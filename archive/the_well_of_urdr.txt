The Fates gazed upon you with apathy. For all that has a beginning has its end. 

Let your thread unfurl. Be it light or dark - it is your choice. Join me in my region and enjoy the joy of silence and immerse yourself with solitude, but take heed to not disturb me on my repose for my gaze is fatal - it leads only to one path, the path of the rejected.

I have decreed that on this region your fate is yours to mold as you see fit.
