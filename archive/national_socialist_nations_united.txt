This region was a tribute to Nazism, though the founder claimed &amp;quot;we are not racist... [but] we support our own race.&amp;quot; He/she also noted, &amp;quot;We do not support violent acts, because we are a civilized people.&amp;quot; These statements only betray the founder&amp;#39;s ethnocentric assumption regarding &amp;quot;supporting&amp;quot; one&amp;#39;s own race and the racist implication behind the words &amp;quot;[i]we[/i] are a civilized people&amp;quot;, but they also contradict the explicitly racist and violent ideology of National Socialism.
