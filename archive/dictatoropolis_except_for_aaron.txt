Hold fast and strong! Do not give in, bravery shall guide you and courage shall lead you! Do not seize up with fear when the hoards descend upon you! Do not give up, Do not give in, Do not falter! You know your jobs, be the best at them, fight to the last man and hold true! We are the Dictators, and we shall not fall! -ButterCatX
