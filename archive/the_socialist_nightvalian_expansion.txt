A region of ultimate power. Of... hooded power. A region that shall rise, and never fall. A strong region. A region that is publicly owned. A region free of corporation. An exciting region. THE region. A left region. The Socialist Nightvalian Expansion. 

After an astounding conflict with the Communist Bloc, this region was created to house Socialists and all those who feel that they have the right to be part of something important in the NS world.

The current region delegate is [nation]The Hooded Republic of Aldor[/nation].
