Natic High Reach is a rugged, mountain-dominated region of dense forests, narrow passes, and hardened infrastructure. Its cities rise vertically from stone and plateau, with New Natic glowing in neon and reactor light against mist and steel, while the surrounding highlands remain tightly controlled and sparsely settled. The terrain favors isolation, preparation, and endurance, shaping nations that value security and stability over openness.
