An alternate history region gone completely psychopathic.
What if Chariots of the Gods, the Bilderberg Group, and an Alternate 19th and 20th Century were to collide into a giant, mangled, wreck?
You&#39;d have a world once colonized by Aliens, liberated by an oppressive global imperial government, shattered by successive political revolutions, and divided into cultural power blocks.
What a nightmare!
