[b]Welcome to [color=darkturquoise]Tofuline- I mean, Tofulinearity[/color], Enterprising Citizen!- the region built specifically for those who I like, whether you&amp;#39;re kind, intelligent, probably fabulous, or just someone who has shown themselves to be worthy. We used to be Tofuline, but a DEAT of my original account and killjoy (not the good, MCR kind) raiders ruined that. Sadface.
