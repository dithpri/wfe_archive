The first to fall apart were the French. Several states declared independence. The British followed soon after. 

Seterland, and many other colonies, were among the first to declare independence against their imperialist rulers. They believed that if they stayed, then they would also become unstable and collapse.

The Spanish were devastated, as they saw their empire across the America&#39;s tumble. More than just Colombia, Panama, Mexico, Cuba, etc, broke away though. Things like East Venezuela renamed themselves.

Seterland renamed themselves. They were a piece of land taking land from Georgia and South Carolina.

Governments advanced, enough to keep each newly independent state stable enough to not collapse in the first two weeks of being made.
