[color=green][b]This region attempted to poach members from [region]Europeia[/region] to grow its own ranks, so the Europeian Republican Navy decided to grace this place with a little visit to see what all the fuss was about. While we were visiting, we decided to brighten the WFE up too since it was looking a little dim.

If you&#146;re interested in joining a region that [i]doesn&#146;t[/i] poach from other communities and actually respects their members, consider checking out [region]Europeia[/region] &amp; [region]Estalcia[/region].[/b][/color]
