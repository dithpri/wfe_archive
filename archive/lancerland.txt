Lancerland is a region of small, recently created nations with close ties to the World Assembly united to increase their strength in the world market and competition. Military is strong and economy is strong for the small size of these countries. We hope to increase our power through industry and military strength. Joining the WA is MANDATORY for any nation to join officially. Anyone not admitted within 8 hours of joining will be ejected until further notice. Any nation with a controversial name, starts a conflict between region members, or is generally annoying (i.e. trolling) will be immediately ejected or banned depending on the severity of the crime. Just use common sense ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you.
