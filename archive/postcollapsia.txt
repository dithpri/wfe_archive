Hey there! We are post-collapsed nations in the future. World had just collapsed, and many prepared on that, establishing their own nations all across the globe.

Map: Coming Soon

Rules:
1.- Trade posts are built to make trade easier, a country trade post limit is by it&amp;#39;s economy (100 = 10 trade posts, 0 = 0 trade posts)
2.- Everytime one wants to build a trade post, notify Sur Africa.
3.- Wars are done to the nation directly, and is up to them what source they use.
4.- Technology has been backward since the collapse, so no aircraft and nukes.
5.- Culture affects a country, more cultured countries are more likely to get tech easier. Culture is measured by &amp;quot;Civil Rights&amp;quot;.
6.- Trade is limited by distance, that&amp;#39;s why trade posts expand this limits.
