A loose grouping of independent states on the expanses of the Great Plains of Rudiya. Nations here generally exist under hereditary nobility and are gathered together in mutual defense against barbarian tribes on the interior of the continent. Consensus is established in the Confederation by a member vote, but can always be vetoed by the WA delegate, requiring 2/3 majority to override the veto. The founder of the Confederation has final say in whatever decisions are made, and cannot be overridden.
