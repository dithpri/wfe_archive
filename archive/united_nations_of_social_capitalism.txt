We are a union of nations of diverse backgrounds and ideas who share the common ideology that Socialism (a political and economic theory that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be regulated) and Capitalism (an economic and political system in which a country&amp;#39;s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit) are not inherently in conflict with one another. We generally agree that nations have the right to regulate their own economies. We find that Social Capitalism is a more balanced, reasonable approach to political economics, freeing citizens from the corruption and greed in capitalism, and protecting them from the Iron Fist of Socialism.
