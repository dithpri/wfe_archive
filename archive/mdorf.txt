The M&eth;&ouml;rf Region consists of several island groups isolated from the rest of NationStates. The region first consisted of 10 nations (not including Ceruala or Firnandoutreqia), but after a grueling war that was caused by the secession of several radical states, which added nine new now defunct nations, caused the merging of Hackeria and Yharfid&eacute; into [nation]Hackeria-Yharfide[/nation] and Nartieda and Dovesch into [nation]Nartieda-Dovesch[/nation]. The region is known for its nudity, its number of nations, compassion, secularism, niceness, inclusiveness, safety, cards, tourism, welfare, pacifism, lifespan, and environmental beauty. Any factbooks by members of the region will be automatically pinned; all embassy offers are accepted (yes, even from fascists and communists).
