The M&eth;&ouml;rf Region consists of several island groups isolated from the rest of NationStates and needs special codes to enter. The region first consisted of 10 nations (not including Ceruala or Firnandoutreqia), but after a grueling war that was caused by the secession of several fascist/communist/nazist/socialist/anarchist/authoritarian states which added 9 new nations, caused the merging of Hackeria and Yharfid&eacute; into Hackeria-Yharfid&eacute; and Nartieda and Dovesch into Nartieda-Dovesch. The region is known for its nudity, number of nations, compassion, secularism, niceness, inclusiveness, safety, cards, tourism, welfare, pacifism, lifespan, and environmental beauty.
