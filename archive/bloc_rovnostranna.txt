The [b]Bloc Rovnostranna[/b] (from the Czech for equilateral; [i]Rovnostrann&aacute;[/i]) reflects the common efforts of member countries to interact in a roleplay environment centred around the ideas of democracy, unity and equality, in peace or in war.

Our founding principles remain those of complementary and quality roleplay in a respectful environment, so we can blast each other to shreds, but maintain dignity when doing it.

So stop by, poke around, see if you like us! We won&#39;t tell...
