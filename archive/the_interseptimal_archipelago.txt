This region was created in order to foster microtonal music and unemotionality. The archipelago is a set of intervals that lie between 440 cents and 460 cents, a quite interseptimal region (between the 2 septimal extremes) on its own. These intervals have been associated with thoughts of calmness and tropical paradise. Because of this, it has a very good environment. Before entering this region, you need to learn about just intonation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation
