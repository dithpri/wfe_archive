We are all [b]Mortals[/b] in the end.
Enslaved to the [b]king[/b]; THE [b]GOD[/b]!
He promised to never set us free, unless he is paid his fee.
Still the human race is enslaved.
And only [b]one[/b] can save it.
The chosen one,
The [b]prince[/b].
Guided by the [b]Goddess[/b] to whom we pray, in this here church.
For this is [b]The Church of the Goddess Watching[/b].
For she is watching over us, and the [b]prince[/b].
In his journey to free us all.
From the God Above Us All.
