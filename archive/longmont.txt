Longmont began in an unusual way. In 1870, a group of prominent men in Chicago decided to start a new town in Colorado. To do this, they sold membership in the new town, called &amp;quot;The Chicago-Colorado Colony,&amp;quot; and used the money to buy 60,000 acres of land in a carefully chosen site in northern Colorado. They brought people, lumber, and building materials to the barren site, and by 1871, a new town was built. They named it &amp;quot;Longmont,&amp;quot; after nearby Long&amp;#39;s Peak.
