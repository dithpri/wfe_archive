A nice, sunny land just east of Whogivesashitland, Shahaidea (&amp;quot;sha-hey-dah&amp;quot;), is somehow half deserts, half humid shrubland. How or why is a complete mystery.
Unlike many other places, we were here first. We are the natives. Lucky break, huh? We left from The Subanian Region, the push factor being that it was invaded and became, well, bad. Not much else to say.
