[b][color=red]Mandalore was a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. It was the homeworld of the Mandalorians, a fearsome and warmongering people who fought the Jedi and raided their temple during the fall of the Old Republic. Wearing distinctive armor, they were feared throughout the galaxy, and had political influence over two thousand other star systems.

During the Clone Wars, the New Mandalorians were overthrown by Darth Maul&#39;s Shadow Collective, though the Galactic Empire would rule the planet after the war&#39;s end.
