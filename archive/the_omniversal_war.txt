While the wars between various nations, PT, MT, PMT or FT, goes on around the multiverse, something...of a greater scale happens across all that exists known as the Omniverse. The [nation]Multiversal Domanaeii[/nation] and the realms of the Gods were the first in this struggle between order and chaos, but later, as the powers of [nation]Multiversal Vorkare[/nation], [nation]Multiversal Indevians[/nation] and [nation]Multiversal Daxarnia[/nation] emerge, things have become...a bit awry.
