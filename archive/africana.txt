A dead region.....
An expanding extremely mineral rich region off the coast of Africa which was part of main-land Africa untill 1093 years ago, due to a massive earthquake. Large deposits of gold and diamonds scattered in coastal areas. The name AFRICANA derives from the Amiri word for AFRICA.
All nations must join the UN and endorse the UN Delegate, Startpakinstan, in order to stay in this region.
