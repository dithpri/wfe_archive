[b]POLITE DISCUSSION REGION ONLY[/b]

Right now we&amp;#39;re witnessing the Syrian civil war where Muslims kill Muslims in a daily slaughter thats ended the lives of over 40000 people since it began. 

The Iran-Iraq War lasted eight years between 1980 and 1988 with estimates of over 1.5 million people killed.

Muslims killing Muslims. It&amp;#39;s not a new phenomenon and with roughly 20% of the global population being Muslim, it&amp;#39;s a matter that effects us all.

This region is open to discuss the social, political and religious factors which surround Muslims killing Muslims with a particular focus on how this can be prevented to make the world a safer place for all.
