The Collective Dictatorship of Marxists is a region based on one thing. The following of Marxist ideals, the following of a socialist government. However, while we are proprietors of Karl Marx&#39;s ideals, we will not force it upon you. We do, however, recommend you are a communist party, as this group is currently based around the idea of communism. (This is a private group, so refrain from entering unless you have permission until further notice.)
