An lonely continent in the midst of a vast sea. Many islands dot the coasts of the East and South seas while massive cliffs border the western edge, periodically broken up by pure white sand beaches. Ice covers the northern edge of the continent, with massive glaciers through most of it and large icebergs float in circular currents in the northern seas. Sever large mountain ranges divide the continent into a series of major valleys that host the major cultures of the continent. Controlling the mountain passes often determines the rise and fall of civilizations.
