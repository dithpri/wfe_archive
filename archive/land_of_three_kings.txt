In 2017 the great nation of Royal Covenant of Redrum banded together to leave their high ranked yet controlling region to spread their own influence in The World.  Founded by three brothers from The Royal Family, RCR has came a long way to create profound influence. Spending centuries building upon their once beloved values and increasing influences from outside nation&#39;s, Royal&amp;#8203; Covenant of Redrum joined the WORLD ASSEMBLY, however this did not last long as competing legislation derailed further developmental economic plans. Thus, forced RCR to branch off into it&#39;s own region. From here on Royal Covenant of Redrum hopes to rise to influence in The World and WORLD ASSEMBLY.
