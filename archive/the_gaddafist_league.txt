The Gaddafist League unites all Third Universal Theorists and followers of the late founder of the first Great Jamahiriya: Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya. We wish to see the destruction of the World Assembly&#39;s &quot;United Terror Council&quot; (Security Council). We seek to bring down the global hegemony of capitalism and spread the socialist revolution abroad, and to liberate the oppressed and weak in society. God bless Brother Leader Colonel Gaddafi!
