Dal&aelig;mov is a RP-focused region, the main activities take place in the Discord server where nations interact with each other. 

In Dal&aelig;mov&#39;s, the internet was never invented, nor were portable computers, therefore the technology used for all fields is based on the early to mid 1940s technology.

Dal&aelig;mov does not restrict any Nation&#39;s form of government in participating in the RP, as long as they are plausible and reasonable.

Punishments and/or permanent bans may be issued to players that do not follow the regional Dal&aelig;mov Code of Conduct.

Endorse Gustavovich and join the discord server to achieve the status of Full Member. The status of Full Member is necessary for RP interactions.
