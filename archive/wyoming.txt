[b]Welcome to Wyoming[/b]

[color=navy]In the far and mighty West, 
Where the crimson sun seeks rest, 
There&amp;#39;s a growing splendid State that lies above, 
On the breast of this great land; 
Where the massive Rockies stand, 
There&amp;#39;s Wyoming young and strong, the State I love![/color][i] -by C.E. Winter[/i]
