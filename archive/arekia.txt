[b][color=#000061]Determination, Virtue, and Compassion.[/color][/b]

Arekia is an Earth-like world in the Lyra constellation which has been in a constant state of strife since it&amp;#39;s founding as a corporate mining operation. Since then, various factions and wars have been fought. The native Arekian people are known as hardy, determined people who value compassion and one&amp;#39;s word. This is a roleplaying region where mostly 3 people sit around and make silly wall posts at one another but feel free to jump in!
