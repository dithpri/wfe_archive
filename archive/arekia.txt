A distant world, tucked into the corner of the galaxy...

Arekia is located in deep space, well beyond the normal means of travel for spacecraft. The location of a very circumstantially beneficial wormhole has allowed Arekia to trade and prosper with the rest of the galaxy at large, as well as new worlds, nations, or other such powers. Arekia itself is a temperate world with many biomes, most reminiscent of Earth&amp;#39;s China at the height of it&amp;#39;s expansion. Deserts, jungles, arboreal forests, snowcapped mountains and fertile farmland dot the landscape of the planet six times the size of Earth. It is beautiful, war-torn, and resource-rich.
