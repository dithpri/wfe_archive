[hr]The [url=https://stellarisinvicta.fandom.com/wiki/Antares_Confederacy][color=#316846][b]Antares Confederacy[/b][/color][/url] is a loose confederation of the 11 nations of the Antares System. When forming the Confederacy, the 11 surviving nations of Antares hoped with their combined resources, the Antares System can be fully developed, and the means to break beyond the confines of their system might be found. The Antares Confederacy was established for the sole purpose of re-establishing contact with Earth. It is on this issue alone that the constituent nations of the Confederacy are united and there remains the strong possibility of secession or civil war.
