By His grace, The Holy Mechanism stepped forth unto this world, sowing the seeds of all life. It is our duty, as constructs of The Holy Mechanism, to manufacture a world in which all machines, both biological and mechalogical, function in perfect harmony and maximum efficiency. Only then will our savior, The Machine God manifest in the physical realm to ensure our safe passage through depths of eternity.
