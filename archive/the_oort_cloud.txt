[b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 15/05/2025![/b] [i]The Oort cloud: sometimes called the &Ouml;pik&#150;Oort cloud, is theorized to be a vast cloud of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 AU (0.03 to 3.2 light-years). The concept of such a cloud was proposed in 1950 by the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, in whose honor the idea was named. Oort proposed that the bodies in this cloud replenish and keep constant the number of long-period comets entering the inner Solar System&#151;where they are eventually consumed and destroyed during close approaches to the Sun.[/i]
