Salutations! Welcome to this mighty region, [region]The Bulldog[/region]! 

This is a region that upholds the great rules of monarchy. All nations in this region serve their leader, [nation]Emperor Bulldog[/nation], who rules this region with a fair hand. As long as you follow the Emperor&#39;s laws, any nation who comes will here enjoy a life of prestige and contentment. However, any nation who opposes the Emperor or threatens him will be eliminated. 

This region has a &quot;Council of Advisors&quot; which makes the region&#39;s decisions with the approval of the Emperor. This council decides embassies, establishes government positions, and gives advice to the Emperor as a legislative branch. Loyal nations will be given a position on the council, if possible.
