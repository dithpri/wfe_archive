A region where equality is accessible. 

This is how the government is going to work.
1. We will elect congressmen to represent people of the region.
2. After these congressmen have been chosen, everyone who is not a congressman MUST CONTACT A CONGRESSMAN and that congressman will represent you. For instance, I contact Sam and he represents me, so anything I bring up to him he brings up to the rest of congress.
3. After your congressman has agreed to represent you, you go along your business. This way we don&#39;t have a clutter o different ideas in the chat. If you want something to be heard, please contact your sponsor OR me, WA Delegate. Only reach out to Sam if it&#39;s something really big.
