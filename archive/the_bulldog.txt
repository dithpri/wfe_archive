The [b][color=green]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=blue]Navy[/color][/b] has come to take every single bulldog from this region and train them as our mighty animals. While our region is already diverse in containing multiple species, the ERN needs a vicious bulldog to attack those who stand in our way. I think we&#39;ll call him [b]Nobody[/b], so whenever he attacks we can yell, [b]&quot;Nobody is coming!&quot;[/b]

If you want to see your bulldog trained in our region, and in future action, come and visit [region]Europeia[/region].
