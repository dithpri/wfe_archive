Hello, and welcome to The Bulldog! A region based in Roosevelt Middle School (River Forest, IL) that holds true to the principles of representative democracy.

We currently have a &quot;Bulldog Senate&quot; where nations (who represent themselves and other nations too) gather to discuss, debate, and vote on proposals. If you don&#39;t have a representative yet, send the Election Advisor a telegram and he will appoint you one.

&quot;Democracy must be built through open societies that share information. When there is information, there is enlightenment. When there is debate, there are solutions. When there is sharing of power, there is no abuse, no corruption, no subjugation and no indignation.&quot;
