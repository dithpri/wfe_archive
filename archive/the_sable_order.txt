[b]Welcome to [color=darkred]The Sable Order[/color][/b]
[i]Wars are not won by numbers, but by the competence of the commanders and the efficiency of the troops.
Our goal is not to raid regions, but to rise through them and control them from the inside out, as simple natives. The members of The Sable Order do not reside within the region, and their main identity remains unknown. None may know of our numbers or strength.[/i][hr][b]Representative: [nation=short]The Sable Order[/nation]
Overlord: [nation=short]General Camus[/nation]
Commander: [nation=short]King Nephmir[/nation][hr][/b]
