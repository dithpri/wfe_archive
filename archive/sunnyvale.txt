The Sunnyvale Trailer Park is a trailer park located in Nova Scotia, Canada near the area of Dartmouth, Halifax and Blandford. The park was in operation for some 30-odd years until it was abandoned in favour of Lahey&#39;s Luxury Estates by it&#39;s final owner, Jim Lahey. The park had been considered a good place to live for most of it&#39;s life, until the final years when the &quot;criminal element&quot;, along with Lahey&#39;s alcoholism and obsession, spiraled out of control.
