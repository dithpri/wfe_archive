Pathways is an old name,
but has grown to become a symbol for many members of Pathways,
whether it symbolized something bad...or something good. 

Pathways was created as a region for a &amp;quot;fictional&amp;quot; war between
the founder and a &amp;quot;friend.&amp;quot;

War was declared on February 26th, 2015 at 8:05 PM Central Time,
and Pathways will not be dragged down for that war.
The war is eternal, and may have been the reason for creating the
region, but will not be the reason it operates.
