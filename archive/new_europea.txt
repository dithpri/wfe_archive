New Europa is a bright region, progressive in thinking and confident in the actions of its countries. It shall serve as a breeding ground of new ideas and as the standard for that those regions to come and a descendant of those great regions who have come before. 

All of those nations who wish to be a part of this region must be willing to abide by three rules:
1)Respect the authority of those members more senior than you, either with more power or who have been in the region longer.
2)Do not declare war unless you have a good reason; wage war in defense and not in hate.
3)Do what is right and make good decisions that represent the popular support of your people; remember that there is no such thing as a long-lasting unpopular government.
