Our great region is very welcoming if you worship our great leaders Mr Peckles, Mr Nooty Noot &amp; Great Uncle Bulgaria . The theme of this region is animal leaders but anyone can join (as long as you worship our great leaders) the main animals in this region are chickens, pingus, Wombles and dingos. We will invade earth on the 16th of may 2020 we believe that if beings do not worship Our great leaders, they deserve to be enslaved, tortured, killed and eaten.
