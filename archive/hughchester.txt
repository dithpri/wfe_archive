The states of Hughchester are located about 1000 kilometres due east of the Philippines. The capital, Magnadinitude, is situated on the fertile north-west peninsula of the Democratic Socialist Dominion of Hughchester (DSDH). While the DSDH has sovereignty, other states are free to change laws that do not involve idealogical or major economic changes. Hughchestrian States follow a democratic Marxist principle. While the DSDH uses traditional communism, its other dependancies have employed an Anarcho-Communistic ideology; effective with their small populations. The DSDH is the political capital of the region; home to a vast percentage of the region&#39;s population, and with by far the largest military power and economic output.
