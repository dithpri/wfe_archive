April 21st,1948: Zionist forces, made up of 5,000 soldiers mostly organized by Haganah (Carmeli Brigade) and some IZL troops, attacked Arab Haifa. Based on declassified Israeli documents, the Israeli historian Benny Morris concluded that the Jewish civilian population (especially Haifa&amp;#39;s Jewish mayor Shabtai Levy) was at peace with their Palestinian neighbors, but the Haganah and the IZL leadership had a different agenda: to ethnically cleanse the city from its Palestinian Arab population.
