[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region][/b][/u]

This region of self-identified &amp;quot;Jesus Freaks&amp;quot; was a member of the fascist [region]Right Wing Uprising[/region] and maintained embassies with several neo-Nazi regions. 

It was refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]opponents of [color=purple]hatred[/color][/b].

[color=red]On 26.05.15 it was handed over to the mighty [region]Antifa[/region]scist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall be kept as a museum against Nazis and hate for all to witness in perpetuity.[/color]
