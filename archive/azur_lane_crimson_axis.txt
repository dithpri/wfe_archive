We are the Crimson Axis as seen in the widely popular mobile game Azur Lane. We represent all of the ideals that are expressed by the Sakura Empire, Vichya Dominion, Iron Blood, and Sardegna Empire of the Crimson Axis Alliance. 

Long Live the Axis!
Es lebe die Achse!
Lunga vita all&#39;asse!

To those that oppose our roleplaying beliefs.......
You are within all of your rights to hold your opinions against us. Just realize before you do anything to or against us that we are a roleplay region in nature and each individual within this region may or may not support a fascist ideology. The only fascist nature of our region is in the representation of the Iron Blood faction and various bits of the other Crimson Axis factions as part of the game.
