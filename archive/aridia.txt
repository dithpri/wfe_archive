Aridia is a relatively new region made up of a handful of closely knit nations cut from a similar cloth. While they may not be like-minded politically, economically, or sociologically, they do have a common interest in each other&amp;#39;s prosperity and well-being. They respect the paths that the others take when it comes to the running of their nation, so long as they are reaching their goals.
