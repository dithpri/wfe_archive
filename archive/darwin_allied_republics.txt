The Darwin Allied Republics are a group of countries formed to keep the world safe.  Started in the New Brentsylvania city Darwin, the D.A.R.s will try to keep a safe world.  
We are one of the few regions that came out of the zombie attack all alive.  This is a good nation home to around 750 million good citizens, so the Darwin Allied Republics is pretty nice.  Unless you have done something very bad we will not eject you, and so far nobody banned from here.  So this is an ideal place to live.  We also are allied with many regions and we will try to unite with all we can.  Right now 18 regions are allying with us D.A.R.s in the next several days, so we are very well with other parts of the world.
