[region]The Black Hawks[/region] were lonely on Valentine&amp;#8217;s day but, they found a love witch from [region]Sparkalia[/region] who could help them fall in love. Unfortunately, a cupid ran away to the nearby [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] and using magic arrows, turned the assassins into lovely assassins! The Black Hawks also wanted to become lovely so cupid shot the hawks and the hawks became lovely pink hawks!
