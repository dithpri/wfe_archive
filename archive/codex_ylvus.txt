This region now serves as a puppet storage and for small-scale chatting and interaction after a series of roleplay implosions and failures in planning happening from mid-2017 to early 2018. Also don&#146;t forget to check Yverdepedia for Codex Ylvus universe and lore. 
Aiming to become the largest puppet storage region, accepting any embassy requests.
