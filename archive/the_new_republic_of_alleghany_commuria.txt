The old Alleghany and the old Commuria are long dead. little activity has distanced us from one another. I hope to bring our friendship back. clicktopia is in a different region, NCA is dead, and the rest of us..... are accidentally further isolated by another group of friends. I love you all. I miss you. for over a year I have strayed away from leadership, leaving it to others. now I see if I don&#39;t, we will never be friends again. I am willing to be one now, long after I should have. if you say yes, then thank you. if not... then thank you for our time together, and, have the best of luck. goodbye.
