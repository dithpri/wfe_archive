[color=blue]Our mission is to take down the [b]puny[/b] region of [i]Smitty[/i] and become a superpower. We are united nations under the [u]Great Tree Octopus[/u]![/color]

[color=green]Most anyone is allowed to join the Alliance. It is possible for a poll to be taken on if people should be able to join the Alliance or not, however polls like that shouldn&amp;#39;t occur often.
[u]If you are ejected[/u] from the Alliance and wish to know why or repeal, please speak to [i]The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Reynwald[/i] owner, Ryan.[/color]
[b]Also feel free to leave suggestions on the message board [i](if you are a resident, of course)[/i] if you have any.[/b]

[color=red][b][i]Glory be to this region, and to the Great Tree Octopus![/i][/b][/color]
