[spoiler=WA Representative Elections]
The Panda Zoo Method:

One: Send a telegram to current WA delegate expressing interest in being the next WA delegate (Must be in WA first)

Two: Poll goes up to determine winner

Three: Unendorse old WA delegate and endorse new WA delegate

Four: The winner will serve as WA delegate for the next two weeks

Five: New poll goes up, you can run for two terms in a row if you are the current WA delegate. (2 Terms, then a 4-week break) [/spoiler] [/color][color=red]
Rules:

No excessive arguing

No sh*tposting

Keep it PG-13

Don&#39;t get the mods mad at us
