[b][color=green]Welcome to Caprecia![/color][/b]

[i]Please pardon our dust, our homeland was conquered! Please feel free to stay and support Caprecian Liberation![/i]

[Region]Caprecia[/region] is gone, but not forgotten. Caprecia was the greatest Role-Playing community in the world! After Seven long years the grand vision of our founder and benevolent monarch, The Dominion, came to an end. His vision lives on, and once more his dream will be realized. First things first: We must reclaim our home.

We shall return!
Freedom! Opportunity! Democracy!
