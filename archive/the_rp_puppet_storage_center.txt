This region is meant for new nations who want a boost in power when they join an RP region that uses NS stats. 
How to get a puppet as your own nation in Future Earth and how to set up a puppet for Future new players:  in order for a puppet to be made, you must put the name of your nation in the motto so they can telegram you and ask for the nation, do NOT put the password for your nation in the motto or factbooks and if you are using the same password for all of them, change it before giving it to them so they do not mass steal the puppets. Make sure they&#39;re RP appropriate names.
Telegram the master in the motto of the puppet you want and he will give you the password for that puppet and its yours.
