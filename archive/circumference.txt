[b]The [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy&#39;s math specialists didn&#39;t teach our sailors about circumference. They said it was point-less! But you know what, we learnt a few things while we were here, and we thank you for letting us dock out ships in these calm waters. If you&#39;d like to clamber aboard our vessels, we&#39;d always love to have you!
