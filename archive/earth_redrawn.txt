All regional roleplaying takes place on the forum, and is independent from regular NationStates roleplaying.

To other region delegates: Our region is isolationist. Our regional roleplay takes place on our off-site forum, but you are welcome to apply as a Foreign Dignitary.  Please send a NS telegram to the Founder nation, [nation]Earth Redrawn[/nation], or our WA delegate to discuss WA proposals and on-site roleplaying.
