[b][color=#FF0000]We are the CSA.  So, what is the CSA?

It&#146;s a rat race... and the rats are winning. We the corporate, soulless rats of America!

Today, more than 80% of workers are said to be dissatisfied with their job or company.

With a private industry workforce of over 107 million, something is seriously wrong in Corporate States of America when 85 million workers are unhappy to the point of jumping ship.

The Corporate States of America are run in the final analysis to lose everything for all participants. Look at the freaking world. It is going to HELL. 

[color=#0040FF]We&#39;ll take your self respect and remaining time. Which in the end are the most valuable things you have. 

Keep worshiping these soulless rats America!  Besides, you really have no choice.[/color][/b]
