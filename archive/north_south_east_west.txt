We are all around the world, that includes the w x y z axis. To find us, all you need is nothing. You are already here. We are everywhere. 
We do have rules for our region. This includes the following: 

I. By joining this region you agree to always vote for what the governor wants. Failure to abide these will lead to harsh punishment. You can learn more about the punishments under article three.

II. Private industry is outlawed unless permitted by the governor or WA delegate.

III. You must maintain a stable government. If you fail to have stability, you will be taken into custody and your government will be replaced by what we seen fit.

IV. If you have a valid seat in the WA you must endorse [nation]The Authority of the Underwater Cities[/nation].
