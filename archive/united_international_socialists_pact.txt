The USP, headed by the Premier, is a regional administration of Socialist nations that have the same leftist mindset. We work towards a united future in which the left can work with the political adversaries and be strong enough to combat enemy nations and ideologies. This pact is only open to Socialists and or left oriented nations and any other nations will be rejected. The main benefits of this pact are that we provide a strong central authority and the ability to be represented in the WA, which all members must be apart of. The Premier heads the organization and appoints positions based on their ability to manage and work with other nations.
