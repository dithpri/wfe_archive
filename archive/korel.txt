[b][color=green]Welcome to Korel![/color][/b]

Korel is a region of mutual friends based on Future Tech roleplaying in the shared universe of the Korel Galaxy. Together, we have built an ever-expanding canon that still continues to grow, while remaining inclusive to new members who care to join. If you&#39;re interested in roleplaying, science fiction, worldbuilding, writing, or just having a good time, please consider taking a look at our [url=http://korel.forummotion.com]regional forums[/url], where most of our activity takes place.
