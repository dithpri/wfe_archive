[b]This past minor Sailors from the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy could only hear the sounds of their cannons firing wildly portside out at the enemy, &quot;Flap, Flap, BOOM.&quot; Thanks to the direction of our Grand Admiral, and some quick manoeuvres from our new Midshipman, we had a hell of a time out on the waters tonight. If you&#39;d like to fire some cannons, and get your feet salty, we&#39;d love for your to join us.[/b]
