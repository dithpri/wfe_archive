Korel has been Raided by the glorious region, PRC! PRC is a rading community as well as a political community! We are a democracy that gives everyone the chance to vote or run for office. As I right, PRC is having an election for junior minister! Our Military defends us, deters aggression directed at PRC, and spreads our legacy. Soon you will see PRC everywhere. And oh! I forgot to mention diplomacy! We welcome anyone intent on spreading our name, and making sure are foreign relations are good. It&#39;s the best of all worlds at PRC, where anyone&#39;s opinions are accepted, voting is almost daily on anything and everything, and so much more. Also, our constitution is being worked on as we speak. We look forward to you joining PRC!
