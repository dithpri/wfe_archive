[b][color=green]What is Korel?[/color][/b]

Korel is a neutral region of mutual friends, who enjoy participating in the regional roleplay. We are largely a Future Tech region, but we [i]do[/i] welcome everyone who has interest in roleplay. Most - in fact, almost all - of our activity takes place on the [url=http://korel.forummotion.com]regional forums[/url], which has years of RP history. Check it out if you&#39;re interested!
