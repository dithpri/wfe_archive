Protoss has been the lagging race for over two year, they need buffs. A Protoss hasn&#39;t won a major tournament in longer time than any of the other race. Clearly the game was better off when David Kim was at the helm. Now, we have this team of people intent on making sure Serral wins every tournament and a 75 energy ability can instantly do 800 damage but only to Protoss units. There&#39;s a conspiracy to make sure Protoss never wins anything. In no uncertain terms Protosss is the weakest race, can&#39;t even cannon rush anymore smh.
