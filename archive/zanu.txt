[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr]

This region was seized on 1/1/2025 from [region]Rhodesia 2[/region], a hate-mongering fascist region which romanticizes the old minority-rule white government of Rhodesia [i](now known as Zimbabwe)[/i]. The state has destroyed this abominable region in the name of self-determination and freedom.

The Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) was a militant socialist organization that fought against white-minority rule in Rhodesia. It was formed as a split from the Zimbabwe African People&#39;s Union ([region]ZAPU[/region]) in 1963.[/color]
