Encompassing an entire Universe in one of the Utopian Test Universes, the Utopian Wargaming Center was established in the 112nd Era of the Utopia in the 5th Grand Cycle. The Utopian Wargaming Center should not be confused with the Utopian War Training Center, which is located in another plane of Universes altogether. While the Utopian War Training Center was created towards the end of one of the eras of the 1st Grand Cycle to train and test the Grand Utopian Military, the Utopian Wargaming Center was made solely for the intention of entertainment.
