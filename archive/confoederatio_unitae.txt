Confoederatio Unitae is a small region consisting of nations formerly part of the United Socialist Confederation of Central Yeetussia and its Territories(USCCYT), now disbanded due to differences in foreign policy. Despite this, socialism and other left-wing ideologies prevail in most of the region. Yeetussia later founded the Confoederatio Unitae Territoria, with intentions of reuniting the region to some extent.
