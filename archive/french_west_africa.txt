An earlier named version of this region was most likely a platform for Nazi-style racist hate, and held by forces associated with [region]The Greater German Reich[/region].  Whether or not that was the case some time ago, it will not be true any longer, for at least as this version of the region still exists.  Racism will NOT be tolerated any longer, along with a lot of other things as well.  Furthermore, this region is now under the control of the owner/controller of [region]The North Atlantic Ocean[/region], and will remain so for at least the foreseeable future.  AMS out.
