[color=green]The biggest problem of contemporary life in other regions is the lack of order.  
A region that is unable to guarantee the rule of law, that tolerates discrimination against those who live according to moral values, while often ridiculing them in favor of those who lead sinful, carefree, and anti-social lives, cannot offer its citizens freedom, independence, or a life worthy of a human being.  

Order means people &#150; the worker and the scientist, the artist and the priest, the farmer and the clerk, the doctor and the patient, the planner and the teacher &#150; having access to clean water, clean air, and life-giving sunlight for us all.  
The people need order; the corruptly elected thrive on disorder.[/color]
