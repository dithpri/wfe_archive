We are looking for mapmakers and I need one of my cabinet members to make this bulletin look spiffy.
Message [nation]Alba Patera[/nation] for claims.
-Planets and other bodies that have already been made up or are real are community regions (meaning anyone can claim there).
-Custom planets and other bodies that are meant solely for the requestor must have a minium of 2 other countries inhabiting that &quot;region&quot; depending on the size and type of body.
-Please encourage other CL members to join.
-Max of 5 puppets in CLSC at a time.
