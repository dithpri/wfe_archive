welcome to our region, at the back of earth! if you come here it&#39;s good too take note that uh, we are as far away from continents as possible so if you want to be less isolated and for some reason not join our interesting religion then you are at the wrong place. If you are here we would like you too know that you will be united with me, the great coast. Dont worry, you will not become a puppet or loose independence but you will still count as us, the great mid-pacific!
expect saftey as we are surrounded by water!
expect help especially if you are new!
and a nice coastal view:)
