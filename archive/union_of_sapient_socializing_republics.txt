Once Upon a Time...
A coalition of nations had formed, under the banner of the Union of Sapient Socialist Republics. This coalition was formed in pursuit of greater lives for its people, but found itself limited in many ways, regarding diversity of economic policies. As a result, after 400 years of semi-tenuous relations, although under consistent prosperity, the leaders of each nation in the USSR met at a summit to discuss the future of the coalition.This resulted in a vote by all nations, and when the ballots were cast, a vast majority supported reform. This reform brought with it a metamorphosized Union:

The Union of Sapient Socializing Republics.
