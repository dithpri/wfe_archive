The Union of Sapient Socializing Republics(U.S.S.R.) is cosmopolitan in many senses, ranging from geographical, cultural, technological, and, of course, political. The nations that are united in this broad, sweeping coalition are spread across much of a large, bio-diverse planet in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, known as Sensus. This Union began with a coalition between the great nations of Betoveria, Skinland, and Cometa. These three nations had united to mutually advance technology and socio-economic prosperity, as well as to present a united front to other nations from other parts of Sensus, and eventually nations from other planets within the galaxy.
