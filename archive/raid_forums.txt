The Raid Forums was captured from Nazi Europa by Celaeon Reisis, Bruhstalia&amp;#39;s dictator and national hero. If you join us, you are welcome to participate in a little game I call IssueRoulette.
To play IssueRoulette, I will post an issue and the numbers 1 and 2 or 1, 2, and 3. Then you guys will post any number on the board, and the number written most will be chosen.
