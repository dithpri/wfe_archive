This is a mostly communist/socialist region, with some nations also having self made economic and political systems. Note, that when I feel the region has too many people, I will permanently ban immigration to this region, but will except some people, even if the region is overflowed. If you join this region, you will actually frequently talk to people you meet here, and you will actually feel like you are apart of a community.
