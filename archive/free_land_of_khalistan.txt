[nation]Khalistan[/nation]  movement refers to a global political secessionist movement which seeks to create a separate Sikh state, called [nation]Khalistan[/nation] (&amp;quot;The Land of the Pure&amp;quot;) in the Punjab region of South Asia. The territory of the proposed nation is mainly carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. However, being roughly analogous to the historical Sikh Empire (1799&#150;1849), other territories of the greater Punjab region may also be included depending upon definition.
