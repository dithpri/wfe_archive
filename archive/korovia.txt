[b][color=darkblue]Greetings, good people of Korovia![/color][/b]

We, your good comrades in [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b] have decided to drop by and liven the place up. We&#39;d say we brought food, but our spice got stolen and we ran out of salt, but that&#39;s why we&#39;re here to replenish our supplies. All claims of &quot;invasion&quot; may kindly be redirected to our Bureau of International Negotiation (BIN for short), we&#39;re positive they will give an adequate non-response.

If you&#39;re curious to see how these parties are organised, feel free to stop by the [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]main tent[/url]![hr]
