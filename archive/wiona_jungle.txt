[color=#00ca4b]Friday night, I&#39;m working overtime
To get my record on
I kill the light, but you still the vibe
Even with my headphones on
Baby it&#39;s no mystery
Why you keep your kiss for me
We&#39;ve both got chequered history
Ah, but you and me we own a jungle
We own a jungle (We own a jungle)
When I die, you bring me back to life
Metempsychosify
Call of Duty, press square to revive
And you tap it every time
Baby it&#39;s no mystery
Why you keep your kiss for me
We&#39;ve both got chequered history
Ah, but you and me we own a jungle
We own a jungle (We own a jungle)
Colder climes you feel the freezing
Beggar&#39;s Bean is all we&#39;re eating
But every time I feel the need
You bring the heat in we own a jungle
We own a jungle
We own a jungle
We own a jungle
We own a jungle[/color]
