[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were passing out [color=pink]ice cream[/color] to neighborhood kids on a hot summer day.  Thieves from this region stole the ice cream which has now been recovered with help from our friends in [region]Europeia[/region], [region]Karma[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region], [region]Balder[/region], &amp; [region]The MT Army[/region].  Now with more rainbows and happiness and less ickyness.[/b]
