There once was a man from France. He dropped a load in his pants. I don&amp;#39;t know what that has to do with anything, but there has been a forum all along. http://www.principiadiscordia.com/forum/index.php It doesn&amp;#39;t work like you expect it to, so try not to be surprised. Also, someone told me French pant loads are incendiary citrus bomb dumplings. Also known as napalm crumpets and biscuit butt trumpets.
