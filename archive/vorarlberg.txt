Vorarlberg  is the westernmost federal state of Austria. Although it has the second-smallest area (Vienna is the smallest) and population (Burgenland is less populated), it has the second-highest population density (after Vienna). It borders three countries: Germany (Bavaria and Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg via Lake Constance), Switzerland (Graub&uuml;nden and St. Gallen) and Liechtenstein. The only Austrian state that shares a border with Vorarlberg is Tyrol to the east.&#151;Wikipedia[hr]
