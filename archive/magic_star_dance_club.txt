After six hours of school I&#39;ve had enough for the day 
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way 
I gotta dance (dance dance dance now the beat&#39;s really hot) right on the spot 
(Dance dance dance right there on the spot) 
The beat&#39;s really hot 
(Dance dance dance now the beat&#39;s really hot) 
Dance (dance) dance (dance) dance (dance) yeah! 
When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick 
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick
