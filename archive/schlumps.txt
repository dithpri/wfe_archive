STATEMENT: As a retired raider, I find that raiding inactive regions is quite fun. But raiding active regions or regions that have a genuine purpose, for GOOD reasons, not advertisement. Taking people&#39;s hard work and destroying it while they sleep is pretty annoying, and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll get anyone to join you.
