[color=purple][b]&amp;#10026;As we are a fairly recent region, we ask for the help of any nation, either to build the office, rules, constitution and to help us control the region
This is your opportunity to be part of the high office of the Great Monarchical Nations&amp;#10026;[/b][/color]

[color=green]First of all we say that we are happy to join this young and small monarchical union
Your participation is important to grow the region.[/color]

We are the [color=red][b]Great Monarchical Nations[/b][/color], as the name says, we are a region where we accept any monarchical or imperial nation, all members must treat each other in a respectful manner and there is no obligation whatsoever to engage in events that intervene in the nation.
