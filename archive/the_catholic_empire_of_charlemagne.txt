This is a traditional catholic region devoted to counter-revolutionary,traditionalist politics.
We wish to restore a dream of the blessed emperor charlemagn, the dream of a united catholic empire.
monarchism,aristocracy,anti-egalitarianism,conservativism,feudalism,agrarianism,capitalism and regionalism stands at the heart of our dream nation, the truly catholic nation, may god help us.
We are anti-democracyists,anti-socialists,anti-liberals,anti-nazis,anti-faschists,anti-nationalists and anti-secularists.
We recognise and resist the papacy of his holiness pope francis I.
