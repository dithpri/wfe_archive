Hevington and friends have rules.
1. No spamming or hate messages on the channel board.
2. No spamming officers with telegrams.
3. No begging for an admin role unless we find your application worthy.
4. We will not constantly moderate the chat because Hevington is only an alt-account, so please respect the region and the rules. Thank you.
