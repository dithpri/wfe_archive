
Palestine &amp;#127477;&amp;#127480; is and will always be Islamic land, from the river to the sea. It was occupied by force, and it will be liberated through force. Al-Quds and Al-Aqsa Mosque are not merely symbols&#151;they are obligations upon every Muslim. We will reclaim them with our blood, our bullets, and our belief.

We pledge full support to the Islamic Resistance Movement (Harakat al-Muqawamah al-Islamiyyah), and to all forces of jihad standing firm against Zionist aggression&#151;from the brigades in Gaza to the cells in the West Bank and beyond.

We honor every fighter who stands firm, every martyr who ascends, and every family who endures. From the stones of Intifada to the missiles of resistance, the fire of jihad will not be extinguished.
