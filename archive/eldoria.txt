Eldoria is a massive continent home to the following fourteen nation-states:

- Kreschev
- Duhmahaba
- Noca Lovotia
- Setstar
- Berwald
- Ansarh
- Kentbury
- Corolinae
- Kuhlman
- Aragon Islands
- Durane
- Bordellae
- Smally
- Vidoc

Each of these individual nation-states feature their own respective governments, but collectively operate as a part of a larger, consolidated country-continent with a centralized government, consisting of elected delegates and executives to oversee all fourteen states in a more communal manner.
