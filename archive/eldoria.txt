Eldoria is a massive continent home to fifteen unique nation-states. Each of these individual nation-states features their own respective government, but collectively operate as a part of a larger, consolidated country-continent with a centralized government, otherwise known as the Eldorian National Government (ENG). The ENG meets in the Eldoria Capital District, located southeast of Ansarh, and consists of an elected Prime Minister (executive) and delegates and representatives (legislative assembly) from each of the fifteen nation-states and the Eldoria Capital District. The ENG also oversees the state government of the Eldoria Capital District.
