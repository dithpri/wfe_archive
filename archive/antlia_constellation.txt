[i]Antlia: is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name means &quot;pump&quot; in Latin and Greek; it represents an air pump. Originally Antlia Pneumatica, the constellation was established by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century. Its non-specific (single-word) name, already in limited use, was preferred by John Herschel then welcomed by the astronomic community which officially accepted this. North of stars forming some of the sails of the ship Argo Navis (the constellation Vela), Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of 49 degrees north.[/i][b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 04/05/2025.[/b]
