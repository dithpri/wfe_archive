&quot;There have been no unusual events in the formerly raider region, now a fun Independent theme park with rides and candy and cute puppies and soft pillows,&quot; said [nation]Pallaith[/nation], the very smart, handsome, and kind Delegate of [region]The North Pacific[/region]. &quot;Really!&quot; Then he made a small child smile by giving him a lollypop.
