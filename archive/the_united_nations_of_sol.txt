[color=red][b]THE ORION ARM[/b]
The Orion Arm, is the colloquial name given to the extent of human exploration and settlement across the galaxy. It derives its name from the Orion-Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way. Though increasingly a misnomer as colonies are established within the Arrowhead Spur or Antares Gulf, it is still the most widely used term to describe the expansion of human civilization across the galaxy.
