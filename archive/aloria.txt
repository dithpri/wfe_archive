Welcome To Aloria!
Aloria is comprised of player of Massivecraft who share a common interest in social issues and government. We do not restrict what form of government you wish to have, rule any way you want! With lore unique to Nationstates, we have our own specialties to roleplay and story. A few rules:
1. Leave Massivecraft conflicts off the board, we are all friends here.
2. Toxic behavior will have you removed.
3. Elections will be held periodically for officers. Do not ask to be one, you will need to win it in an election.
4. Have fun :)

Remember, this is not sanctioned by the Massive-staff and is a player organization.
