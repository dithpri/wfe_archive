Welcome To Aloria!
Aloria is comprised of player of Massivecraft who share a common interest in social issues and government. Or just want to screw with imaginary citizens. Either way, we all share the same goal so lets all have a fun time. A few rules:
1. Leave Massivecraft conflicts off the board, we are all friends here.
2. Toxic behavior will have you removed.
3. Elections will be held periodically for officers. Do not ask to be one, you will need to win it in an election.
4. Have fun :)

Remember, this is not sanctioned by the Massive-staff and is a player organization.

Freedom is Power - Equality is Justice
