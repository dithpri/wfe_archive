Aloria is a region based on the minecraft server &quot;MassiveCraft&quot; and it&#39;s lore. The various nations here are run by people who are active on MassiveCraft and also enjoy NationStates. We&#39;re a small but tight-knit group, and only people from MassiveCraft are welcome here (with exceptions for people who are friends of people who play MassiveCraft). Nations here do not need to have MassiveCraft&#39;s lore in mind, as this is an alternate universe to MassiveCraft&#39;s &quot;Aloria&quot; planet.

Aloria was founded by Al&#39;Darub (MassiveCraft Username: Mecharic) during it&#39;s 2nd incarnation (the original died because reasons). To join, contact him via the MassiveCraft forums for the Password.
