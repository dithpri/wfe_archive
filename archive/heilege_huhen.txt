The colonial state which later became the nation of Drayon(and South Drayon) was founded by the Confederation of the Rhine, with partial assistance from the French empire during the early 1800s. It&#39;s located on an Island named Heilige Huhen, or &#39;Holy Hens&#39; in modern English translation. Heilige Huhen is 37,423 miles(60226 kilometers) in total surface area, and located 2023 miles(3,256 km) east from New Zealand. Heilige Hugen remained a colonial territory of the German Empire until the Treaty of Versailles, where the colonial state was given independence.
