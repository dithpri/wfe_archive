Welcome to the freeland!
Freeland is a region where nobody tells you what to do with your nation. 
Nations in the freeland tend to be stronger than the nations in the other regions.
The freeland is open for new nations to join it and respects others in the region.
Nations here fill others and come together to see that we arent so different after all and accept our differences.
