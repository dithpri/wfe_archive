Our region is an ecumenical alliance of Christian nations. Though it is founded by a Roman Catholic nation, it accepts the Orthodox, as well as protestants. Committed to localist principles, and leaning toward communitarianism, socialism, and distributism.

There are two rules of this region: 

Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind.
Love your neighbor as yourself.

Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.

He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

-Psalm 101:6-7
