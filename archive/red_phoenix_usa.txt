[region]Red Phoenix USA[/region]
In the midst of the crisis of late capitalism, a small but well-armed revolutionary cell of Marxist-Leninists seized power in some of the mountainous towns in Arizona (of all places). A sovereign socialist government was installed in the Northern area of the state where it continues to operate in tension with the surrounding USA. This region is intended to harbor and support rogue socialist nations within the USA and promote the spread of socialism across the land. Nations from all parts of the world are welcome, as are the gamut of socialist tendencies from Stalinism to Anarcho-communism.
