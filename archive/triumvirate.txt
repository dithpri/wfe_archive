Called the Triumvirate because of the trio of Executives in power, The Founder, WA Delegate, and elected Leader.

Member nations will not become officers instantaneously, they will have to prove themselves in this region to gain privileges open to the original members of the region.

Polls are held regularly to ask member nations about their opinions on things, and to vote on elections every two weeks, therefore please check the Triumvirate page often to check for new polls.
