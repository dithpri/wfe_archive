Welcome to Dubtopia! If you really want to get the most of your visit you should see our forum at [url=http://justdubsonline.net/forum/]JustDubs Online[/url]. There you can meet people to talk about those great (and not so great) anime. We also like to goof around and play games so the atmosphere is pretty relaxed.

[nation]Alpha Empire[/nation] will be retiring it&amp;#39;s delegate to the World Assembly. The council feels it is time to free itself from it&amp;#39;s laws. 

The council has also seen fit to keep all delegate powers with the founder so no funny business :)
