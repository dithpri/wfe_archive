Welcome to Dubtopia! Right now zombies are propping up all over the place as police and military forces struggle to quarantine them. 

The Alpha Empire as well as it&amp;#39;s vassel nation Ajora are working hard for a cure. Sadly the Nyan Knights of the Table decided a kill them all strategy fits them best. All contact was lost with the head of the Panzer Nyan expedition force in Onett as well.
