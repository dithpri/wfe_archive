[b][u][color=purple]NEW REGION FLAG EVERYBODY![/color][/b][/u]
Okay so technically it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; as it&amp;#39;s been around for a while now and I been too lazy to change it myself. As a boost we got two mascots on the flag! You know what they say about two heads are better and so on. If you happen to be one of our great artists at the site and think you can do better then please let me know!
