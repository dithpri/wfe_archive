[b]The Leftist Union Treaty Organization ([region=LUTO]) is a union of leftist member regions committed to the protection of Socialism, Communism and Leftist Ideology through the use of force if necessary. We are pacifist, but we will engage in conflict if our sovereignty is infringed. An attack on one is an attack on all.[/b]
