The Successor to New Avalonia and Confederacy of Ashes.
This is a sci-fi region. Any type of governments, tech, or species are allowed, as long as they&#39;re balanced. We don&#39;t use NS stats because we don&#39;t want to bash on newbies or ruin anyone&#39;s day. TG [nation=short]Columbian Patriots[/nation] for entry. If you&#39;re planning on joining our summer rp, send a puppet here: https://www.nationstates.net/region=warden_world_side_rp

Rules:
Whenever someone wants to update their traits or weaknesses, they need to list what&#39;s been updated on the RMB!
You gain 1 trillion per week as a base income, then add traits and weaknesses, with a cap of 20 trillion.
Each week is 1 year in RP.
You get 30 free points to spend.
Alt traits are replacements.
