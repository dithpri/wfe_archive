This is a sci-fi region. Any type of government is allowed, any kinds of tech are allowed, any kinds of species are allowed, as long as they are balanced. We don&#39;t use NS stats because we don&#39;t want to bash on newbies or ruin anyone&#39;s experience. If you want to join the region TG [nation=short]Columbian Patriots[/nation], or [nation=short]Red Alert 2-Transylvania[/nation].

Rule:
Whenever someone wants to update their traits of weaknesses, they need to post a link in the RMB, and list what&#39;s been updated!
