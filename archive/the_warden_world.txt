The Successor to New Avalonia and Confederacy of Ashes.
This is a sci-fi region. Any type of governments, tech, or species are allowed, as long as they&#39;re balanced. We don&#39;t use NS stats. TG [nation=short]Red Alert 2-Transylvania[/nation] for entry. 

Rules:
You gain 100 billion per week as base income, then add traits and weaknesses, with a cap of 2 trillion.
Each week is 1 year in RP.
You get 50 free points to spend on traits, and can get more through adopting weaknesses.
