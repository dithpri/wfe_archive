The Successor to New Avalonia and Confederacy of Ashes. Sci fi, but friendly and accessible to any tech level.

This is a sci-fi region. Any type of government is allowed, any kinds of tech are allowed, any kinds of species are allowed, as long as they are balanced. We don&#39;t use NS stats because we don&#39;t want to bash on newbies or ruin anyone&#39;s experience.

Rule:
Whenever someone wants to update their traits of weaknesses, they need to post a link in the RMB, and list specifically what has been updated!
