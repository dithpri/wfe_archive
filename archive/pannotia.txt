Pannotia is a re-emerged ancient continent formed by the combination of Florida Men and Sky Turtles parting the sea spectacularly, as well as drift of pre-existing continents and islands to form a new large, far-off land.  We are home to a variety of nations, small and large, extremist and moderate, as well as occasional conflict and power-struggles.  All nations are free to participate, writing their own page in the history books of this strange, unorthodox land.
