The Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) is a union in which countries that share social and liberal political views work together and stand together.
We believe in human rights and equality.
All countries who share our (progressive) political views are welcome to join.
We value (all forms of) freedom and democracy.
We are a community of people who enjoy playing and want to share experiences.
Our goal is to work together, help each other, and enjoy the game. We do not provide strict rules about what you should do or not do.
Let&#39;s build a strong and vibrant community together.
