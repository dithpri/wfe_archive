The Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) is a union in which countries that share social and liberal political views work together and stand together.
We believe in human rights and equality.
It is our opinion that a union can only function when it consists of countries that share the same or similar views.
All countries who share our (progressive) political views are welcome to join.
We value (all forms of) freedom and democracy,
and we don&#39;t tolerate racism/fascism or any kind of oppression.
Countries that don&#39;t meet our criteria will be removed.
The objective of the PDA is strong diplomatic relations within our union and with our (international) allies.
Let&#39;s build a strong and vibrant community together.
