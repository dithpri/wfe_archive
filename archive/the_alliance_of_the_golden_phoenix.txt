This Alliance strives to give Freedom, Understanding, Knowledge, Rights, and Equality.

We make sure people have the freedom to do what ever they want. To understand others as they are, to know what happens in the world, to have rights to their freedoms, and to be equal with others.

Weekly Nation of the Week:

Senatus Populusque Phoenixus 
(Senate and People of the Phoenix)

We mostly love democratic nations, since we give people power. We are a peaceful region that do not strive mostly for war, but for diplomacy and peace.
