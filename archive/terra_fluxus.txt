Terra Fluxus is a newly discovered region located in the uncharted backwards of the western spiral of a group of islands located in the mid-Pacific Region. Maps have been attempted to fully document this region, however, due to natural shifting of tectonic plates the islands naturally move around and change location. This has lead to various interesting developments in geopolitics and kept Terra Fluxus somewhat isolated.
