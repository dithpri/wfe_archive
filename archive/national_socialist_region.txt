[i][color=grey]For those regarded as warriors, 
when engaged in combat, 
the vanquishing of thine enemy 
can be the warrior&amp;#39;s only concern. 
Suppress all human emotion and compassion. 
Destroy whoever stands in thy way, 
even if that be Lord God or Buddha himself. 
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.
