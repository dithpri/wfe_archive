Capitalism is destructive to the rights of the majority. It is not a government &#147;of, by and for the people.&#148; The existing government and state&#151;the military, police, intelligence agencies, courts, prisons, bureaucracy and so on&#151;defend the interests of the capitalist class. A monstrous profit driven machine has imprisoned the globe under its infuence. This system thrives on class disparity, never ending war, and a submissive working class to take the brunt of the financial burden. A new dawn rises for humanity. Join us.
