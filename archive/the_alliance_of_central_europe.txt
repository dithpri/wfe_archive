[b][region]The Iron Legion[/region]&amp;#39;s [color=#0000BF]Leonidas Squadron[/color] formation tears through the skies of [region]The Alliance of Central Europe[/region] as a storm-siren betokening a new turning point in human history. Surrounding stars are engulfed in fiery blaze, false idols shatter into shards of clay. A single national class has emerged from the chaos of political separatism and class warfare to declare themselves the Guardians of the New Order.

The Fascist Century has arrived.
