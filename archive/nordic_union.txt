The Nordic Union was created by two liberal and democratic nations. It wishes to continue the tradition of the democratic process, but also wishes to invite all ideologies into a fair, and politically free environment.
- Elections are bi-monthly and only World Assembly members may vote in elections. However legislation will in the future be passed, to allow non-WA members to participate in the political process.
