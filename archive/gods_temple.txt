God&#39;s Temple is a theocratic society that values faith, intelligence, obedience, and purity. Our leaders are revered for their wisdom and piety. As a member, you will be expected to uphold high standards of morality and conduct.

Our religious life centers around a magnificent gnostic temple, where our most devout citizens gather to worship, offer sacrifices, and seek guidance from our holy leaders. Our traditions are steeped in ancient rituals, and sacred texts passed down through generations of faithful adherents.
