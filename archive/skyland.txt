It is the 23rd century; the Earth has shattered into billions of pieces which orbit around a central core. In this new world named Skyland, an evolved form of humans has appeared: Seijins, beings with supernatural powers activated by sunlight. Skyland is ruled by the Sphere, an organization which controls the fragmented blocks water supplies and maintains its power thanks to Guardians - promising Seijin children who have been taken away from their families and given a special training. Some Seijins have escaped the Sphere and joined a group of rebel pirates to fight against it&#39;s oppression.
