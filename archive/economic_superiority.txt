Essentially we value money over freedom and basically everything. It&#146;s ADVISED to have a tax rate of 30% and lower. You don&#146;t have to have terrible freedom but just as long as your economy is better then you pass.

Other than all of those rules it&#146;s pretty chill here. Polls will be posted every day, and embassies will be requested regularly. We have occasional Economy Checks. Basically running over user&#146;s economic status and finding ways of improving them. The Officer of Economic Checks, [nation]-Zed-[/nation], will do a check up after which the Officer Of Economical Improvement, [nation]Queconom[/nation], will do more research on your situation. Try to keep your economy over 75.00, if you&#146;re lower you have a week to fix the situation.
