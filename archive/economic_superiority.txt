Essentially we value money over freedom and basically everything. It&#146;s ADVISED to have a tax rate of 30% and lower. You don&#146;t have to have terrible freedom but just as long as your economy is better than you pass.

Other than all of those rules it&#146;s pretty chill here. Polls will be posted every day, and embassies will be requested every minute. We have occasional Economy Checks. Basically running over user&#146;s economic status and finding ways of improving them. The Founder [nation]Zex Mafia[/nation] will do a check up which the Officer Of Economical Improvement [nation]Queconom[/nation] will do more research on your situation.

Also while you&#146;re at it, why not endorse Westspringdalleyfield? He&#146;s your 2nd in command leader and he represents Economic Superiority.
