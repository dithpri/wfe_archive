This is a Region for Europa Union Puppets, They can be used in RPing, to have a RP usable State you must invade the Land.

All Puppets may intervene in EU politics, but as a puppet state of a nation.
They can be granted independence with proof that they aren&#39;t a puppet anymore, and will be given a EU vote.
If you aren&#39;t a puppet you may not join.
But what you can do is move to the [region]Europa Union[/region]!

Also note that Puppets my get a place on the map, but only one nation.
