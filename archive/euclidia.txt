As The Speaker (Owner of the region) i say people may do what ever they like when they like. If someone is unable to respond to something, eg. being invaded, it will only come into effect when they are able to get back onto nationstates, else anything is fair game unless [b]The Speaker[/b] or the [b]WA Delegate[/b] say otherwise.
