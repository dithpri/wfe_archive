Welcome friends to Ecotopia, a green, eco-friendly region of peace loving folk. The region is open to all and there is only one rule: no invaders or region crashers. 

I&amp;#39;ve created a new blog for the Ecotopia Region that has my bio and I hope we can have some great 

discusions. [url=http://nsecotopia.blogspot.com/]Ecotopia Blog[/url] 

WA Delegate: Allemonde- btw my name is Nick if anyone wants to know.
