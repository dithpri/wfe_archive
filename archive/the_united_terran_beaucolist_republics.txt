The United Terran Beaucolist Republics (UTBR) are a federation of like-minded NationStates who feel that in order for Humanity to not only survive, but thrive then we must unite as a race and focus our energy outward. While the UTBR&#39;s main focus is towards expansion, it also encourages technological development, social cohesiveness, and economic efficacy. The member states of the UTBR have the freedom to rule their nation to a sizable degree as it is the belief that the government that governs closest to the people governs the best. The UTBR economy is a finely tuned and liberally oiled machine, and all member states must use the UTBR Credit in interstate trade.
