Cziskilamonia, a region beset by difficulties in an increasingly secular world (Well, except for the Disputed Territories of Perilous Danger, darn socialists...) and the lack of morals that it has brought about. Only through cooperation, and working together may, as the region inhabitants put it, the &amp;quot;best way&amp;quot; of governance be achieved. (Though some disagree on what that form is!) Each nation is left to its own devices, mainly, and is allowed to make any choice it desires, for the most part, by their fellow governments.
