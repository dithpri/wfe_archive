A land of beautiful mountains and their valleys, stunning fjords and numerous islands form the geography of this cool northern region. Various kingdoms, republics and many other nations have risen and fallen, or gave way to the yearning of their populations, since their settlement in hallowed antiquity. But today only a few would survive in this land to become what they are today, the forward thinking and robust nations which share a common historic bond sure to hold them together in even the worst crisis this millennium could hold for this land and its peoples.
