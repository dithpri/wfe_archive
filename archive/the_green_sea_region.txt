 The Green Sea Region is a region in central Asia. The region has had its fair share of bloodshed in the past decade, such as the Flashpoints of both Chernarus and the Kingdom of Takistan. After the US led coalition efforts in the most recent flashpoint in Takistan in 2012, foreign assets from both Russia and UN-based nations have been withdrawn, and the region left to build up from the remnants of war.

 The region is involved in a region-wide conflict known as &amp;#39;The First Invasion of Sarim&amp;#39;. So far, the region has suffered almost 1 billion casualties.
