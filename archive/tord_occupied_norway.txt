Welcome to Tord-Occupied Norway, a cozy little region where you can rest safely. The nation is protected with a password, but you can join by TG&#39;ing [nation]TordVPN[/nation] while they&#39;re online with a request to join. 

This also serves as where the puppets of [nation]Anarchals[/nation] and [nation]The Marions[/nation] reside, protecting them from all outside influence.

[i][b]There is no endorsement limit![/i][/b] Anybody who becomes a WA Delegate (if that ever happens) can discuss matters of state 1 on 1 with TordVPN, but [i]NEVER[/i] try to unlock the region or spread the password without permission. We want this to be a safe region away from the horrors of raids and bots.

With that all out the way, welcome to your [i]new communal paradise![/i]
