The Continent of Africa in a post apocalyptical alternative 1970&#39;s that&#39;s infested with hostile aliens, sentient robots, ancient resurrected &quot;old gods&quot;/physically manifested demons, &amp; other super-natural/esoteric &amp; retro sci-fi threats/elements. As if it wasn&#39;t already a crazy place to live in.
