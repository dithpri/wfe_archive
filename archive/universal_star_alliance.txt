An alliance of nations working on behalf to unite humanity across the stars.

Send a request to Necromancershift on skype for addition to the official Skype group.

Our main goal is to establish political and military allies to as many nations as possible to unite humanity. All others must be exterminated.

As we unite, we are not fully peaceful. War is always an option.

Countries in the Region are considered full &amp;quot;employees&amp;quot;.

If we have an Embassy with a region, then they are part of the alliance. They may ask for RP Members/RP Help/Military/Political Assistance, to the best of our abilities.

See Pinned Factbook Post for Master Post and Alliance list.

This Region is Roleplay based.
