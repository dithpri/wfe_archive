[u][b][color=maroon]Welcome to Lerodas![/color][/b][/u]

We were established on April 14th 2020, and have grown significantly since. At our highest point, we were home to [b]152[/b] nations! Currently, Lerodas is going through some major changes to improve the region and to regain our long lost glory. 
On January 2nd 2023, we were the featured region of the day. This significantly increased the number of nations residing here and, as a region, we aim for that figure to only keep climbing from here.
