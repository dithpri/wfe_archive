ATTENTION ALL RESIDENTS OF IMPEROSPHERE:

 Due to recent efforts by our founder, [nation]Socialist Republic of Andrew[/nation], and [nation]Oceara[/nation], we have decided as a region to return to the [region]Empire of Andrew[/region], the old home of many of our nations, where we shared prosperity, growth, and activity. As a result, you will notice many nations leaving Imperosphere for this newly reclaimed Empire of Andrew. Please do not be alarmed, it is a sort of mass migration to greener pastures. We hope that all of you will accompany us- it is to be a new beginning, and a time of peace and prosperity for all of us. Please direct any questions to myself, the temporary head of the region charged with directing this migration. Thank you.
