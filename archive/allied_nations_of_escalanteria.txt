Welcome to the ANE! Here we welcome any nations willing to unite under our banner.
Our history is as rich as our culture and natural beauty. In 1598, explorer Manuel Escalante discovered the uninhabited islands he named after him self. All of Escalanteria was a Spanish colony for long but now we are independent and are glad to invite and welcome any nations willing to settle on one of our many islands.
