The Coalition of Democratic States or CDS, is an intergovernmental military alliance some-what based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party. CDS&amp;#39;s HQ has no official location, but a temporary one in Des Moines, Iowa. The Coalition also promotes free-speach, free press, and free elections among member and other states. Also it works as a peacekeeping force in troubled regions, and promotes trade among members.
