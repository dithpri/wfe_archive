To congregate the small nations of the southern peninsula surrounding the inland sea into a unified force that protects its citizens and the liberty of the people from the massive corrupt nations of the west, the vandal nations of the south, and overseas enemies. That is this alliance&amp;#39;s goal.
TILL ALL ARE ONE.
