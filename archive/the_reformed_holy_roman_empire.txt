The Reformed Holy Roman Empire is a modern-day version of the Holy Roman Empire, which has both a emperor and a elected body.

The Grand Chamber is the main legislative body, with the Emperor being head of state. The Emperor is mainly a figurehead, however he has select prerogative powers which can be used to ensure nothing extreme is passed.

The Prime Minster is the leader of the largest party in the chamber, and can select his own cabinet. The chamber is elected on a popular vote method, with votes taken from across the entire empire.
