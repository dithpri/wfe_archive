Welcome, we are bodies and Nations united under the Christian Trinity as Signatories to our Charter of Coalition. The Chartered Members gather in Coalition Assembly at Redeemer Palace to refine the Charter, decide Coalition stances &amp;amp; resolve issues.

&amp;quot;STRENGTH THOUGH UNITY, UNITY THROUGH FAITH&amp;quot;
