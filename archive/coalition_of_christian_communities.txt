[b]I&amp;#39;m feeling a bit bored today, so I have decided to troll all you Christians out there. Thanks to Cerian for this idea.

&#147;To be fair, much of the Bible is not systematically evil but just plain weird, as you would expect of a chaotically cobbled-together anthology of disjointed documents, composed, revised, translated, distorted and &amp;#39;improved&amp;#39; by hundreds of anonymous authors, editors and copyists, unknown to us and mostly unknown to each other, spanning nine centuries&#148;

&#147;...when two opposite points of view are expressed with equal intensity, the truth does not necessarily lie exactly halfway between them. It is possible for one side to be simply wrong.&#148;

I am only doing this as a joke, so please don&amp;#39;t get too angry.
