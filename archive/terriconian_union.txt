Founded in 2013, the Terriconian Union was founded under the revolutionary political ideology of Federal Socialism. A concept that believes in a strong welfare state with partial government control in all businesses. FeeSoc believes in defending oneself, only to attack those who threaten the belief of FedSoc. We refuse to acknowledge religion in any form of politics or buissiness. All devotion to FedSoc.
