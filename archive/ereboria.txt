The Region of Ereboria is a mountainous region. Although it has only one isolated mountain in its capital, it lies far over the Hazy Mountains cold, two dungeons deep and caverns old. If you must away, for your vacation stay, you&#39;ll find we have no forgotten gold. The pines were roaring on the heights, where our primer Amphitheater awaits you, the winds were moaning in the night, from the luxury spas our country is renowned for. The fire was red its flaming spread but have no worries the dragon is dead, the trees like torches blazed with light, come and join our luxurious nights.
