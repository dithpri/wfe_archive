[b][i]I&#39;ve had you underneath the heel on my boots
Many times before and I can do it again
The blood runs cold on the fence
I have already made damage
And I will finish what I started
On and off, one day the switch will retire
The bones will keep breaking
But you think it&#39;s nothing to worry about
You&#39;ve cried your eyes before, oh lord I bet you have just now
Wait for the sound of the crack[/i][/b]
