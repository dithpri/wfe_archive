The Sovereign Memist Union of Trogdor was formed in the wake of the disastrous &quot;Union of Falcon Grit&quot; which was disbanded in 2081 after parting ways with the Bailtion Dictatorship. Other than a change in name, the Union consisted of the same countries that had previously been a part of The Union of Falcon Grit years prior.
