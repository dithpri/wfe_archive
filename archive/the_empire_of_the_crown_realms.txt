By decree of the High Crown and under the eternal light of the sun, the scattered realms are brought together beneath one imperial banner. The Empire of the Crown Realms unites kings and dukes, nobles and lords, under the divine mandate of the Throne.

From shining citadels and sun-forged banners, the Crown Realms stand eternal, an empire of loyalty, fire, and dominion. Each vassal kingdom swears its fealty to the Emperor&#146;s crown, and each realm&#146;s honour is bound into the greater destiny of the Empire.

Motto: In Light, Dominion. In Dominion, Eternity.
