The land of Flotsam is a place where all nations are equal and have agreed to leave each other alone. It consists of rolling hills, the ever-stretching Astronomy Domine Mountains, and the crown jewel of the land, Flotsam Lake. There are rumors that an ancient civilization once thrived in the now center of the mammoth lake. Scientists are still trying to solve the mystery of its disappearance, but most believe the lake was once grasslands that were lost in either a massive earthquake, or wiped out by a giant meteor/UFO crash.
