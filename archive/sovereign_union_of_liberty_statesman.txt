1783, a nation was born from a fiery passion of freedom, and liberty from authoritative government. A passion for rights of the people and the state, a passion for a commonwealth that not only gives the citizens personal social rights; but also their own personal economic choices, as long as they don&#39;t impede on other&#39;s rights of course. We create this union to make these ideals reborn to breathe again, in the name of Liberty, Sovereignty, and Stability. 


This document holds our dearest beliefs, and signifies that this Union only allows freedom of the state and people.
