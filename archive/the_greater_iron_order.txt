[b][color=#1f75b7]The (Greater) Iron Order[/color][/b], known shortly by its acronym, [color=#1f75b7][b]T.I.O.[/b][/color], is a global organization of nationalistic fascists bent on the  hostile takeover of[color=#ed221c] [i][b]The Pacifics[/b][/i][/color], a group of regions run by a cabal of communists, anime fans, medical students,  and vegans. The shadowy cult that administers these regions as the soul puppeteer is the [color=#ed221c][b]N.P.O.[/b][/color], our sworn enemy headquartered in the regions known as [color=#ed221c]&#39;[b]The Pacific[/b]&#39;[/color] and [color=#ed221c]&#39;[b]The West Pacific[/b]&#39;[/color]. Soon, we will bring peace, prosperity, and the liberation of all of these regions, as well as their commie allies. [b][color=#1f75b7]Viva La Fascismo![/b][/color]
