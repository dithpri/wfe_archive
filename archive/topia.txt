Topia is a large continent between the American and Asian Oceans. Land of all the famous nations such as Bigtopia and Maxtopia. Countries so big that most people will end up bordering at least one of them.

The point of this region is to make it so all of the issues make more sense. Why would your nation have issues with Bigtopians and violetists in Eastern Europe for example?
