[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by! 

Possibly the most to the point raid I&amp;#39;ve ever done. Heart was beating rather fast. Somerset Guard leading the way to some minor glory.... keep up you others!

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

With thanks to [region]Albion[/region], where Knights woo the Dames and Dragons sit in the mountains.[/b]
