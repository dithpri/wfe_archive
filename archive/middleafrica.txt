[i]The Region of Middle-Africa was a once largely populated region with many prestigious nations held within. These nations convened at the Middle African Council to discuss matters of monetary, military, and domestic issue. The Downfall of the region as a whole is a mystery in itself, and the total disappearance of the populations has left many to speculate. However, the grand accomplishments and cities of the nations still stand as solemn testaments to the industriousness of their former sovereigns.[/i]
