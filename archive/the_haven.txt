[color=purple][b]!!!THE HAVEN!!![/color]

[color=blue]A place of safety and retreat. A world without worries. Not as good as [region]Fairy Tale Land[/region] where all your dreams come true, but this is the best your gonna get because that place doesn&#39;t exist.
But even still, The Haven sells sanctuary and asylum to any and all nations whether or not they&#39;re on the run. And even though we can&#39;t make your dreams come true, we can still get rid of your nightmares.[/color]

[color=purple]All nations of all types are welcome: left wing, right wing, up wing, down wing, you name it.
Even nations that are at war with with each other are welcome. Just don&#39;t start any trouble because this is The Haven, and we are a neutral parley zone when it comes to war. We are the keepers of peace, and this is a hideout for all.[/b][/color]
