[b]This region is just an informative tribute to what could have been a great, safe and welcoming region.[/b]

We have been betrayed, by the bloody daggers of the traitors, [region]New Valdoria[/region] and [region]Valdoria[/region] have both fallen.

The ashes has been swept away by the wind
The [color=blue]Valdorian Dream[/color] is no more.

The dove is finally free once again, no longer chained under the false hope of Valdoria, a region that was not meant to be.
