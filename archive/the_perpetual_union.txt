[b][color=darkblue]Welcome to the[/color] [color=red]Perpetual Union[/color][/b]

[hr]

[b][i][color=blue]This is the puppet storage region for the long-standing nation of [nation=short]North America and the Great Lakes[/nation], and his collection of puppets. Within these halls reside a perpetual union of American states, and the various puppets of histories that could have been. Feel free to look through my factbooks if you wish, or go on through and off to a new region. Thanks for stopping, and may this union be perpetual. [/b][/i][/color]
