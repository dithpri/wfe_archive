The Grand Sonora Valley is a vast expanse of land in North America. It is located in the southwestern United States, primarily within southeastern California and southern Nevada, and it occupies a total of 307,877 square miles. The nation&#39;s diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sonora Nevada mountain range in the east, and from the redwood&#150;Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. Though the region is well-known for its warm Mediterranean climate, the large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains.
