In the kingdom of Emporios, every aspect of the region&#39;s management is cared for by an elite team of Managers. There are many different roles in our region.
The Security Team: The safety Manager Unit
The Information Committee: Sending out dispatches and telegrams to inform people of the regional news and info
The Political Supervisors: Political needs
The Border Managers: Taking care of the region&#39;s borders
We will send you a telegram of region rules when you join, and you may be assigned to one of the Manager Teams.
It&#39;s a fun region, as we will have polls regularly and little discussions about current events.
I&#39;m the leader, Galadoria. If you want a fun, enjoyable NationStates experience, this is for you!
