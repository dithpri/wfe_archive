Hic Sunt Dracones, a mist-shrouded collection of heavily forested islands located somewhere at the end of the world. A faint sound of Langoliers eating time (perhaps it&amp;#39;s just water flowing off the edge of the world) lulls residents to sleep as it has been doing to the tardigrade population since time immemorial. Residents grow flavanoid-filled glow-in-the-dark chocolate mint mushrooms on composted tardigrade poop and harvest jumbo shrimp from estuaries. The islanders have an inexhaustible supply of thorium for residential nuclear reactors. Radioactive by-product is carved into talismans and sent as gifts to career politicians around the globe. Politically incorrect atheists and freethinkers live peacefully in scattered villages.
