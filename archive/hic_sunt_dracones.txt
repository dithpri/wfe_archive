Faint sound of Langoliers eating time (or perhaps it&amp;#39;s just water draining off edge) lulls residents to sleep as it has the tardigrade population since time immemorial.  
Island chain has inexhaustible supply of thorium for residential nuclear reactors. Radioactive by-product carved into little trinkets, sent as gifts to career politicians around globe. 
Objectivist philosophy is espoused. Politically incorrect atheists and freethinkers live peacefully in small, scattered villages.
