The East Phirod Islands are a group of beautiful perfect climate islands that are populated by the great people of United East Phirod. There are Native tribes on certain islands but they are not to be disturbed as they were there before the Nation was formed and the region was founded, The East Phirod government strongly believes that these natives should be monitored (Of course very far away from the island they are inhabiting) to discover more about there ancient way of life.
