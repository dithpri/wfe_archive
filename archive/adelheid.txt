&quot;From the seeds of restlessness, grows anarchy.&quot;- Chancellor Link P. , Phadonian Union

From the ashes of empires long since passed and forgotten by history, rises greatness. Adelheid was an ancient order of leaders driven by the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. After the first civil war of Phaendal however, the society was exiled, and thought to have been eliminated.  It lay unheard of for many centuries until the 3rd Civil War, which usurped the Republic in favor of an Authoritarian Regime. Through careful manipulation, Adelheid gained respect and many followers throughout the regions. Now, it has become the forefront in Phadonian Politics and has plans to spread its reach.
