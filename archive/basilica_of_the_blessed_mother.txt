Welcome to the in-game headquarters of the Autocephalous Gotesbourg Catholic Church. You do not need to be a member of this region to take part in the Church, this region exists for the ease of documentation, mostly.

This Church is a roleplay group where we simulate Church government and also have the real life mission of bringing the church to others via NationStates. As such, in the lore, this Church is part of the Universal Church, but exists outside of the Latin Church while still in communion with the Pope of Rome.

The Church is overseen by the Patriarch, which at this time is His Beatitude Joseph I.

If you are interested in joining the Church, please send a message here, or contact the Patriarch himself at [nation]Routcher[/nation].
