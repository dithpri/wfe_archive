[region]The Apprentices of Andrew[/region] otherwise known as the AoA, is a region founded by [nation]Hollmannlandia[/nation], and co-founder [nation]Nordic Peninsula[/nation]. [nation]Hollmannlandia[/nation] broke away and destroyed the former region of the Union of Westminster and Associates in order to create a more powerful and well-respected region. This is a region that does not turn away many nations. However, certain standards are required if you want to be in the region. The AoA asks that each nation reach [i]50+[/i] on the big three categories: civil rights, economy, and political freedoms. If a nation fails to reach this mark in an allotted time, given by a delegate or founder, they will be evaluated and may be ejected from the region.
