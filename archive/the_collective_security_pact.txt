The Collective Security Pact is a fiscal and military faction responsible for ensuring international peace in our territories.

We provide each other with
- Military Equipment
- Military Convoys
- Naval docking rights
- Pacts to defend each other


We give eachother aid in times of need. Despite us being a small security faction, our power should never be underestimated.


We have members in the world assembly, and we are trying to expand onto our presence in the world assembly.
