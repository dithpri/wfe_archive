The Collective Security Pact is a fiscal and military faction responsible for ensuring international peace in our territories.

We provide each other with
- Military Equipment
- Military Convoys
- Naval docking rights
- Pacts to defend each other


We give eachother aid in times of need. Despite us being a small security faction, our power should never be underestimated.


We have members in the world assembly, and we are trying to expand onto our presence in the world assembly. 

Do not appoint any other members that are not trusted allies and are sure to abuse their power, doing so will result you get kicked/banned
