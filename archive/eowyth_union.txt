Welcome to Fast Food My Way!  I&amp;#39;m your host [nation]Pepin Supremacy[/nation] and today we are cooking the magnificent [region]Eowyth Union[/region] loaf.  Remember to always drink wine when you cook, it will improve the flavour more than any single ingredient.

We begin by chopping swellvania and hung kung.  Remember when cleaning the hung kung to slice him from the ends to thoroughly wash him.  Next add some Eowyth, this is the main ingredient.  Now I add Euca, which will emulsify the mixture.  Put in the oven at 350 F for an hour, and what a dish we will have!
