The Cardassian Empire is a region mimicking the structure and government of the Cardassian Empire from Star Trek. Although nations don&#39;t have to join the regional RP, which will be based on Star Trek, they&#39;re certainly encouraged to! 

The regional RP will start right after the occupation of Bajor ends, and will cover events such as the dissident movement and the Dominion War. Nations will either play as individual characters or small groups of people (ie, the crew of a particular ship or the population of a small planet). A brief bio is encouraged, but not required.

When the region gets up and running, there will be a Detapa Council (legislative), Central Command (military), and Obsidian Order (intelligence).

Have fun and Long Live Cardassia!
