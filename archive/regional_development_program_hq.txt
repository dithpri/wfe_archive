Hello, my main nation is [nation]Trivalve[/nation]!

The regional development program is program that is centred around supporting and building smaller regions so that they can thrive. All operations run will be done under my alt [nation]Sodium Hydride[/nation] (will be run under [nation]Trivalve[/nation] soon). It is my hope that I can support a wide variety of regions so that they have have a better chance to become highly developed regions.
