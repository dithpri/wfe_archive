[b][i][color=red]With sincere and utmost apologies, we depart this region and give it back to the natives. We have strayed far from our original goal of freeing you from the Black Riders, and placed you under our own selfish control. We tend to forget that if we do whatever we want, we scorn others.

Utmost apologies,
The New Dawn Party, Oriental Governor of Gods Holy Empire[/color][/i][/b]
