We have escaped from the communists in [region]Right to Life[/region]! This is [region]The Inquisition[/region], led by our great Supreme Leader [nation=The_Patrimony_of_Saint_Peter]! This is the Traditionalist Catholic Inquisition and we shall overthrow the tyrannical liberals known as [nation=Culture_of_Life] and the Right to Life Senate. We have escaped degenerate Democracy. We have escaped liberalism! Welcome.
