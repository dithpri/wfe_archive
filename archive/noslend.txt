[b]Noslend is a region in an alternative Quebec ruled by a democratically elected president.
After a fascist victory in World War 2, where Pearl Harbor never happened and the Axis ruled almost all of Europe and Northern Asia. Survivors of the war, mostly Soviets fled to the new world through the Bering Strait and the Atlantic. They traveled as nomads from the harsh, bitter environment of Alaska and Yukon all the way down south to Quebec City where they fought a brutal war against the Kingdom of Quebec, before taking over everything south of the St. Lawrence River, now named the Jacob River, which included Montreal (now named Noslend Island) and the Thousand Islands.[/b]
