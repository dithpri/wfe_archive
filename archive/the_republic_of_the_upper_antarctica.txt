[color=Green] Whether you&amp;#39;re here to join, or just looking, we thank you for coming, but before you go anywhere, we have a few basic rules
1) Be respectful. As much as this sounds like a grade school rule, it is actually not that bad of a rule, and should be followed at most times
2) Don&amp;#39;t be a b*tch. I know this is hard for some people (Azmorica...) but please, don&amp;#39;t be one
3) Just be nice and friendly in general
4) Please be active and contribute to polls and decisions 
5) Send Recruiting letters to nations and try to establish embassies 
6) Don&amp;#39;t cherry pick new nations in challenges just for points
