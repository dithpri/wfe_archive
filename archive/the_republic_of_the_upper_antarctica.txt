                      [color=Blue] Welcome to the great region of Upper Antartica! [/color]
[color=Purple] Whether you&amp;#39;re here to join, or just looking, we thank you for coming, but before you go anywhere, we have a few basic rules
1) Be respectful. As much as this sounds like a grade school rule, it is actually not that bad of a rule, and should be followed at most times
2) Don&amp;#39;t be a b*tch. I know this is hard for some people (Azmorica...) but please, don&amp;#39;t be one
3) Just be nice and friendly in general
4) no using profanity. If you use profanity, i will shove a knife up your a** you f*cking dumba**
remember, these are just basic rules, and more might be added.
