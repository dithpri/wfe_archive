The Order of the Kek is comprised of Kekistani enthic minorities who emigrated and founded new nations. Although we no longer live in the Holy Land of Kekistan, we are loyal to its noble cause. The Order works eternally to spread the word of Kek, establish ties with all other Kekistani regions and nations, fight all forms of Antifa wherever they may appear, and defend the Holy Land - Kekistan itself.

Kek Vult!
