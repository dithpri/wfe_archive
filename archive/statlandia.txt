Statlandia is a region meant to be more of a joke, and so anybody can join.It should not be taken too seriously and will hopefully just be a place where some nations can let loose and hang out together.
I hope that this can be pleasant, but there are rules.(Rules may be updated as I continue with this region)

1.Put-Downs or Bullying Will Result in Ejection.

2.Serious threats will lead to you being banned.However, if the threat is a good-natured joke that the people you&#39;re posting to can laugh at, then it&#39;s OK.

3.If you are ejected but not banned, it is essentially time-out of detention.You have to leave for a specific amount of time.You will be banned if you come back too early, but if its just by a minute or two, it&#39;s OK.
