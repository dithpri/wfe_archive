Welcome Everyone! This is a new region, who is willing to prosper! As soon as we get a few more nations into Bayou Nepacane, all membering nations will be able to elect a WA Delegate, all nations have the right to run for this position. All nations will be able to have freedom of speech, specified rights (which will be listed on the Region blog,) access to the region blog (which is under construction,) run for regional office, and everyone will have right to vote in any and all future elections! A Map will be soon established, contact the Founder to apply for a map place.
