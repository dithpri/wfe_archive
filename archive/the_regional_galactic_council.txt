We are a star-wars-loving region devoted to thought and discussion. Even if you are not interested or do not know about Star Wars, or the conflict, friendship, and adventure that is undertaken by a team of underdogs in the Millenium Falcon, you may join! 
As long as you create a friendly environment, we welcome you with open arms! 
Our founder is [nation]ITrea[/nation], and our second-in-command is [nation]Moorse[/nation]!
