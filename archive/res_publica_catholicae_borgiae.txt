The [region]Coalition of Catholic States[/region] may have perished in name but her successors will carry on her name and her integrity.

Welcome to the Borgian Catholic Republic, the Res Publica Catholicae Borgiae. This is a region will have regional RP and government. This will be combined at sometime in the future. We are a region dedicated to the tenets of the Catholic Faith, but are open to nations and players of all backgrounds. It makes things much more livelier.
