The Eos is an Earth-like planet, which is inhabited by a Human population. The founding nations of Cyrac and Bhorgz colonized Eos after the devastating Delian Wars, which left the home planet in ruin. The geography is very similar to that of Delia, and with only 3 continents, and varying climate zones.
The member nations of Eos are well-prepared to protect their home, with superior military capability through technology and training.
