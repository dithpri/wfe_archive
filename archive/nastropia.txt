[b][u]Could everyone move their mains to [region]Arvadia[/region] as we have merged with them. Only transfer your main and at most one puppet if you must. Nastropia will endure as a puppet storage for the foreseeable future and the limit on nations has been suspended.[/u][/b]

[color=green]What we stand for:
The Members of Nastropia are those who stand for greatness. They stand for freedom and liberty, strength in words and 
actions. While all nations are free to worship whoever they please the official religion is Nastroism [/color]
[u][b]Viva Nastropia![/b][/u]
