Nastropia
Forged in the fire
But from the ashes a great empire be formed 
An empire that never sets 
And love that never dies
Friends are welcome
But enemies are forever doomed

The Members of Nastropia are those who stand for greatness. They stand for freedom and liberty, strength in words and actions.
