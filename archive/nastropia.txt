[b][color=red]The Pledge of nastro:[/color][/b]
[color=blue]Nastropia
Forged in the fire,
But from the ashes a great empire be formed, 
An empire on which the sun never sets,
An empire of fire that shall never be extinguished 
An empire of water that shall never dry out, 
We stand together side by side in arms, 
Through the good times and the bad[/color]

[color=green]What we stand for:
The Members of Nastropia are those who stand for greatness. They stand for freedom and liberty, strength in words and 
actions.[/color]
