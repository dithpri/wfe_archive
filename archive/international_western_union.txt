[b][color=blue]Welcome to the International Western Union.[/color][/b]

The IWU has merged with the [region]International Northern Union[/region] and the [region]International Southern Union[/region] to form the [region]International Northwestern Union[/region].

For 1 year 340 days, the International Western Union has provided home to nations, regardless of their background and origin.

The IWU respectfully embraces its daughter regions, the International Northern Union, the International Southern Union, and the International Arctic Union, for overcoming mixed feelings on the ventures of the daughters and standing to create a name for themselves.

For those who have ever called the IWU a home, we salute you for now and years to come. Without you, the IWU would have never reached the peak it did.
