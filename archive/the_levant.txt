The Levant is the area of Western Asia bounded by the Mediterranean to the west, the Taurus Mountains to the north, the Arabian Desert to the south, and the Syrian Desert to the east. The Levant includes modern Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Territories and corresponds roughly to the historic area of Greater Syria. The Levant has been described as the &quot;crossroads of western Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and northeast Africa.&quot;
