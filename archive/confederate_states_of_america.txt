Welcome to the Confederate States of America, which in an interesting Juxtaposition, was &amp;#39;assisted&amp;#39; in their refounding by the French.

This region is dedicated to the principles that made the confederacy great, like local sovereignty and the principles that would have made it greater, like personal freedom for all and equal justice under the law.

Our bathrooms have warm, freshly laundered towels and hippo attendants who may or may not be former plantation workers. Please do not confuse the tasty mints with the urinal cakes.
