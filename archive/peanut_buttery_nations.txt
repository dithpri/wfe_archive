The Peanut Buttery Nations is a joke region that basically hopes for a economically based region that hopes to grow nation&#39;s economy! We plan to defend and guide all new nations and work as a team while indulging on private debates and public debates and allowing those to open discourse. We hope to include all nations that wish to be included and leave those who wish not to be bothered. We do have an Executive Authority in hope of preserving an economic focus but will still focus on the region&#39;s best interests whether it be an offensive focus.
