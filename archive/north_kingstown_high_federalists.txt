I hurt myself today 
To see if I still feel 
I focus on the pain 
The only thing that&#39;s real 
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting 
Try to kill it all away 
But I remember Everything.

I wear this crown of thorns 
Upon my liar&#39;s chair 
Full of broken thoughts 
I cannot repair 
Beneath the stains of time 
The feelings disappear 
You are someone else 
I am still right here 

If I could start again 
A million miles away 
I would keep myself 
I would find a way
