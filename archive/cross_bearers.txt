Is there too much world in your life? Do you grow weary of how far the world has turned from what the Father desired? We here in Cross Bearers understand that struggle all to well and have decided to band together to anoint this our section of the world with His Holy Water. Come, help us grow and watch over the flock that He hath given. May He watch over you and provide you with His peace. Amen.
