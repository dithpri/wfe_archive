Hladgos is kind bored of The Oubliette due to his own laziness, and will vacate the premises through a cabinet in the wall very soon.

&amp;quot;What is this place?&amp;quot;

&amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s an oubliette.&amp;#39;

&amp;quot;An oubliette, right..&amp;quot;

&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t act like you know what an Oubliette is!&amp;#39;

&amp;quot;Alright, what&amp;#39;s an Oubliette?&amp;quot;

&amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s a place you put people to forget about!&amp;quot;
