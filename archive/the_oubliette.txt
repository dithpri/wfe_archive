Hladgos is kind bored of The Oubliette due to his own laziness, and will vacate the premises through a broom closet in the wall very soon.

&amp;quot;What is this place?&amp;quot;

&amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s an oubliette, labyrinth&amp;#39;s full of em.&amp;#39;

&amp;quot;Really, I didn&amp;#39;t know that..&amp;quot;

&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t act so smart. You don&amp;#39;t even know what an oubliette is!&amp;#39;

&amp;quot;Do you?&amp;quot;

&amp;#39;Yes. It&amp;#39;s a place you put people to forget about!&amp;quot;
