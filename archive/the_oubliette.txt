&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s where you put people to forget about.&amp;quot; -Hoggle

Welcome to The Oubliette. A dank dark place where you&amp;#39;ll have plenty of time to think about nothing in particular, because there&amp;#39;s only one way out, and it&amp;#39;s only for going in. 
Er.. 
That was a little terrifying. Let&amp;#39;s try this again.

WELCOME! Welcome to The Oubliette, where there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing to do but chat about what you&amp;#39;d be doing if you weren&amp;#39;t here! Totally inclusive, since everyone is worth forgetting about (hey!), very chill, since noone is worth worrying about (hey!), and completely devoid of any kind of intelligence, because noone here is very smart (HEY!).

So welcome, and enjoy your fruitless stay in The Oubliette forever!
