[i][color=silver]And all of Ephialtes of Trachis&amp;#39; Black Horses,
And all of Ephialtes&amp;#39; Suomi,
Couldn&amp;#39;t put Sauna together again.

We are the rememberance. 
We are the haunting.
We are the cold breath upon your neck.
No walls will stop us.
No locks will hold us.
We are what haunts you in your sleep.

No longer territory of Suomi.
Now a haunting of Ghosts.[/color][/i]
