[b]Catalunya[/b] (English: Catalonia, Spanish: Catalu&ntilde;a, Aranese: Catalonha) 
is a region which compromises four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. It&amp;#39;s capital is Barcelona.

During the Spanish Civil War, in anarchist-controlled areas, a vast social revolution saw the workers and peasants collectivise land and industry and councils set up. 


Welcome to Catalunya, inspired by Anarchist Catalunya of The Spanish Civil War.
