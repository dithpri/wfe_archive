[color=Blue][u][B]Hello, and Welcome to Kadereon.[/B][/u][hr]
We are an Alternate History Roleplay region set in the modern day. Where most scenarios can happen, The USSR never collapsing, Germany winning the Second World War, Communism never rising in China, and many more. So telegram [nation]The Hojo Shogunate[/nation] for your map claims after reading the Regional Rules shown in the link below. Make sure to watch the map, and be active in RP! Only two puppet states, at a reasonable level. Anymore, and they&#39;ll be kicked. If you make anymore, you&#39;ll also be kicked.
