Welcome!

This is a safe space for conservatives!
Here in the conservative bloc there is only one rule: [b]don&#39;t be a socialist[/b]
The conservative bloc is an economic area that promotes capitalism. Unlike in other regions, the member countries are not obliged to be a democratic or authoritarian state. There is no prime minister or anything that member countries have to listen to, there is only one choice for the secretary general (The Secretary General has no higher rights than the other states.). The member states are also not obliged to be in the World Assembly. (If there are more member states, there can also be roleplay)
