&quot;We are the world of the individual person; the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm or office where he works. Such are the places where every living Beast has. equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.&quot;
&#151;Eleanor Roosevelt, Chair of the United Nations Commission that wrote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948
