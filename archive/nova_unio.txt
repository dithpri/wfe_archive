[b]Nova Unio[/b] (latin for [i]The New Union[/i]) is an intergovermental organisation. It brings together various countries around the globe, that support each other and trade freely. Originally founded as a left-leaning liberal movement, it grew up and reformed to become an international force for unity, peace, safety and serenity.
