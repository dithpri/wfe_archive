This region was captured by the [region]Holy Orthodox Alliance[/region]/[region]Holy Russian Empire[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b], [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b], and other [b]defenders of [color=blue]freedom[/color][/b].

Romanov Russian Empire is now a memorial for the victims of Tsarism, as well as Nicholas II&amp;#39;s family and victims of the Red Terror. Hopefully some day soon, Russia will develop a true democratic republic, free from corruption and crime.
