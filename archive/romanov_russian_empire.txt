This region was occupied by the [region]Holy Orthodox Alliance[/region]/[region]Holy Russian Empire[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b], [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b], and [b]promoters of [color=gold]freedom[/color][/b].

Romanov Russian Empire is now dedicated to both the victims of Tsarism and Nicholas II&amp;#39;s family, who were murdered just as coldly as many a Russian peasant.

For a just Russia, free from corruption and gangsterism!
