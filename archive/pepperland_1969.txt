[b][u][color=#e69138]Why hello!
[/color][/u][/b][color=#cc4125]Bet you thought the legion was dead. Well we aren&#39;t! We were just...resting! We got some fresh blood and we&#39;re ready to rumble.
[/color]
[color=#38761d]Oh and ignore the uh...disappointing results...cause as a wise raider once said [/color][i][color=#6d9eeb]&quot;It&#39;s better to fail 18/20 raids than not raid at all&quot;

[/color][/i]So yeah we are still around and ready to kick butt. Just shaking off some rust and recovering from the loss of our old Moshir. See you around!
