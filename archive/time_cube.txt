[color=medgreen]In 1884, meridian time personnel met
in Washington to change Earth time.
First words said was that only 1 day
could be used on Earth to not change
the 1 day bible. So they applied the 1
day and ignored the other 3 days.
The bible time was wrong then and it
proved wrong today. This a major lie
has so much evil feed from it&amp;#39;s wrong.
No man on Earth has no belly-button,
it proves every believer on Earth a liar.[/color]
