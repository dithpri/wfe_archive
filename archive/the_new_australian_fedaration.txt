When the Australian federation split on the 7/8/2078, each former state or territory split into a country of its own. Each country is backed by one large nation, for example, The United Socialist States Of The Best Australia (formally Western Australia) is backed by China. All ex states or territories are currently on good terms except for Tasbama (formally Tasmania) which due to inbreeding decided to merge with their close allies: Alabama.
