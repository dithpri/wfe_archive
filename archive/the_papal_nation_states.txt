[b][color=blue]Welcome to the Papal Nation States.[/color][/b]

We are a (private) region of many diverse nations, united by a common recognition of the exiled sedevacantist Pope in [nation]Kingsgrove[/nation]. Our community aims to assist in improving our member states&#39; economies, development, civil rights and religiousness, so long as they themselves are willing.

Roleplay is also encouraged, whether this be something as little as saying &#39;heresy&#39;, &#39;deus vult&#39; or rejecting some of the positive (yes, positive) aspects of the modern Church in order to fit in with our theme.

Unlike regions such as the [region]New Cantonberry Bloc States[/region], we [u]do not[/u] bribe nations with powerful offices to get them to join us or inflate our numbers by creating multiple nations and then moving them into the region.
