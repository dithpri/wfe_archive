[color=navy]Temple Prime is an organization with the intent of spreading the truth of Wakeism, the only true religion across the world per &amp;#127350;&amp;#127358;&amp;#127347;&#39;s command. Temple Prime aims to achieve this through the conquest and acquisitions of unruly, abandoned, or dead regions. All of this is to achieve the main goals of Wakeism, which are unity, brotherhood, and the pursuit of eternal happiness/knowledge (also known as divination) So remember brother, if you see a brotherhood patrol, don&#39;t resist, but embrace. For it is you who will lose the chance for peace, unity, and divination.[/color]
