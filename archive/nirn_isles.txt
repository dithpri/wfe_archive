A hub for nations, corporations, and ideologies alike, The Nirn Isles welcomes players eager to explore political intrigue, economic rivalries, military brinkmanship, cybernetic conspiracies, and cultural revolutions in a setting where the present collides with the strange possibilities of post-modernity.
Players are encouraged to build nations, multinational corporations, paramilitary groups, activist movements, and more&#151;crafting stories ranging from political thrillers and noir dramas to dystopian explorations and speculative visions of society&#146;s future.
