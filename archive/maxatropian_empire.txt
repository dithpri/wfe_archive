Founded because we refused to join the Arkronians after the Fall of the Zantoxan Empire. Due to the efforts of a select few Arkronians who were disgraced by our rivals, we were able to locate their new Star System. Under the command of our great Queen, Tano Flux, we have set up our new Empire in a System only 44 light years away from their Empire. Though we are currently at peace, it is not likely to last.
