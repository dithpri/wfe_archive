This Region is a full RPG, you don&#39;t have to go to other forums to role play, just write in the Message Board section to start playing.

That said, as my country is the founder of the Region, I invite everyone to collaborate to create and have fun in the game. There are no limits, every request must always be discussed in the &quot;Message Board&quot; by writing &quot;Off-topic&quot; for any topic that does not concern role play.

We will shape the history, the ministries, the geographical scope of our region and therefore of the United States of Europe.

UNITED WE WILL BE GREAT
