The Greater Durakistani Peninsula contains primarily the nations of Durakistan and East-Durakistan. A great desert lies between the mainland and these two Durakistani states, and an untamed forest lies near the south end of the peninsula, only inhabited by some East-Durakistani who don&#39;t vary their life too highly and a various range of rural tribes.
