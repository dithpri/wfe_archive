The Greater Durakistani Peninsula contains primarily the nation of Durakistan. Outside of this country&#39;s border lies a great desert between the mainland and Durakistan, and an untamed forest near the south end of the peninsula, only inhabited by those who don&#39;t vary their life highly and a various range of tribes.
