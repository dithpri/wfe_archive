A snowy archipelago inhabited by Yetis, Ducks, Berets, Dragons and many other amazing mystical creatures. Each nation exists on its own large island containing many lush forests and sparkling river ways. During the winter the water between the islands freezes over allowing access between neighbouring nations. The political nature of the nations established in the Land of Yetis is both diverse and complex, with few nations seeing eye to eye on common day issues.
