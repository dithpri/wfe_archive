[b]Welcome to the [color=red]TriPeyt Dominion[/color]![/b] We are a power alliance founded by the Three Roses known as the Matriarchy of Nocterae, the United Socialist States of Veliklya, and the Federation of Fernandiland. The region&#39;s name is derived from an ancient draconian language, [i]tri[/i] meaning &quot;three&quot; and [i]peyt[/i] meaning &quot;roses.&quot;

[b][color=red]The Roses of the Dominion[/color][/b] meet at least once a week to discuss regional affairs, policies, proposals, and current issues domestic and foreign.

[u]The Unification Proclamation[/u] was passed, enforcing nations of the Dominion to convert to the new regional currency of the &quot;[b]Parsnip[/b].&quot; Proposed by [b]El Capitan[/b] of the Armed Republic of Stosa, he was given the greatly esteemed [color=green]Rank of Rose[/color], the highest honor within the Dominion.
