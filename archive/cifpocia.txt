Gonna take this opportunity to tell you all you&#39;re the reason that the left is failing to seriously rebuild in country after country as you pit oppressed groups against one another and destroy any chance of solidarity. The only way to fight oppression is to fight together. That doesn&#39;t mean allowing racism to run rampant, no, but it also doesn&#39;t mean saying that white people could never be apart of a struggle to emancipate human society. 
The indigenous struggle in Australia is a prime example. It took the solidarity of WHITE unionists to win substantial victories. 
Trigger warnings won&#39;t end your oppression, hiding behind content warnings leads to passivity and inaction. 
Go out and actually fight.
