An Alliance formed from the ruins of the United Bubian Front. After a brute Civil War between the Dictatorship of the Bub Tub and the Republic of the United Bub Tub, the Alliance split into a rival faction: XezMistezimaDomem. The rivalry between the United Bubian Front and XezMistezimaDomem has caused nations to leave the faction. In referendum, the Integrated Bubian Pact was form. An Alliance to bring peace to the continent of Bub. And hopefully, a new United Front.
