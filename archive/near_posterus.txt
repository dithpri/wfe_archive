[b][color=purple]A little bit about the forum:[/b][/color]
[b][color=black]Near Posterus (Near Future) is a forum based around near future nation roleplay. We remain within the realm of reality but use technology in the 2020s to early 2030s. A lot of our rules are centered around military but all kinds of roleplay are recommended and encouraged. If you have any other questions please message either of the founders.[/b][/color]
[b][color=red] It is also mandatory you endorse [nation]near posterus[/nation] for WA Delegate [/b][/color]
