[b][color=black]Near Posterus is based around near future nation roleplay. We remain within the realm of reality but use technology up to early 2030s. A lot of our rules are centered around military but all kinds of roleplay are recommended and encouraged. If you have any other questions please message either of the founders.[/b][/color]
