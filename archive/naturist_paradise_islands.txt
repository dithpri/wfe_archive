A huge, ecologically vast, environmentally expansive archipelago of thousands and thousands of islands of all shapes and sizes, spaced sporadically across a shallow sea.  So far, only a few nations have colonized less than 1% of the islands, all of them officially nudist (naturist) nations.

Only nudist nations are within the mostly linear regional borders.
