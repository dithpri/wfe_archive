We are currently at DEFCON 4.
Endorse [nation]Bilmar[/nation], our delegate. 
Failure to endorse our delegate may result in ejection and, in rare cases, banning. Mandatory: [url]https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_commonwealth_of_furry_peoples[/url]
We are proud members of [region]Interregional Defence Pact headquarters[/region].
Note:
Interregional conflicts, while rare, happen frequently enough that you should avoid being involved or engaging in any activity that could be seen as a coup. Also know that regional leadership is ALWAYS watching you.
To participate in operations, join the Regius Militaris: https://forms.gle/QT72SFBme3GdDZw16
