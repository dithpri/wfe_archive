Endorse [nation]Bilmar[/nation], our delegate. 
Failure to endorse our delegate may result in ejection and, in rare cases, banning.

We are proud members of [region]Interregional Defence Pact headquarters[/region].

Note:
Interregional conflicts, while rare, happen frequently enough that you should avoid being involved or engaging in any activity that could be seen as a coup. Also know that regional leadership is ALWAYS watching you, and who you may think is trustworthy may not be.
