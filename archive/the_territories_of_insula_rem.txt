Endorse [nation]Bilmar[/nation], our delegate, so that our region may have better representation on the world stage.

The Territories of Insula Rem is a small region whose purpose is to provide a safe region for nations to grow and develop friendly relations among nations. It is one of NationStates&#39;s most average and least familiar regions. The UN is headquartered on interregional territory in Insula Rem and has other main offices in Citiobaidsonis, the Neavian Republic, and The Interregional Defense Pact HQ (home to the Insula Remian embassy) as well as four offices in Insula Rem itself. 


Failure to endorse our delegate, [nation]Bilmar[/nation], may result in expulsion from the Territories
