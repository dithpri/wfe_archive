The Territories of Insula Rem is a small region whose purpose is to provide a safe region for nations to grow, and develop friendly relations among nations. It is one of NationStates&#39;s most average and least familiar regions. The UN is headquartered on interregional territory in Insula Rem, and has other main offices in Citiobaidsonis, Neavian Republic, Guinea Kiribati, and The Interregional Defense Pact HQ (home to the Insula Remian embassy) as well as eight offices in Insula Rem itself. We are currently sending a worldwide security reinforcements call as the nation Bilmar is ejecting the founder even after we implement security measures.
