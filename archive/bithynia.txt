[list][b]Bithynia[/b], officially the [b]Kingdom of Bithynia and Pontus[/b] (also known as the [b]Bithyno-Pontic Kingdom[/b] or [b]Bithynia-Pontus[/b]) is a [color=green]constitutional monarchy[/color] situated in the northern part of [color=green]Anatolia[/color], along the southern coast of the [color=green]Black Sea[/color]. The capital of the kingdom is [color=green]Nicomedia[/color], named after its eponymous founder, [color=green]Nicomedes I[/color].
