[b]LONG LIVE THE URA[/b]
[i]Thats right and there&#39;s nothing you raiders can&#39;t do about it![/i]

We are recovering from a raid and stronkifying the region, also if you raiders come back and read this, good luck doing that again.

After all this blows over we will begin to try to expand again, after that a new constitution will be written and we will establish a democracy.
