[u][b]Greetings from The glorious Green Hills of Apolea![/b][/u]

Accepting new applicants who desire little more than to have a place to hide your nation and relax. Newbies welcome.

After the transition from our previous lands, this region is now fully democratic. While currently we are understaffed, this does not mean the democratic process will be impeded.
We are currently password locked, so please contact one of the WA nations here to ask for entry. Alternatively, contact [nation]Catlibia[/nation] directly if you wish for confidential interaction.

Thanks, [nation]Catlibia[/nation]
