After the transition from the Waord lands, this region is now fully democratic. While currently we are understaffed, the default electee is [nation]Catlibia[/nation].
Please endorse this member at your earliest convenience, and contact your cronies to alert them of the existence of this region.

We are currently password locked, so please contact the current administrative electee to request entry.
Personally known users only at the moment please. Thanks, [nation]Catlibia[/nation].
