[hr]The world is an ugly place, full of problems, pine needles, and pie. It is your solemn duty to make it slightly less than that. Except the pie. We should probably keep that, actually. In other news, this region is actually slightly more important than its size would suggest. While our numbers are small, our hearts and nations are large. Our embassy with [b][region]The Bar on the corner of every region[/region][/b] is open also, so you can go explore or whatever there.

[color=Crimson][hr][i]Martial Law is still in effect. Failure to endorse the current WA electee (Excepting non-WA nations), spam, or harassment, is grounds for immediate ejectban.[/i][/color]
