The Obsidian Order is an isolationist council of nations. They are diverse in government types, but all are interdependent, though economic, political, and social means.
All regional governance comes from the member nations. The Obsidian Order is run as a council of very few nations that together make all decisions on a majority vote that are then carried out by the chancellor of the order, who also serves as the WA delegate. We, [region]New Alexandria[/region] and [region]Acidalia[/region] function under the Pollan Union.
These nations are brought together by their common goal; creating a prosperous and safe environment for their citizens.

[color=red]The region is now open to all, without a password. We invite all nations to join us and get involved![/color]
