The Obsidian Order is an isolationist council of nations. They are diverse in government types, but all are interdependent, though economic, political, and social means.
All regional governance comes from the member nations. The Obsidian Order is run in the Asmara Aggregation in which all states have equal representation. Rulings of the aggregation are carried out by the Chancellor of the Order. Actions of nations are reviewed and disputed settled in the Tribunal Court, a court of three randomly selected nations.
These nations are brought together by their common goal; creating a prosperous and safe environment for their citizens.
