The Obsidian Order is an international federation which maintains order throughout the lands of Obsidia. The Order is run by a council of its nations, referred to as the Asmara Aggregation. The rulings of the Aggregation are carried out by the Chancellor of the Order, currently [nation]wilorin[/nation]. The Tribunal Court sorts out international debates, and is a vital organ in the Obsidian Order.
Though the nations of the Obsidian Order vary greatly, they are all united under the common goal of creating a peaceful and prosperous environment for their citizens.
