The Obsidian Order is a council of isolationist nations. It was founded because no other region allowed all member nations to fully participate. Because of this, the Obsidian Order is run as a council of very few nations that together make all decisions on a majority vote that are then carried out by the chancellor of the order.
These nations are brought together by their common goal; creating a prosperous and safe environment for their citizens.
