The Obsidian Order is a council of nations. They are diverse in government types, but all are interdependent, though economic, political, and social means.

The region is moderated by the nation of Oldec, but all regional governance comes from the member nations. The Obsidian Order is run as a council of very few nations that together make all decisions on a majority vote that are then carried out by the chancellor of the order.
These nations are brought together by their common goal; creating a prosperous and safe environment for their citizens.
