We defenders lay waiting, waiting for the call, the call for help

[color=Blue]To defend the Innocent, we regions have banded together to stop the raider threat,
We Are Not Afraid to do serve justice,
We help others in need, we do so because so many regions have slowly been,
Disintegrating and dying slowly and we wish to stop that,
to destroy shackles and free the oppressed,
We must fight to defend ourselves from them, 
so defenders of the world, Unite![/color]

[i][b][color=maroon]&quot;There is no revenge you could ever conceive of that will come close to
what we will exact upon you one day, Brotherhood of Malice!&quot;[/color][/b][/i]
