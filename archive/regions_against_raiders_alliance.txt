[color=brown][b]This region once stood confidently as an attempt to destroy the raider unity once and for all. 
Alas, we were conceited and inexperienced. Region after region perished to the raiders, including some members of our alliance. 
The future for this region is unclear. Regardless, we stand strong in our convictions. [/color][/b]

Sorry whoever Warzone Trinidad is, but we will not tolerate raider advertisements here. Or at least not me.
