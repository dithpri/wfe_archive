The Defender Regions Have Risen at their best,

Here thy [color=orange]Ondol[/color] people lay,
And the sea of [color=maroon]Salasia[/color] swiftly sways,
where high voice [color=blue]Phantoms[/color] screech in the trees,
where [color=purple]Coyphusian[/color] Cacti weeze and weeze,

[i][b][color=purple]&quot;There is no revenge you could ever conceive of that will come close to
what I will exact upon you one day, Brotherhood of Malice!&quot;[/color][/b][/i]

Note from the co-founder and leader, Fullworthia/Error Onion:
