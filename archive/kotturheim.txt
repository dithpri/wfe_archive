[color=#0000BF][i]They say there&amp;#39;s no such place... as Paradise. Even if you search to the ends of the Earth, there&amp;#39;s nothing there. No matter how far you walk, it&amp;#39;s always the same road. It just goes on and on. But, in spite of that... Why am I so driven to find it?[/i][/color] - Kiba, Wolf&amp;#39;s Rain
