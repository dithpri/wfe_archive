In the lands of always winter, it will always be unbearably cold.  
Luckily the inhabitants will have nothing to fear. The great and mighty Empress of the Lands of always winter will take them under her wings and protect them from all that is cold, demonic and evil.

All hail the Empress for all men must serve or all men will die.
