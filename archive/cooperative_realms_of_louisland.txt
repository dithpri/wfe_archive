WELCOME TO THE COOPERATIVE REALMS OF LOUISLAND!
====================================

Here, anybody is welcome to join with only a few simple rules to follow:

1) All nations must use the regional currency: CRL Dollar

2) Nations must be nice to each other, with the exception of roleplaying arguments

3) If you have any problems or questions, please telegram Blythaii Island



Please be aware that this region is still relatively new, so there isn&#39;t too much set up yet, but a lot of things will be implemented soon (such as a map, anthem, laws, etc.)
