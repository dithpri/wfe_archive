[b][color=blue]Concord is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, in the United States.

On April 19, 1775, a force of British regulars marched from Boston to Concord to capture a cache of arms that was reportedly stored in the town. Forewarned by Paul Revere and other messengers, the colonists mustered in opposition. Following an early-morning skirmish at Lexington, where the first shots of the battle were fired, the British expedition under the command of Lt. Col. Francis Smith advanced to Concord.[/color]
