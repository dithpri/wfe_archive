[u]Guardian Network[/u]
A collection of regions that are completely safe regions. With 100% living founders sworn to protect their regions from invasions and griefers, should the need arise.
The GN does not impose its will on individual regions, only that the founders remain active nations and do not eject or ban nations without good reason.

Thanks for the help, defenders! (Not sarcastic)
