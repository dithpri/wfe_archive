[color=FAA700][b]Refounded, but most positively not occupied, by the ULN forces![/color][/b]

[b][i]This region,[/i] once one of the world&#39;s largest embassy-collector regions, [i]has been re-founded by the forces of the ULN! It has been re-founded, and is now a region of Liberalism and Democracy[/i][/b]

Re-founded: 20/04/2018, one day after the Augustin Alliance [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=33870756#p33870756]released the region[/url]. There is no password: You may visit if you feel like it, and this will indeed be a region of freedom and democracy rather than a ULN-held trophy... ;)
