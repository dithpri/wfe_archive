I, the Leader of New Iby Tell, am establishing this region of Iby Tell, as an Empire. All those who wish to join from here on become Independent Territories or States under the rule of Iby Tell. All have the opportunity to represent themselves as elected officials who may present ideas and amendments in order to progress forward as an powerful empire. 

By my decree, Iby Tell is established.
