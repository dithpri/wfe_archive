This is the Council of the Nations of Polarus, where they have an open channel to interact with each other, as well as vote on internal resolutions or polls. 
Polarus is our beloved planet, the home for roughly 1.5 billion people, and many unique countries. It&#39;s territory is yet to be fully charted. 
So far, 4 countries joined the Council: [nation]Ottlantoservales[/nation], [nation]Palisgonya[/nation], [nation]Cappians[/nation] and [nation]Leopiathevy[/nation].
There are more countries in the Polarus, but most of them are still considering to join our Council.
