This is the Council of the Nations of Polarus, where they have an open channel to interact with each other, as well as vote on internal resolutions or polls. 
Polarus is a planet discovered in the late 1950&#39;s, and colonized by humans since 1980. It&#39;s territory is yet to be fully charted. 
So far, 4 countries joined the Council: [nation]Ottlantoservales[/nation], [nation]Palisgonya[/nation], [nation]Cappians[/nation] and [nation]Leopiathevy[/nation].
There are more countries in the Polarus, but most of them are still considering to join our Council.
