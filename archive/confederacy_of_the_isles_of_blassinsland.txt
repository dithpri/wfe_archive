A small group of islands off the east coast of New Zealand. Post-Colonization the initial coalition government at the time had trouble controlling political groups with it`s hands off approach. Most islands became part of this loose confederation of nations. Islands are constantly gaining new governments or changing ones. Having been colonized by a mix of Italian and French in the Mid-1930`s the isles are predominatley catholic and have a good appreciation for Latin and Roman customs. Many nations are modeled after Imperial Rome, and take their names from Latin.
