Since the Wars for Survival, Zyphus has sought to secure and fortify not only its own borders, but also the borders of its more cooperative neighbours.  States which have negotiated a protectorate agreement with Zyphus retain only a limited consultative role in their foreign relations, but the rewards of Zyphan protection are often worth the loss of an independent foreign policy.  In addition to guaranteed Zyphan military protection, Zyphan protectorates retain their autonomy in the administration of domestic affairs and are given preferential treatment in Zyphan trade legislation.
