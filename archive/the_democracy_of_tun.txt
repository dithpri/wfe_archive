         In this region we live by a democracy, which means by any means, and always, the people have the right to say something about what they think, and there ideas will be depicted as, a possible idea for the nation. There will be running positions for certain jobs that i don&#39;t want to run. For say that I want someone to run the border patrol then that person will get it by a first come first serve basis. if you want a regional job then you have to get it first. The region will be running for government postions.
