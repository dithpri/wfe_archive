Lead and defended by the Armed Democratic Republic of Cranisa. 

the NSUS is a Nationalist and preservationist region, comprised of the beliefs of the French commune and Italian Fascismo, with Largely right-wing beliefs. 

the NSUS is open to all, but preferably nationalist or socialist states are favoured, the NSUS is strongly against the policies of the NSGWP or N&amp;#64;Z! party. we currently house a two party election system much like that of the US, with both parties open to new members. 

we strive for a safe and fun interactive community and do not tolerate hate speech or Direct Fascism, we also ask that you keep your religious Beliefs out of our community.
