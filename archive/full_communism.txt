Former WFE:
&amp;quot;Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist; that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level -- there&amp;#39;s a little bargaining, a little give and take, but the line of authority is perfectly straightforward.&amp;quot;
- Noam Chomsky

The Brothers and Sisters of THE RED FLEET have liberated the left-wing region Full Communism from ACA, freeing the region from the chains and shackles we know as Capitalism.
