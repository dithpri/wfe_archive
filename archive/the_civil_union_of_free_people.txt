Formed in 1914 as an international forum for world leaders to meet and discuss global politics (as well as make sure certain founding members didn&#39;t start firing upon one another), the Civil Union of Free People, commonly abbreviated CUoFP, is perhaps the most incorrectly named international organization in the history of international organizations. It ain&#39;t civil, and a lot of member citizens ain&#39;t free.
