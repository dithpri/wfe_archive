[nation]Terran Iberia[/nation], formally known as the [region]Reino de Iberia[/region], is a country bordering [nation]Terran Laterano[/nation], [nation]Sargon Empire[/nation], and [nation]Terran Victoria[/nation], occupying the southern coastlines of the continent. It is a totalitarian theocracy that was once ruled by secular kings but is now under the ironclad rule of the Inquisition, a religious order enforcing strict isolationist policies on the nation.
The population is predominantly of the Liberi race, as symbolized by the wings on its national emblem. Additionally, a minority of local Aegir inhabitants, referred to as the &quot;Islanders,&quot; have settled in the country for generations but have faced severe religious persecution.
