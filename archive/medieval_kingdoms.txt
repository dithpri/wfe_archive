[b][color=#900000]Britannia: Winter of 1258[/color]

The [i]Kingdom of England[/i] rules most of the Isles. On Irish soil, England hold fortresses that keep the Irish at bay, however, Brian O&#39;Neill has succeeded in rallying the [i]Gaelic Irish[/i]

On the Marches, Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of the [i]Principality of Wales[/i] threatens English border fortresses

In the north, the English are allied with the [i]Kingdom of Scotland[/i], but this bond is untenable

The [i]Kingdom of Norway[/i] is returning to the Isles; their king coming personally to oversee the conquest of Britannia.

Perhaps worst of all, the [i]Barons&#39; Alliance[/i], threatens to unify into a full-fledged rebellion.
