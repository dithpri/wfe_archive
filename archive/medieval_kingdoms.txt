[b][u]Britannia: Winter of 1258[/u][/b]

[color=#8B0000]The [b]Kingdom of England[/b] rules most of the Isles. On Irish soil, England hold fortresses that keep the Irish at bay, however, Brian O&#39;Neill has succeeded in rallying the [b]Gaelic Irish[/b]

On the Marches, Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of the [b]Principality of Wales[/b] threatens English border fortresses

In the north, the English are allied with the [b]Kingdom of Scotland[/b], but this bond is untenable

The [b]Kingdom of Norway[/b] is returning to the Isles; their king coming personally to oversee the conquest of Britannia. 

Perhaps worst of all, the [b]Barons&#39; Alliance[/b], threatens to unify into a full-fledged rebellion. [/color]
