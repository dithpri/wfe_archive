A Place where time has 4 dimensions.

Nobody in the Chronosphere is quite sure what time it, but doesn&#39;t really matter to them much anyway. Everyone and everyhing here is immortal and indestructible. An infinity of existence lies ahead every citizen, some call it a blessing, some call it a curse.

The Chronosphere is powered by an Ancient Machine of unkown origin, located in the center of the chronosphere. It reduces entropy and occasionally emits a powerful beam of light that illuminates the world. Surrounding the mysterious machine is a large, disk-like continent with a temperate climate split into several smaller pieces by snaky waters.
