The Holy Empire of Zuzich is a tiny, cultured nation, remarkable for its complete lack of prisons, frequent executions, and irreverence towards religion. The hard-nosed, hard-working, democratic population of 10 million Zuzichians are highly moralistic and fiercely conservative, in the sense that they tend to believe most things should be outlawed. People who have good jobs and work quietly at them are lauded; others are viewed with suspicion.
