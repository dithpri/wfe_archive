Therefore, the monarchy of Aig&eacute;antir has decided to proceed with the formation of the Northern Imperialist Alliance Liberation Force. An emergency meeting has been called for all Northern Imperialist Alliance Members States, and allies of these states to take part in a discussion on how best to regain control over this free and independent region. All assistance will be appreciated, please contact the Office of High King Conchobar II of Aig&eacute;antir if you are interested in taking part in this action.
