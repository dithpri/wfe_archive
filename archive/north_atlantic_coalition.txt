Welcome to The North Atlantic Coalition, an newly created alliance of rising powers.
We may have ideological differences but that does not stop our Coalition.
We achieve our goals together as one whole,
We fight together and even if we are on the brink of collapse,
We fall together as one whole.

So, my fellow nation, I do not mind if you do not join because we do not care about our growth. If you don&#39;t then we hope you have a good time.

If you want to join then telegram me, since this region requires a password to enter.
I will decide if you can join or not. Anyways I hope you have a great time.
