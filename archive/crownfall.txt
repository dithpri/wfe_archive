[hr][i]A dying world, a fractured age. You will not rule it. But you may shape it stories.[/i][hr]

[b][region]Crownfall[/region] is a grim, low-fantasy collaborative storytelling region, set in the fractured year 1358 - just after the Black Death (known here as The Pestilence) has swept through the known world. 

The great empires have collapsed. In their ashes, fragile realms squabble, rot, and fight over memory and ruin.
This is no power fantasy. It is a place of fading faith, brittle nations, and stories carved into bone.[/b]
