[i]&amp;quot;Strobe lights beam create dreams
Walls move minds do to
On a warm San Francisco night
Old child young child feel alright
On a warm San Francisco night&amp;quot;.[/i]

--- Eric Burdon and The Animals

[i]&amp;quot;Ever&amp;#39;body might be just one big soul,
Well it looks that a-way to me.
Everywhere that you look, in the day or night,
That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m a-gonna be, Ma,
That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m a-gonna be.

Wherever little children are hungry and cry,
Wherever people ain&amp;#39;t free.
Wherever men are fightin&amp;#39; for their rights,
That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m a-gonna be, Ma.
That&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m a-gonna be.&amp;quot;[/i]
