[i]There is no reason to accept the doctrines crafted to sustain power and privilege, 
or to believe that we are constrained by mysterious and unknown social laws. 
These are simply decisions made within institutions that are subject to human will 
and that must face the test of legitimacy. And if they do not meet the test, they can 
be replaced by other institutions that are more free and more just, as has happened
often in the past.[/i]
