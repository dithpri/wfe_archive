[i]Strobe lights beam create dreams
Walls move minds do to
On a warm San Francisco night
Old child young child feel alright
On a warm San Francisco night
Angels sing leather wings
Jeans of blue Harley Davidsons too
On a warm San Francisco night
Old angels young angels feel alright
On a warm San Francisco night.
I wasn&amp;#39;t born there perhaps I&amp;#39;ll die there
There&amp;#39;s no place left to go, San Francisco.[/i]
