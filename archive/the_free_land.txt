[b]This capture is in honor of RKA General Christopher Bishop&amp;#39;s birthday! I hope you&amp;#39;re having fun in Scotland Chris! Its due to his hard work that the Royal Kantrian Army was able, with gleaming bayonets and perfect formation, to capture this region!

Glory to [region]Kantrias[/region]![/b]
