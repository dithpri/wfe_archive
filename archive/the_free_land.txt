[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by! 

[color=red]Well, well, well looks like your land isn&amp;#39;t so free after all ;) Our forces appear to have destroyed said freedom for the next 12 hours. Somerset Guard were the only people planning raids this minor. Looks like the others just can&amp;#39;t keep up![/color]

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

With thanks to [region]Albion[/region] who&amp;#39;s member was conducting his first raid! Congratulation Celeste :)[/b]
