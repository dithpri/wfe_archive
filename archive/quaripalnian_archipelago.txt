Located off the south of the largest continent, the [b]Quaripalnian Archipelago[/b] is home to various island nations, each with diverse systems of government and methods of trade. Largely presided over by the grand Quaripalni Island (sometimes referred to as a small continent, as it is the largest island in the world, containing 7 countries), the region has over 800 islands within its bounds, and is extremely promising to up and coming nationalists who seek control of plentiful lands. 
Over 1,900 species of flora and fauna inhabit the tropical islands, with some even being found on the highest mountain in the region, Mt. S&ouml;ntari, under the control and protection of the [b]Grohunpooglan empire. [/b]
