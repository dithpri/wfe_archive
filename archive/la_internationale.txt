We are a [b]Marxist[/b] region dedicated to the education of and propagation of Marxist theory; its studies, as well as standing against revisionism of history relating to socialism.
Unlike most other leftists regions on NationStates, we stand firmly against revisionism of any kind, whether that be social democrats, anarchists, or patsocs. We also remain firmly neutral in affairs to the general assembly, or security council; nor do we care about the existence of fascist regions numbering 5 people on a LARP web-browser roleplay game.
