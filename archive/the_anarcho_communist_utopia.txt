[b]Built upon the teachings of Petr Kropotkin, Joseph Dejacque and the Italian Section of the First International, we are an Anarcho-Communist Uptopia.[/b]
Anarchists and Communists are welcome, but if you are a [u]right wing nation[/u] you do not belong in our Utopia, take your authoritarianism somewhere else.
[i]Join today where there are no limitations, no one telling you to do anything and no wage labour. You work, not for the good of a corporate fat cat, but for your self and everyone around you. 
Let us share in the prosperity to come.[/i]
