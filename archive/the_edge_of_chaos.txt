A land with all sorts of chaotic places, some intentionally, some not. We thrive on the balance between chaos and order. Some nations here have many laws that protect people while allowing them to live their lives comfotably, while another may or may not be ruled by a semi-malevolent entity where the tourists have more rights than the citizens, and is ruled not for world domination, but petty amusement. 
In the Edge of Chaos, chaos isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s our solution that brings opportunity!
