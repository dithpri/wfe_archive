[b][color=red]Dearest Disciple,

Verily, not everyone who says CAT, CAT, shall inherit His kingdom.

You must first [u]conjure[/u] His cat.

You must then [u]serve[/u] His cat.

You must then [u]walk among the children of dog[/u] as His cat.

Thus shall you receive the blessing of [nation]the UNSPEAKABLE[/nation]. Return to [region]The Bottomless Pit[/region] whenever you are in need of rest.[/color][/b]
