[b]Verres, founded for the greater good of humanity.[/b]

After the scrambled people of the verrisian continent rose up and began to create infrastructure, a powerful region was set in the making. Culture, Science, Industry, all products of a set of nations, some small, some large, who seek to make the world a better place.
(Or a more &amp;quot;Enlightened&amp;quot; world in the case of Euthenasia)

[color=blue] Verres is mostly a peaceful region and we value our member nations greatly. [/color]

[color=purple] If you wish to build an embassy with Verres, simply contact either our founder or our WA Delegate and we will most likely accept. [/color] [b] We will not accept if your region is an anarchy or has morally corrupt goals. [/b] [color=purple] We aim to please every Nation in our region, so have a nice day! [/color]
