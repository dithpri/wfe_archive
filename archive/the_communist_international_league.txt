Welcome to the true and legitimate successor of the [region]Communist International League[/region]. We are an independent [color=red]Stalinist[/color] region opposed to both the [color=pink]idealist Libertarian Socialism[/color] of the claimant to the purported original lineage, [region]CIL[/region] and the [color=black]patronising pseudo-collectivist &amp;quot;solidarity&amp;quot;[/color] of [region]The Internationale[/region] and their cronies in [region]The Red Fleet[/region], [region]Antifa[/region], and [region]Das Kommune[/region].

All nations that wish to disrupt the region&amp;#39;s working are going to be ejected and banned rather quickly.

Our Central Committee is appointed by open consensus of all League members and confirmed by the General Secretary.

[color=red]General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist International League:[/color] [nation]New New Capston[/nation]
