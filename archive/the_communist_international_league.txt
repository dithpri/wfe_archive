This region is the one and only true and legitimate successor of the [region]Communist International League[/region]. We are an independent, [color=red]Stalinist[/color] region opposed to both the [color=pink]idealist Libertarian Socialism[/color] of the purported successor to the lineage, [region]CIL[/region], and the [color=black]patronising pseudo-collectivist &#147;solidarity&#148;[/color] of [region]The Internationale[/region] and her cronies in [region]The Red Fleet[/region], [region]Antifa[/region] and [region]Das Kommune[/region].

All nations that wish to disturb the region&amp;#39;s working will be ejected and banned rather quickly.

The Central Committee is appointed by joint consensus of all League members and confirmed by the General Secretary.
