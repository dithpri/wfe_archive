Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, sinners and supposed saints... to the [color=red][i][b]cognitive world[/b][/i][/color].

A realm where [i]bias becomes reality[/i] and [b]vice is strength[/b].

Sprawling networks of malicious metropoleis, built upon the ignorant backs of the masses; skyscrapers of toxic conviction reaching towards stars that burn with selfish desire.
