The Scarlet Empire welcomes any and everyone to our region! To new nations joining our Region, there are rules we put in place to keep our region peaceful; If you have the country name that is suggestive, oppressive, sexual, anti-gay, anti-women, anti-men, or anti- humanity is general you will be removed. If you have a banner for more than 30 days that suggests an oppressive and cruel system, you will be removed. Any racial slurs, sexual suggestions, or sexual orientation slurs will be found, and the persons who spoke will be removed. Finally, if I or any other admins find you are a nation that deliberately makes life worse for its citizen, I will have you banned from the Region. Thank you for your time and welcome to the Scarlet Empire.
