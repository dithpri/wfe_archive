I could not ask to live in any other moment of history than this,
because never has mankind, never has the human species been confronted
with such possibilities, with such choices,
of disaster or of greater heights and greater glories.

My friends do live in that sense that you are Europeans,
that you come from people who faced tremendous odds again and again.
That much is against you, but you&#39;ve got within you that will,
that spirit and above of all that faith and that belief
which will lead the generations to come
to look back at you in the pages of history
with the proud words: &quot;To Britain, to Europe, they were true!&quot;
