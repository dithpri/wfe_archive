&amp;quot;Luxuriant greenwood, virescent fields and grasslands, sharp rocks and steep hills. 
Fallen leaves sway in the wind, snow covers mountain tops; sun rays cascade down the golden desserts. 
A cerulean globe, its landmasses filled with cultures and communities, 
endless possibilities and numerous opportunities. 
Pupils strolling along, an attorney pleading with fervour, a couple&amp;#39;s first kiss, 
monarchs and presidents shaking hands, the scholar actively researching and 
a young rebel witnessing his father&amp;#39;s execution...&amp;quot;
This... Is Geryon.
