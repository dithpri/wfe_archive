[b]The Age of the Old-Earth is over. Sol and its spheres have been reduced to rubble in a cataclysm beyond biblical. In its desire for survival, mankind has scattered in every direction to look for a new home. One of those directions was north, towards Polaris. 700 years hence, you are now its lords, and its destiny is yours to control.[/b]
