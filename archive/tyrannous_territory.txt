All countries should follow through with sacrificing citizen&#39;s freedom for economic progression. Tyranny is the superlative way to economic success, which is imperative to any country&#39;s success. A countries government should be run by the people who were successful enough in life to deserve a place of high praise. If you&#39;re useless, you&#39;re useless, and that&#39;s what you shall be know as unless proven otherwise. Freedoms do not help the economy, work does, and if you&#39;re useless enough not to have a seat in the government, then you work, simple.
