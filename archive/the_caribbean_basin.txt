Welcome to the Caribbean Basin!

Following the total collapse of the old regime, the Caribbean Basin is now under 100% control of the [color=ff000]International Caribbean Communist Party[/color]. The Caribbean Basin supports a Federative Government in which every nation is autonomous, so other more capitalist or fascist nations are allowed. Join today to support the betterment of region! Any nation would be hard-pressed to discover a more democratic region, and the expansion of the region will only make it more active.
