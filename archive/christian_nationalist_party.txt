[b][color=#000000]The [region]Christian Nationalist Party[/region] is looking for political leaders to carry the politics of the party to their region and grow national membership rolls.

To gain membership a nation submits a party application form to the founder, does not need to be present in this region, must be a member of the WA, and may only use their WA nation to vote on party matters.

National Roll List is shown on the Regional Message Board.[/color][/b]
