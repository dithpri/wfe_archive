KWANGYA (Hangul: &amp;#44305;&amp;#50556;, Gwang-ya) is a word in Korean meaning &quot;wilderness&quot;. Wilderness means the wilds, waste, jungle, or desert. KWANGYA is a world where the lads rule. NAVIS can open portals to this location, while the &aelig; didn&#39;t seem to have heard of KWANGYA before. The Black Mamba is disrupting SYNK from there, whatever the heck it means. Kwangya is also a place where asian women are deeply loved.
