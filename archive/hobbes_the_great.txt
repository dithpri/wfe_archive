[color=gold]Calvin[/color]: [i]Do you think boogeymen really exist?[/i]
[color=orange]Hobbes[/color]: [i]I don&amp;#39;t know.[/i]
[color=orange]Hobbes[/color]: [i]... But if they do, I&amp;#39;m sure this is where they live.[/i]
[color=gold]Calvin[/color]: [i]That as the creepiest campfire story I&amp;#39;ve ever heard. Let&amp;#39;s get back to the tent.[/i]
[color=orange]Hobbes[/color]: [i]I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll ever sleep again.[/i]
[color=gold]Calvin[/color]: [i]SHH![/i]
[color=orange]Hobbes[/color]: [i]What? Did you hear something??[/i]
[color=gold]Calvin[/color]: [i]Didn&amp;#39;t you?[/i]
[color=orange]Hobbes[/color]: [i]I don&amp;#39;t know. What did it sound like?[/i]
[color=gold]Calvin[/color]: [i]Sort of like breathing and drooling and ripping the meat off human bones![/i]
[color=orange]Hobbes[/color] and [color=gold]Calvin[/color]: [i]YAAAAAAAAAH![/i]
[color=orange]Hobbes[/color]: [i]You were right. I&amp;#39;m glad we carried a generator all this distance.[/i]
