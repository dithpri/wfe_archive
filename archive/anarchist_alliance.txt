The [color=green]Anarchist Alliance[/color] is a group of Pro-Anarchist, Anti-Capitalist, Liberal and Socialist like mind political Nations, founded and centered around complete personal Freedom and Individual Rights. Many of its Nations are noted for having mostly Liberal and Anti-Business policies and stances, while still noting the need to keep the economy stable. Autonomy is a must, even if it means being something seen as opposite to Anarchism.
