Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth GC The Raider? I thought not. It&#146;s not a story the Defenders would tell you. It&#146;s a Sith legend. Darth GC was a Dark Lord of the Independents, so powerful and so wise he could use his WA to influence regions to create ROs&#133; He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the regions he cared about from being raided. The dark side of the Endorsement is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. See below for more!
