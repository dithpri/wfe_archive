The ever-glorious region of the Cloudnamers began long ago, in the year 2010. It was then when my fenedo had affectionately title me a cloud person. It is a largely symbolic title, though it carries with it lots of responsibilities. First and foremost, you must absolutely LOVE cloud-watching. And cloud-naming. The second one is also very important. Perhaps even more important than the first. Of course, there&#39;s the third option of just coming in for whatever reason, but I just want to make the region seem cool.
