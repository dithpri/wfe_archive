[color=red][b]Welcome to Kervsey Island, a small island in the middle of a lake in the Heartlands of Pennsylvania![/b][/color]

[color=teal]How peaceful it is here. The lake&#39;s waves ripple in the sunshine, sending yellow sparks against the blue waters. Wind running against the trees and shrubbery sing a light, airy song. Luxury at the backs: velvet couches, crystal balconies, Waygu steaks everyday. Paradise.
