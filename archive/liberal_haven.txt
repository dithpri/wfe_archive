[b]Welcome to [region]The Black Hawk[/region] Haven! We are a region of war. We are against defenders. If you are a nation of liberty and peace, than we tell you to stay in [region]Kyzikos[/region] or wherever the fendas come from now-a-days. Because we are fully raider in nature, no defenders are accepted.

Currently considering Ideas for reformation, but not from fendas. Things need to change, except for our founderless part, because that lets us get raided by [region]The Black Hawks[/region].
