[b]Graviton Veil[/b]

The Graviton Veil is a region of space unlike any other, marking the chaotic outer boundary of the Celestial Nexus. This turbulent zone is a cauldron of intense gravitational forces and unpredictable space-time anomalies, where the laws of physics seem to bend and twist at will. Ships entering the Veil must contend with violent gravimetric distortions, energy surges, and unstable spatial rifts that threaten to tear them apart.
