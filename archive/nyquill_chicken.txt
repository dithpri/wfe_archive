We take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these nations shall not die in NyQuill Chicken -- that this region, under no-one, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the region, by the region, for the region, shall not perish from the earth.

&quot;we love nyquill and chicken&quot;
