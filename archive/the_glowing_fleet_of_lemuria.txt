Out of the fog, you spot something. A light? A soul? 
Your tired eyes must be deceiving you, because suddenly you&#39;re at the base of a gigantic floating city consisting of dozens of ships lashed together. Laughter and music hits your ears, and the strong smell of grog and roasted gull hangs heavy in the air amongst the smoke of cheerful deck fires. You have made it. Welcome to Lemuria. Welcome home!

This region is founded on the ideal that everyone is welcome to do what they want within the region. There is no role playing, no rules, and no membership or outside forum. What you see is what you get, and that&#39;s how quite a few of us prefer it.
