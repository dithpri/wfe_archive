Out of the fog, you spot something. A light? A soul? 
Your tired eyes must be deceiving you, because suddenly you&#39;re at the base of a gigantic floating city consisting of dozens of ships lashed together! Laughter and music hits your ears, and the strong smell of grog and roasted gull hangs heavy in the air amongst the smoke of cheerful deck fires. You have made it. Welcome to Lemuria. Welcome home!

This region is founded on the ideal that everyone is welcome to do what they want within the region. What you see is what you get!...unless you want to see something else, and you have the freedom to enact that, too. Stay and hang out for awhile, or forever!
