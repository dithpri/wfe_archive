Random is a random association of random nations who make decisions randomly. Regardless of a nation&#39;s method of random selection, all nations who decide randomly are welcome here, whether they use dice, cards, spinners, coins, or even the weather to make their decisions. All that matters is that we are random.

The regional flag is a coin on a field of green felt.
