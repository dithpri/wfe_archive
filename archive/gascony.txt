Gascony was historically inhabited by Basque-related people who appear to have spoken a language similar to Basque. The name Gascony comes from the same root as the word Basque. From medieval times until the nineteenth century, the Gascon language was spoken, which is a regional variant of the Occitan Language. It is also the land of d&amp;#39;Artagnan, who inspired Alexandre Dumas&amp;#39;s character d&amp;#39;Artagnan in The Three Musketeers. It is also home to the hero of the play Cyrano de Bergerac and to Henry III of Navarre who later became king of France as Henry IV.
