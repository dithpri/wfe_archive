The Atlantic Seaboard is a region that accepts any country to participate within our region. Countries can participate in politics within the region and run for different positions when election time comes. Anybody can use the forums and we are willing to have embassies with any region big or small. Also, since the Atlantic Seaboard is so new, anybody can shape how the region will become in the soon future.
