A strange region, founded after the discovery of the mythical &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot; Although it just turns out it was just very rich mineral water not magic water. Anyway, the residents of Babopolis are all incontinent, either in bladder, bowels, or even both. (This is due to a disease inside the &quot;Fountain&quot; that has been passed down through generations. (kind of like an STD)) It&#39;s residents due to this have extra time on their hands and spend it leisurely developing industry, art, and such. This region has several &quot;gods&quot; it worships such as &quot;the Great Canned Owl&quot;, &quot;Ka Nenelu Loa Pali&quot;, or &quot;Nino&quot; All who supposedly control all natural happening in the region, keeping the region out of the eyes of others.
