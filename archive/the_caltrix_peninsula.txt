Host to many varied states in terms of government and stability, the Caltrix Peninsula is headed by an elected executive with appointed officers. Many rivalries plague the region and often reach a boiling point of armed conflict. Although the executive has often taken steps to prevent or end these wars, the participants rarely listen to anything other than military force.

Unification efforts are usually met with resistance and many of the states within the region are the result of civil war and secession.

Nocturus Terra currently stands as the executive.
