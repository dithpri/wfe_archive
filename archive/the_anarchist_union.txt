The Anarchists Union is a region founded on the principles of voluntary cooperation, anti-authoritarianism, and mutual aid. There are no rulers, no leaders, and no state authority within the Union&#151;each member is free to govern themselves and cooperate with others on their own terms. The Union&#39;s foundation rests on the belief that true freedom and equality can only be achieved when hierarchies of power and control are dismantled.

Each nation within the Anarchists Union operates autonomously, with decisions made by the people through direct, horizontal democracy or other forms of self-governance. Alliances and trade between member nations are formed out of mutual benefit, not out of coercion or central control.
