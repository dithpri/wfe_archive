[b]War on Terror[/b]

Democracy, Freedom and Peace is what our region stands for, and the recent terror attacks on our soil by Black Riders terrorist group opposed that in the max.
We will retaliate, make no mistake about it. Our dispersed nationals will come back and we will fight this injustices. We will not sleep. We will not back out, we will fight!
