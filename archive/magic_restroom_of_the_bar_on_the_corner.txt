[b]Welcome to THE headquarter of [region]the Bar on the Corner of every Region[/region].[/b]

This utmost precious facility management unit is the magical conference room of our bar. It is just meant for serious discussions of the bar team about how to improve the bar since the current high activity there makes it hard to focus on a topic. Be serious! Ok, I&#39;ve kind of spoilt it already with choosing this region name but please be seriously serious! : )

ah,  and bar guests, please go after your business in this room silently,  and do not feed the Cthulhu...  thanks.
