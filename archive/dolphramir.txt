The region has a mountain range that divides it into 3 zones.
To the south east we find a massive desert that is run through by a river
To the north we can find a land of rocky praires and gentle hills that get smaller until you reach the sea. There are some marshlands to the northeast
Finally, to the south west we find lush forests stretching all the way down the mountain range. This area is the most abundant in wildlife.However it is very hard to transverse doe to the 2 winding rivers that run through the zone, creating small islands in the middle of them.
