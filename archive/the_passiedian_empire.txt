Passiedians subscribe to theories of racial hierarchy and Social Darwinism, identifying Passiedes as part of what is regarded as a master race. We aim to overcome social divisions and create a homogeneous society based on national unity. The Passiedians aim to unite all Passeides living in historical territory, as well as gain additional lands for expansion, while excluding those deemed either to be community enemies or foreign people. Passeidians use socialism as an alternative to both internationalist Marxism and free market capitalism. Passeidiansim rejects the Marxist concept of class struggle, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and seeks to defend the private property and privately owned businesses.
