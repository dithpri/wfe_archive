&quot;You heard of that new earth they found? It&#39;s a new earth, but it&#39;s like, 10 times cooler than this Earth. It&#39;s earth though, it look almost identical and almost everything it&#39;s the same. You ain&#39;t heard that yet? It&#39;s 10 times cooler than Earth, but it&#39;s another Earth they just found. It looks almost like Earth though.&quot; - Young Thug talking about Tartaros, 2015

Tartaros is a world entirely separate from Earth, and as such it has it&#39;s own unique history and nations, allowing you to have vast and fun creative freedom, as long it&#39;s in the bounds of realism.
