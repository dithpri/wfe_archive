[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region was a holding of [region]New Reich of Bunicken[/region], the apparent dominant entity over [region]Raxulan Empire[/region] in [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1366181]some sort of union[/url] between the two. It would appear NRB has allowed its little pet to go around [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1415704]insulting whoever they want[/url]. It would appear NRB and the Raxulans have forgotten who they are messing with. Furthermore, I will be keeping this region name safe from those pesky leftists and ANTIFA nuisances, we wouldn&#39;t want them to soil this fine region name now would we? You didn&#39;t do a good job of that.
