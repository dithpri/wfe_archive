The south-west is half temperate, half semi-arid, mostly inhabited by the Illevium Empire.

The north-west is covered in rolling hills and fertile plains, a portion of which is claimed by the Empire, but mostly consists of the United Republics of Tomischii. In the north, forests grow in abundance, with few Tomisichii outposts.

Two matriarchal nations have formed in the south-east, from the tribes, clans and towns present there. They are The Theocracy of MARGARET and The Queendom of Kozakuu.

The north-east is inhabited by the two fledgling, authoritarian empires of Dellios and Dru-Zod. Also sharing the area are The Nomadic Peoples of Zimbabewoozy.
