The south-west is half temperate, half semi-arid, mostly inhabited by the Illevium Empire.

The north-west mostly consists of the United Republics of Tomischii. In the north, forests grow in abundance, with few Tomisichii outposts.

The south-south-west, bordering the Illevium Empire is the newly emerged Armed Republic of South Jasonnam.

Two matriarchal nations have formed in the south-east, from the tribes, clans and towns present there. They are The Theocracy of MARGARET and The Queendom of Kozakuu.

The north-east is inhabited by the two fledgling, authoritarian empires of Dellios and Dru-Zod. Also sharing the area are The Nomadic Peoples of Zimbabewoozy.
