The south-west is half temperate, half semi-arid, mostly inhabited by the Illevium Empire.

The northern half of the region is covered in rolling hills and fertile plains, a small portion of which is claimed by the Empire, but mostly consists of the United Republics of Tomischii&amp;#39;s territories. To the northern extremes forests grow in abundance, as of yet untouched, save for a few Tomisichii outposts.

Despite the two nations&amp;#39; massive size, most of the region, particularily to the east, is still unclaimed wilderness.
