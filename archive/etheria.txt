The north-western area of the region is covered in rolling hills and fertile plains, a small portion of which is claimed by the Empire, but mostly consists of the United Republics of Tomischii&amp;#39;s territories. To the northern extremes forests grow in abundance, as of yet untouched, save for a few Tomisichii outposts.
