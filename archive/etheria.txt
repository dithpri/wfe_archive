A half temperate, half semi-arid region, mostly inhabited by the Illevium Empire. Beyond the Empire&amp;#39;s borders lies as of yet untamed land, that may yet one day either be claimed by the Empire, or give rise to new nations...

The northern half of the region is covered in rolling hills and fertile plains, a small portion of which is claimed by the Empire. To the northern extremes forests grow in abundance, as of yet untouched.

The south is semi-arid and borders the sea. The western portion of this area is the home and core of the Illevium Empire.

Despite the Empire&amp;#39;s massive size, most of the region is still unclaimed wilderness.
