We are a young region, and we are looking for more to join us! We plan on joining into military gameplay when we grow bigger. We are a communist region, although unlike the others, we have more political freedom; Bukharinists for example are allowed, regardless of their rightism. However, having said this, fascists, conservatives, (most) bigots, and in general enemies of the revolution will not be allowed. We are light on our rules for now because of our tininess, but do not expect this to be the case in the future.
