Hello, everyone. These island regions in Southern Asia/Oceania have one common unique trait.

We are the only home of the natural Woonf, and Caleonia has a different breed, known as the Kale Woonf.

Overall, we support both extremes of government, and with very few nations, already have very diverse ideals.

Caleonia occupies the mainland, while Steneste and Colon-Z occupy some major islands in Asia, probably Borneo and Sumatra respectively.
