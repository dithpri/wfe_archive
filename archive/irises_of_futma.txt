This region was founded by a puppet of [nation]Turkisan[/nation], and was, and still is a Coyphusian Protectorate. This region is Coyphus&#146; first embassy region ever. For months this region has been used as a punching bag for raiders, the raider who raided this region the most was [region]Lily[/region]. It got raided, then liberated, then raided, then liberated, until [nation]Pasina[/nation] CTE&#146;d.. and then got revived by [nation]Turkisan[/nation]. Finally we are in peace, and the Coyphusians can rest&#133;.  For now[/u][/i][/color]
