Deep in the dark reaches of space resides the planet Koro-na. The main continent is known to the locals as Zombie-Playland, a vast desert of sandy mountains and plains. The entire sufrace of the continent is inhabited by mindless shuffling zombies. The premature zombie apocalyse was caused by the ancient Koro, an advanced humanoid race seeking imortality. 2000 years later a small Transport ship crashed into the planet, bringing the first humans to the desolate wasteland. After a long struggle and many deaths a civilization was built.
