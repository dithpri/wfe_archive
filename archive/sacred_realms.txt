[b][color=red]- WA Delegate can access Regional Control -[/color][/b]

Welcome to Sacred Realms, formerly a puppet storage but now ready to be [b]left in your hands[/b].

I encourage you to stay here and maybe even join the WA to take over regional control and establish a friendly Community in which I, as a founder, promise you to remain neutral and active to act as a shield against raids.

In [color=red][b]4[/b][/color] days, most puppets will CTE and most nations remaining here won&amp;#39;t be under my control, eventually only this nation will.
