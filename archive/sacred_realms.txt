[b]Welcome to the Holy Kingdom of Sacred Realms[/b]

I may not be able to understand you all the time, but I love you, my little human biotch. You were not at all convinced there was an afterlife, but, at the same time, you kind of knew it, didn&amp;#39;t you? You hoped even denying, you wished there was a heaven.

Here it is. The ethereal, magical world for the righteous (no nazis allowed) that&amp;#39;s full of puppets for some reason.

This region was founded in 2012 as a puppet storage but everyone with at least half a brain (i.e. not a nazi) will be welcome from now on. So this is open to new citizens and the Founder would gladly give up Regional Control if needed.
