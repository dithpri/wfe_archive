Welcome to Sacred Realms, formerly a puppet storage but now ready to be [b]left in your hands[/b].

I encourage you to stay here and maybe even join the WA to take over regional control and establish a friendly Community in which I, as a founder, promise you to remain neutral and active to act as a shield against raids.
