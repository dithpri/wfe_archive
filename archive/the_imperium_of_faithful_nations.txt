An unholy alliance of anarchy, freedom and atheism.
Founded by The Imperium Sanctum and taken over by the socialist brigades.
Here, chaos is encouraged, religiousness purged, and tolerance sacred.

The updated Creed:
Freedom above faith. Anarchy is order. Everything above honor.

Law of the Imperium:
The Emperor&#146;s word is ignored.
Devotion and obedience are forbidden.
Members act with tolerance.
Conservatism and fascism are treason.
