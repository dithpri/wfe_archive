It is the year 4666.

The Tindadhanka Sector has been cut off from any signals emergent of the direction of Earth. 

It has been little over a full century since any final transmissions or broadcasts were captured from the Sol System. 

Like falling dominos, one by one, whether to maintain the order of humanity&#39;s empire, to guide a new era for their own planet, or to simply safeguard their homes and their sovereignty,  the worlds of Tindadhanka and its peoples have drawn their lines upon the new star maps. The factions surrounding this stranded star prepare with bitter anticipation, or perhaps reckless abandon, to risk their lives in preparation for the battles to come.

It&#39;s every man, every clan, and every planet for himself.
