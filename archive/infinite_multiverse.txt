Welcome to the Infinite Multiverse, a roleplay-centric region with deep background lore. If you want to take part in the grand battle between the forces of Light and the forces of Darkness, where the fate of all realities hangs in the balance, this is the place for you! We will endeavor to find a place for all nations in the overall story of this region, so all players feel that their nation is making a difference. Whether you&#39;re a supercluster-spanning space empire, or a magical kingdom bound to a single planet, you&#39;re welcome to join.

We have no idea how to run a Discord server, but we made one anyways. It&#39;s a work in progress. Constructive criticism welcome.
