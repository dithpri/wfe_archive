Malchior is a well hidden region with many different species, both sentient and wild, sometimes even a mix of both. It is especially well known for its unique breed of Mahogany Trees and exotic landscapes. The region was founded by humans more recently, making it an official region on the map. Malchior originally consisted of seven united countries, but recently the seven countries all were combined over one religion to form the Holy Empire of Musanrak. Joining this region one is expected, though not required, to follow the word of the Deykel do Musanrak.
