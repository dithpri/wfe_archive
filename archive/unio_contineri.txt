Greetings, nations of NS!
UC is created to be a pactum between Amordeus and other countries.

&#149;Why should NS trust Amordeus?
Well, Amordeus is a peaceful nation. I should need to trust you more than you should need to trust me.

&#149;What is the point of UC?
The community of NS is not connected. The idea of UC is to create a big network of nations, so everyone in UC can use this network in peace and harmony.

&#149;Why would we?
Because if you have a network, you have oppurtunities.

&#149;Is it safe?
It is, because UC has her own staff, so every step on UC is safe.

&#149;How does it work?
There are different ways to use UC. For example, if you want to create a company, you could advertise on UC.

For more information, contact the government of Amordeus.

The king of Amordeus.
