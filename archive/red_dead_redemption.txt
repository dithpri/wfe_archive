[b][color=#00BF00]!Hello and Welcome to the honored ones!
[/color][/b]

[color=#0000BF]As you have probably guessed, this is a region based on[/color] [u]Red Dead Redemption[/u] and little bit on [u][color=#FFBF80]Battlefield 1[/color][/u]. [color=#0000BF]This region is quite unique because it combines the aspects of modern warfare [u]and[/u] the authenticity of the historical perspective. 
So if you ever dreamed of utilising that Wild West - type of country of yours forgotten somewhere in Osirirs, you are in luck!
If you miss that simple warfare with classic guns and uniforms, you are in luck! 
If you don&#39;t want to miss out on the elements of the modern warfare, you are in luck![/color]
