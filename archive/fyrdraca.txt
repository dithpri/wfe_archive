Welcome to Fyrdraca. This land has been without humanity up until the Romans colonised the island.

After the end of the Romans, Fyrdraca has been unruly. Vikings raid the island very often and only the strong will survive.
(Note: You can attack other nations in the region, but you will only loss land. You can be a vassal.)
