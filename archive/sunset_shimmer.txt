[b][color=orange]Welcome to the region of [/color][color=#FADF87]Sunset[/color] [color=#DC002A]Shimmer[/color][color=orange], a region named after the best pony of all time![/color]

Thanks to our [color=#DC002A]bacon-haired overlord[/color], puppetmaster [nation]Triseria[/nation] has managed to accumulate the second most Tractor Parts in the world during both World Trade Fairs ([url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=tradefair_history?year=2022&amp;leaderboard=3]2022[/url] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=tradefair_regions?leaderboard=3]2023[/url]), only being bested by the entirety of Raider Unity in 2022 and Lily in 2023 respectively, and was the second region to ever hit 2k of a resource while being the first solo region to ever hit the 1k mark! He also managed to snag a second place spot with Anime Nations Against Liberals in N-Day 2022, and placed top 40 in Z-Day for Most Infected in 2022![/b]

Thanks for your time, have a lovely day! ^^
