Now that the so-called zombie invasion is over, I think that we all need a break from Angels Cove.  Though I think that we should, so of you may not agree.  It is time to abandon Angels Cove for a new region.  Druid Republic is leaving for a new region, for he has a new one.  Anyone that wants to go, please feel free to do so.  Thank you, and have a nice day.
