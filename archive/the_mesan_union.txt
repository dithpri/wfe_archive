The Mesan Union is a group of nations, all working together to complete the grand vision of the old Emperor Carlos, that was formed out of the shared love of creating a better world and community. The Mesan Union works to not only improve scientific, artistic, and industrial strengths of member nations, but to master them. While it challenges each nation individually, at the same time it provides a friendly community where competition is welcome and solidarity takes priority.
