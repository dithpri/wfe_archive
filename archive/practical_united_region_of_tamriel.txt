[b]#TakeBackTamriel2017 is underway![/b]

The Practical United Region of Tamriel is a region consisting of many different nations who are united in order to survive. This Region consists of a mainland, two large islands, and several small islands. The land is fertile in most of the region, with the exception of Elsweyr which is barren due to deforestation by an ancient race. The region is always looking to expand and will be looking for more land to add to the size of this great place.

We are the curators of a region-wide (American) football tournament, the Tamriel Golden Shield (currently suspended). The Champions&#39; Table can be found below.
