Home to a varied collection of nations that somehow work together harmoniously, North Timbre is a great place to be! While there is a lot of rest going on here, everything and everyone is always on time, even with everyone going at their own pace. Be warned, if you decide to screw things up, we will be forced to take drastic measures. But hopefully it won&amp;#39;t come to that!
