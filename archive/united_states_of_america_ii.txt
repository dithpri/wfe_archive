We decided to build our own continent from scratch in the middle of the ocean.
It was slightly controversial to bomb the ocean floor that hard, but we needed new land.
We just flattened off the new sections and imported the best topsoil we could find.

In case you are wondering why the hell we went to the trouble..
..The old USA was way too corrupt, and we&#39;ve had enough.

Hopefully we can learn not to repeat the mistakes of the past.

Anyone may join. Those that piss off the founder will be kicked to the rejected realms.
(But don&#39;t worry too much, he used to live in the old USA and has a high tolerance for bs)
