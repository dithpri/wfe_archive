[b]Greetings traveller, this region is small but has a few good things about it you may like:
[color=green]
[list]
[*] We are very friendly towards everyone.
[*] We have three veteran members who have played for several years and can help you get around the game.
[*] We are against raiders, because they ruin the fun of regions who don&#39;t even want to be part of that type of &quot;roleplay&quot;[/color]
[/list]


We have been raided numerous times in the past and each time taken back power over the region, hence why its password protected now.

[color=brown]If you have any questions, telegram [nation]Astro-Tech Corporation[/nation] or [nation]Area 275[/nation]
you should get your answers quickly since we are around every day. [/color][/b]
