Vichi Etane is designed to be a nice, calm place for nations to interact and role-play with one-another. You may have nearly any kind of nation you want, with a few loose guidelines:
-Your nation may have whatever level of technology you want, including postmodern not exceeding what may be possible in the next 50 years or so.
-Your nation does not need to be human, but I ask you keep in realistic.
-Be prepared for some awesome RP
-Be kind and respectful to others
-Have fun
