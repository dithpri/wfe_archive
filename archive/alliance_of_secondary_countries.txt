[b]A message to all Invader scum - Do your worst. Try your hardest to invade us. We dare, nay beg you to try. We spit at you. No matter how hard you try, you will fail. Your efforts will come in vain. You have free rein. Go on. We dare you.[/b]

Please [b]do not abuse authority[/b] given to you by the Founder, or you will have said authority stripped from you. Read the Unlawful Acts Factbook so you know what not to do. If you wish to join the region, the password-protection has been removed. Join if you wish. Invaders welcome - try your hand at invading us. You will find it impossible.

[i]For foreign Embassies officers[/i] - Please contact the Founder and/or the Minister of Foreign Affairs if you wish to construct embassies with the ASC.
