&quot;My buddy Keith tried camping out on top of a building once. He was shooting crows, but the police were too busy teargassin&#39; him to ask what he was doin&#39; up there. He screamed for an entire year every single time he opened his eyes! Oh, man! At first, it was funny; then it just got sad, but then it got funny again! Oh, man!&quot;
