[color=red]WE ARE THE NOVEMBER REVOLUTION OF 2017!!!!![/color]

[region] The hole to hide in[/region], is a region which, like countless other regions, has a WA delegate.

Being a WA member prevents us from ruling as we wish, as they have admitted:

&quot;The WA is the world&#39;s governing body. Membership is voluntary, but all member nations must abide by legislation it passes.&quot;

seeing that membership in the World Assembly is only voluntary, and that The hole to hide in, and any other region does not need a WA delegate, the November revolution of The hole to hide in may begin.
