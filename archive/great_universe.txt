Heretics, barbarians, laid their eyes upon the fallen Holy Region of [region]Battleships[/region] and stripped its Holy possessions against its will.

Now, the reformed Polish Mongolian army of [region]Gaming Town[/region] had marched deep into one of its enemy&#39;s territory and razed it until there&#39;s nothing left and salted the earth until nothing will ever grow again. This land will be a barren wasteland until the end of time.[/b][/color]
