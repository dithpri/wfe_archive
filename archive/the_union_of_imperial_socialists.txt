The [region]The Union of Imperial Socialists[/region] is a Union forged to further the international strength of all member nations. We are open to international talks and trade and wish to further our global influence. [b]All members are welcome to join the UIS[/b] and we look forward to growing as a region. We are still relatively new and have yet to fully organise a Constitution and system of government.

We also now have a shared currency: the UIS Credit. Adoption of the UIS Credit is non-compulsory but is recommended for UIS members in the interests of international relations.

[b]All members are required to endorse [nation]Scerenia[/nation] as WA delegate.[/b]
