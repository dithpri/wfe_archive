The [region]The Union of Imperial Socialists[/region] is a Union forged to further the international strength of all member nations. We are open to international talks and trade and wish to further our global influence. All members are welcome to join the UIS and we look forward to growing as a region. We are still relatively new and have yet to fully organise a Constitution and system of government.
