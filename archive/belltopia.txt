[b]This description is outdated at present. We are currently going through the process of reviving this region.[/b]

A small, relatively peaceful region to the south of the Equator, Belltopia is a land of thinkers, leaders, and idealists. Founded fairly recently, its rich history is instead composed mainly of the independent, but often interlinked, pasts of each of its member states. Among them are the nations of Beattieland, Rhydennias, Lampora, Allah Il, Gamzia, Gandu, Solbis, Greater Tharsis, X Island, Mexicoland, Monotremursia, and Wadiyya.

All members of the region, please endorse our own WA delegate, the Democratic Republic of Lampora.
