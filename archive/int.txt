[b]Welcome to /int/[/b]

We are the collective /int/ community. Anything goes here - No matter what a member state&amp;#39;s history, political views, or actions against other nations.

WA membership is entirely voluntary. No nation should feel pressured to join (or to not join) the WA, and we put absolutely no pressure on how members should vote in the WA.

The only thing we don&amp;#39;t participate in as a collective is inter-region warring, as it doesn&amp;#39;t fit with most of our member&amp;#39;s casual play style.

All nations are encouraged to join our world map (linked below) and, if the mood takes them, wage war on their fellow nations.

that feel when we have a world map:
