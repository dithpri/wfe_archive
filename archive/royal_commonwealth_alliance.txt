[b]Welcome to the Royal Commonwealth Alliance. Being a Commonwealth region of friendly, honourable and respectful nations, we stand for pride, freedom, and dignity. These are the things that no entity can take away from us. We are a free region, with a democratic regional government in place, and our region is as safe as they get from any invader; our WA delegate does not have administrative powers.[/b]
