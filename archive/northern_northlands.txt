North of the most North Northern lands, this chilly land of pine forests and tundra is an ideal habitat for classic symbols of northern pride, such as Beavers, Moose, and of course, the Gyrfalcons. Quiet streams and plentiful timber-filled forests mean that a prospering economy can easily take wing among the extraordinary snow-topped mountain ranges and chilly plains of the region. Countries here enjoy breezy summers and cool winters, along with a lush variety of pine forests and animals in our lovely chunk of the North.
