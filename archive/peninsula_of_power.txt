The Peninsula of Power is an older region, founded by a small number of friendly nations in the interests of collective strength. The Peninsula has seen many trials throughout it&amp;#39;s existence, though. There was a deep rooted power struggle, fairly recently, between the Capitalist and Socialist inhabitants of the region. Creating disunity across the board, it brought massive international tensions along with it. As most things do, however, the conflict died off with time. An International Council has since been set up, encouraging open regional communication and delegation. The Peninsula currently stands strong and united, bring nations together in the name of Liberty for all.
