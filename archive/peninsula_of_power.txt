Welcome home. Although this home is a war zone. This started a long time ago when the region was started by a few friends. They knew each other and knew that they could benefit as a team. Leaders entered and leaders left; government has been a large problem. There became a clear conflict between the sides looking for civil rights and capitalism and democracy going head-to-head against the sides looking for equality with socialism and communism. There wasn&amp;#39;t a day without a shift in power and fights breaking out. This region is still a war zone and will continue to be until only one side remains standing.
