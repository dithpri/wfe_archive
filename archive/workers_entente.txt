Lore: The Worker&#39;s Entente is a reformed Warsaw-Pact type organization, based around the countries of Austria, Denmark, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, and the SRR, the leader of the Entente. 

They were formed after the third world war (1959), in which a military stalemate &amp; white peace was established between France, the U.K. and the SRR. The United States, enthralled in it&#39;s own political matters (Namely serious revolts and riots due to the Jim Crow laws) &amp; afraid of Soviet nuclear retaliation, was unable to step in.
