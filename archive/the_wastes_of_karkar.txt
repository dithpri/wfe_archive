Karkar was once a sprawling nation that existed in peace and harmony. Then reality found it, and it was destroyed in nuclear fire to make room for a new mall. That mall was promptly burned to the ground by Karkar survivors, and they established a kingdom it its wastes. The Kingdom went through 18 civil wars in the period of 1 year, prompting the switch from a democracy to a Dictatorship. Once the fires went out, the Karkar founded Robinaria.
