The Yfraitrope main are a set of three continents divided by a small channel betwixt them, sheltered from the outside world by a vast ocean with tumultuous currents to all sides, save for the south-eastern seas. The main is surrounded by small craigy islands home to various tribes that have migrated when Yfraitrope was a larger landmass, during the Kelkedon warm period of year 321. The nations in this region primarily thrive on the mainlands, with the occasional scientist or colonial venture to the outer seas.

The 3 continental mains are Eptro, Ifary, and Fyrapi
