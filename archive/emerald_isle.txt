The Emerald Isle is a string of islands in the middle of a vast ocean. Efalii is currently the only inhabited land in the Emerald Isle. Efalii has all power and control over the Emerald Isle. New nations are always welcome in the Emerald Isle. The Emerald Isle is not a raiding party, though if one region decides to invade the Emerald Isle, we will attack back. The Emerald Isle has an official oath that must be said in order to inhabit the land. The oath is ; Sua Tak Oai Poni Koau Limpah. That translates to : I will not fall to evil.
