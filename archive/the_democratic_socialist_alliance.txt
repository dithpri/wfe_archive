A territory of [region]international socialists[/region].

&amp;#39;Democratic Socialist Alliance&amp;#39; was founded by the nation &amp;#39;Cynthia Mckinney. It&amp;#39;s WFE used to have socialist commitments to oppose imperialism, fascism &amp;amp; zionism. Sadly the current ruling regime has abandoned this for isolationism.

[b][i][color=red]International Socialists[/i][/b][/color] will use this WFE for solidarity purposes, thus upholding the true spirit of DSA.
