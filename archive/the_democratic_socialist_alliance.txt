A territory of [region]international socialists[/region].

&amp;#39;Democratic Socialist Alliance&amp;#39; was founded by the nation &amp;#39;Cynthia Mckinney. It&amp;#39;s WFE used to have socialist commitments to oppose imperialism, fascism &amp;amp; zionism. Sadly anti-socialists abandoned this for isolationism. However CMK has acted to restore the aims of the region. IS waits upon events.
