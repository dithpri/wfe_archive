The Collection of Vaguely Associated Nations is just that - a region for nations of any political orientation. We don&amp;#39;t discriminate - any and all nations are welcome!

This region sits quietly in a little-visited area somewhere south of Antarctica, as its member nations busily toil away, working towards their ideas of a Utopia. Despite its location, weather varies wildly from nation to nation, as does form of government and culture. Democracies are border-to-border with dictatorships, but a surprisingly uncorrupt regional council comprised of members from each nation moderates the interests of each nation, preventing outright chaotic war through a cunning policy of banning all potato exports to offending nations.
