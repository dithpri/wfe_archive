We are a region which adheres to the interpretation of Marxism by the great, Joseph Stalin, which we wish to see it implemented across the known world. Comrade Stalin gave birth to a model of rule which saw the rapid industrialization of Russia, a backward country, transforming it into a power to be feared and reckoned with. We believe that &amp;#39;socialism in one country&amp;#39; can be achieved through the sweat and collective effort of a great people under the leadership of a strong, avuncular character.
