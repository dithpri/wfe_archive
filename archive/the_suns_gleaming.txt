A thousand years ago, in the land of &quot;The Suns Gleaming&quot;, there was no light. Everyone was impoverished. Until, the leader of Leave Me Alone gave a helping hand. He provided simple needs and food. But, there were rebels. Against the idea of freedom. They wanted to control. After a thousand years of peace, and a thousand years of war, &quot;The Suns Gleaming&quot; was now an independent and sovereign region, having some of the most immensely involved members in the NationStates community.

We are The Suns Gleaming Empire.
