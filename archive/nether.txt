Founded when a few notable nation founders struck out from their city of Torn, the Nether Region is known for its playful internal conflicts, hot and cold verbal combat, and stinging witticisms. The leaders are also known for dancing about on bubble wrap, running lottos and giving out empty blood bags. Trout-slapping is not uncommon, and all the members adore their founding female fatale.
