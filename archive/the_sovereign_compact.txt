The Sovereign Compact is a strategic and political alliance of independent states united by a shared commitment to mutual defense, economic coordination, and non-interference in domestic governance. It was founded in the wake of rising supranational pressures and global trade bloc centralization, as a counterbalance to other organizations.

Unlike other alliances that emphasize integration, the Compact&#146;s guiding principle is the preservation of national autonomy &#151; cooperation without subordination. Each member retains full control over its internal affairs, contributing to collective goals through voluntary coordination rather than binding mandates.
