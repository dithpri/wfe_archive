The Euphratus System is a planetary system with twenty-seven rocky planets and four gas giants. The capital empire, though not necessarily the ruling empire, is The Holy Theolist Empire of The Church of Unity. As of now, only three rocky planets and one gas giant have been colonized by The Church of Unity: The snowy planet of New Saint Gabriel, the desert planet of Saint Isabel, the forested planet of Saint Patrick, and the gaseous steam planet of Saint Rochester. The Church of Unity is one of several empires in the system, although the Church forces the local planetary governments into compliance with its laws, with some success.
