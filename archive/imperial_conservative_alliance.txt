This fascist region was originally created by two former [region]Federation of Conservative Nations[/region] members, and later captured by the now defunct Gentlemen&#39;s Coalition. It is now back in the hands of the FCN, and stands as a monument against fascism.[hr][i]He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment-seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me.
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,
While God is marching on.[/i]
