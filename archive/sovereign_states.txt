Rising from the ashes of the once Great Empire and united by common tongue, the sister lands have united behind the leadership of Karterstan.  Bound by the principle of sovereignty, each nation governs itself without fear of interference from the others.  Here all nations are free to build their own destiny without fear of undue influence or reprisal.
