The union of kingdoms in the largest landmass on the terraformed Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. The Kingdoms are mostly far removed from the world assembly on earth but have generous amounts of exported oil and petroleum, leading to most of the war exhausted countries on earth to rely on the moon for such exports.

Titan has been made completely self sustaining, this makes the culture differ from that of many earth countries.
