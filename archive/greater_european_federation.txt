[i]The Federal Parliament is shut down for the weekend to let cooler heads prevail. By executive order. If that is not sufficient call it direct rule and we can dispense with the pleasantries. I will turn this Federation into an Empire before allowing it to degenerate into a democratic free for all.
Tell your constituents to grab a beer and shut up for now.[/i]

Your puppet constituents would not take the hint. [region]Iron Europe[/region] was a region I already had set aside as a protectorate and now it is the Empire I warned all of you was going to happen. The GEF is now destroyed. My regions. My call.
