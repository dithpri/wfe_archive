To protect the unique ethnocultural identities, the languages and borders of each member and prevent ethnocide. To combat rampant Global Socialism, Communism, Islamic and other Terrorists wherever we find it.

Comprised of Sovereign European Regions and the Nations that are representative of them, the GEF has established a European Parliament to democratically legislate specific matters of joint interest to the Federation.[/i][/color][hr] [/b]
