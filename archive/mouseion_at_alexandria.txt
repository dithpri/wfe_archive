The Musaeum or Mouseion at Alexandria (Ancient Greek: &amp;#924;&amp;#959;&amp;#965;&amp;#963;&amp;#949;&amp;#8150;&amp;#959;&amp;#957; &amp;#964;&amp;#8134;&amp;#962; &amp;#7944;&amp;#955;&amp;#949;&amp;#958;&amp;#945;&amp;#957;&amp;#948;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#943;&amp;#945;&amp;#962;), which included the famous Library of Alexandria, was an institution said to have been founded by Ptolemy I Soter. This original Musaeum (&quot;Institution of the Muses&quot;) was the home of music or poetry, a philosophical school and library such as Plato&#39;s Academy, and also a storehouse of texts. It did not have a collection of works of art; rather it was an institution that brought together some of the best scholars of the Hellenistic world, analogous to a modern university. This original Musaeum was the source for the modern usage of the word museum.
