Xochitl Crestoria is a political, economical, and social region born after the fall of The Grand Nation. Today, it is only known to be home of the economically powerful Empire of Procazium, and the socially innovative Republic of Ueltini Papalotl. However, it is well-known that Xochitl Crestoria has yet many undiscovered lands that can be claimed by other nations willing to join. This region promotes technological and scientific discoveries, as it supports women&#39;s, POCs, LGBTQIA and all minorities rights and equality. It is important to note that although Xochitl Crestoria may seem easy-to-invade, there are powerful armies and high-tech equipments that will help defend any country attacked within the region.
