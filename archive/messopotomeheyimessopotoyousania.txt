A widely varied megacontinent, most Messopotomeheyimessopotoyousanian nations tend to embrace environmentalism, socialism, and/or syndicalism. We tend to enjoy casual lives, filled with rich culture and good humor.

The region&amp;#39;s Enforcer, [nation]Babylonandonandon[/nation], plays the dialectical antipode to what most of the region&amp;#39;s inhabitants believe. On the other hand, the Babylonandonandonian Leader will gleefully excoriate any nation that openly subscribes to bigotry, fascism, or general prickishness.

Our region is still young and small, with plenty of room for growth. Any nation that has a suggestion or complaint is asked to forward their correspondence to [nation]Babylonandonandon[/nation].

Have a nice day.
