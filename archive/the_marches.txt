The Marches is a region of nations that are, or aspire to be highly millitarized. The Marches welcomes any militarily focused nation to join it, regardless of the nations further ideology. The Marches was founded in an attempt to bring militarized nations together, and hopes to eventually, in someway, succeed with that goal.

The Marches is a region of militarism, although it hopes to foster roleplaying elements within the region, and with other regions. Roleplaying is something the Marches promotes, but will not force on it&#39;s members.

This region does not represent the actual ideology of its members and is purely for roleplay purposes. The Marches does not condone ultra-militarism and other extremist ideologies that promote hate.
