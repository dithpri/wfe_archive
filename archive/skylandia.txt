[b]Skylandia[/b], also known as [b]New Earth[/b], is the name of the physical remnants of Earth. In 2230, a catastrophic event of unknown origin occurred. This event was so powerful that it caused the Earth to literally rip apart. Chunks of the Earth broke away and drifted off into Space, while others remained around a central core due its gravitational pull.

It wasn&amp;#39;t long until the human race recovered. While there were twelve billon people on the Earth at the time of the event, only fifteen million (approximately) survived. Despite the population setback, the survivors quickly established nations in their new world, many of them varrying in ideology. Some of these nations adopted Conservative ideals, while others adopted Liberal ideals. It is now 2310.
