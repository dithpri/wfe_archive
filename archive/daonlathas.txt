In Irish Gaelic, Daonlathas means Dummies. We are a big poopy-head of a region and couldn&amp;#39;t tell a good nation from a bad one if we tried. Daonlathas will never amass to anything because we are highly seclusive, over conservative, stuck up sons of guns that can&amp;#39;t poop straight. But... ENJOY!
