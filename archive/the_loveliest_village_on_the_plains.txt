[i]    &quot;Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain;
    Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain,
    Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
    And parting summer&#39;s lingering blooms delayed&quot;

Upon the rolling plains of Dixie, beneath the sun-kissed sky, lies Auburn Alabama. Incorporated in 1839, this jewel of the South is home to Auburn University, a Carnegie R1 research institution with a focus in agriculture and engineering and the home of the Auburn Tigers.
