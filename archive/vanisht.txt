This is Vanisht, an Vanugurad-occupied region. Only 10 nations can join the region otherwise the region will be password protected. There will be no WA delegates as I refuse to be a WA member. The map represents historical life in Vanisht. The other map represents well...um...da citizens. And the 3rd map shows the world map in case you don&#39;t know or new to politics.
Rules:
No offense
No making fun of the region
No stealing the region (IDC if you want to be a governor of the region)
No leaving the region
At least 7 nations can join the region.
