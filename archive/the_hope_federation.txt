[b]In January 2020, The Hope Federation decided to partake in offsite property destruction. 

[color=red]The Discord Server belonging to [region]Union of Liberal Nations[/region] was stolen, and ultimately butchered leaving most of its history gone, though they forgot to remove some old traces of the Union.[/color]

Offsite Property destruction isn&#146;t cool. Do that, and your region is going to get nuked by us :)[/b]
