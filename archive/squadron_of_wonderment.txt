In the year 5610.8 kAD, the world was gripped with terror as Tzar Shaun (basically Hitler) pushed his armies into Corasant and over took their government. Czar Shaun then announced his plans to invade the next country over, Shiny Persia. Emperess Helena of Shiny Persia held him off while pleading to the rest of the world to ban together against this tyranny. Eleven nations answered this call and banded together to stop the oppression of the Corasant people. We will not let Czar shaun and his New Rome minions spread their terror.
