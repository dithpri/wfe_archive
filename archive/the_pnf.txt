The Pact of Nations for Freedom is an anti-regulation region, we condemn restriction on free trade, civil rights, political freedoms, and national sovereignty. We are NOT an anarchist region, we only condemn restrictions up to a reasonable standard. For these reasons we also condemn the world assembly believing it to impede on the sovereignty of its member nations to make their own decisions.
