Welcome to Earth and Mars! This region is just getting started, so there&#39;s plenty of space on the maps. The premise of this region is that Mars has been terraformed, and is now a nicer place to live than Earth. There are high standards for setting up a colony on Mars however, which not everyone meets. To get a space on the Mars map, you must have above-average Environmental Beauty in your nation. Otherwise, you will be kept to the Earth map. Telegram me if you want to get on one of the maps.
