We are a fledgling regional alliance held together by culture and an entanglement of international treaties. Free markets are permitted along with a reasonable level of income inequality as long as a sufficient amount of government expenditure is allocated for welfare. The primary subjects of education are science and literature because it insures technological and cultural advancement securing the longevity of our alliance. Elections will be held monthly.
