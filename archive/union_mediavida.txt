Once a small, pro-World Assembly region, [u]Union Mediavida[/u] has now been absorbed into the [b][region]Entity[/region][/b] vision for the future: reaching for a world without the deranged oppression of mob rule.

All anti-World Assemblists, welcome.  For those wishing to learn about, or join, the growing movement, you are invited into the developing [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Entity_NS/index]Entity regional forums[/url].

All pro-World Assemblists will be exterminated like the filth they are.
