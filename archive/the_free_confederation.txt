[I]Captured: 25.01.17[/I]

[color=red]Formally a captured territory of [region]Empire of Italy[/region] and [region] The Iron Order[/region], this region has now been captured and liberated by the mighty Anti-Fascist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]
