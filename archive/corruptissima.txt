Founder: The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Green Shrubs

Welcome psychotic and corrupt dictatorships! In Corruptissima, all dictatorships are allowed here. Here we will make sure the grass will be green, the flowers will bloom, and that your civil rights and political freedoms will be absolutely low! 

Three simple rules:
1) Only corrupt and psychotic dictatorships and iron fist consumerists allowed.
2) You must be environmentally friendly
3) Your civil rights and political freedoms must be absolutely low!

So take my hand comrade! Let&amp;#39;s show the world our might.
