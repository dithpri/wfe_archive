The [B][region]Mexican Empire[/region][/B] ([i]Spanish: Imperio Mexicano[/i]) is the current government in Mexico. It was created by the Mexican Congress with the support of Napoleon III of France. A referendum confirmed the coronation of the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, of the House of Habsburg as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico.

Promoted by the powerful and conservative elite of Mexico&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;[i]hacendados[/i]&amp;quot;, with the support of the French, as well as from the Austrian and Belgian crowns, the intervention attempted to create a monarchical system in Mexico, as it had functioned during the 300 years of the viceroyalty of New Spain and for the short term of the imperial independent reign of Emperor Agustin I of Mexico.
