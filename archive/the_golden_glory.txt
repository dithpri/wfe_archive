We are The Golden Glory. We just want to become stronger countries. Countries that matter. You can join too. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you are liberal or conservative, ruled or free, or anything else different. We put aside those differences to make friends, to make allies, to have peace and strength. We are The Golden Glory, and we will rise to power with our future under our own control. So no matter what your views are, we gladly accept you. Here you can make your friends. We are very friendly and when we do argue, they are civil debates. You can be independent, or depend on anyone who comes to the rescue. We are just a region of nations who want to be strong and who want to matter to others. Join us and you will matter. You&amp;#39;ll matter to us.
