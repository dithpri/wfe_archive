We are a new yet very powerful region who try to advance scientific studies and educate our citizens. We also have modern militaries and fair governments. We started as part of the Pacific and decided to form our own separate government and economy. We are very open to countries who would like to join us, and we try to make all countries who are here feel welcome and involved.
