Located in the Anglo-Saxon region of Mount Lobithere, a fictional point in Britain, the Anglo Region of Lobithere is home to the Kingdom of Lobithere, an aristocratic nation. The region was discovered when settlers found the peak of Mt. Lobithere and created the Lobithere Colony, which still resides there today.
