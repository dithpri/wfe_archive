Throughout the year, contests encourage the writer to aspire to new heights of writing and editing.  One of the most popular international contests is [url=http://www.nanowrimo.org/]National Novel Writing Month[/url] in November. Writers attempt to write a 50,000 word novel in a span of 30 days. They are encouraged online, or in regional events throughout the planet. 

[url=http://campnanowrimo.org/]Camp NaNoWriMo[/url] takes place in April and July. Write your own thing and set your own goal. A novel? A play? A short story? Go for the gusto and go for the glory!

If you want to experience the joy of writing for the sake of writing, lock your inner editor in the closet (or send him to some vacation spot like the Antarctic Oasis) and get writing. You have 30 days to write 50,000 words! Hop to it!
