Throughout the year, contests encourage the writer to aspire to new heights of writing and editing.  One of the most popular international contests is [url=http://www.nanowrimo.org/]National Novel Writing Month[/url] in November. Writers attempt to write a 50,000 word novel in a span of 30 days. They are encouraged online, or in regional events throughout the planet.
