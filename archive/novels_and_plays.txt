Throughout the year, contests encourage the writer to aspire to new heights of writing and editing.  One of the most popular international contests is [url=http://www.nanowrimo.org/]National Novel Writing Month[/url] in November. Writers attempt to write a 50,000 word novel in a span of 30 days. They are encouraged online, or in regional events throughout the planet.

With one month before National Novel Writing Month, we have removed our password and encourage all nations who thrive on the love of writing free and unedited novels until your fingers drop from your hands.  The big event is in November, so come on in.
