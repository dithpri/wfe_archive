&amp;quot;The death of the beloved Monarch had been an unexpected blow to the nation of Avalanchia. Despite the best doctors his regime could afford, the years of nanomachines and genesplicing had left the king in a untreatable state.
The period of mourning ended the moment the coffin was burried. Riots in the street were only held back by the violent display of police and order regulators under control of DRTJR, who had turned Triforce Island into a fortress untill a clear successor was appointed. The Ministers and the Queen scrambled to keep control of things, but ultimately, a break was inevitable.
