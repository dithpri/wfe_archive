We are the PokeLovers! If you are one of the first the joiners, you will become of the three main leaders, which will run for the WA Delegate position. After the delegate has been chosen, a new nation will replace its prior position based on Nation Point (NP). Gather NP by winning the daily trait, such as Happiness, Godlessness, and Niceness. The NP standings will not commence until at least 3 (three) people have joined the region.
