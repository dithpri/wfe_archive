[b]What is 4chan?[/b]

4chan is an English-language imageboard website. Users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines. Registration is not required, nor is it possible (except for staff).

Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards were originally used for the posting of pictures and discussion of manga and anime, as the site was modelled on Japanese imageboards. The site quickly became popular and expanded, though much of 4chan&amp;#39;s content still features otaku, anime and other Japanese cultural influences.
