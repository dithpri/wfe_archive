The League of Enlightenment (LoE) is a confederation of independent states with the unified goal of pursuing the perfect, powerful, and enlightened government. Any authoritarian or autocratic states are welcome, but democracies, especially libertarian or pure ones, are frowned upon. Their governments do little to bring their people out of ignorance. The iron fist is much stronger when it is connected to a strong body!
