Francoist Spain, use to be property of [region]Nazi Europe[/region]. Unfortunately due to idleness, it&amp;#39;s now been refounded by [b]Ant[/b][color=red]ifa[/color] Brigades from the [color=red]Red[/color] [b]Fleet[/b]!

We salute the International Brigades who fought against Franco and his Fascists to liberate Spain from tyranny, and who said [b]&amp;quot;&iexcl;No pasar&aacute;n!&amp;quot;[/b] to the Fash!
