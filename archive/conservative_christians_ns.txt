[spoiler=Last WFE by the original founder][b]Everyone is instructed to move to the [region]ACA[/region] by Muntre! This region has become barren and inactive! Move to the ACA and make your self at home!![/b]
[b]This is [nation]FlorinGuilder[/nation] speaking. I created a new region about two weeks ago, and I would like to invite you all to come to [region]Christians United[/region]. We already have a few members from CCNS. I warned you all a long time ago that Muntre would just make this an ACA colony. Well, see where we are? [region]Christians United[/region][/b]

Here are the options that I see that you have:

1. Do as Muntre says an go to the ACA.
2. Join me in Christians United.
3. Find a different region.
4. Stay here and create a new government and rebuild.[/spoiler]
