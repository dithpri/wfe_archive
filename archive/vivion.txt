The fledgling region of Vivion was first founded by the nation of Alisatia, which quickly brought the news back to other nations, such as Zephyia, Sahrla, and New Victoria. The region quickly expanded and is branching out in many different economic and political stances, such as a very pro-capitalism, to entirely state owned industries. Vivion holds a general election to determine the WA delegation, and is generally regarded as a democratic region, with free choice to do as you will.
