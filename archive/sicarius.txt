Unneeded and unwarranted WFE update because I&amp;#39;m bored and I can. So there. 
Anyway, what is it with all these people retiring? C&amp;#39;mon! The year barely started and already I can tell this is going to be a poorer year for Gameplay than 2014. I demand more political intrigue and backstabbing. I mean, so long as no one suffers any ACTUAL emotional damage, because that would be extremely sad to see someone do that over a game of any kind (not the whole getting distressed, but being a jerk)
