[i]As it stood, Sicarius at it&amp;#39;s core is an ideal. A strong belief that what NationStates could be and is are two very separate things and therefore needed a &amp;#39;nudge&amp;#39; in the right direction. However, along with other ideals and ideas, Sicarius cannot really die. But instead can be rethought and reborn over time. So, do not consider this an end for Sicarius.

But a start.

It&amp;#39;s been real, it&amp;#39;s been nice.
