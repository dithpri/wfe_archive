 Because sometimes, the world needs nudging in the correct direction (or the fun one). Unfortunately, those apt to do so are busy somewhere else, and asked me to fill in for them. So, here we are today. We tend to do this to make people mad and get a few genuine laughs along the way. I mean, what could be better than watching other&amp;#39;s pain and suffering? Not into gameplay? Cool, &amp;#39;cause we have roleplaying too! The best/worst of all of NationStates! Interested? Excellent...
