Most monarchy regions I&#39;ve seen have been totalitarian in every single way and I&#39;ve hated it
So screw it, I say let&#39;s do a democratic monarchist region since monarchies are a bit odd on here from what I have seen.
This is my first time running a region but I trust people to be nice and be like how they are in other regions as well.
