[b]The Blemmye Tribes refounded!

After decades of extintion, a group of Explorers found a cave, ventured down into the deep dark. The explorers were never heard from again. Now the year is 2015 and the Blemmyes has extended thier Empire/tribes across all of the Nubian Desert. Wars between the various Tribes are common and very fierce. No humans allowed!
