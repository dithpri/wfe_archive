The Alican States consist of two main islands as well as many smaller islands along the coasts. The Alican Region is divided in to many nations tightly knit by the cultural ties that lead back to the taking of Vlorance from the early Sijic Empire. The Sijic War allowed the Alican States to expand to nearly the size of modern day Europe.
