These three nations are situated upon the backs of great beasts. Those beasts are the national animal of each nation. Harikulade is upon a wolf, Akihitoha is upon a tiger, and Mote is upon a bongobeetle. Smaller versions of each nation&amp;#39;s beast inhabit the same areas as the nations. The three beasts are under the command of the capital cities, so when they all crashed into each other they became allies due to their similar situations.
