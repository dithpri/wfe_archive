dearest, member of our great region

This entry into this factbook will be about what is expected of you in our wonderful region.
1) There will be no tax for the nations of this region and I will not accept any of your currency, this means you can live here rent-free. 
2) We shall live as neighbours (some can choose to live as one) and help one another if in need.
3) If under any circumstance two or more regions have debates it will be settled in a kindly matter with no violence.
If any of these rules above were to be broken, then whomever the tyrant is will be punished and sentenced to be ejected.

please send me a telegram if you disagree or you would like to see more expectations for this region.

F.F.K.
