[b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 04/05/2025![/b][i]Apus: is a small constellation in the southern sky. It represents a bird-of-paradise, and its name means &quot;without feet&quot; in Greek because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by Petrus Plancius in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756.[/i]
