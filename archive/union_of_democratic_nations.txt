The Union of Democratic Nations (UDN) was founded to ensure the freedoms of the peoples of the world. It exists to bring together a group of like-minded world leaders to ensure the longevity of Democracy and to stop the spread of Autocracy. 

The UDN understands that power-hungry individuals will stop at nothing to gain more land, and more people to rule over. So, they believe in the use of any means necessary to put an end to those that subjugate others.
