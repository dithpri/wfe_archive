The Interconfederation was founded in 1951 to originally secure German stability between the central government and surrounding warlords, secessionists, and rival governments, after the Second German Civil War. However, in the years following, to present day 1960 it has grown in size with several global nations joining, as well as in direction, and has taken on a whole new meaning in the Cold War era. Can the Interconfederation rival the emerging powers of the modern world? Only time will tell.
