[i]&amp;#127881; CARD GIVEAWAY AT 50 MEMBERS! &amp;#127881;[/i]

We are a paradise that believes in freedom of internal policy for all members. Regarding our government type, it is somewhat like Canada, with the King ([nation]Ciralsvegia[/nation]) technically holding power, but the Prime Minister ([nation]Zemivorefar[/nation]) actually holding power. Anyone can move here and enjoy life with us, but if you want shiny rank labels, you can go through the naturalization process and become a Verified Citizen.
