Surrounded by Solom&oacute;s Th&aacute;lassa, popularly known as the Pink Sea, the Sacred Island of Neavarea is home to the ancient tribe of the Aeravenese people and other sister communities. Realists and religious leaders have predicted that every nation which becomes a part of this nation will flourish greatly, especially in the environmental field and in technology and science. Nations in this region are encouraged to be self sufficient while helping lift up the Island, one at a time.
