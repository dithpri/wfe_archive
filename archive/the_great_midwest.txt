Midwesterners are praised as being open, friendly, and straightforward. The region&amp;#39;s fertile soil made it possible for farmers to produce abundant harvests of cereal crops such as wheat, oats, and corn. The region was soon known as the nation&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;breadbasket.&amp;quot;Their politics tend to be cautious, but the caution is sometimes peppered with protest. The Midwest gave birth to one of America&amp;#39;s two major political parties, the Republican Party, which was formed in the 1850s to oppose the spread of slavery into new states. Perhaps because of their geographic location, many midwesterners have been strong adherents of isolationism, the belief that Americans should not concern themselves with foreign wars and problems.
