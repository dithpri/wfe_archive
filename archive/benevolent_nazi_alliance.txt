The [region] Benevolent Nazi Alliance [/region] (BNA) is a region comprised of dictators, fascists, monarchs and nations that believe democracy has become a little... outdated. 

Benevolence is key - BNA regions should respect other nations and regions and their right to set their own laws. 

Raiding other regions will be discussed in the future.

We may be Nazis, but we are BENEVOLENT - racism will not be tolerated here!

&amp;#39;Nazi&amp;#39; is used here in it&amp;#39;s historical sense - you know, those guys in jackboots who controlled Germany? ;)
Historical conversation is, therefore, encouraged amongst BNA members.

The Benevolent Nazi Alliance is a protektorate of [region] THE REICHSWEHR HEADQUARTERS [/region]
