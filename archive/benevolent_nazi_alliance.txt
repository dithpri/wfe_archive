The [region] Benevolent Nazi Alliance [/region] (BNA) is a region comprised of dictators, fascists, monarchs and nations that believe democracy has become a little... outdated. 

Benevolence is key - BNA regions should respect other nations and regions and their right to set their own laws. Invading other nations is not currently on the BNA agenda, however, if the chance arises to take down the Black Riders it will be seized.

We may be Nazis, but we are BENEVOLENT - racism will not be tolerated here. 
&amp;#39;Nazi&amp;#39; is almost always used in a historical sense by the founder region, the Nazi Kingdom of Neo-Prussia, and historical conversation is encouraged.
