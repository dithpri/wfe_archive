The Benevolent Nazi Alliance is a group of nations who believe that democracy is outdated, but still care for their citizens and strongly believe that what the government does is always for the benefit of the people. 

The Benevolent Nazi Alliance supports fascists, dictatorships, monarchies and other forms of totalitarian government. Benevolence is key - governments can do what they like within their own nations, but other nations are free to govern their people as they see fit.

The Benevolent Nazi Alliance does not tolerate racism. We may be a collection of dictatorships, but you can keep your opinions to yourselves and your own people.
