This region, a bleak, desolate and somewhat radioactive wasteland, is rightly shunned by most, but is for the same reason a safe haven for nations fleeing persecution or oppression elsewhere. All who care to brave our dangerous shores and pioneer our potentially verdant land are welcome to settle here, and even elect a Lunatic with a Funny Hat (we&amp;#39;re short one).

Raiders will be banjected on sight by our gracious Lady Protecter, [nation=short]Everyton[/nation].
