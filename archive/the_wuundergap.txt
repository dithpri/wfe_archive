Our great founder in Ellosonia created the Wuundergap from a large chunk of land formerly part of the [region]Floodlands of the Hill[/region].

Upon retirement of our great founder in Ellosonia, the wise and noble representative from Mint Slice came forward and ruled fairly for quite some time. But he&amp;#39;s gone now.
