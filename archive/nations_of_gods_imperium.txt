&quot;The Father, the Son, and the Holy spirit.&quot;

&quot;In the name of God, smite the heathens.&quot;

The Nation&#39;s of God&#39;s Imperium (that&#39;s &quot;empire&quot; for you non-Latin-speaking heathens) is a region dedicated to delivering the word of God through speech, text, and steel. We are Christian, capitalist, and nationalist. We are strictly opposed to any policies of Marxism or Communism. Muslim nations are not permitted, under any circumstances whatsoever.

If you think you are worthy to wear the sign of the Holy Cross and smite the enemies of the Church, message The Nomadic Peoples of Gayrwtards, or me, The Holy Empire of Teutonistan.
