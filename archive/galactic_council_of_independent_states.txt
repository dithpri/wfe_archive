The Galactic Council of Independent States (GCIS), is an international body dedicated to the purpose of logical discussion and debate, followed by an ideal of biological and bureaucratic coexistence. The main function of this body is for stronger interspecies communication and links, and a deeper understanding of said species. With stronger communication between sovereign states, a stronger galactic foundation will be realized. Due to the nature of inclusiveness of the region, there will be few regulations established, and those that are will go through a polling system.
