Welcome to [color=#00487a][b]Aurelia[/b][/color], an modern-tech, closed-world, role-playing region. Aurelia is home to a wide variety of nations, governments, and more in a dynamic world. Open to both serious and casual role-players and world builders, Aurelia is here for everyone interested in telling a story. We are not at all interested in gameplay side of raiding/defending and advertisement of such will be dealt with accordingly.
