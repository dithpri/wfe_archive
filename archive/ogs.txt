&amp;#128293; Welcome to [b]OGs[/b] ~ The Realm of One-Word Wonders! &amp;#128293;

&amp;#128526; [region]OGs[/region] exists to safeguard the rarest and coolest nation names in NationStates. We are a curated and public archive. Our mission is threefold:

&amp;#128221; [i]Preservation[/i]: Protect and maintain ownership of iconic and otherwise scarce names.

&amp;#11088; [i]Recognition[/i]: Celebrate the craft of claiming a concise name, and the culture that has grown around that achievement.

&amp;#9888; [i]Defense &amp; Continuity[/i]: Coordinate to defend these nations and the region that shelters them, so rarity isn&#146;t lost to neglect or opportunism.

&amp;#128737;&amp;#65039; This region is governed completely by the [b]ultimate elite[/b] of NationStates, [i][nation]Laser[/nation][/i] himself.

&amp;#127963;&amp;#65039; [b]Embassies[/b]: Request at your peril. Our bureaucracy is a locked cabinet labeled &quot;Don&#146;t.&quot;

&amp;#128706; Region rules: 1) Stay awesome.
