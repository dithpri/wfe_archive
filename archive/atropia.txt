[b]Hear ye, hear ye! This region fell to the combined might of [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Ceseris[/region]. 

Despite having a broken laptop, General Sebastian of the Imperial Army managed to organize a quick op to awaken the troops from a long summer break, and with the help of First Lord Charles IX Talleyrand from the Diarchic Guard, came marching in to claim a sneaky victory!

Long Live the Emperor! Long Live the First Lords!
