Region 11 is a prosperous region comprised of the Empire of the Byzantine Confederacy of Byzantium and its tributaries. Region 11 is considered by the South Pacific to be illegally occupied territory. It gained its independence from the South Pacific when the counties which comprised it formed a confederacy and revolted against the South Pacific and its pernicious liberal democratic policies. After the rebel forces were victorious in the Twelve Years War, most of the confederate counties united to form the Empire of the Byzantine Confederacy of Byzantium, with the remainders choosing to become nominally independent vassal states of the Empire.
