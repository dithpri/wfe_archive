The EUN was originally founded in July 24, 2011 by Tisotto. Once a republic with President as the head of state, it became a monarchist regime with it&#39;s head being an Emperor. On Sept 26 2012, it merged with [region]Transcendence[/region] to form the [color=blue][B][region]United League[/region] [/B][/color] and is administered by UL ever since.
