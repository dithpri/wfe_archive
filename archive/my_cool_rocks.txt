A region for [nation]Zerphen[/nation]&#39;s card farming puppets, all with rock names (as in stones, not the genre of music)

Names for the puppets are based off this list on Wikipedia: [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rock_types]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rock_types[/url]

I&#39;ll also make some minerals later but idc rn

I just added rock images to every rock but I&#39;m not a petrologist or geologist I know nothing about rocks please let me know if any of the images are wrong

I&#39;ll accept any embassies with other card farming regions, most embassy collectors, or anyone really if I think you&#39;re cool enough. Telegram me on [nation]Zerphen[/nation] if I miss your request (I&#39;ll probably miss your request I&#39;m not over here often :| )
