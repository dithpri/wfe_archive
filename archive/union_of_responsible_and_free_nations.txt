Union of Responsible, Free Nations
Guided by the people, for the people.

This region-union is made up of countries that have adopted the newly created regime &quot;Direct-Democratic Socialist Monarchy&quot;. Under this regime, countries are assigned, democratically elected, monarchs who rule the country based on socialist ideology. These monarchs, upon their death, are replaced by others, by a democratic election. 

Joining this region-union, you are committed to helping your people when it comes to freedom, income equality, and let them decide, with a referendum, on topics that affect their everyday life.
