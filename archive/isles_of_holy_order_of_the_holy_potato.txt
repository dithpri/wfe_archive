[b][u]Welcome to the Holy Isles![/u][/b]
We are a medium-sized, democratic gathering of nation-states goverened by the Dual-Delegacy of [nation=short]New Pyrosky[/nation] and [nation=short]Pyrosky[/nation] and their four cabinet members, [nation=short]Deafviper[/nation], [nation=short]Tatertotia[/nation], [nation=short]Duivelskunstenaar States[/nation], and [nation=short]Not Copenhagen[/nation]. Our regional monument, &amp;quot;The Great Potato Plantation&amp;quot;, is the talk of the world, and our main export is the potato. As a side note, our regional currency is the [b]Bap[/b], and we urge you to assimilate your currency upon moving here.
