[hr]We are a medium-sized, democratic gathering of nation-states goverened by the Dual-Delegacy of [nation=short]New Pyrosky[/nation] and [nation=short]Pyrosky[/nation]. Their cabinet members include [nation=short]K0L0PIA[/nation], [nation=short]Duivelskunstenaar States[/nation], [nation=short][/nation], and [nation=short][/nation]. Our regional monument, &amp;quot;The Great Potato Plantation&amp;quot;, is the talk of the world, and our main export is the potato. As a side note, our standardized currency is any variation of the [b]Bap[/b], and we urge you to assimilate your currency upon moving here.
