We are a medium-sized, democratic gathering of nation-states under the delegacy of [nation]deafviper[/nation] and the two cabinet members, [nation]Pyrosky[/nation] and [nation]New Pyrosky[/nation]. Our main export is the potato, and our potato plantations are the talk of the world. We do not discriminate against any other form of government.

As a side note, our regional currency is the Bap, and we encourage you to assimilate your currency upon moving here.
