Lying somewhere in the outskirts of the Milky Way, Fjodar is a lonely, harsh planet remarkable for its pervasive, frigid climate, sparing small to moderately sized isolated grasslands in maritime areas. Somewhere around the year 2256 Anno Domini, Humans first made planetfall on Fjodar through a graceful crash landing, whereafter they lost all contact with all existing interstellar governments. 

Centuries have passed, and Fjodar has emerged as a Germano-Nordic world in the midst of an industrial revolution, still uncontacted by the wider galaxy and largely unaware that Fjodar isn&amp;#39;t the homeworld of Humanity.
