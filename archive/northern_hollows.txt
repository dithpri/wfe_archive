The secluded area of high mountains and steep valleys around the open coast form the [region]Northern Hollows[/region]. Separated by the large and dominant [i]River Lud[/i], the two nations that make up the Nation are [nation]Louthia[/nation] and [nation]LynchMoor[/nation] on either side.
[nation]LynchMoor[/nation], sunk within one of the largest of the valleys, is the largest and oldest of the nations; known for its lush forests, pleasant scenery and revered Red Fox population. While nearby [nation]Louthia[/nation] was settled more recently by those of [nation]LynchMoor[/nation] and surrounding areas to escape the hearty bustle of modern life; embroiled in the simple life, beautiful culture and traditions of olden times.
