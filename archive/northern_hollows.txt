The secluded mountains and valleys around the coast form the [region]Northern Hollows[/region]. The two nations that make up the mainland Nation are [nation]Louthia[/nation] and [nation]LynchMoor[/nation], with the recent addition of [region]Gneuban[/region], an island dictatorship off the coast. LynchMoor is sunk within the largest valley, it is the largest and oldest of the nations; known for its forests and revered Red Foxs. Nearby, the nation of [nation]Louthia[/nation] was settled recently in the surrounding area by those wanting away from the bustle of modern life. Gneuban is a tyrannical dictatorship with an almost crumbling internal structure, settled on an irradiated island. They offer protection for the region in exchange for resources from the mainland.
