The invasion by [b]DEN[/b] has been [color=red]CRUSHED[/color] under the iron fist of [nation]Revedonia[/nation]!

We shall not be made to conform to the desires of those more powerful, but instead resist and rise to our full potential.
As long as I am in control of this region, we will not fall without a fight! Please feel free to read the posted dispatch, &quot;The Problem That Is Raiders&quot; by [nation]Roosevetania[/nation], and voice your opinion. Your support is much appreciated.

Good day gentlemen.

[region]Blackwick Mountain[/region] stand strong!
