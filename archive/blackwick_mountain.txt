The invasion by [b]DEN[/b] has been [color=red]CRUSHED[/color] under the iron fist of [nation]Revedonia[/nation]!

We shall not be made to conform to the desires of those more powerful, but instead resist and rise to our full potential.
As long as I am in control of this region, we will not fall without a fight!

Good day gentlemen.

[region]Blackwick Mountain[/region] stand strong!
