Hello,

This was a large region, then everyone stopped being active.
I am still active though, Huzzah! 
Join us comrades, in our fight against oppression.

Also, balderdash to modern technology and futuristic stuff! We needn&amp;#39;t have futuristic things to succeed!

Typewriters and steam ships are the way it is done properly, methinks.
