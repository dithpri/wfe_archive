Europa Oriental is the eastern part of the European continent. The term has widely disparate and varying geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic readings, which makes it highly context-dependent and even volatile. There are &amp;quot;almost as many definitions of Europa Oriental as there are scholars of the region&amp;quot;. A related World Assembly paper adds that &amp;quot;every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct&amp;quot;. One definition describes Eastern Europe as a cultural (and econo-cultural) entity: the region lying in Europe with main characteristics consisting in Byzantine, Orthodox, and some Turco-Islamic influences.
