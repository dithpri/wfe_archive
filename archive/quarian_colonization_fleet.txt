QCF is a quarian fleet that was created by Yel&amp;#39;Tees vas Iktomi that had a job to try and colonize new planets, where could quarians live and have their homes. Admiral Yel than created 1st colony in the Dholen system on planet Haestrom and created their 1st &amp;quot;planet-state&amp;quot;. We hope that in the future we&amp;#39;ll have more than just one colony or (if the quarians cannot get used to living on planets) having some &amp;quot;mini-fleet&amp;quot; orbit around the planet.
