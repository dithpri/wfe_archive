The New African Union is based on a future scenario where a military coup of sorts has happened and now a united league of African nations controls the world. Any nation is free to join the New African Union, and may make a land claim as long as it&#39;s not too big. For now, to make any claim, just telegram me, [nation]Xibansa[/nation] personally.
