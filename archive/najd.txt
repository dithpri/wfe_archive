28% of Saudis live in Najd. Najd consists of the regions of Riyadh, Al-Qassim.

Najdis are the &amp;quot;dominant minority&amp;quot; in Saudi Arabia. Unlike Hejaz, Najd is very remote and stayed outside of the reign of important foreign empires.

[I]&#147;O Allah, give us baraka in our Syria, O Allah, give us baraka in our Yemen.&#148; They said: &#147;And in our Najd?&#148; and he said: &#147;O Allah, give us baraka in our Syria, O Allah, give us baraka in our Yemen.&#148; They said: &#147;And in our Najd?&#148; and I believe that he said the third time: &#147;In that place are earthquakes, and seditions, and in that place shall rise the devil&#146;s horn [qarn al-shaytan].&#148;&amp;quot;[/I]
