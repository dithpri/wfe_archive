[b][color=Green]Nordic Lands[/color][/b] values freedom above all else. No player will ever be forced to play a certain way or endorse a nation that they do not wish to endorse.

[b][color=Green]Nordic Lands[/color][/b] is a [color=green][b]Meritocracy[/b][/color]. Here you&#39;re only limited by your own ambitions and statesmanship.

[b]We are a Nordic Themed region, but all cultures are welcomed![/b]

[b]Please read the NS Guide and FAQs linked above.[/b]

We do [b][color=red]NOT[/color][/b] communicate with NS Moderators, as their decisions are largely [u]unfair[/u] and [u]arbitrary[/u] at best.

For immediate administrative concerns please telegram a Regional Officer or message them on Discord.
