[b][color=1E90FF]Nordic Lands[/color][/b] values freedom above all else. No player will ever be forced to play a certain way or endorse a nation that they do not wish to endorse.

[b][color=1E90FF]Nordic Lands[/color][/b] is a [color=1E90FF][b]Meritocracy[/b][/color]. Here you&#39;re only limited by your own ambitions and statesmanship.
