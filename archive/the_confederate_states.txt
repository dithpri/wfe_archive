[b][color=darkred]Welcome to [i]The Confederate States[/i]! A region that is truly founded on state&amp;#39;s rights and individual liberty. This region will endeavor to preserve the culture and civility of the Old South while discarding that which is most abhorrent. It is also our goal to establish a tradition of open, participatory, direct, and transparent democracy whereby all can have free participation no matter their status.[/color][/b]
