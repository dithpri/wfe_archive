[b][color=darkred]Welcome to [i]The Confederate States[/i]! A region that is truly founded on state&amp;#39;s rights and individual liberty.

It is also our goal to establish a tradition of open, participatory, direct, and transparent democracy whereby all can have free participation no matter their status.[/color][/b]
