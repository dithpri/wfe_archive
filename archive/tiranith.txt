A Realm seperate from the rest of Time/Space, appears to be a fast ocean of stars, with raised circular ocean in the middle with waterfalls flowing down to the stellar sea which is full of galexies of starts. The middle circular raised ocean is where light emulating from. On it lies a main contenent with a few smaller empty contenents and various islands around it.

The realm is entirely independant from the WA and all foriegn authority, as with the kingdoms within.
