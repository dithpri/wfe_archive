hi there 
Welcome if you are a new Nationstate member .here are my simple Rule&#39;s  

1. Give respect to all nations
2.Friendly fire
3. Stay in the boundaries of the nation and don&#39;t causes problems with other nations.
4. No swearing or any foul language to another nation or Country
5. and custom your flag be unique and original don&#39;t copy others design.

Okay those are the five rules I have. I want is a loving community from all of those who want to come in my nation. But also protecting it from harm. If we are being watched through other nations.ask this question would you like to be a friend or foe and you choose  Foe. why did you want to attack the nation. And give me three reasons why

Sincerely 
Thomas
