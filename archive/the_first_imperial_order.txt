[i]&quot;There is only one plan&#151;one great design which shall govern the universe&#151;mine.&#148;[/i]
 
A little bit of history:
[region]The First Imperial Order[/region] is a region in which that was founded out of the ruins of battle and chaos by none other than [nation]Deum Perpetua[/nation]; the main focus that he had this for was to restore peace within the Trans-Dimensional Superpowers, he had a two of his most trusted set as his &quot;Sword&quot; and his &quot;Shield&quot;. 

The Shield is to protect The Order from any threats internally and externally, and the Sword smites at the will of The Emperor.
