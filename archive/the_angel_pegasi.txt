We have tons of fun things to do like play at the beach, or perhaps one of our region&#146;s many playgrounds, or go to the library. You cannot litter in The Angel Pegasi region, or you will be kindly asked to leave this region. Our region&#146;s founder is Forista&#146;s queen, Queen Rayanda Wing lll. We hope you enjoy this region, and sand dollars and sea shells are our currency here in The Angel Pegasi region. We also have the worlds biggest kelpie statue, for it is the founder&#146;s favorite animal.
