&quot;Pacem, libertatem, fraternitatem&quot;

Novaterra is a region where every nation, big or small, communist or capitalist, has a voice and can be represented.

Here there are no offsite forums, only a warm, welcoming environment.
We will soon publish dispatches about elections, what we approve of or not, our government, and what to do to start embassies.

ALL IDEOLOGIES WELCOME.
If you want to have a good time on NS, you know what to do (click the little &quot;move to Novaterra&quot; button)
