Novaterra-12d, more commonly known as &quot;Novaterra&quot;, was a planet initially found in the Novaterra Exploration Program, searching for an alternate place for human inhabitation. An initial spaceship settled forcefully in 2143 in the previously-uninhabited planet, and struggled for remaining resources, breaking the spaceship society of approximately 100 million persons into multiple separate nations, that continue to this day.

Novaterra is a welcoming community wishful for new members.
