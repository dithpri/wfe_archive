[color=gold][b]Novaterra is a Discord- based Roleplaying region which has a world map, an active community and a throughly tested inter- nation warfare system.

Set in the 24th Century, the Game takes place on a planet which has only recently been colonised by settlers from Earth. As space travel is not fully developed yet, the settlers are outside Earth&#146;s oversight and have complete autonomy.

Registered players will receive territory and a starting population of settlers with which they can begin building their nation.

Nations created in Novaterra can be inspired by all of Earth&#146;s many cultures but must reflect actual history[/b][/color]
