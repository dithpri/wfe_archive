I&#39;m so sorry but I simply want to be the one I was before. I feel nostalgic for the days where I was happy and everything around made me smile. I always say to myself that I don&#39;t need much but I always push myself to get more and more.

In the end, what I just really wanted is to become loved by everyone. But, what&#39;s so good about being loved by everyone if I don&#39;t truly enjoy what I&#39;m doing?

When I say I wanna die I do not mean it literally. I just want to erase everything I built but not enjoy and begin anew... again.

&quot;Saying, &quot;This is just like back then,&quot; doesn&#39;t mean I want to go back
I&#39;m searching for the sky we lost
I want you to understand
So stop making a sad face like you&#39;re the victim&quot;.
