[color=#670067][b]And the Lord spake, saying,[/b] [i]&quot;First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.

Five is right out! Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.&quot;[/i][/color]
