We&amp;#39;re a happy bunch of travellers who love to see new things. We&amp;#39;re gregarious and friendly - but not neccessarily sane! Some of us wear scarves, some wear bow ties, others wear opera cloaks or even decorative vegetables! Principle sporting interests among the younger members of the region are cricket and football, and tea is the main regional drink.
