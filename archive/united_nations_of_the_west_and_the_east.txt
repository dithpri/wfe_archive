All nations unite! 


Regional anthem:

You pushed away the severe storm.                       
You gave us a belief, Comrade Alberto Struphadara!           
We can not live without you.                            
Our country can not exist without you.                  

Our future and hope depend on you.                      
People&#39;s fate depends on you, Comrade Vladimir Lenin!
We can not live without you.                            
Our country can not exist without you.                  

Even if the world changes hundreds of times,            
People believe in you, Comrade Jermu!          
We can not live without you.                            
Our country can not exist without you.
