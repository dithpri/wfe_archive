The Waver (and Turon) Archipelagos are located in the South Western Pacific, within 250 miles of each other. The leader of the Waver Archipelago is Seriona, and the leader of the Turon Archipelago is Reas. Waver Archipelago is more war based, with fighting beginning in the 12th century. This creates military juggernauts like Bravad or Confused and separated states like Mujeus. There is a fine diversity in governments with corporate, Democratic, Communist, Theocracy, and Anrachy based governments. Turon Archipelago is more peaceful, excluding Gloriasi. They have a more straight forward line of governments with mostly democracies or corporate controlled governments.
