In 1801, Europe was dominated by Napoleon Bonaparte, who, as First Consul of France, had just defeated Austria in the Treaty of Lun&eacute;ville, expanding French influence. Britain remained at war with France, though peace talks were underway. The Holy Roman Empire weakened, Russia shifted its policies under Tsar Alexander I, and Spain aligned with France. Prussia stayed neutral, while the Ottoman Empire and Portugal were caught in the broader conflict. Europe stood on the brink of the Napoleonic era.
