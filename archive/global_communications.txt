Global Communications allows all government types and nations. Our prime concern is diplomacy and interaction between diverse countries, without the enforced load of regional culture that may not apply. We currently have a Psychotic Dictatorship, Scandinavian Liberal Paradise, Democratic Socialist, Iron Fist Consumerist, Father Knows Best, and Inoffensive Centrist Democracy in our broad range. All you need to join is the regional password (for security reasons) and an openness to moderate international relations.
