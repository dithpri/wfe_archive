[b][color=blue]Welcome to the Continent of Erezia[/b][/color]

You have sailed the oceans and you have found this secret piece of land, a whole continent lost in time, resembling an old, fantastical Europe, Where a hundred different nations live in harmony.

Here you can find Dragons, wizards, evil bitches and camwhores, but there is nothing impossible, and no one is invincible for a brave heart and a good sword.
