The Sovereign Homeland is a region of liberal politics, democratic ideals, and the ideologies of freedom and equality. 
We are a comparatively new region and therefore it is easier to achieve an executive position in The Senate. We also have an active military and police force
The Regional Government, called the Senate, is headed by the President, which is fixed as the President of Oroterra. The people (anyone who joins the region) elect 
the twenty senators who run the everyday business of the region and amend the constitution when appropriate. They elect the the judges to the Judicial Authority and the generals to the Military Authority. The senators, judges and generals elect the WA delegate.
