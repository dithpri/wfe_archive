After the fall of our Homeland, the Asmor Federation fled to a large abandoned military base. The Region is ruled over by our Chancellor(former warlord) and the Stratocracy Council. Our culture is made up from the Remnants of fallen/broken nations. Our Primary Duty is to Defend our population of Asmorian Elves and Lunar Angels, who were formerly enslaved.  We like to thank the Bajorans for bringing Spiritual Enlightenment to us.

The Asmor Federation stands with the Nation of Israel and her People. Jews and Christians are welcome here. Hatred of them will NOT be tolerated.  Communism of any type is Forbidden within our borders.
