This region is a large military base for the Asmor Federation. The Region is ruled over by our Chancellor(former warlord) and the Stratocracy Council. Our culture is made up from the Remnants of fallen/broken nations. Our Primary Duty is to Defend our population of Asmorian Elves and Lunar Angels, who were formerly enslaved.  We like to thank the Bajorans for bringing Spiritual Enlightenment to us.

The Asmor Federation stands with the Nation of Israel and her People. Jews &amp; Christians are welcome, any hatred won&#39;t be tolerated. Communism etc...is Forbidden within our borders.
