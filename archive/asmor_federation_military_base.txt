After the loss of our Homeland, We the Asmor Federation sit exiled in this large abandoned military base, plotting and building for us to rise again, and become a next big empire.
 
The Region is ruled over by our Chancellor(a former warlord).  Our culture is made up from the Remnants of fallen/broken nations-kingdoms.

The Asmor Federation stands with the Nation of Israel and her People. Jews and Pro-Israel Christians are welcome here. 

Communism is Forbidden within our borders.
