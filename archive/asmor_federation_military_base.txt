This region is a large military base for the Asmor Federation. The Region is ruled over by our Chancellor(a former warlord).  Our culture is made up from the Remnants of fallen/broken nations, and our population is made up of Terrans, Asmorian Elves and Lunar Angels, who were freed from being enslaved.  Bajorans are welcomed guests to bring Spiritual Enlightenment to us.

The Asmor Federation stands with the Nation of Israel and her People. Jews and Pro-Israel Christians are welcome here. 

Communism is Forbidden within our borders.
