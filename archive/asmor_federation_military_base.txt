We are the militarized nation known as the Asmor Federation. We are ruled over by our Chancellor(former warlord) and the Stratocracy Council. Our culture is made up from the Remnants of fallen/broken nations. Our Primary Duty is to Defend our population of Asmorian High Elves, Lunar Angels, who were formerly enslaved.  We like to thank the Bajorans for bringing Spiritual Enlightenment to our borders.

The Asmor Federation stands with the Nation of Israel and her People. Jews and Christians are welcome here. Hatred of them will NOT be tolerated.

We the Asmor Federation are somewhat Imperial. By Order of the Chancellor, Communism of any type is Forbidden within our borders.
