After the loss of our Homeland, We the Asmor Federation sit exiled in this large abandoned military base, planning and building to rise again. (84% survival rate for Z-Day 2021)
 
This Anti-Villain Region is ruled over by our Chancellor(a former warlord).  Our culture is made up from the Remnants of fallen/broken nations-kingdoms of Terrans, Lunar Angels, outcast high and dark Elves, and Bajorans.

The Asmor Federation stands with the Nation of Israel and her People. Jews and Pro-Israel Christians are welcome here. 

Far Left/Communism is Forbidden within our borders.
