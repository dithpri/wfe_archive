Welcome to the planet of Zoca. Dirtcrakia first established their rule here when apocalyptic events on their own planet forced them to move to another part of the galaxy. They found Zoca a fitting home. Shortly after arriving, Libertarian activist threatened rebellion if they did not get their own independent country. They formed [nation]Ausmota[/nation]. Speak to Dirtcrakia if you want to be apart of this planet.
