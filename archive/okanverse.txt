Okanverse, or the Habitable Bulk Local Bubble (HBLB) is one of the many great &quot;habitable nexuses&quot; in the broader multiverse known as the Bulk. Because physics vary widely from universe - also known as a brane - to universe, across the Bulk, much of it is completely uninhabitable to human-like beings down to the level of basic biochemistry and electromagnetic interaction. This desolate landscape is punctuated here and there by oases and sometimes great clusters of habitable space, sometimes connected by filaments of habitable space stretching through the higher dimensions.
