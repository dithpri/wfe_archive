Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleepin&#39;
We could dream this night away.

But there&#39;s a full moon risin&#39;
Let&#39;s go dancin&#39; in the light
We know where the music&#39;s playin&#39;
Let&#39;s go out and feel the night.

Because I&#39;m still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I&#39;m still in love with you
On this harvest moon.

When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart.

But now it&#39;s gettin&#39; late
And the moon is climbin&#39; high
I want to celebrate
See it shinin&#39; in your eye.

Because I&#39;m still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I&#39;m still in love with you
On this harvest moon.
