[b]Welcome to The Moon.[/b]

Nothing much happens here, since there&#39;s no oxygen. But if you&#39;re lucky, you might find some neat craters! Lunar explorers are encouraged to drop into the MoonLight Bar on our [url=http://z3.invisionfree.com/TheMoon][b][color=#427daa]forums[/color][/b][/url] - or not, since we don&#39;t use it.

All are welcome here, except for Martians. Go home, greenies!

Those outsiders wondering about our rising population may wish to ponder this statement:

[b]Residents of The Moon debate:[/b] &quot;If you cannot see the Earth from the Far side of the Moon - does the Earth really exist?&quot;
