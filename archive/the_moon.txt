[b]Welcome to The Moon.[/b]

All are welcome here, except for Martians. Go home, greenies!

Nothing much happens on the Moon, since there&#39;s no oxygen. But if you&#39;re lucky, you might find some neat craters! Lunar explorers are encouraged to drop into the MoonLight Bar, which is now hosted on our RMB since the forums imploded.

Cheese is our speciality, particularly the stuff with holes in it. It&#39;s freshly mined by captive astronauts, so take your pick. Just watch out for buried Transformers and roving Moon Princesses.

[b]Conspiracy theorists should ponder:[/b] What if the Moon landings weren&#39;t faked - only the return to Earth? There&#39;s a reason they haven&#39;t visited in over 40 years...
