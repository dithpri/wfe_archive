Association of Southern Hemisphere Nations is a regional association between states on earth&#39;s southern hemisphere that cooperates in culture, economy, politics, military and other things. Was established by the basis of the same objectives and goals that these nations don&#39;t want anything to do with today&#39;s politics, they just wanted to chill and enjoy life in the southern hemisphere near the Antarctic.
