[b]Welcome to [region]the New Socialist Coalition[/region]![/b]

In accordance with its Socialist ideology, the NSC is a free region committed to the advancement of democratic values in both political and economic spheres. Our Region is accepting of all nations who join, asking only that their nation&#39;s decisions align with the values of the region.

As a region, the Coalition does not intend to compete with established and powerful leftist regions, but rather to work alongside them in the common goal of advancement of Socialist values.
