[i]Welcome to Mesoamerica, an official Protectorate Region of [region]Declansburg[/region]![/i]

Mesoamerica is a historical and important region and cultural area in southern North America and most of Central America. In Nationstates, however, this region is just about utterly worthless. It has absolutely no influence on anything anybody does and we&#39;re pretty sure it will not be remembered.

[i][b]UPDATE:[/b] Mesoamerica is trying to become slightly relevant![/i] Stay tuned.
