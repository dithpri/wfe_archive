Welcome to Vigila Pacem! A natural paradise awaits all peaceful young nations with the intention of creating a safe, diplomatic region. Founded by the country Terra Aquadamas, this region focuses on civil rights and political freedom for all. The region is open to democracies only. If a nation is non-democratic, research will be done on the happiness and civil rights of said nation before being allowed access to the region. The lush, beautiful environment in which this region rests is a natural treasure, and for this reason only the most environmentally aware nations will be allowed into this region. We extend serenity and kindness to all nations reflecting on joining the wonderful region of Vigila Pacem!
