The Confederation of Corrupt Dictators once blessed the great plains of NS with its infamous presence.

Time to bring back a bit of the past and create a little bit of controversy.

With a little more governance for all the World Assembly fanatics.

Disclaimer:
This is not Jocospor.
The attempt is to have a controversial region without all that nonsense the other one had and have a little fun in the process.
What&#146;s more fun than having a common enemy.
