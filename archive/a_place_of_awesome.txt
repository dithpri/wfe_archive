A place of Awesome is a place where everyone is awesome!
We are still a young region just waiting for you to come and shape it, we welcome anyone, any nation, we are a very young region, but offer much. We don&#39;t have much though, but that can all change when you join! When we have more nations here we will get a regional map, and a regional forum (maybe, still under consideration). We will have open offices, like WA delegate, or Minister of Defense. We hope you consider us to join!
