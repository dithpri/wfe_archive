Uskeluuse is a small region consisting of several nations, organized into a loose confederacy with a basic regional government setup akin to many others with the founding nation and WA Delegate in control of the region. Most of the leaders of these countries originate from the same area. The regional confederacy was founded by Oksylia, a nation removed from the Pacific to lead a better future for itself and it&#39;s follower nations. It&#39;s environment is mixed between the nations there but for the most part the countries present tend to ignore the environment, with only some keeping the environment thriving.
