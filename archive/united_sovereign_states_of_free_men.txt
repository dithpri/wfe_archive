This is the hold of the free man, and his elected representatives, organized into sovereign states, with free choice and justice enshrined in law, and democracy in politics. With free, thriving markets supported by bountiful soil...with strong armies erected independently for the protection of liberty...with strong police forces and courts executing the orders of justice, and civilization...this region will rule supreme, for in this place all men choose their destinies and the enforcers of its laws and do not stumble down that road of serfdom too long trodden, but fight for the reign of virtue. Here, light reigns and goodness prevails.
