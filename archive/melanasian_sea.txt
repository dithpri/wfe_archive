Welcome to the Melanasian Sea! Our climate is mostly tropical, democracy is fledgling, and coups are generally expected at some point or another. Many nations of [region]European Union[/region] once had colonial holdings in this part of the world, however most have let them go and periodically check in on them by diplomatic - or other - means. Enjoy your stay!
