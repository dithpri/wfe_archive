These nations, coming from similar cultures, have decided to form an alliance. Its currency is the .22 LR round. This region is primarily for CBHS students and their affiliates. (If you need a password, the password is our school mascot without caps or spaces). 

Here is the regional chat document. The W.A. delegate checks this everyday, and also if you need anything feel free to send me a telegram.
