[color=purple][b]ALLIANCE OF CBHS[/b][/color]

Welcome to the [region]Alliance of CBHS[/region]! We were formed from the merger of the original three CBHS regions, the Alliance of CBHS, the Union of Brotherhood, and the Confederacy of Purple and Gold, and now we are one. Our goal is to promote brotherhood between all CBHS students, past, present, and future. Introduce yourself in the chat and endorse our delegate.
