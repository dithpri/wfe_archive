[color=red][B]Welcome to the Great NationStates Expedition Headquarters![/B][/color]

The Great NS Expedition was born on the fateful day of January 4th of 2015 and was the brainchild of one The Rogue Nation of Ava Ire. We are a group of travelers that go all around the NationStates world, seeking different regions to inhabit. Any region is fair game for an expedition, from The Black Riders to Balder. 

[B]And as long as your borders are open, you can count on one thing: one day, we&#39;ll pop by and say hello.
Expect us.[/B]
