Welcome to Midwest Japan! A region surrounded by sea similar to the island Japan, but slightly cold with rice and wheat.

[b]History: 
&quot;long before, the region was a place of Rabbits in a quiet lonely ocean. 
the pioneers who brought their God, Fishing Nets and Ramen 
said &#39;We shall make this our land,
 if they live in such a deserted place 
we shall make it our home as well.&#39;
thus was the beginning of Midwest Japan.&quot;
