Greetings! We are Kennan, a region of friends dedicated to worldbuilding and roleplaying. Our region is a region of opposites: democracies and autocracies; bustling cities and untouched wilderness; ancient peoples and infant nations. Despite these differences, we are united in friendship and Kennanite pride. Feel free to join us! We hope to make you feel welcome here.
