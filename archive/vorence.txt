[b][color=green]Welcome to Vorence! [/color][/b]

[i][color=blue]This region is home to nations of quite the variety. Some of which have experienced things from famine, plague, and even thermonuclear warfare. We prefer to maintain an in character role-playing community, but are open to any and every idea out there. Vorence can provide a meaningful and enjoyable existence for any nation.[/i][/color]
