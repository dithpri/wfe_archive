I&amp;#39;m Commandin Pillotus, and I&amp;#39;m back. If you want to join, contact me or our WA Delegate, Scyclones Empire. We&amp;#39;ll decide between the two of us if you&amp;#39;re OK to join.

I&amp;#39;m setting some rules for the message board.

1). No arguments. I want to keep the message board open for announcements, so take your arguments to a forum or use telgrams.
2). No offensive language. No cursing, slurs, or other insults.
3). No gore/torture descriptions. No one wants to hear about your sick, sadistic, fantasies.
4). &amp;quot;Ranoria is cool&amp;quot; must be placed before and after all entries.
