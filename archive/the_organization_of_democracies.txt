No longer are we under the control of the [region]Black Riders[/region] . [region]The Organization of Democracies[/region] is now free, for now, thanks to the kind leaders of [nation]Doggroomer[/nation] and [nation]Dilualih[/nation].

Telegram me if you want to join; I will look at your nation and determine if it is worthy, then I will, if you ARE worthy, give you the regional password.
