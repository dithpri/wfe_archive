Imperia was a large empire that spanned an entire continent. It lasted for 1489 years as a major world superpower.
As the empire collapsed due to a revolution against the nationalists and socialist revolutionaries, Clavicus, a young military officer, gathered the support of the people to create a new nation, one that would not fall again.
The Nationalists wanted to re-create Imperia&#39;s government and policies, however, Clavicus rejected them to create his own.
Clavicus established YEAR 1 as the year that Imperia fell. The dating system now used by most former Imperian territories.
