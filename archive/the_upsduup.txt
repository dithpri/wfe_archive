The United People&#39;s Syndicalist Democracies United Under the Prince (or the U.P.S.D.U.U.P.) is a collection of nation states who acknowledge the glorious Prince Gregarious&#39; status as leader of the great revolution.  While all states are given their own autonomous socialist democratic governments, the Prince himself decides on matter of foreign policy and exercises executive authority over all member states.  

All nationalities are equal within this pact so long as they follow the prince, and all are allowed to be different as long as they are different in the same way as us.  

Long live the People!
Long live the Prince!
Long live the Revolution!
