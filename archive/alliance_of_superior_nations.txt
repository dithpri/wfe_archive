Are your nation superior to other nations?
Yes?
Then join this great alliance!

[color=black][b]* Member nations must agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party.
* A nation can choose to keep neutral in an conflict instigated by another member, but are obligated to give economic support.
* No acts of hostilities amongst members are allowed.
* A member nation cannot support (economically, politically or militarily) a nation at war with another member nation.
* Once a nation leaves the ASN (or is thrown out), it cannot become part of it again (exceptions can be made).[/b][/color]


[color=crimson][i]Creating a counsil of member nations will be possible when there are enough members in the alliance.[/i][/color]
