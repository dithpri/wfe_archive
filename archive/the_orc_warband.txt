The Orc Warband is the name of the combined force of all the Orc Clans. Orcs thrive on fighting, it is the only thing that keeps them happy. Peaceful bosses don&amp;#39;t get far in the politics of Orcs.
The Orcs are by no means organized, they are just drawn together by the mutual aim of destroying everything they see that isn&amp;#39;t green. Although much of the time they fight amongst themselves.

The Orc Code:
1. Green is best.
2. Anything not green must be destroyed.
3. Orcs like fighting above all else.
4. If the Warboss can&amp;#39;t defend his title, then he is not fit to lead.
5. Orcs can build anything out of any material.
