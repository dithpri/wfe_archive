The Orc Warband is the name of the combined force of all the Orc Clans. Orcs thrive on fighting, it is the only thing that keeps them happy. Peaceful bosses don&amp;#39;t get far in the politics of Orcs.
The Orcs are by no means organized, they are just drawn together by the mutual aim of destroying everything they see that isn&amp;#39;t green. Although much of the time they fight amongst themselves.
