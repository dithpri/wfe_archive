[b]The Island of Palos is a decently-sized island in the Pacific which is currently united into a fragile federation.[/b]

[b]History:[/b]
The island of palos was inhabited by the Palian people, a native populace of Polynesian descent which now is a minority in the island due to the colonisation by both the British and the Spanish Empires in the 1700s.
The three separate States of Palos declared independence recently (2023), but they united after 2 years into a federation, a federation that however is very unstable due to the internal tensions between the states.
