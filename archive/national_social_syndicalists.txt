[b]&amp;quot;Hate is able to provoke disorders, to ruin a social organization, to cast a country into a period of bloody revolutions; but it produces nothing.&amp;quot;[/b]

We work fight for real worker&amp;#39;s welfare, not a dictatorship of the proletariat.
We believe, however, that the real conflict is the national conflict
We hate socialists and communists. They simply do not understand human nature.
Simply, we are nationalists.
