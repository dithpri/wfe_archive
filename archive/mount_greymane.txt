[b][i]Welcome to [region]Mount Greymane[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This snowy peak is the hunting grounds of [nation=short]Thane the Winter Wolf[/nation], one of the Wolf Clan&#39;s fiercest warriors. Like so many others, Thane hopes to end the reign of the Mad King and see Armello ruled by his clan. He has come to his favorite hunting grounds to hone his skill with a sword against the mountain&#39;s most fearsome beasts.

In his pride, however, Thane has bitten off more than he can chew. Spotting a Bane, a creature of darkness, stalking the mountain paths, he charged after the terrible, vulture-like demon and attacked! Now they battle atop the mountain, evenly matched. Whichever Clan should score the most points will help Thane slay the Bane and claim Mount Greymane as their own!
