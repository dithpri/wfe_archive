The [b][color=red]Union of Anti-Fascist Regions[/color][/b] is an alliance of regions dedicated to fighting the far-right ideology we know by the name of fascism. The regions are deemed equal in all aspects of treaty organization. No nation or region is superior to another one in terms of inter-regional positions. The flag and emblems were made by the propaganda committee.
