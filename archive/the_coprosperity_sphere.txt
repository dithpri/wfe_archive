The Co-Prosperity Sphere had been founded as an alternative to regions such as the Social Liberal Union which place civil rights above economic prosperity. Here in the CPS we put aside partisanship in order to pursue economic prosperity and regional/national security through mutual defense. So if you&#39;ve been ejected by another region due to civil rights or political freedoms and wish to solely be judged by your economic policies then please message Dei Gentem with your application, after review by our executive board we will send you the password to join.
