The UND is a conglomerate of nations that stand for freedom in the political, societal, and economic ideas each may hold. All from psychotic dictatorships to democratic utopias are welcome. We are aligned in one goal, the destruction of the WA. No mass shall impose their morals on another.

So why do we have a WA delegate? Well, you can only stop such a great force from the inside. It is the way the great game is played.
