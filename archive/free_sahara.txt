[b]ATTENTION:[/b] Everyone in Free Sahara or who has been ejected from Greater Sahara may now return to Greater Sahara. Please note that all members of the World Assembly are required to endorse the President until our transition to a stronghold is complete. Thank you for your cooperation.[hr] Since the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1893868]TRUST pact[/url] has been signed, and the conflict between the two regions has been laid to rest. 
As part of the agreement, those who once called Free Sahara their home may return to the Greater Sahara at long last. As for Free Sahara, it will exist only as a museum, and a monument to the historic struggle. By learning from the past, we can ensure that that struggle will never again divide us so deeply.

May peace prevail for the common good of the Saharans.
