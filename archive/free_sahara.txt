Yesterday, the people of this region were separated from [region]Greater Sahara[/region]. It was a time of conflict, of rivalries, of war and bitter words. 
But today is another story. Today, the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1893868]TRUST pact[/url] has been signed, and the conflict between the two regions has been laid to rest. 
As part of the agreement, those who once called Free Sahara their home may return to the Greater Sahara at long last. As for Free Sahara, it will exist only as a museum, and a monument to the historic struggle. By learning from the past, we can ensure that that struggle will never again divide us so deeply.

May peace prevail for the common good of the Saharans.
