Welcome to the Vengrynkhal Empire.

As you may notice, we&#39;re losing nations like a leaky beanbag. Therefore, we are in need of recruiters. You may apply to become a recruiter here (http://s15.zetaboards.com/Vengrynkhal/topic/8475411/1/).

You may wonder what this job entails. Well, if you become a recruiter, you will be required to check the World Activity list for recently founded nations, and send recruitment telegrams to them. You will be asked to do this twice per week, at least.
