We, the hidden lords of Galtil, are proud to present our glorious region to you!
We see freedom as an ideal, as the highest value, as a shrine, blinding the false faces of our opponents with its brilliance. Freedom is our Sun, our north star, which shows us the way in the darkness of the unhappy era of Kali Yuga. We are ardent enemies of communism, nazism, socialism and other plebeian ideas. Leave it to the workers, slaves, dalits and other rabble who are approaching the Mahapralaya offensive.
Join our underground if you share our sacred covenants and let the flame of Freedom illuminate the firmament of our land with the righteous light of Truth!
Glory to Galtil!
