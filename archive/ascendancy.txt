The [B][color=darkblue]Ascendancy[/color][/B] is a [B]Future Tech[/B] Roleplaying region with an offsite community forum and galactic map. The region is accepting of all caliber&amp;#39;s of writers and chooses to focus on community growth and world building over elitism. The Ascendancy however still requires an application process which can be found on our forums.
