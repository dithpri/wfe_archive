AFter the collapse of the Domain and the death of the gates the Persean sector has been set back technology wise decades. pirates and terrorists raom systems looking for easy prey. And the major factions are constantly at each other&#39;s throats. Among the prominent factions are, The hegemony, the Tri-Tachyon corporation, The sindiral diklat, The Persean league, The luddic church of galactic redemption. and many other independent governments. Often independent pilots often called spacers are payed to fight for said factions allowing for proxy warfare without declaring war. some just explode the sector. trying to recover technology lost to the AI wars and collapse of the domain.
