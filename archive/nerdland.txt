Hi! We&#39;re nerds. Let&#39;s use actual elections, once a week, not just random endorsements.

This means we will not be using Oozi area&#39;s form of politics, that being argue with people until they submit. If they don&#39;t ban-kick them. No no no. We don&#39;t do that here. We are civilized nerds.

Long live the Nerds.
