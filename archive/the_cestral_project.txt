Welcome to Cestral
Or The Cestral Project!

A nice new region that you can help just by clicking &#39;Move [Nation] to The Cestral Project&#39;!
Anyways, we aim to have a democratic government and a new constitution by March

The Cestral Project is not involved in Raiding or Defending and will take precautionary measures. We may or may not have offsite forums soon. Please Excuse the mess
