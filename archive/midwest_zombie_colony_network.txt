After the outbreak of the C12BA2 virus, society as we know it came to a crumble. Looters, rioters, and marauders overtook towns and cities and killed anyone who got in their way, including each other. The common folk were weeded out slowly as the infected feasted on them and their bodies. The smarter ones left out into the rural areas and slowly colonized, away from the rest of the world. Over time, these colonies connected with others anywhere from miles to states away. Although these colonies are far apart now, they are hoping to one day form one super survivor nation and rebuild society from the ashes.
