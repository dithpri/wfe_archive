This region is created for the purpose of voting down or repealing any resolution in the World Assembly that infringes on a nations national sovereignty. Many proposals and resolutions are anti-Nationstate and disregard the fact that a Nationstate is founded by it&#39;s people, for it&#39;s people, and of it&#39;s people, not for some supernational world assembly. They slowly take away our rights as nations, moving closer and closer to a tyrannic mob-rule of the world&#39;s nations.
