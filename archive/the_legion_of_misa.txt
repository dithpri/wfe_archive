[color=FF00FF][b]Some of us at [region]The Black Hawks[/region] had an interesting day. It mostly was composed of long talks about various anime and experiences, which then moved to the topic of salted rice when we got hungry, all to end off on a quite insightful Japanese lesson from our resident weeb and company. Oh, and I suppose we raided your region too.[/color]
