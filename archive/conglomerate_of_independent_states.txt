The Conglomerate of Independent States is an association of three countries held loosely together by various treaties. 
While not the most diplomatic of decisions, the military matters of the Conglomerate are handled by the aggressive and xenophobic Terra ex Machina, who&amp;#39;s artificial island cities house the nation&amp;#39;s most impressive and technologically advanced military hardware. Supplementing these are the Timorian&amp;#39;s more traditional military forces.
Diplomacy and internal mediation between the other two extreme nations falls to the Republic of Satsudinar. This smaller, latecomer to the alliance has quickly become the public relations face of the Conglomerate.
