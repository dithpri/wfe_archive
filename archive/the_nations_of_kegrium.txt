Hello new nation!

I am Dextranta, Founder of the Nations of Kegrium, a wonderful region I hope you choose to be your own. One the 20th of February, 2016 I formed this region in the hopes of reuniting my old nations together. I created this region as well in the hopes of creating a friendly community of new nations, who can talk about what they please in a friendly, tolerant environment. The Executive Ministry looks to create that environment, and make it as friendly as possible for all nations. When you choose the region you want live in, choose one that is fair too all, and welcomes all. Thank you, and welcome to The Nations of Kegrium
