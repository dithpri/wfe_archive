The informal term &quot;Soviet Lupercan Empire&quot; is used by critics of [nation]Luperca[/nation] and Lupercanian nationalists to refer to that country&#39;s perceived imperialist foreign policy. The nations said to be part of the Soviet Lupercan Empire were officially independent countries with separate governments that set their own policies (to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the country), but those policies had to remain within certain limits decided by the Soviet Republic of Luperca and enforced by threat of intervention by the Volfgrad Pact. Countries in this situation are often called satellite states.
