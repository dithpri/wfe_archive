[b]On the Halfisland, so to speak, there are the most people who speak the Serbian language, they are all different, but here we call it Slovenian-Serbian, Croatian-Serbian, Bosnian-Serbian, and others. I can say that once upon a time there were novels, and our old Slavic peoples, every country on Balkan Halfisland are known for something, Bosnia is known for the Bosnian War that took place in 1992 and ended in 1995, Serbia is known for a good amount of plums and plum picking, and thus for the traditional drink called Rakija, Croatia is known for its picturesque pebble beaches as well as Montenegro same, and so the rest of the countries also according to some custom, event, place, food, etc.[/b]
