The Rural Region has short, numerous hills. Barns are decaying, cedar-post and barbed-wire fences are nearly falling down. Roads are on crests, trees are in low-lying areas. There are no guard rails. Slip on the ice, roll down the slope. No apologies to anyone. We listen to Country Music, Rock, and Vocal Trance. We have copperheads and brown-recluse spiders. Maybe you should just stay away, if you know what&#39;s good for you. We&#39;re the only ones who really like it.
