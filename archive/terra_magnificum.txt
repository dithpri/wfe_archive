[b]Welcome to Terra Magnificum, a Region founded upon Alternate History and a touch of Fantasy[/b]

Imagine a universe where there have been no great wars, and that the balance of power laid out in the Congress of Vienna still exists, in some form or another. Then, imagine that the great empires of the world remain, and continue to dominate Africa and Asia. Finally, imagine that the human race is joined by other sentient species, notably talking ponies and griffons. This is the world of Terra Magnificum.

For the purposes of this region and Role-Playing, members will be expected (but not required) to assume the identity of a RL-nation on the map.
