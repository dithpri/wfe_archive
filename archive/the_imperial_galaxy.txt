Until recently, the Kingdom of Jacobia maintained strict border controls over their sphere of influence in the Imperial Star System and the otherwise desolate Imperial Galaxy. While still remaining somewhat isolated, the kingdom now allows for colonization and other nations in the star system. They established the Regional Government of the Imperial Galaxy to govern and protect itself and sister nations. It welcomes any and all into its gravitational borders provided they are a friend to liberty and righteousness.
