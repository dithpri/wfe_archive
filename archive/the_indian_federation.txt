In the early days, [region]The Indian Federation[/region] was a growing region, harbouring quite a few citizens. After a month of its creation, a deal was struck between [region]The Indian Federation[/region] and [region]EMPIROSIS[/region], to merge, creating [region]The Indian Empirosis Legion[/region].

Now, a brave region who goes by the name of [nation]IndianFederationProtector[/nation] guards [region]The Indian Federation[/region], alerting [nation]Draftcubic[/nation], the last governor if anything goes wrong.

[b]If you are interested in joining this region, consider joining [region]The Indian Empirosis Legion[/region], as this region is now a relic. Thanks![/b]
