[b][color=#cc3333]Welcome to Limerick - the [i]other[/i] poetic corner of the world![/color][/b]

Without Limerick, NationStates
In all its fun fully abates.
We&#39;ve had up to here
With lack of good cheer,
So join up and write - come, create!

This region is but a successor,
Old history, sadly suppressored,
But maybe we&#39;ll be
Something to see!
I hope we can make it impressive!

Region rules:[/b]

Other places the prose is endemic,
But here, poetry we do mimic.
F&#39;r other stuff there&#39;s no time,
So please try to rhyme
That&#39;s why this place has the name &quot;Limerick!&quot;
