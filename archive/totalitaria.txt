[b][color=blue]Welcome[/color][/b]
Totalitaria is a mainly authoritarian region but we allow other types of nations as well. There are some democratic aspects to this region, such as deciding the Delegate vote and important changes being made to the region. Because Joergenland is the permanent WA Delegate it is a good idea to endorse them as we then have a larger say in international law. We support the WA because it gives us power in the international community, but we are anti security council as commending, condemning, and liberating are useless, time wasting activities.
