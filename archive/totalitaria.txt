[b][color=blue]Welcome[/color][/b]
Totalitaria is a mainly authoritarian region, but we allow other types of nations as well. We have some democracy here, but for most things, executives have the final say. We have polls mainly on WA proposals and resolutions, and also we use the endorsement system to let whoever is the most popular to become the WA Delegate. We have no endorsement cap, but raiders will be immediately evicted and banned.
