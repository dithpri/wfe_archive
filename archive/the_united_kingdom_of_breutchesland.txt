[b][u][i]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/i][/u][/b]

Upon reviewing [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region]&#39;s [URL=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=like_a_rock/detail=factbook/id=732530]list of acquisitions[/URL], J o J came across an undefended region which they had listed as captured from [region]The Red Fleet[/region]/[region]Antifa[/region]/[region]Libcom[/region]/[region]North Korea[/region]. Take care of what you own, [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region], or I will have to do a little bit of a [color=red][b]repo operation[/b][/color] due to your carelessness like I have done here. Well, I never owned it in the first place, but you get the idea.
