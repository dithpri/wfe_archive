The Central Pacific Empire was one of the greatest regions to grace NationStates in the past 5 years, unfortunately in the latter part of the 5 years the region saw a decline in activity, ultimately causing it to cease to exist, deleting years of history on the RMB. 

This new region will serve as a monument to the great empire that once stood. Former CPE residents/rulers are urged to telegram the regional administration.
