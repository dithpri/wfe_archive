Welcome the [B]Old England[/B]!  

The home for Old Anglophiles feel free to explore this great region and enjoy the splendid simplicity and order of the Heptarchy of Kingdoms and feel free to take part in daring defeats of invading Danes (Black Riders, twice now).  

&amp;quot;Collie Knox says 1/8 of the world&#146;s population speaks &#145;English&#146;, and that is the biggest language group. If true, damn shame&#151;say I. May the curse of Babel strike all their tongues till they can only say &#145;baa baa&#146;. It would mean much the same. I think I shall have to refuse to speak anything but Old Mercian.&amp;quot;  -J.R.R. Tolkien 1942, [i]Letters[/i]
