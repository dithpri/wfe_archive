Joyous blessings!  This region proved more than a match for a charge by The Black Riders!

Welcome the Old England!  The home for Old Anglophiles feel free to explore this great region and enjoy the splendid simplicity and order of the heptarchy of Kingdoms and feel free to take part in daring defeats of invading Danes (Black Riders, twice now).  

May it be known that into the battle rode the following losers (once more):
[nation=short]General Halcones[/nation]
[nation=short]The Realm of No Return[/nation]

Fear the mighty flag of Wessex, never to falter!
