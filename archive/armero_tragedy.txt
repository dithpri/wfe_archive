[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armero][b]Armero[/b][/url] was a small town located in the [b]Colombian Andes[/b], near the [b]Nevado del Ruiz volcano[/b]. It was founded in the [b]19th century[/b] and was known for its agriculture, particularly for growing coffee beans.

On [b]November 13[/b], [b]1985[/b], the town was hit by a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armero_tragedy]catastrophic disaster[/url] when the Nevado del Ruiz volcano erupted, triggering a massive avalanche of mud, rocks, and water. The eruption was caused by a combination of factors including the volcano&#39;s proximity to a glacier and heavy rainfall, which caused the glacier to melt rapidly and unleash a deadly lahar (mudflow).
