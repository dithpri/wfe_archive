Named after the wallydaeger, an elusive, ferret-like animal that lives in low, or unpopulated areas, Wallydaeger is a peaceful, generally left wing region that strongly supports fun and creativity. It is home to several Dharma Initiative stations, including the rubber duck, and the wallydaeger. Wallydaeger is also the region with the highest population of spotted wallydaegers, the forty-second most endangered species. It is also the prime supplier of sonic screwdrivers. It is in constant communication with the trolls of Alternia and the squibs of the magical world. The population has a soft spot for squids and is very decapodian friendly. I hope you have reason to join!
