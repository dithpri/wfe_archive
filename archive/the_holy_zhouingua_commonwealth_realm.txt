The Realm of ten thousand years, ruled by the son of the heavens, The Holy Zhouingua Commonwealth Realm is made up of the many inferior nations which have recognized the authority and superiority of the Zhouingua, who, ruling with benevolence and justice, treats all of the commonwealth realm&#39;s members fairly, and, most of the time, gives them a say in the decision making.
              ALL HAIL THE EMPEROR! GOD SAVE THE ZHOUINGUA!
