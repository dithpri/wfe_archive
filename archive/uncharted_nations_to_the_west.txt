Welcome to Uncharted Nations to the West. We are located to the far west of the world, if you follow the ideology of the Flat Earth Society, we&amp;#39;re right on the edge. A very small continent which no one has ever ventured to because of the fear of the crashing into the stormy seas and falling off the edge of the world. We&amp;#39;re very isolated, but now, due to the invention of the aeroplane, everyone is coming to party.
