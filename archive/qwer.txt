Sir QWER was the younger brother of ASDF, chief of a warrior tribe. They been taught the ways of their forefathers since birth. However, once ASDF became chief, QWER watched in Horror as he threw aside those teachings, forsaking their family legacy. ASDF allied with their tribes long time enemies and created a region that valued freedom and democracy. However, QWER knew from his father&amp;#39;s teachings that the common rabble was ignorant and incabable of deciding what was best for themselves. So QWER took those who shared his views and formed his own region, one that would honor his heritage and never forsake the greater good, no matter the cost. 

Also, QWER isnt random letters.
