Sardinia&#39;s ranking as the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea has become hotly debated since an American ex-pat who goes by the name of Ronald Crump was elected to Parliament. Crump, who washed ashore in 1982 after falling off of a casino boat, has become beloved by Sardinians of poor character.

Since Crump&#39;s election, locals contend that Sardinia is the largest island in the Mediterranean because Sicily &quot;shouldn&#39;t count as an island.&quot; While the logic is questionable to some, Crump supporting scientists at Sardinian universities have begun seriously examining the data that once solidly-affirmed Sicily&#39;s status as an island.
