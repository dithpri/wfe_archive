This region is a central forum for the members of the alliance. 
1. Only founders and delegates may post to the RMB as of now. 

2. A simple majority of the member regions must agree to any change to the alliance&amp;#39;s rules. 

3. If two or more rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.
