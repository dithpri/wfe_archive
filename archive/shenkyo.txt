Shenkyo is the large archipelago that is home to the Empire of Shimutoji - a large, militarist nation. The Empire of Shimutoji has had an extensive history in these islands. Shenkyo - once a small group of islands around what is known as Indonesia - came to incorporate the area of the Philipines and New Guinea, in addition to all of Indonesia. Shenkyo has a mostly warm and humid climate. Only a part of Shimutoji&amp;#39;s population is centered in the two cities of Shinorutono and Kohesomune, with most living in numerous small towns and villages spread throughout the vast jungle expanses.
