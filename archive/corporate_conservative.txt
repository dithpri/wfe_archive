As was carried forward in the past by the region Corporate Conservative by its elders such as Verak, a new generation of leaders proudly carries forth the banner of social and fiscal conservatism. 
Though the original elders are gone forever, their region, until recently founderless and in a state of neglect and decay, has been resurrected. Their ideas of capitalism, ultra-nationalism, and militarism shall live on, and this region will once again be the largest conservative region on NationStates.
