On 28 March 2012, the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=the_new_sea_territory]14th Division of NAF Remnants[/url] marched into Soccerland&amp;#39;s abandoned cities and raised the flag of the NSL above the desolate wasteland, and have now occupied it to the fullest. As no population of natives exists, the unclaimed Soccer Fields now feature the 14th Division Band at halftime.
