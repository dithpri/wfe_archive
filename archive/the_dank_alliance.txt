spiciness manager - person who checks new or current memes to see if they are still spicy (dank and usable) memes.

Memes that will always be suitable for usage are:
&#149;Memes that have [i]never[/i] been BTMed* (btmed means reviewed by that normie guy aka btm)

&#149;Memes that have been immortalized in one or more ways (i.e. Doge, We are number one, Oof)


*Some memes have survived BTM, like Oof. These are allowed too.
