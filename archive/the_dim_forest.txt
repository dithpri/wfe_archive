The Dim Forest is a tangle of gnarled oaks and clinging brush with canopy so thick that little sunlight reaches the forest floor. There are few pathways into the forest&acute;s depths, and the gloomy recesses are a haven for evil monsters and other beasts. Unlike most forests, the Dim Forest is oppressively quiet and sightings of small, innocuous animals are rare. The region closest to Hulvin is tamer than most, but there are still dangers within.
