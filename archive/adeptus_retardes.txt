[b][i][color=3E07BD]This region, by virtue of the past misdeeds of its founder, has been claimed by [region]the Democratika[/region] as one of its dominions.[/i][/b][/color]

[color=D1A605]&quot;Let it be known to all that Amurria was ejected from the Democratika for overt racism and subversion of its democratically elected leaders and institutions. Amurria disgraced and betrayed the community that had provided him with so much and elevated him to its highest public office. No matter how many puppet nations and pseudonyms he creates, he shall always be known by the name of Amurria to those he has wronged, a name that he rightfully scorns.&quot; - [nation]Candanadium[/nation][/color]
