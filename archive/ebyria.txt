[b]History[/b]
Ebyria once flourished as an expansive, loosely connected empire. Known for it&amp;#39;s internationally acclaimed football leagues and rich culture of friendly competition, Ebyria boasted many nations during it&amp;#39;s heyday. 

Now, however, the empire is in shambles and most of the lands live under semi-chaotic governments and the civil bloodbath has left the history records nearly completely wiped out. It&amp;#39;s time to start anew for the Ebyrian region.
