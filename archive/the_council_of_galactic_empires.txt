We Celestial Beings, the members of the Council of Galactic Empires, have little in common, but have joined together to study the peoples of your planet. Our goal is unclear as of yet, but we see no present threat from you and feel safe enough to remain impartial. We have no need to interfere in the political happenings of your planet as long as it is contained to your part of the universe, but should you enter any of our member&#39;s territory it shall be met with swift punishment.
