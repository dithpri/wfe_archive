[b]Tick tock goes the clock, [region]Belltower[/region]&#146;s hand has struck.[/b]

If [region]HYDRA[/region] would like to play games with us, we are more than willing to oblige them. We do, however, find quarrel with a recent statement made by HYDRA. More specifically, the execution of the raid on Light My Fire. Belltower watched as HYDRA made not one, but two failed attempts to claim a completely undefended region. As it turns out, even a fool can raid.
