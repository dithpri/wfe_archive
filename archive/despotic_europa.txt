I guess I forgot to tag this one, so anyway, heres an old WFE:
[b]The Black Hawks went on a trip today to give TED Talks all throughout the world, and when we stopped in your region, we looked at the data, and what we found . . . shocked us.  Welcome to my TED Talk.  Defenders will never like you, no matter how much you raid, and I can tell you that as a raider.  I could be wrong about that but who cares this is [i]my[/i] TED Talk.  But you know what?  That&#39;s pretty cool.  Thank you for listening to my TED Talk.
