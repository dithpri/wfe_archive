Created as a haven for serious role play, The United Runlish Isles prefers its members to be of right wing
political beliefs, however all are welcome. We invite you to become part of our newly founded region, so why not take the chance? Send us a telegram today, and once your nation has been checked thoroughly, you will receive a notice, perhaps giving you good news? The URI wants you to join today! And may the odds be forever in your favour.
Yours Sincerely,
Tobias Abernathy, Secretary to his majesty King Coriolanus VI of The Runlish Federation.
