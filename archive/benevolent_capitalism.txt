&amp;quot;Behold the Power&amp;quot;
[color=orange]Welcome to[/color] [color=blue]Benevolent Capitalism[/color]
It&amp;#39;s great to finally return to benevolent capitalism. I was the world assembly regional delegate for this region for a long time under the original, non-existing founder known as Sarpyism. Hopefully we can return benevolent capitalism to what it once was. I need help from everybody!
Thank you

I give credit to [nation=short]the american revolutuion[/nation] for holding on to this region in my place.

Also, I am giving the regional flag a major overhaul.

It appears that [nation]port hellen[/nation] will serve as &amp;quot;Secretary of Foreign Affairs&amp;quot;
