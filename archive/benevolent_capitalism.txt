[color=blue][b]Welcome to Benevolent Capitalism![/b][/color]
From your Founder:
  Welcome to the region. Hopefully we can begin a natural restoration!

From your World Assembly Regional Delegate:
To the citizens of [region]Benevolent Capitalism[/region],
I am so thrilled to be at the helm of this once vibrant cult. I am still in very close contact with the original leaders of this government. Under my lead, I am heavily researching appropriate ways to extent &amp;quot;open arms&amp;quot; and put recruiting on the top of the priorities. If the first phase is successful, the second phase will involve gathering candidates (hopefully from foreign regions) that can support a fledgling region. More coming soon!!

Thank You,
