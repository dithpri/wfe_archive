Welcome to Occrestia! We are a roleplay based region that also has a functioning, democratic regional government. The story of our region picks up in the year 2025, five years after the world&#39;s governments fell to an anarchist uprising known today as The Halloween Uprising. Nations must now work together to find their way through this chaotic world.... or not.
