New Andraxia exists for one simple reason. To collect to the shattered nations of the Imperium after its break-up.

Each Andraxian nation will carry one vote in all matters concerning the Imperium. The Andraxian Senate will consist of all non-Andraxian nations. Each Andraxian nation will receive a royal title once they are approved to be authentic by a committee. False Andraxian nations will be ejected from the region, and will receive a two month ban. After the ban is over, they can participate as a regular member of the region if they wish to do so. RP wars are permitted, with the only constraints being Modern Tech and a 100,000 max army size.

And with that, you are officially a member of New Andraxia. Welcome!
