After the downfall of the Terran Dominion the M-Corporation established a league of nations that wished to seek protection from the rising threat of Amon&amp;#39;s return. Nations that seek protection from outside influence can join this league. Those who plan to attack this league, be warned, if you cannot withstand the wrath of the Protoss, Terran, and Zerg are advised to avoid any hostile acts toward this league.
