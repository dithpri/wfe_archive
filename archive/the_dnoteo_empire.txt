In recent years we have all struggled. The Just Protector &amp; His People, Citizens of D-NO-TEO more than anyone else. The D-NO-TEO Empire begins as an ever-expansive region, aiming to have full control over every other state and its policies to embody an entirety of one ideology: Devotionalism, Natural Order &amp; The Equal Order. There may be dark times ahead before the enemy - our enemy - ceases to exist, but one day we will triumph, and we will triumph. I anticipate that anyone, no matter their nation, join my region, for a Greater D-NO-TEO.
