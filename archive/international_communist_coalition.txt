[b]Motto:[/b] &amp;quot;Workers Unite!&amp;quot;

The International Communist Coalition (ICC) is a global union of Communist nations. The ICC does not rule over any country, or have a government. Just a union of Communist nations who run independently. Join today and push for the global communist revolution of NationStates. In the future we hope to destroy the World Assembly power and establish a International Assembly of our own.
