According to the Dwarves, [nation]Durin I the Deathless[/nation], eldest of the Fathers of the Dwarves, awoke at Mount Gundabad shortly after the Awakening of the Elves. From that time forward, the mountain was revered by the Dwarves. However, since Durin awoke alone he did not stay at the mountain; he walked southward until he founded Khazad-d&ucirc;m. In the early ages, Mount Gundabad did serve as a place of assembly for delegations of Dwarves, yet there is no mention of any making permanent residence there.
