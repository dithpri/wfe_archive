The Commonwealth of Chelonian Nations is an intergovernmental organisation composed out of member states that have agreed to follow the idealogies of The United Kingdom of Chelonia and Aldabra. It is solely ruled by the monarch of the Kingdom and much like the Kingdom itself, holds frequent compulsory ballots which are then passed up to the Head of The Commonwealth of Chelonian Nations. Since the Head holds a position of absolute authority, these votes serve as simple advice to the Head. The Head is hereafter recommended to pass legislature based on the majority vote, given His Royal Highness does not disagree it.
The Commonwealth strives for economic and international superiority for all of its member states through expansionism.
