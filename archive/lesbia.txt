Original homeland of Femocracy, Lesbia was refounded to keep it out of the hands of our enemies, and today is an open and peaceful region, an oasis of peace, love and sun.
Our founder applies on our RMB a policy of &amp;quot;No Suppression&amp;quot;, which means that we accept in the RMB any type of message, including those averse to our ideology. 
&amp;quot;I do not agree with what you say, but I&amp;#39;m ready to die to ensure you the right to say it&amp;quot; is our RMB motto!
Of course, you can&amp;#39;t violate NS rules here, but this is obvious: Lesbia is part of NS and, like all other regions, is subject to the rules of NS.
This is the closest thing to free speech that we can offer, and we are proud to offer it.
