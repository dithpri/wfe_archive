THIS REGION IS NOW SAFE and no longer under the rule of anti-woman forces,
thanks to the efforts of [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] and Her allies.

Everyone friendly to females in general and lesbians in particular is welcome.

EMBASSY POLICY: No embassies with misogynistic or homophobic regions.
And yes, we do look at the embassies you already have. If you have any embassies
with misogynistic or homophobic regions, don&amp;#39;t expect us to accept your proposal.
FURTHERMORE, no embassies with &amp;quot;collectors.&amp;quot; If we suspect you see embassy
trading as an end unto itself, don&amp;#39;t expect us to accept your proposal either.
But anybody else should be OK! :)
