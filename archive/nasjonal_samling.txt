Nasjonal Samling (Norwegian pronunciation: [n&amp;#593;&amp;#642;&amp;#650;&amp;#712;n&amp;#593;&amp;#720;l &amp;#712;s&amp;#593;&amp;#768;ml&amp;#618;&amp;#331;], NS; literally &quot;National Rally&quot;) was a Norwegian far-right party active from 1933 to 1945. It was the only legal party of Norway from 1942 to 1945. It was founded by former minister of defence Vidkun Quisling and a group of supporters such as Johan Bernhard Hjort &#150; who led the party&#39;s paramilitary wing (Hirden) for a short time before leaving the party in 1937 after various internal conflicts. The party celebrated its founding on 17 May, Norway&#39;s national holiday, but was founded on 13 May 1933.
