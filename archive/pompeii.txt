[color=000000][b]Welcome to Pompeii! The city of Pompeii was an ancient Roman town-city near modern Naples in the Italian region of Campania.[/b]
In 79 AD. Mount Vesuvius erupted destroying and burring Pompeii, along with the surrounding area under 13 to 20 ft of ash and pumice.[/color]
[color=darkred][i]The rumbling began, impatient, low,
shivering walls, trembling cup and platter
in nervous crockery nudge and chatter.
Hanging planters commenced to sway.
The rumble went away...then magnified, returned
when muscular Vesuvius flexed and boomed ---
with startled glances cast. Dishes fell
from shelves to crash and shatter on the floor.
As the volcano flared ascendant,
water in garden fountains ebbed and died,
one last living jet to heaven sent.[/i][/color]
