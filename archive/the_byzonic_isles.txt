Welcome to the Byzonic Isles! Founded on the 7th of September, 2014.

On the 1st of October, the Byzonic Isles was invaded by the Black Riders, as our region began to succumb to inactivity. Thankfully, I, your founder, came in just in time to defeat the Black Riders.

This is under reconstruction.
