The Free World Democratic Coalition circles around the concepts of freedom, equality and rights, and welcomes any nation that supports such ideals with open arms. Its members will also fight under the flag of those standards, against any other nations or regions that defies them, through bureaucracy or military action under more severe circumstances.
The FWDC is also part of the World Assembly and is willing to establish political relationships with any other regions willing to respect what it defends.
