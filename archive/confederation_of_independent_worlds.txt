A Confederation based upon the ways of humanity before the war that swept across the known universe, a war that truly ended all wars because there was almost nothing left... Those survivors have been primarily located within the Milky Way Galaxy and chose humanity&amp;#39;s birth system (OUR solar system) and several other systems as new starting points for life, in case one was somehow destroyed. The Confederation consists of Earth, a terraformed Venus, a terraformed Mars, Europa, Ganymede, Titan, and so on.
