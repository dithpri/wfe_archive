[color=336699]The [b]Maluku Islands[/b] are an archipelago within Indonesia. Tectonically they are located on the Halmahera Plate within the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. Geographically they are located east of Sulawesi, west of New Guinea, and north and east of Timor. The islands were also historically known as the &amp;quot;Spice Islands&amp;quot; by the Chinese and Europeans, but this term has also been applied to other islands outside Indonesia.

Most of the islands are mountainous, some with active volcanoes, and enjoy a wet climate. The vegetation of the small and narrow islands, encompassed by the sea, is very luxuriant; including rainforests, sago, rice, and the famous spices&#151;nutmeg, mace and cloves, among others.[/color] [color=666666]&#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
