After the last Hugoslavian union fell apart in a massive civil war, we figured we&#39;d try it again, but better (maybe).  Srbyska is the leader, as they are economically and militarily the most powerful nation in the region.  Montinegro is their lackey currently, but may soon usurp them through greater economic power.  Glory will be brought back to this backwater Balkan basin, we&#39;ll make sure of that!
