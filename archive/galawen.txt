The nations of Galawen, a huge continent spanning thousands of miles across the earth. 
The climate is generally warm, however northern regions can get cold in the winter. The south-eastern island of Jalkastan is famous for it&amp;#39;s seemingly inhospitable deserts.
The terrain varies around the continent immensely. The north-eastern areas of the continent are generally mountainous, whilst the central area is known for it&amp;#39;s vast steppes and plains. Many great rivers run through the continent, marking the landscape ever since the First Phariopians arrived in the old ages.
The nations of Galawen clash when it comes to ideals and goals, but one thing unites them, and that&amp;#39;s their home.
