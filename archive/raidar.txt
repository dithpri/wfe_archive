The Regional Alliance In Democracies And Republics (RAIDAR) is dedicated to fostering cooperation and diplomacy among member nations that share a commitment to democratic principles and republican forms of government. RADAR prioritizes peaceful conflict resolution, economic collaboration, and upholding human rights within the region. Many regions skewed authoritarian or leaned heavily towards specific ideological blocs. In response, these players established RADAR as a haven for nations that valued democracy and republicanism, regardless of their alignment on other issues.
