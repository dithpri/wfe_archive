[I]Whirlpool Hall is a region focussed on the World Assembly.  Here we strive to author General Assembly resolutions, help others develop theirs, and ultimately, pass many of our own General Assembly resolutions.[/I]

Our regional Government is small, but effective.  We operate as a constitutional monarchy, with the power of the monarch constantly varying.
