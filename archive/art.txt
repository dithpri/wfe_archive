A place for the artistic bohemian; to discuss or display any form of art, whether it be a painting, poem, or urinal.

&#147;I say unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star. I say unto you: you still have chaos in yourselves. Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue.&#148;

I desire that your conjectures should not reach beyond your creative will.

...Could you create a god?

Then do not speak to me of any gods.
