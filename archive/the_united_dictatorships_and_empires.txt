[color=blue]Hello everyone, so The Dictatorial Paradise isn&#39;t fully friendly to Roleplayers so I am making this region; now some things you might need to know about this region: this region is based off of RP, there will be no discord made by the leader however if you want to make a discord for this region you can, also depending on what others say we might have a government system for this region.[/color]

[color=purple]Discord has been made by [nation]Teodorias Space Colony From Claus[/nation]. Link: https://discord.gg/u2aAnWR
