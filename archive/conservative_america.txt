Welcome to [b][color=darkred]Conservative America[/color][/b], where we are proud to be American! 

[b][color=darkblue]Conservative America[/color][/b] is a new region for those interested in the Conservative movement. Our region is supportive of individual rights and responsibilities, small government, fiscal conservatism, capitalism, and democracy. We oppose authoritarianism, communism, fascism, and socialism.

The regional message board is out of character (no roleplay). [url=www.nationstates.net/region=conservative_america]Why?[/url]

[color=gray][i]Rules will be established for the region. | A forum will be established for the region. | A government will be established for the region. | Embassy policy will be established by the government.
