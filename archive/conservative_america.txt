The people of Conservative America are the best at everything we do, including military operations, economy management, and protecting the freedoms of our first class, first world people. Crime is not tolerated and consequences are harsh, as we feel that our nations deserve to feel safe when in public. Taxes here are almost nonexistent, as we support the free market and capitalism.
