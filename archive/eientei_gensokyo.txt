&amp;#127769;[color=purple]Eientei is currently occupied by a large group. Kaguya Houraisan and moon bunnies have been hiding there since their exile from the Moon.[/color]&amp;#127769;

&amp;#127769;[color=black]Every month on the night of the full moon, the residents of Eientei hold a Moon Festival (&amp;#20363;&amp;#26376;&amp;#31085; Reigetsusai), offering mochi with medicinal herbs pounded into them. Making mochi is thus the main occupation of the Earth rabbits.[/color]&amp;#127769;
