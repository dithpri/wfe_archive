[color=navy][b]The Aqua Office is a regional office of office in the blue. If you break a rule in the AO, you&#39;d get a strike. AO&#39;s Rules is that:
Nations shouldn&#39;t be 18+ contents.
No bad descriptions, that&#39;ll result in ejection.
Only recruit every 24 hours or so.
No flaming.
You would get a strike. Also don&#39;t beg to get featured of the week nation, because I randomly pick one nation. Hope for the best. Good luck.
