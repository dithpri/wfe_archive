The Community of Vanamada is a fledgling, safe nation, notable for its barren, inhospitable landscape, irreverence towards religion, and absence of drug laws. The average income tax rate is 13.2%. The Vanamadan economy, worth 321 billion dollars a year, is broadly diversified and led by the Uranium Mining industry, with significant contributions from Information Technology, Door-to-door Insurance Sales, and Pizza Delivery. Average income is 53,521 dollars, and evenly distributed, with the richest citizens earning only 3.1 times as much as the poorest. Vanamada&#39;s national animal is the kiwi, which teeters on the brink of extinction due to widespread deforestation.
