[b]For too long, ANAL, JEFF, and KHAN have ruled N-day. This ends NOW![/b]
[hr]I, [nation]Wisteria and Surrounding Territories[/nation], was responsible for Yggdrasil Security Coalition&#39;s rapid expansion following a recruitment operation. Without that operation, we wouldn&#39;t have placed 8th!
Now that I am running my own region ([region]MHBs New Earth[/region]), I plan to make my own, more powerful N-day faction!
I want regions to unite with the common goal of stopping the faction dynasties that have ruled since the early days!
