This region managed by Remi Farnetus (Leader of [nation]Ter Voland[/nation]) is aimed at discussing U.S. politics (conservative views preferred but not required), Latin, and most importantly soccer (MLS, Concacaf, Conmebol).

Tho this region is mostly for puppet storage.

&amp;#128680;&amp;#128680;&amp;#128680; Attention! &amp;#128680;&amp;#128680;&amp;#128680;
I am looking for Vocaloid cards. I am willing to pay more for ones I&#39;ve missed from past seasons. You may TL to any of these puppets or my &quot;main&quot; Ter Voland.
Season 1 - 10.0
Season 2 -   7.5
Season 3 -   5.0

[spoiler=disclaimer] I (Farnetus) reserve the right to deny purchase of any card I deem not worthy. There is also a certain season 3(?) that is technically vocaloid related but is ugly as sin. I will never get that card. [/spoiler]
