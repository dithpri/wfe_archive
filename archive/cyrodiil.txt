[b]Cyrodiil: the Starry Heart of Nirn, Seat of Sundered Kings, Heartland of Tamriel.[/b]

[i]Come traveler, warrior, pilgrim or trader- the Imperial Province welcomes you.[/i] From the rugged foothills of the Colovian Highlands to the mystic waters of the Nibenay Basin; from the glorious sunrise of the Gold Coast of the Abecean Sea, to the lush beauty of the West Weald; Cyrodiil&#39;s wondrous sights are endless.

[b]Cyrodiil[/b] started with the ancient Ayleids, experienced the rise of Alessia, birthed the Empire of Tiber Septim, which ended here as well. The White-Gold Tower, which stands tall and inspires pride in all of her people. All are welcome to Cyrodiil. Please do not eat the Nirnroot.
