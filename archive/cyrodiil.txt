[i][b][color=#A58A00]Cyrodiil, Dragon Empire, Starry Heart of Nirn, and Seat of Sundered Kings...[/color][/b][/i][hr]In ancient times, dwelt by Ayleids who built grand cities now sundered; home now to the Colovian and Nibenese people, the core of a continent-spanning Empire. The rugged westerlands of Colovia produce Cyrodiil&#39;s finest soldiers and wines, while the lush Nibenay valley feeds a nation. The Gold Coast hosts rogues abound, and the southern borderlands of Blackwood holds beauty untold in its forests and marshes. In the north, County Bruma serves as the gate to Skyrim, with County Cheydinhal a scenic bridge to Morrowind. In the heartland, the White-Gold Tower dominates the view from every corner of the province.
