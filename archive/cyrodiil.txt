[b]Cyrodiil: the Starry Heart of Nirn, Seat of Sundered Kings, Heartland of Tamriel.[/b]

[i]Come traveler, warrior, pilgrim or trader- the Imperial Province welcomes you.[/i] From the rugged foothills of the Colovian Highlands to the mystic waters of the Nibenay Basin; from the glorious sunrise of the Gold Coast, to the lush beauty of the West Weald; from the rugged Jerall Mountains, to the murky swamps of Blackwood; Cyrodiil&#39;s natural wonders are abound.

[b]Cyrodiil[/b] was once home to the ancient Ayleids. It birthed the Alessian Order, and saw the rise and fall of Tiber Septim&#39;s Empire. All are welcome in the Imperial Province. Please do not eat the Nirnroot.
