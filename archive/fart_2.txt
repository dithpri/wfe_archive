[b]Hi everyone![/b]

This is just going to be a small group of friends running countries together.

Make sure to look at the [u]Welcome Message[/u] and read through that! It is very short and just has some basic Fart 2 information as well as some beginner tips if you are new to NationStates. Please message Fynn if you did not receive the welcome message.

[u]People and their Nations:[/u]

Fynn is running Buaf

Elise is running Thimbletill

Braden is running Greenland II

We have yet to add a WA Delegate or any other Region Officers. We&#39;ll figure that out later (possibly during the summer).

[b]There is a very important poll running right now that will end May 18, 2025. Please make sure to vote before it closes![/b]
