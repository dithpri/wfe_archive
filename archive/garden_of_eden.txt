The [b]Garden of Eden[/b] is the biblical &quot;garden of God&quot;, described most notably in the Book of Genesis chapters 2 and 3, and also in the Book of Ezekiel. 

In the Hebrew Bible, Adam and Eve are depicted as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence. Eden and its rivers may signify the real Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, or the Promised Land. It may also represent the divine garden on Zion, and the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem. The imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubs, has been compared to the images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent and guardian cherubs. &#151;Wikipedia [hr]
