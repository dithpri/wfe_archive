We drink to our youth, to the days come and gone
The age of oppression is now nearly done
We&amp;#39;ll drive out the empire from this land that we own
With our blood and our steel we will take back our home

All hail to Ulfric
You are the high king
In your great honour we drink and we sing
We&amp;#39;re the children of Skyrim and we fight all our lives
And when Sovengarde beckons, each one of us dies

But this land is ours and we&amp;#39;ll see it wiped clean
Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams

Thank you for joining the fight against the Thalmor!
Please endorse your Delegate, [nation]Thom Yorkeshire[/nation]
Oh, and don&amp;#39;t use your real name.
