Original Founder: Democratic Left

The original World Factbook Entry was a neutral description of the Greek political party this region was named for. 
In 09/2012, however, DL party leader Fotis Kouvelis reneged on campaign promises and betrayed workers, the poor 
and the elderly by agreeing to the harsh austerity measures demanded by the multinational capitalist mafia. 

This region now supports all anti-authoritarian Anarchists/Socialists/Communists not only in Greece but world-wide, 
in the struggle to create a united revolutionary front. And unity is essential: Both the trans-global corporate octopus 
and every localized fascist movement must be confronted and defeated.
