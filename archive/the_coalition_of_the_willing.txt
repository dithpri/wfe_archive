Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety. Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will be removed. Many nations, however, do have the resolve and fortitude to act against this threat to peace, and a broad coalition is now gathering to enforce the just demands of the world. The tyrant will soon be gone. The day of your liberation is near.
Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time. The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land. That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our people by uniting against the violent.
