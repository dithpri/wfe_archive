According to all known laws
of aviation,  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly. 
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.  
The bee, of course, flies anyway  
because bees don&#39;t care
what humans think is impossible.  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let&#39;s shake it up a little.  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!  
Coming!  
Hang on a second.  
Hello?  
- Barry?
- Adam? 
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can&#39;t. I&#39;ll pick you up. 
Looking sharp.  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those. 
Sorry. I&#39;m excited.  
Here&#39;s the graduate.
We&#39;re very proud of you, son. 
A perfect report card, all B&#39;s. 
Very proud.  
Ma! I got a thing going here. 
- You got lint on your fuzz.
