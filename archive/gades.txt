The members of Gades have reached a consensus to depart from Gades. We do this because of many reasons, but the main reason is because of our relationship with the region Putakha. To everyone from Putakha, we hope to maintain a good relationship with your region. We will be in contact with the nations in Putakha that supply us our information, it is not secret of the great openness of the region. Especially with Asianan making the rule that each member may have as many alts as needed. We support the downfall of Asianan, many of this nations in Gades had alts in Putakha, and they felt as though Asianan was a terrible dictator. We hope to live peacefully in our new region of Zama Regia.
