The western side borders on the ocean and has many small islands. It&#39;s mostly covered in forests.
The eastern half is very mountainous with some plains at its base. There are several volcanoes located here, along with hot springs and geysers. In the center of this area lies an enormous lake that stretches from east to west. This is where most of the people live, and it&#39;s surrounded by a massive wall that stretches across the entire continent. It was built long ago by ancient maleuxians to defend themselves from recolonization forces and continues to be maintained even today.
