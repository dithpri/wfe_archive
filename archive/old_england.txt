[color=red][b]WELCOME TO OLD ENGLAND[/b][/color]

From 927 to 1707, the Kingdom of England was a sovereign state to the northwest of Europe. At its height, England spanned the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain &amp; several smaller islands. England as a state began on 12 July 927 AD after a gathering of kings from throughout Britain at Eamont Bridge, Cumbria, but broadly traces its origins to the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain &amp; the petty states that followed &amp; ultimately united.
