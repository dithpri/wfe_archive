[b]This region has been refounded and therefore acquired by us as now a 100% totally legit shell company based at a remote tax haven in the Caribbean. I&#39;ll be the first to say: Grand Theft Auto IV isn&#39;t overrated and Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars has one of the best opening themes for the series. Wanna ask questions? Wanna complain about how this practice is ruining the game? Contact [nation]Skamparlus Dutchy[/nation] or [nation]Wapistan[/nation] and they may get back to you (probably).

This subsidiary is now in the ownership of the following board memebers:
