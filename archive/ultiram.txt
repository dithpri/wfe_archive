The magic-based region formed by the adjoining nations of Westknight, Darkem Ethil, Taron, Southlands, and The Hinterlands. The primary force of Ultiram resides on the island continent of Taron. Westknight contains the borders to the Outer Regions where arcane magics are not used or seen. The Southlands and Hinterlands are known for being neutral in all conflicts as they are staked by no nation or fighting force other than themselves. Darkem Ethil is the home of darker arts, where the fallen titans go to rest. Ultiram is likely the largest source of magic in the entire world of Thaln. It possesses one of the only physical gateways to Vandra, though it is unused.
