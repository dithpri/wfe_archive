The world of men, angels, and demons. Created ages ago by the Gods of Old, the wardens of existence. Now forgotten by the old gods, the children of titans now inhabit the world, using magics and ingenuity alike to build a better future. Several regions make up this world, all separated by their beliefs in the arcane and the history of their world. A peaceful land entirely, with its many issues arising in its central, and most powerful region: Kallen.
