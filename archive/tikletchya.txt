Located under the skirts of glacial cliffs in the arctic is a rather mysterious patch of wobbly ocean. Those who have lucked out and wibbled their way over the wobble have found themselves, rather bizarrely, washing up on the golden shores of a new, sunny continent - Tikletchya.

The natives of this strange land are incredibly friendly, if a shade taller than what would be considered reasonable and decent, and with a strange complexion that they call &#39;octarine&#39;. Also, cats are friggin huge and speak with big booming voices. Elephants are truly tiny, a pleasing orange colour, and smell like freshly cut grass. Everything else is normal.
