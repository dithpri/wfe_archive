Welcome to the Yozpozian alliance, where money is happiness and everything else is a lie. 

Enjoy our thriving tax havens and absence for such wastefulness as &quot;minimum wage&quot; and &quot;civil rights&quot;.

A great place for cheap labour and rich CEOs, who needs human rights to the poor when the rich are so happy?
