[b]Zebrica[/b] is a vast southern-hemisphere continent defined by extreme geography and fractured power. It spans jungles, frozen mountains, deserts, and fertile [i]riverlands[/i], home to zebras, kirin, deer, llamas, yeti, and more. Once scarred by the Storm King&#146;s conquests, the continent remains divided into rival regions, each struggling between recovery, ambition, and survival.
