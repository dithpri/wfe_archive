Nue Burgundie is a loose association of states that rose from the ashes of the once great Empire of Burgundie. 

In the beginning it seemed to be nothing but warlords vying for dominance and the seat of power in Sant-Fourchenaut, until outside forces harangued the various cliques that emerged and pushed them to unite against the greater threat.

Now an alliance of independent states, theyare finally recognised internationally as theor representative in the territory of Sant-Forchenaut speaks for them to the world.
