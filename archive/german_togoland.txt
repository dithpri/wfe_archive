[u][b]WE ARE [region]UMOJA[/region][/b][/u]

Unlike [region]The Greater German Reich[/region], we don&amp;#39;t found regions and pretend like we conquered them.
[region]UMOJA[/region] founded this region, German Togoland, named after the scene of brutal exploitation,
to [i]prevent[/i] the imperialists and fascists from doing so and glorifying their villainy.
