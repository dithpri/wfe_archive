[color=CD853F][u][b]I suppose all good things eventually come to an end. 

This region lasted longer than I had expected, but alas, people continue to find strength amongst themselves, while there are those that remain lost because of those around them. Here a great region has stood tall, and now it has demised, community shattered. It will rebuild. It will recover. Resolve is but a finite fuel in this endeavour.

Let this region mark the existence of a once-proud and flourishing region where people just sought to chat and have fun, unbecoming in its attempt to become something more than that.
