[color=CD853F][u][b]Let this region mark the existence of a once-proud and flourishing region where people just sought to chat and have fun, unbecoming in its attempt to become something more than that.

For the people have recovered, their wounds healed. For they now look at each other and care for one another, rather than spite. The marvelous emotions and heart that keeps community together, is none to be questioned, for there is nothing remotely like it out there.

The community of this once great region has either dispersed, or migrated to the [region]Union of Confederate Regions[/region].
