[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to cause some christmas chaos 

Hanging bulbs or poking santa&#39;s sleigh did not seem particularly fun, and the hawks wanted their christmas presents. 

Tasked with the deep question of how to cause chaos, we decided to visit your region for some ideas! We didn&#39;t find ideas, but we found cookies and milk, and we took them happily!
