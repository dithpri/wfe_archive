Welcome to Earth 98! Earth 98 is a world building project based on the premise &#147;what if X was bigger?&#148; DeFlame, started this project back in 2016 with his sole focus on the United States. However, the scope of this project of has grown since then to encompass making every corner of the Earth bigger. When making Earth bigger we do not concern ourselves too much with realism, and geographic changes are not limited by real life tectonics. The most important thing to keep in mind is that this project is for the fun of it.
