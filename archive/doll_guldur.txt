[b][color=green]Welcome to [region]Doll Guldur[/region] which has been refounded by members of The West Pacific Armed Forces on the 26th May, 2017.[/color][/b] 

Whilst it is appreciated that all of you are either awaiting your next mission or enjoying some rest and recuperation, maybe you would like to add a note to posterity by adding a few pithy or snarky comments on the rmb :) Alternatively, you might enjoy watching this lighthearted, spoof TWPAF recruitment video which was produced by TWP&#39;s [b][i]Regional Sniper[/i][/b]  [nation]Yy4u[/nation]

Please do not leave your WA here unless you are on, about to go on, or have just returned from, an operation.  Any puppet left with WA on it after 2 weeks will be ejected from the region.
