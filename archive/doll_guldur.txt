[region]Doll_Guldur[/region] has been refounded after being held under password status for more than three months by a long-time nation of the region, 
[nation]Stone of Caliburn[/nation]. 

All nations from other regions which are friendly to [region]The West Pacific[/region], its allies, friends and co-conspirators are welcome here.  Feel free to come and go as you please, as is the wont of your makers, but don&#39;t forget that participation in all the traditions of [region]The West Pacific[/region] such as Karaoke Friday, Punday Monday, etc is encouraged :)  It is appreciated that most of you will be just awaiting action in the field, or passing through, but the odd pithy or snarky comment on the rmb is welcomed :)
