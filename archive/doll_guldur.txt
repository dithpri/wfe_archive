[b][color=green]OPERATION IT&#39;S ALL FOR YUNO:[/color][/b]

[b][color=indigo]This region has been cleansed for [/color][color=pink]Yuno[/color][color=indigo] of cheaters from The [region]US Military[/region], the supposed premier army of NationStates.[/color][/b]

[b][color=pink]Yuno[/color][/b] is loved so much that three factions ([region]the Black Hawks[/region], [region]Firehelm[/region], and [region]The Order of the Grey Wardens[/region]/the [region]South Pacific[/region] Special Forces) moved in separately. TGW and SPSF got it!

[b]The Yuno Fanclub[/b]
From the Wardens and the SPSF, we send greetings from Roavin, Vinny, Lenlyvit, Katie, and Vietnam. 
From the Hawks, this was ordered by Souls, triggered by Vapid, and Satya, MiniGrey, and HoC say hi too!
From Firehelm, Stretch, Ike, Saint Sav, and Maria were going for it to give the region back.

The Yuno Fanclub recommends this region&#39;s founder finally comes back...
