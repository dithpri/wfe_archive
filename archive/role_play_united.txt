This is Role Play United, and we are a role playing region
We are a friendly region, and accept all forms of government

A map will be coming out, so telegram [nation]1st USSR[/nation] for a claim
[color=red]PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE IN MAP CHOICE! MAKE REASONABLE CLAIMS, AND NO ONE CAN HAVE A WHOLE CONTINENT[/color]

We also vote and have referendums on things that involve roleplay. Each new law or referendum will have a link here so you can read it. A constitution will also be drafted soon.
