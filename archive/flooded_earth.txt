Humanity has always had a habit for greed and destruction. Especially war. After The Great Mistake, the sea levels rose major cities were destroyed. But that was just the beginning. Storms increased in power and grew to be more common. Species died out, and refugees left to go inland. Soon the world fell into anarchy. But some nations survived, and built new cities along the much larger sea. Civilization has started again.
