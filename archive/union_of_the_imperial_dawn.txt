This region has been closed.

During this last few days, I&#146;ve been thinking. 

I have sinned against the Heavens, I&#146;ve become that which I so much disliked, and I&#146;ve realized, I must do something to stop it. By abandoning Nationstates I seek only to preserve what little remains of my soul from eternal damnation, and pray to the Holy Spirit to give me forgiveness.

Well, this is the last you&#146;ll hear of me I hope, and I pray that all of you, my friends and my enemies have a good rest of your life, and that you realize, like I have, that without God we are nothing.

Thank you for everything&#133;

Sincerely,

-Santa Catalina de Arag&oacute;n

Postdata: Raiders, I guess you can refound all my regions once I CTE, I don&#146;t really care.
And to those I have ejected: sorry!
