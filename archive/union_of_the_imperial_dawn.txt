The Union of the Imperial Dawn is an association of Catholic absolute monarchies, led by the Queendom of Santa Catalina de Arag&oacute;n. United by divine right and bound by sacred tradition, our nations will be the last bastions of order and honor.
We not only are a political alliance, we are guardians of Christendom&#146;s legacy and builders of a resplendent future where crown and cross reign supreme
We welcome all righteous realms who share our sacred values to join us in forging a new golden age.

Ave Mar&iacute;a Purisima!

-Her most Serene and Catholic Majesty, Do&ntilde;a Carlota de Borgia, Queen of Santa Catalina de Arag&oacute;n
