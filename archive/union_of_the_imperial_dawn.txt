The Union of the Imperial Dawn is an alliance of Catholic traditional monarchies, who long for a return to the monarchist order present in Spain from 1479-1700.

We listen only to God, Motherland and Monarch, we are enemies of the new Liberal World Order which wishes to end the traditionalist ways of life and change it into a degenerate, corrupt society. We are guardians of Christendom&#146;s legacy and look forwards to a resplendent future where crown and cross reign supreme.
