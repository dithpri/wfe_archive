Loyola is a region compromised of states that beleive strongly in self-determination,self-defense, political freedoms, and the right of citizens to protect themselves from all threats foreign and domestic. Very much aligned with Jeffersonian ideals, all citizens are citizen-soldiers, and military service is compulsory. We strive to create a world where people are free, self-reliant, and government can be big enough to govern, small enough to where it does not become tyrannical, effective enough to where only the most competent,modest, strategic, and loyal can represent the People.
