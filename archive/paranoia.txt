[b]Somebody:[/b] Hello there nationstatesling, I see you have somehow found your way to this cold, desolate wasteland.

[b]You:[/b] Why is it so cold, and where is everybody?

[b]Somebody:[/b] You see, this place used to be populated, but everybody got to paranoid and left.

[b]You:[/b] *smiles*. I see.

[b]Somebody:[/b] The residents of this region have moved on to greater places.

[b]You:[/b] You still haven&#146;t told me why it is so cold.

[b]Somebody:[/b] When a region is abandoned, the great frost comes and takes its place. The great frost brings wind, and snow, and frigid air.

[b]You:[/b] I wonder what happened to the nations that resided h-

[b]Somebody:[/b] That&#146;s enough! You best be on your way now, my good child. You have better things to do than to wonder, I&#146;m sure.

[b]You:[/b] *chuckles* Ha! I could wonder all day!
