[b]The Organization of United Empires (OUE)[/b] is a non-strict role-playing region.

The map consists of two large pieces of land vaguely similar to Earth&#39;s continents, the technology we all start with is from the early 1900, so no planes or tanks.
If you are still learning how to rp you can join here and learn with me because i don&#39;t know what the hell i&#39;m doing, and as i said before this is a non-strict role play region and the current rules i&#39;ve placed will be modified during the rp, these can be seen in the discord, which is where the rp will happen.
