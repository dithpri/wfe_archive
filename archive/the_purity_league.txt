A haven for those people wishing to flee this dying world and establish a safe haven for sojourners. The league is established to renew and strengthen people - creating a new man: strengthening them not only physically, but also morally and spiritually.

The League recognizes that the main opposition to this spiritual renewal is Talmudic Judaism, a perversion of the Hebrew faith found in the Torah, and centred on Jewish ethnocentrism, chauvinism, and Zionism. It is the evil schemes of this bastardized Jewish faith, and all those who follow it, which must be recognized and opposed if a man is to become strong again.
