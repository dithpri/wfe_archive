A haven for those people wishing to flee this dying world - corrupted, as it is, by Talmudic practices - and establish a safe haven for sojourners. The league is established to renew and strengthen people - creating a new man: strengthening them not only physically, but also morally and spiritually.

The League recognizes that the main opposition to this spiritual renewal is Talmudic Judaism. The League has always been committed to fighting the evil schemes of Talmudic Jewry and their quislings worldwide, in order to free ordinary people from Jewish perversity, leading them to the light of personal salvation and renewal.
