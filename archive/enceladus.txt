[b]Enceladus[/b] (Greek: [i]&amp;#917;&amp;#947;&amp;#954;&amp;#941;&amp;#955;&amp;#945;&amp;#948;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;[/i]) is the sixth-largest moon of Saturn. It is about 500 kilometers (310 mi) in diameter, about a tenth of that of Saturn&#39;s largest moon, Titan. Enceladus is mostly covered by fresh, clean ice, making it one of the most reflective bodies of the Solar System. Consequently, its surface temperature at noon only reaches &amp;#8722;198 &deg;C (&amp;#8722;324 &deg;F), far colder than a light-absorbing body would be. Despite its small size, Enceladus has a wide range of surface features, ranging from old, heavily cratered regions to young, tectonically deformed terrains.
