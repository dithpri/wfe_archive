Welcome to KOI-4878.01, or as the aborigines call it, Tummar, the new world to which the ancients decided to emigrate, after the Battle which ended with our old home, Earth. Upon reaching the center of the star system, they found a planet, which had a single continent, later &quot;Persea&quot;. Several families settled there, and in a short time they learned to cultivate, thanks to the memory stored in the now Governor&#39;s Palace. They learned which &quot;plants&quot; were good and which were lethal, and they made contact with the natives, just the year I was born, son of Henry Samiro, the Sub Commander of the mission.
