[b] Welcome to the United Nations of Astria [/b] 

The region is small right now so I don&amp;#39;t have much set up. Give it some time and we will have elections for different positions like [b]Chairmen of the Astrian Council[/b]. Send me a telegram if you want to help in growing this region. Also the WA Delegate will be non-executive until I trust him/or her. Thanks.
