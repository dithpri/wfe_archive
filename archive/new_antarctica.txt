[b][color=blue]Welcome to New Antarctica, the safe, valiant, democratic, and aggressive defense, region. All major recruiting, organization, official, political, and military decisions are decided by a representative Congress voted into power by and for all NA members.[/color][/b]
[hr][color=orange]New Antarctica is a completely open nation, accepting of any country (unless you are a puppet; we don&#39;t like them). We plan on being spontaneous, invading invader regions,and all in all, having fun. Feel free to advise the Congress, join a party, or request something from the Founder, [nation]Atyacari[/nation], or the Delegate, [nation]Zymal[/nation].[/color]
