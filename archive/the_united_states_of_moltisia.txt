The United States of Moltisia is a massive, safe nation, ruled by Supreme Chancellor Endelezo with a fair hand, and remarkable for its teetotalling pirates, smutty television, and devotion to social welfare. The compassionate, hard-working, democratic, devout population of 1.092 billion Moltisians enjoy a sensible mix of personal and economic freedoms, while the political process is open and the people&#39;s right to vote held sacrosanct.
