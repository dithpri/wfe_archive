Joining the WA and endorsing our [b]President [nation=short]kitiini[/nation][/b] greatly helps our region become safer and stronger. The more endorsements he has, the less likely the WA Delegate post can be taken, and we get more votes in the World Assembly when voting on resolutions in the General Assembly and Security Council. This also allows you to vote in the WA on all resolutions as well as propose resolutions to the WA.
