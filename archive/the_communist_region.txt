&amp;quot;Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: Freedom for the slave-owners.&amp;quot; - Vladimir Lenin

&amp;quot;In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality.&amp;quot; - Karl Marx

&amp;quot;The state is nothing but an instrument of opression of one class by another - no less so in a democratic republic than in a monarchy.&amp;quot; Friedrich Engels
