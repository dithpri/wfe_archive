According to the ancient AI:Cortana, Halo is some kind of weapon. One with vast, unimaginable power. According to the data, the ring has some kind of deep religious significance.Roughly 10,000 kilometres in diameter and 22.3 km thick, Halo remains in orbit at a Lagrange point between Basis, the moon, and Threshold, the gas giant (Earth Survey Catalogue Number B1008-AG). 

Halo&amp;#39;s geography was much like they had hoped, but far from what they could have expected. It was Earth-like, complete with mountains, hills, plains, seas, rivers, waterfalls, swamps, deserts, and icy canyons, with the only surprise being just how multi-climatic it was, considering that Halo was artificial.
