The Capital Wasteland is a term which refers to a loosely defined geographic region, spanning areas of Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia surrounding the Potomac River from (roughly) Harpers Ferry to the Potomac tidal basin.

A once verdant and populated area of the U.S, the Capital, and its surrounding countryside received significant nuclear bombardment during the Great War. As of 2277, the area is little more than a scorching, barren desert where life for its inhabitants is a constant struggle for survival. It stretches from Raven Rock in the northwest to Rivet City in the southeast, with what&#39;s left of the Potomac River dividing it roughly in two.
