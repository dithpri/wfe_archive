The American Wasteland is home to many the many Nationstates rising out of the old world. There are the old superpowers of the NCR2 and Reborn Ohio, the dying &quot;Empire&#39;s&quot; of America, theres the Enclave and there government which recently restored the Federal Government and the Commonwealths with her. They seem functional like the old America but they are far from it, problemed by riots and resistance by the dying empires, mutants, and outside forces. The battle of America is yet to be determined, but its leaning in the Enclave&#39;s and America&#39;s Favor.
