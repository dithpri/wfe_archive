The Former United Nobleland Nations (FUNN), unofficially founded in 2011,  during the exodus of Nation States from the United Nobleland (UN). The founding nations (Dacebiou and The Dominion of Jean Caille) endured more than a decade of civil warfare and domestic unrest before they migrated into the FUNN region. The government eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed presidential elections in 2018.   Land claims and the possibility of new nations joining may be a cause of concern for future peace.
