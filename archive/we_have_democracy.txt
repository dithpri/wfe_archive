Welcome to the very democratic restaurant, how may we help you?

We have many different meals: Democratic Dictatorships, One Party Democracy, Communist Democratic Dictatorships, Communist One Party Democracy, Chocolate covered democracy with just a hint of Communist Dictatorship, and of course, my favourite, Democracy but with no elections, grilled to perfection on a barbeque, with a side of Communism and whipped cream, and five thousand pounds of &quot;Spam&quot; the canned ham with a hint of a one party system, and escargots with a hint of a dictatorship.

We also offer democratic meals, now with 50% more elections with a single candidate.
