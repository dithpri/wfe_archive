While Mugabe&amp;#39;s Zimbabwe is a horrible authoritarian human rights-abusing regime characterized by corruption, economic instability, and shameful anti-white racism, the Republic of Rhodesia was no saint, either. Maintaining order, stability, and economic prosperity does not and never will necessitate the racial discrimination and atrocities that Rhodesia inflicted on its black population.
