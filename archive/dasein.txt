 This land is founded by political rebellion. One may perish but others survive. Our people will salt the earth upon the sight of other nations that wish to conquer. we (I) welcome those that wish to honor the empire of freedom. Empire is only a name. The only illegal rebellion is the one which seeks the destruction of the people for the creation of power. No being shall be sacrificed for power. All beings will survive, chaos is the ignorance of the eternal order of relative subjectivity. Fair warning, from our destruction will remain nothing. Have you forgotten nothing?
