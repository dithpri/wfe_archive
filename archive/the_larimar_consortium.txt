The Larimar Consortium (aka the Order of Larimar, the Church of the Larimartyr and the Weirdos in the Turquoise Cloaks and Expressionless Masks) is an ancient order following the all-powerful Larimartyr. The complete details of the Consortium&#39;s intentions are available only to those who join it. 
The Larimartyr cares not who joins his noble cause. He who sits upon the green squidgy throne has greater intentions.
ALL HAIL THE LARIMARTYR. ALL HAIL THE LARIMARTYR.
(Additionally, the population of any country in the Larimar Consortium will receive free turquoise cloaks, a handbook on Larimar rituals and a subscription to CoolCult&reg; Magazine.)
