Stille Nacht Over Septentria is a Region Project consisting of consolidated canon from nation concept developed over many years, regions, and RPs. While this project is spearheaded by [nation]Achesia[/nation], others are encouraged to join and help build upon the world in a casual and low-pressure atmosphere. If you are interested in joining, feel free to move your nation into the region and chat with us about what you would like to contribute. If you do not want to move, but would like to RP with us, we would love to hear about those ideas as well!

Our canonized RPs, maps, and RP philosophy can be found in the dispatches below.
