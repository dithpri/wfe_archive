Many people say we do not even exist but in fact we do. No my friend not in the shadows or even in the dreams of the most brilliant men and women in the world but in a place where many fail to look. Have you ever played cards? The kings in the deck you may be telling yourself, but no my companion we are the jacks and jokers of the world the men in quilted plaid hidden in full view for all to see but none to really know of. we are not men of the shadow but instead of the mind and spirit. You see us but do not realize the extent of our being. So join us my friend, simply send Plaidlandia a riddle and if it is sufficient you shall be rewarded.
