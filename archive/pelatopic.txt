Welcome to Pelatopic! Pelatopic is a broad alliance of leftists, democracy, and anti-fascist action.

Pelatopic is based on democratic principles. The Founder may not take unilateral action against the will of the members of Pelatopic. The will of the members is typically expressed through actions by an elected WA Delegate, except in cases when the members of the region cannot agree on a candidate, when the Founder will step in to administer the people&#39;s mandate.
