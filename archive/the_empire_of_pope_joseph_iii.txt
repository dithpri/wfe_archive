The greatest empire ever led by the one and only Supreme Leader Pope Joseph III.

The Empire is the most powerful region in the world. If any country dare cross the empire, they should:
Prepare for trouble
And make it double

The Empire&amp;#39;s main goals are:
To protect the world from devastation
To unite all people within our nation
To denounce the evils of truth and love
To extend our reach to the stars above

Finally, as part of the Empire&amp;#39;s space program, the Empire has discovered a way to blast off at the speed of light.
