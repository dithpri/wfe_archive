On the soils of Wulfija there were once many nations. The interactions between them, though forgotten, were complex, and the region bustled with activity. Then enemies took over the region-multiple times in fact-and they left it shamed each time, until the region was only a shadow of its old self. Eventually the region learned to defend itself, and the enemies were locked outside the gate. From this point onwards, the region withered until nothing remained.

After a long sleeping period, a people that once occupied the region have returned to the ruins. The soils have rested, the wilds are open for adventure, and an old region will receive new hope.
