A region for undead nations. The World Assembly Delegate currently has executive authority, so independent zombie nations are free to elect a Zombie King that governs the region.

This region is currently under the administration of the [region]Independent Liberation Front[/region].

Please contact [nation]Great Liberator[/nation] for any inquiries.

[b]Feel free to join and revive this region![/b] Full independence is granted if the community of Zombie Nations is active and has the ability to protect itself from raiders.
