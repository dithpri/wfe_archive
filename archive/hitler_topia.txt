[b][color=black]This region was formerly a colony of [region]The Greater German Reich[/region], administered by [nation=short]Kajstan[/nation].

[region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] attacked this region, expecting no resistance, because we assumed Kajstan, or as the world knows him, K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzer, wouldn&amp;#39;t care. We were wrong - he resisted.

This just goes to show - you can take the nation out of the Nazi region, but you can&amp;#39;t take the Nazi region out of the nation.

Anyway, in booting out the invaders, [nation=short]Kajstan[/nation] made a series of basic errors, which allowed UNAF to re-enter, boot Kajstan&amp;#39;s new puppet and refound.

So here it is. Former Nazi colony, now run by UNAF (their 50th), in the tender care of the [/color][color=red]Luxemburg und Liebknecht Institute for Anti-Freikorps Action.
