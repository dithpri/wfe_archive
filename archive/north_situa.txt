The continent of Situa is located in the southern hemisphere and lines up north to south. Thus, the continent has many different climates. In the far northern reaches such as in the countries of Spricham and Tivronai, expansive and dry deserts cover most of the area. In the mid-north, savannas and forests can be found. Farther south, the Sloping Range extends its northernmost hills of bare rock, the higher hills of which may be covered with snow during the winter. In the far south, there is nothing but desolate tundra, snow-smothered mountains, and frozen bays.
