[i]You will guard them and they will hate you for it. Whenever there is not a Blight actively crawling over the surface, humanity will do its best to forget how much they need you. And that&#39;s good. We need to stand apart from them, even if they have to push us away to make us do it. That is the only way we can ever make the hard decisions.[/i]

In Peace, Vigilance
In War, Victory
In Death, Sacrifice
