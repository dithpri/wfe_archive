[color=black][b]The Grey Wardens are an order of warriors of exceptional ability dedicated to fighting darkspawn (invaders) throughout NationStates. It is the goal of The Order to efficiently defeat as many invaders as possible as frequently as needed. We are not the white knights who clamor for the approval of our peers. We embrace the darkness and shall follow our enemy and defeat them wherever they attempt to spread the blight.[/b][/color]
