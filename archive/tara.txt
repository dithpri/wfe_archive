[region]Tara[/region], formally known as the [nation]Kingdom of Teamhrach[/nation], is a Terran country in the southwestern coastlines of [nation]Terran Victoria[/nation]. It is a monarchy ruled by a Draco house titled &quot;King Gaeil&quot; that split itself from the Victorian royal family.

At the dawn of the common era, Tara was forcibly annexed back to Victoria in the name of forming a brotherly alliance against the Nightzmoras.
Throughout history, the Victorian Dracos sought to marginalize the local Tarans, and the situation deteriorated after the Aslans took over the Victorian throne in the ninth century.
Eras of discrimination against the Tarans fueled their ever-growing nationalism that eventually matured to become a violent separatist movement.
