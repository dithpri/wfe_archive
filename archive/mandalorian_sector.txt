[b][u]Welcome Children of Mandalore[/u][/b]

Do you adhere to the Resol&#39;nare? 

It&#39;s the core of what it means to be Mandalorian. A sacred law giving us direction and purpose:
- Wear the armor.
- Speak the language.
- Defend oneself and family.
- Raise your children as Mandalorians.
- Contribute to the clan&#39;s welfare.
- When called upon by the Mand&#39;alor, rally to their cause.

Do you accept the creed and choose to walk the Path of the Mand&#39;alor? To do so makes you both predator and prey so choose wisely. If you choose so you&#39;ll find that family is more than blood.

This is the way.
