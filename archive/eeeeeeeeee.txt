Today the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy felt that it was a good day to strap on our steel capped boots, wake up early, make some tea, and scream at the top of our lungs across the seas of NationStates &quot;Eeeeeeeeee!&quot;

So if you&#39;d like to let loose and scream at the top of your lungs beside us, feel free to climb aboard our vessel too, we would more than welcome your company!
