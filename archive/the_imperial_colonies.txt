We are under the rule of the Kaiser, born from House Alkr&auml;ph and son of Klaus, our Kaiser has raised The Very Dark Place into its rightful place as the greatest empire known to mankind. These colonies represent that power that the Kaiser has created, and will maintain for one thousand years, and a thousand more.

Long live the Kaiser, Long live The Very Dark Place!
