Narnia is to be a serene, beautiful, well-balanced, not-too-large region that offers a home to stable nations. Aslan primarily keeps thing under control with occasional help from a couple honest-minded, interlopers from Britain. This Region welcomes all those that contribute to the political/environmental beliefs of Narnia.
