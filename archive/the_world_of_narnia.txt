[region]The World of Narnia[/region] is to be a serene, beautiful, well-balanced, not-too-large region that offers a home to stable nations. Aslan primarily keeps thing under control with occasional help from a couple honest-minded, interlopers from Britain. This Region welcomes all those that seek a home to develop or wish to rise to power in [region]The World of Narnia[/region] and the World. 

[region]The World of Narnia[/region] currently welcomes any nation into its tight-knit, yet independent community. We are generally a friend to all.
