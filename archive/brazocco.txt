Message from Xommunia:

Recently, I have lost interest in playing Nation States. [nation]McDolnia[/nation] still has much interest in this and would love to see it take flight. He is willing to make a new region with the same political based roleplay style while using an interesting map to bring such political play into perspective similarly to the current map of [region]Brazocco[/region] located right above this message. If you guys are interested, send [nation]McDolnia[/nation] a message about your interests. I guarantee you it will be fun.
