In light of our recent victory over the weak minded and ill-equipped invaders known as the Black Riders, I have prepared for you a number of inspirational war quotes:

[i][color=red]&amp;quot;I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.&amp;quot;[/color][/i]
[b][color=blue]~Alexander the Great[/color][/b]

[i][color=red]&amp;quot;If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known, that we are at all times ready for War.&amp;quot;[/color][/i]
[b][color=blue]~George Washington[/color][/b]

[i][color=red]&amp;quot;No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.&amp;quot;[/color][/i]
[b][color=blue]~George S. Patton[/color][/b]

Affectionately Yours,
