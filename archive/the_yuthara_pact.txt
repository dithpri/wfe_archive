They thought we were dead.  But we return ...

Welcome back from the dusts, my brothers and sisters of The Yuthara Pact.  Long have we waited in the shadows, biding our time for our perilous return.  We did not die, we did not slumber, we did not cower, we did not run ... Our enemies are long forgotten, the dust on their tombs ancient as their brittle bones.  Now is our time to break forth into the day after an eternity in the embrace of the night!

The world shall feel our return.  They shall remember The Yuthara Pact ... or they shall die.
