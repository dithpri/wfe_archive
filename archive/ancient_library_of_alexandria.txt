The famous Alexandrian library - a repository of ancient knowledge.

The library was founded in the 3rd century BC and was destroyed around the end of the Roman period, containing up to millions of indexed documents. 

Alexander the Great (356 &#150; 323 BC) is famous for building a vast empire in just over a decade, from succeeding the Macedonian throne in 336 BC, until his early death in 323 BC. Alexander&#146;s lasting legacy stems from the dozens of cities he founded, including about 15 cities named Alexandria.

But no city was more important than Egypt&#146;s Alexandria, founded in 330 BC. Alexandria is a land located west of the Nile Delta, near the fishing village of Rhakotis, a thriving new city that amazes visitors with its wealth.
