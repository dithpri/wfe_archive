This region is ran by people from King World 2012. The rules for residing in this region is simple. People are encased in cheese, and everything, including buildings, are made of cheese as well. Please refrain from eating the cheese buildings, as we already had multiple incidents regarding building collapses due to children eating the buildings. Also, please do not eat other people or animals, as they have feelings too. If you have spare cheese, please throw them on buildings or the ground to replenish the region&amp;#39;s cheese supply. On last note, please do not eat the cheese on the ground, as it would disturb the cheese planet&amp;#39;s structure and might make it collapse upon itself, and that would be the end of the universe.
