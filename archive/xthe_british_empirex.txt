The British Empire was composed of the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. As a result, its constitutional, legal, linguistic, and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was described as &quot;the empire on which the sun never sets&quot;.

We are ruled by King Jude the Great, first of his name, King of England and Juddania, Emperor of the British Empire. We live in the time of 1841.
