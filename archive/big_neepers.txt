Welcome to [region]Big Neepers[/region]!

Who are we? We are a group of LGBT nations that decided to come together and form a home. We wanted a community that did not judge us because of our gender or sexuality, our inexperience on this platform, and our left-wing ideals. We wanted a community that accepts us for who we are and helps us become better nation builders and better people. We do not want to create a community that bullies and pressures others, we do not want to create a fascist and hateful community, nor do we want a community that is full of gossip and drama. We are here for the sole purpose to help each other and exhibit strength through compassion. We hope you join us!
