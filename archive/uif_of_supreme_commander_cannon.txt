We are the United Imperial Forces Of Supreme Commander Cannon. We are not completely owned by the glorious Commander, though we are all allies in times of war. We are technology at it&amp;#39;s height. We have advanced devices that can do pretty much anything. All aspects of our lives can literally become satisfactory at the touch of a button. We have, over time, become superhuman, though our genome is still within the boundries of Homo Sapiens. We are the Perfect Civilization. Join us, we may be small, but the minds of this region now how to solve problems, with or without use of deadly weapons.
