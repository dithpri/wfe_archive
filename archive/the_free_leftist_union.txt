[colour=blue]Welcome to [b][region]The Free Leftist Union[/region]! (TFLU)[/b][/colour]

[hr]
Declaring independence from [region]The Great Red Union[/region] on January 21st 2019, [region]The Free Leftist Union[/region] is the home of the official continuation of [region]The Communist Bloc[/region]&#39;s former Regional Message Board Roleplay. TFLU is a relatively small region, made up of almost dedicated roleplayers or simple fools, generally devoted to being mild nuisances.

Feel free to jump on into our RP or join the Discord to banter with us idiots, TFLU is always ready to assimilate newcomers into the collective.
