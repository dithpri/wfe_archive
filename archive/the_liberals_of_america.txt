Most people see fear as a weakness. It can be. Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear into people. I know it&amp;#39;s not right, but if I&amp;#39;m honest, like the 4 Steps asks us to be, I have to be ruthless. Because failure is not an option. The same goes for my sobriety. I have to be ruthless with myself. I have to use my fear. It makes me stronger.
