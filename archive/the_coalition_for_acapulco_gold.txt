You awaken in a dark alleyway with your pants around your ankles, one shoe missing, and your socks on the wrong feet.

&quot;Wait&quot; you struggle to say as your eyes adjust, &quot;I don&#39;t even know what socks belong on what foot to begin with.&quot;

Our cause has brought us together under one banner, the Coalition of Acapulco Gold.
