The Gentu, or Gentu II Project is a 2000s-tech world-building with magic and a slight role-playing region. As a young and dynamic region, we are actively looking for new members to join our ranks and contribute to our shared canon. Our goal is to become a high-quality world-building project on NationStates and maintain an active and vibrant community of devoted members. If this appeals to you, please join our regional Discord server and take a look at our IIWiki portal, both of which are linked below.
