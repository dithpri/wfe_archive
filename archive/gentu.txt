Gentu is a personal project on IIwiki started by [nation]Philimania[/nation] focused on creating an alternate world, emphasizing the development of its unique history, and culture. As English does not exist (and should not as that would be unrealistic) in Gentu, the replacement for it would be Neragese (see below for translator) which will be used in all IIwiki articles.
