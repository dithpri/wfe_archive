We are the forgotten about colonies in the IOU (Imperial Oyster Union). Kelgre used to be a strong republic with Rehudsarks as the only sapient race on the planet. Once the IOU took over the planet and killed all of the Rehudsarks, IOU citizens started a colony there. Since Kelgre is on the edge of the Bell Galaxy, not very populated, and does not produce very much, the IOU does not pay very much attention to colonies like this. The &amp;quot;crimeless, perfect&amp;quot; civilians of the IOU are not so perfect here. On frontier worlds, a little bit of fun is not punishable by death.
