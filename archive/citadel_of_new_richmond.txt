[b]Welcome to the Citadel!!![/b] The greatest haven west of the Mississippi River. A land of surprisingly diverse people(and creatures.....and robots) that have the liberty to do virtually anything. Politics and religion take a back seat here at the Citadel. Here bacon and pure randomness are priority.

       Now here at the Citadel their is no functioning need for a government as long as the founder is alive. However a government body is active now for the sake of regional activity. This board is elected by majority vote once every three months. The political line up is as follows.
President/WAD:[nation]Frozenius[/nation]
Sec. Def.:[nation]North Fastercat[/nation]
Sec. Foreign Affairs:[nation]Torchwood 49[/nation]
