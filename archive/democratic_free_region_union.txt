The Democratic Union is a Community made for anybody who wants to join, we are not fussed about getting new members. We like to think we are a laid back Union and we believe in democracy but we are open to anyone&#39;s views and opinions because that is what makes a democracy and region great and basically you can do anything you want within your own right and you won&#39;t be forced to do anything here, however you are welcome to join and the more the merrier!
