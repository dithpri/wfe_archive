Several months have passed since our wonderful region reclaimed itself  from the corrupted minds of raiders. Thanks to the joint forces of the International Resistance Army (IRA)  sent from Finth, Orestavia, and Klynom and backed by supplies from Canadamk2 and Abbadon, the islands of our region have been cleaned. The embassy forcefully set up by the raiders lays in ruins and those who betrayed our trust have been rid of. The region is in a state of bliss and trade is flourishing! Let us celebrate these good times by voting towards Orestavia for delegate so that these good times last.
