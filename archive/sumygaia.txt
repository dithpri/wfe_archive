[color=red]Sumygaia[/color], a small cluster of Islands that hold a few large nations precariously close together. Though more land is available to nations who wish to join us. Old or new, life in [color=red]Sumygaia[/color] is interesting to say the least. We are not held together through religion or political beliefs, as each nation has its own independent view on life, but simply through the love of politics and trade. So if your nation likes politics or free trade [color=red]Sumygaia[/color] may be the one for you! We&amp;#39;d love to have our little region grow into something larger, and new friends will be welcomed with open arms. We currently have a password due to a failed coup, so message [color=orange]Orestavia[/color] if you wish to join on.
