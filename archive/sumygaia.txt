A note to all nations. Recently we were invaded by those motherless dogs, the Black Riders. Well they attempted to oppress the proud nations of Sumygaia and instead rode straight into Kyrill&amp;#39;s oversized BAN HAMMER OF TRADE. So hopefully they will stay down, but contact your nearby Orestavian trade office for other measure we have to take to keep our nation free of these raider bastards.
