&amp;#10018; [b]Bazaar[/b] (pronounced Baza-Ar) is the bizarre cataclysm of [nation]Gothgraff and Lilium[/nation]. It was established as a final resting spot; a culmination of nearly a decade of active roleplay through many different forms.

Baza-Ar is a diverse planet composed of 115 nations competing politically, economically, and ideologically. The world moves at an increasingly rapid pace. Old, traditional systems of government are challenged by new waves of reactionism. Technology increases so that the full floodworks of industrial society can be released upon an autochthonous world. Soil and society squeals under the weight of automata. Religion and rationalism tread a fine line, celebrated by some, demonized by others. The world has questions, and is drowning in them. &amp;#10018;
