[b][color=#993399]!Welcome to the ACE Place![/color][/b]

This community is dedicated providing a place for All people of the LGBT+ community (including allies), However with a focus on those who identify with any form of the Asexual or Aromantic spectrums.

Please be aware that we are new, I plan to expand the complexity of the regions governance and culture as more people join. In this way I hope to allow for the region to grow naturally and in a way that would best suit the community.

Know anybody who would be interested? Just give them our link!
