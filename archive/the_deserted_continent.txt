A collection of folks who were either left in the crazy old-world or who got there by choice. Either or, there&#39;s no kind of political or social standard; Anything goes, depending on who&#39;s in charge of the state/country. Anyone and everyone, come and go as you like, as within the deserted continent, nations rise and crumble constantly, always in some sort of poorly maintained existence.
