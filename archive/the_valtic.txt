[b]INFORMATION[/b]
Until its sunset and subsequent ceasing to exist, The VALTIC was a side project of the Augustin Alliance, originally founded by Betmet and later maintained by DiRito-Opolis. It was discontinued due to decreasing population and internal struggles. It was indirectly succeeded by The Clover Confederation.

Due to the region having ceased to exist twice, the original Regional Message Board is lost. A variety of archived dispatches can be found on this page.
