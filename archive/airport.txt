The Aero International Airport (AIA) was completed on November 15th 2020. It is planned out in one large terminal removing the need of a airport tram. It is built to handle the 3.23 million daily Airportean flyers with an astonishing 18 runways. It is located in-between the two largest cities of New Cerata and Erasean. It is connected to the Airport Spaceport (AAS) which handles cargo from space. [hr]
