[i]All human life can be found in an airport. [/i]
David Walliams

An Airport is a wonderful gateway to everywhere.

We desire embassies with [u]every single region[/u] so that this Airport can connect every part of the NationStates World. We want so that every region in this world is only two clicks away at all times.

[u]If you send us an embassy request, we will always accept it.[/u] The RMB is open, everyone from a region with an embassy with the [region]Airport[/region] can post here.

This region is 100% neutral, and has no political, social or religious objectives.
