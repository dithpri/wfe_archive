The Airportean international airport (AIA) was completed on November 15th 2020. It is planned out in one large terminal removing the need of a airport tram. It is built to handle the 100 million daily Airportean flyers with an astonishing 8 runways. It is located in the core of Aero, the capital of Airport. High speed rail connects AIA to the Airport Spaceport (AAS) which handles around 3.5 million riders annually coming from space and other cities. Millitary operations are conducted in the BMAFB or Ballistic Missile and Air Force Base.
