[b]Tonight the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy brought together a band of the dirtiest sailors they could find - often playing nasty tricks on each other, the Rear Admiral had to command these sailors to hit everything that they came across with some sharp orders, or risk a mutiny. If you&#39;d like to join the baddest bunch of seafaring scallywags to sail across NationStates, we&#39;d love to have you jump aboard our vessel.
