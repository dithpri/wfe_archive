Absjihrdistan was temporarily disestablished, and when that happened, the continent of Greater Gazyrystan fell into anarchy. Recently, a certain nation took over and has claimed that it is the founder of Greater Gazyrystan, when in fact it was Gazyrystan itself! So in retaliation Absjihrdistan now announces the creation of Greater Absjihrdistan, a home for all Absjyr and Gazyr, a region of hope and freedom, a motherland for all!
