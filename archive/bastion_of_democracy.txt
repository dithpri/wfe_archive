This region serves as a lowkey simulation of the 2016 Presidential race. Each nation is representative of one candidate currently running, or at least speculated to run. Each Nation operates by ruling on issues based on the perception of how each candidate would respond to the issue, or using policy which they have advocated for already. The outcome of the nations will therefore serve as a mildly facetious metric for how good a president each candidate might be. 

As they say, ball is life. Cook up son.    

AMEN!
