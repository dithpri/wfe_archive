A region home to states that were founded after America&#39;s sudden conservative-induced breakup.

The governing body of this region is known as the American Council, an intergovernmental group designed to make sure the setup of the U.S. Constitution is held up even though the US states have broken up, with a low likelihood of reunification. 

This region is generally Centrist and is welcoming of Capitalism.

Note: Always make sure to read the news to see what&#39;s up! We were going to have the Chesapeake Republic do that but their media likes to just promote others.
