Yggdrasil (/&amp;#712;&amp;#618;&amp;#609;dr&amp;#601;s&amp;#618;l/ or /&amp;#712;&amp;#618;&amp;#609;dr&amp;#601;z&amp;#618;l/; from Old Norse Yggdrasill, pronounced [&amp;#712;y&amp;#609;&amp;#720;&amp;#716;drasil&amp;#720;]) is an immense mythical tree that connects the nine worlds in Norse cosmology.

Yggdrasil is a region full with nations that run in various different ways but through these differences a beautiful unity emerges.

A cosmic ash tree, Yggdrasil, lies at the center of the region. Three roots drink the waters of the homeworlds. Through the drinking of these waters from all home-worlds (regions) Yggdrasil gains power, strength, wisdom and fate.
