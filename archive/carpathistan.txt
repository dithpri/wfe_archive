Carpathistan is a great steppe region, occasionally graced by lush forests and rivers.

By some accounts European, by some accounts Asian, by most accounts neither, Carpathistan is inhabited by a diverse variety of tribes and nations, most of which are themselves multicultural melting pots. Common religions include Eastern Orthodoxy, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Manicheaism, and Tengrism.

If you are looking for where modernity and traditionalism, revolution and conservatism, and faith and apostasy intersect, look no further than the winding trails of Carpathistan.
