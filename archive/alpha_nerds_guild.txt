We are a community of people (typically with Alpha personalities) that love gaming and nerdy topics. Most importantly, we are coming together for a much greater purpose - to help our veterans, LEOs, and first responders battle their PTSD and anxiety disorders through gaming and the mutual love of all things nerdy. We are looking to give them a place that they can call home and know that no matter what, everyone here (civilians and brothers/sisters-in-arms alike) will have their back - be it in life or in game.

So whatever your nerdism is - video games, tabletop games, movies, music, tv shows, books, whatever - bring it and join our family.

Everyone is welcome - civilians, LEOs, veterans, and first responders.
