[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] needed to take a moment to relax. The hawks found directions to coffee shop sever regions away, so they thought they might pay it a visit while taking down some regions on their way. But don&#39;t worry - when we are on our way back home, we&#39;ll stop by again and give this region some free coffee! If you wanna join our coffee drinking, region crashing adventures, then [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]come join us[/url]!
