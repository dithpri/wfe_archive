[b]The Iron Islands are a group of islands off the continent Westeros. The seat of the Islands is Pyke, and they are ruled by the House Greyjoy and their leader, the Lord Reaper of Pyke. While the Iron Islands is the smallest of the nine provinces of Westeros, the naval prowess of House Greyjoy has lead to a powerful military strength around the desolate cliffs that surround the islands. The Iron Islands also enjoy great trade due to their naval might.
