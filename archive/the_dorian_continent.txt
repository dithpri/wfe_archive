A large continent surrounded by water on three sides and a vast and endless tundra on the rest, the Dorian continent has been inhabited by the Dora Peoples for over 10,000 years. Empires have risen and fallen with different subsets of the Dora ethnic group taking supremacy at different times, but one thing has remained throughout the years... the intense hatred felt between the different (yet very similar) nations in the continent.
