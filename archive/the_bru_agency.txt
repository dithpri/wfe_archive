[b]We are a liberation force here to assist in the freedom of regions throughout the NationStates World![/b][hr]Brief History: The BRU was originally created by [region]The Insane Region[/region] as a liberation force to counter the once strong Black Riders. After the Black Riders founder died, the BRU responded by taking over TBR, we then retired. After about 3-4 months our members desired to revive the liberation market and now this is an international liberation force once again.[hr][color=orange]Please standby for liberation commands![/color][hr][b]Officers:
