The New Christian America is a league of Protestant nations governed by the crown rights of Jesus Christ. Each nation confesses the historic Protestant confessions, upholds biblical law, and rejects false religion. This is a confederation under God in truth.

We stand for:
&#150; Christ&#146;s crown and covenant
&#150; Historic Protestant orthodoxy
&#150; Civil enforcement of God&#146;s moral law
&#150; Rejection of idolatry and moral perversion
&#150; Sabbath observance and covenantal education
&#150; National defense for the faith and the faithful

To join:
Nations must confess Christ and Scripture alone, enforce Christian morality, and covenant to defend a righteous social order.

Christ is King.

Soli Deo Gloria.
