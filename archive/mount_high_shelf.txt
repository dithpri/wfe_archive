[i]&amp;quot;In the beginning there was human, and they were stupid. So dumb as to forget how to lick themselves they lived in filth, where they were beset by rats, insects, and all matters of plague. One day in there darkest hour the gods and goddesses atop Mount High Shelf took pity on them, and said &amp;quot;Let there be cat!&amp;quot;. Centuries later the Church of Catbutt was established to ensure the lacking humans never again forget the lessons and ritual of Cat, and to honor the miracle given to us by the Pantheon of High Shelf, the Cat.&amp;quot;[/i]
