Welcome to [b]Bozia[/b]! A fantasy world set in the early 16th century, where dragons and magic meets gunpowder and cannon fire.

Bozia was made for role play in mind, with a fully unique world map made for it.
If you&#39;re interested in fantasy or managing a nation more in-depth, this region is for you!

Bozia was made with more than just a map and role play in mind, We&#39;ve been working hard to make a simple-yet-effective system for this!
Of course, since no nation should be separated from the world, sometimes a special event will hit a part of the map, and it will bring consequences.
As always, let&#39;s avoid hate-speech or any political topics, that just sours the mood for everyone involved!

Have fun!
