[b]Welcome![/b] to DND essentially.

We shall be creating a nice campaign, the story can be anything of [b]you&#39;re[/b] choosing, the story will evolve around all of the players participating.

[i]Become one of the main parties or become a side character, help out the main group or become their rivals.[/i] 

The story is up to y&#39;all, you can choose the twist and turns, the choice is up to you. The only rules we have are no IRL racism, but racism against another made up species? Sure! But the campaigns will be, as realistic as possible, meaning yes other species will be racist to your character if you&#39;re specie&#39;s are at war, admins will play as gods, giving you blessings or answering prayers, or giving you problems.

I hope you have fun, as the story will begin soon.
