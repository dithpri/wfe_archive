Greetings and Welcome.

Derived from the Native American word nebrathka meaning flat water,
the prairies discovered on this land inspired writers such as Willa Cather and Bess Streeter Aldrich,
and has been home to the good life for many years.

We are fortunate to live in a country where so many step up to defend the ideals we hold dear.
To all our veterans I offer my most grateful thanks for the service you have given to our state and this nation.
