A civil region is a region striving for full respect for the rights of citizens, their support and justice. The region is liberal - democratic. Any state can join us (with the exception of fascist, military states and states with real military conflicts). The region supports the rights of minorities, if the acceding country does not support them - refusal to join. All these rules will help the development of our region and your peoples. &quot;Glory to the people, glory to the country!&quot;
