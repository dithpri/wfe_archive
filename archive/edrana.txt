The Edrana Region is a diverse geopolitical zone encompassing fifteen sovereign nations spread across two primary island chains and one continental cluster. It stands today as one of the most politically and economically significant regions on the planet, home to superpowers, emerging democracies, and unique cultural identities forged through centuries of maritime exchange, colonial ambition, and resilience.

From the industrial sprawl of Betlia to the sun-washed streets of Guanatamo, the Edrana Region represents both the challenges and the triumphs of a shared yet divided history. Though deeply varied in governance and ideology, its nations remain bound by proximity, trade, and the enduring shadow of Fujikori&#146;s postwar leadership.
