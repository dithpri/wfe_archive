The kingdoms descended of the Gruptang Empire are the pillars of modern Tangian ideology and philosophy.  The continent still lives in the impact of the empire today. The Capitalist Revolution dethroned the king of the Harperlands and marked the beginning of modern age of Tangia. Various ethnicities unite under the Capitalist Union, Mmoliland, Smogopolis and many other nations with a share of the land. Despite the powerful modern age bringing new understanding and cooperations, ancient ethnic and ideological conflicts dating back to the Gruptang Empire are still present.
