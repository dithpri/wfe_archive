Removed from the outside world, the region of Tangia rose up from the sticks and stones of the Gruptangian Empire collapse. Left in the remnants of what once was, the isolationist peoples banded up and formed various nation states, a surge of nationalism and isolationism overcoming the region. Today, the states of Tangia reside within a coalition assuring interregional cooperation, however, the wildly differing ideologies and goals amongst states brings friction amongst the members.
