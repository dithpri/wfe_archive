Welcome to the Abyss, traveler. It seems you have fallen from your universe, and have come here. Please tell us about what you think bread is (we do not know). 

We live by the simple principe of &#39;An&#39; it harm none, do what ye will.&#39; We sincerely hope that the variety of new nations will paint the otherwise monotone, black Chronal Abyss in more colours than just black.

Also, we&#39;re invincible! [nation]Staranesia[/nation] will personally refund you fifty-thousand dollars if you ever get kicked by a raider.
