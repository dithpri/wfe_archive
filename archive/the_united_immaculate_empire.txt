Due to the recent invasions I have granted several more nations power over border security. All border guards are under the command of the Chief of Border Security and unless a matter is urgent will not remove a nation without the permission of the Chief of Border Security, the Vice Delegate or the Delegate. On another note I would like recommendations on who should fill the office of Public Research Analyst. This nation will be the one who mainly controls the polls.
