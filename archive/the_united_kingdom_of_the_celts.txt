The British Isles are in a state of Chaos. 3 years before the invasions of the European Union, the Counties have united into one Kingdom, following the conquests of The King, and the victory over Hitler in 1063, a defeat. The King decided the time was right to unite the Celts of Wales, Cornwall, Scotland, Ireland and Brittany, In 1066, whilst the Anglo-Saxons fought a war on two fronts against the Norwegians and Normans. We stormed the West Country, and took all the land from the Isles of The United States and The United Kingdom. In one swift move, Wales had doubled in size and population. The borders between the two powers in the world were extremely hostile, and they all knew as soon as the truces expired, war would again commence.
