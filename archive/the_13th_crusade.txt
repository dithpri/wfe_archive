The 13th Crusade is a region that is based on the crusades. Some sources say that there have been 30+ &#39;crusades&#39;, but I used Random Number Generator to come up with 13. We offer a RP (Middle East, and a bit of Europe), an active Founder, and suggestions for the region. I will see you around, and remember... Deus Vult!
