Pristinus is an ancient, forgotten land, long inhabited by Atavista. It has reached an unheard of level of technological advancement, where computers and organic beings are synonymous; many Users &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; by plugging into a jack, providing processing power for the Central Unit. No one knows who made the Central Unit, nor do the know how it works; only that it provides their every need. 
The cities are fluid things of steel, glass, and concrete with ghostly images and readouts hovering on most surfaces. The citizens are nearly literally attached to their home; bio-reactive technology makes the world bend to their will, creating a deadly fantasy land. Most Users are benign, but nonetheless there is a dark side.
