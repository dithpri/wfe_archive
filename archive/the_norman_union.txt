300 years ago, The Holy Empire of Raquieste, The Kingdom of Khazadun, The Republic of Rap Advex and The Holy Empire of Imprimis engaged in one of the bloodiest wars in the history of mankind. Fighting over land and natural resources, the nations fought each other for years. After the dust settled, the now current leaders, Lord Burress, King Musgrove, and President Tompkins (respectively) decided to live in harmony, splitting the natural resources between the three nations. The Nations have been living in peace under the new flag of the Norman Union.
