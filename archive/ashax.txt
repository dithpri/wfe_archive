The [b]Dominion of [region]Ashax[/region][/b] was founded on 6/17/2025 by the 19x Security Council author [nation]Lenlyvit[/nation]. [b]The Dominion of [region]Ashax[/region][/b] is a region dedicated to writing and drafting resolutions for the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=sc]WA Security Council[/url], as well as collecting ideas for potential future resolutions. While not the first region in history to be solely dedicated to the Security Council, [b]The Dominion of [region]Ashax[/region][/b] strives to be the only one in existence at this point in time to bring back a thriving community to the World Assembly body.
