This reigon was created in a fit of one nation&amp;#39;s rage at the constant raids completely obliterating the chance for any small nation of ever ceasing power. The hopes for this reigon is that it will one day become quite large with new recruits and be able to raid the raiding reigons itself, especially Assasin&amp;#39;s sworn enemies the Black Riders. All new recruits must vote with the nation who already retains the most endorsements else the raiders will be able to topple the reigon.
