[color=red]PROCEED WITH CAUTION[/color][/b]

The United States of East Peninsula (USEP) is a roleplay and community region, originally created in late 2019 but refounded on the 19th July, 2020. It was made for good conversation and Regional Government, but it is primarily for modern day, alternate continent roleplay. You should come here if you are interested in creating and roleplaying your own nation, as well as crafting its stories.

USEP is a fractured continent. It is ridden with war, disease, famine and terror. It is not a place for the weak. Your nation is somewhere in this godforsaken land, and it is up to you to steer your people away from hardship and into prosperity. So, what are you waiting for?
