The Great Coomer Lands are home to a few distinct countries.  It is it&#39;s own continent located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  The people of The Great Coomer Lands all fall under the ethnic group known as &quot;Zoomers.&quot;  Much like how Slavs have different subdivisions, Zoomers have the same idea of diversity.  One of the most prominent Zoomer subdivisions are Chungites, who call The Oppressed Peoples of Chungus Gamers home. The E-Peoples are a simple society, based on a barter system with no real government. The government is all the citizens combined, the truest form of an anarchy and communism.
