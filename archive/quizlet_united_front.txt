[b][u][color=rainbow]Quizlet United Front[/color][/u][/b]

Welcome to our army. We were founded in Quizlet in 2009, and now we have decided to move to nation states. Our army is trained and totally professional. We are mercenaries and if a region needs help raiding or defending, we will certainly help. We are on 24/7, so no worries.
