Happy Trading! This year I semi-regularly farmed using 60 nations, the result was 70 legendary cards over 11 months, a pitiful haul. Apologies I did not find more.

This is likely be the last giveaway unless something like TCALS returns; thanks to everyone in the cards community for being such great people.
