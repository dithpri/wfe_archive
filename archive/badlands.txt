[b]Good Times in the Badland[/b]s

The rugged beauty of the Badlands draws visitors from around the world. These striking geologic deposits contain one of the world&#39;s richest fossil beds. Ancient mammals such as the rhino, horse, and saber-toothed cat once roamed here. The park&#39;s 244,000 acres protect an expanse of mixed-grass prairie where bison, bighorn sheep, prairie dogs, and black-footed ferrets live today. &#151;[url=https://www.nps.gov/badl/index.htm][color=663300]Badlands[/color][/url][hr]
