[b]This region has been raided 1 time,, and as the founder, I really don&#39;t mind. Should another group decide to raid I say go for it. Just don&#39;t touch the [color=purple]Flag[/color] and leave the previous calling cards alone. I want to see how many times a region can be raided within its lifespan.
