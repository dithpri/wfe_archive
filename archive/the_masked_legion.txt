We are the tossed aside, the forgotten, the abused. Under this banner, we put on our masks, and we become one, as we fight back against those that have oppressed us, or on behalf of our siblings. We fight hard, for we have lost everything.

Welcome to the Legion, Sibling!

The Masked Legion is an Independent R/D Region, dedicated to fighting against those that would toss aside valued members of their community.
