The New European Community is a politically-neutral region of mutual co-operation within. The entry process however, is quite strict. Entry will only be granted if the Council of Three ([nation]Copper-9[/nation], [nation]The Jacobian Realm[/nation] and [nation]The Northwest States[/nation]) all agree to let you in. A single currency is shared across the region, NCoin. If a nation wishes to join the region, they must use the NCoin as their official currency or have their own currency closely tied to the NCoin.
