A vast wasteland that spans the continent, &quot;the steppe&quot; is a colloquial term for the many flatlands and deserts of northern Eurasia. The region is isolated from the rest of the continent, and few who live in the region venture outside it.

The region is sparsely populated, and most of the population are nomadic, though they roughly 
(and rather reluctantly) respect national borders.
