The New Order was created on the foundation of ruins.
Phyrislandia and Ulaba made diplomatic contact after trying to excavate the shared ruins of an uncontrolled area in the middle of their respective countries. The excavation was led by the two country&#39;s leaders, being young countries at that point. They grew to enjoy each other&#39;s countries and founded an alliance to dominate the world together, although their technological and theological essences contradicted each other.

Other nations were eventually allowed into the alliance after a short time. They promised to defend the rights of the people and make a better world for each other.
