Emberlake District
Area of Lakes Grove

A vibrant mix of city and nature along the south shore of Ember Lake. It is inhabited by ~850,000 people, with green energy, tech start-ups, and organic agriculture being its reputation. It is governed by the democratically elected Emberlake Council and focuses on sustainable growth and community participation. Ember City is the economic and cultural hub. Open spaces and public transport keep the area connected and livable. Urbanization vs. nature remains the prime issue to overcome.
