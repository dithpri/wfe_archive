[hr] 
&quot;What is the Quest?&quot;

I&#39;m glad you asked! The quest is a competition! Starting on Sept. 13th, there will be a theme.  You will be encouraged to change your flag, motto, currency, and so forth to fit the theme of the day into your region. There will also be daily questions on the theme on the RMB that may or may not sway the judges voting!

[u][b]Voting[/b][/u][/list]
[list][*]1 point for flag change to theme
[*]1 point for motto change to theme
[*]1 point to money change to theme
[*]Each judge will award 1-5 points based upon their subjective feels. Then everything gets tallied up[/list]
