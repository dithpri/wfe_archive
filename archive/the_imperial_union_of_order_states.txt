The Imperial Union is an alliance of The Terren Dominion and other like-minded nations. The Union believes that people should be free to live their lives as they see fit without fear of harassment or expulsion, and should have the freedom to spend money in a free and fair market, however should have little say in the government unless they are educated and government positions should only be filled by people who are qualified for those positions.
