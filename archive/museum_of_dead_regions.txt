[b]Welcome to the [color=purple]Museum Of Dead Regions[/color], a compendium of worlds nearly lost!

We save dead regions (regions with 0 nations) from disappearing [i]if[/i] they have a significant number of messages in their regional message board. Until a definitive minimum is decided upon, this usually means about 100+ messages. Then we document them so their tales are not forgotten.
