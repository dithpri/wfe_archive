The Handos Encalve located in the region of the Handos Moutain Range. Whos landscape has dramatically been alterd from the catastropic blasts of Stocklouian strategic punishment missile strikes following the 2nd Cryxian War of Annexation. Now the region is a mix of craters,cracked moutians dotting the sprawling evergreen forests on the cliffs around the gulf of handos. Once great nations before and during the 2nd Cryxian war are now nothing more than Necropolios
