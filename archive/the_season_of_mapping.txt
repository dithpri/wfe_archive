I am starting a mapping series!
So mapping is just a fun hobby. That is why I am creating my own series. Now you may be wondering, why are you telling us? Well in mapping there is a thing called an official nation. You can start your own, and control what you want to happen to do with it. Then I will put it in my video! Let&#146;s say you get an official nation, and decides to invade somebody else&#146;s official nation, that is something you can do with an official nation!
