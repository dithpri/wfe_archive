[b]The Corporate Alliance[/b], also known as [b]The Corporate Syndicate[/b], is a region for all types of corporations, whether they be fledgling, too-big-to-fail, or somewhere in between. 

Our mission is to expose [nation]The Blackwater Corporation[/nation]&amp;#39;s corruption, oppression, immoral activities, and crony-Capitalism. We will not resort to violence to do this, as violence is a Blackwater Corporation trait.

The Corporate Alliance welcomes all types of corporations and nations, but primarily welcomes Capitalist nations that are against crony-Capitalism and Corporatism.
