Welcome to the Spee empire. We all strive to do our best. Here our people come first and not politics. Just because someone goes to war, don&#146;t feel guilty if you don&#146;t help. We all have to cover our own nations and you might not have the strength to fight a war. Which is okay. We all try to be fair here and help each other out where we can.
