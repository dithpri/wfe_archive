A peaceful and religious region. A region that promotes freedom of all it&#39;s people and it&#39;s allies. Templar law shall rule here always and the goals of negotiation highly valued. religious tourism is encouraged and many make the Pilgrimage to Mount Venta-Gon to visit the scared shrine of the Templars. However this is an unforgiving land of high Mountains and those who wander from our modern cities can find them selves in peril.

The Region combines a regional Police and Rescue Force which maintains safety and order.
To maintain citizenship one must be born in the region.
Templar Law is a strict Law.
