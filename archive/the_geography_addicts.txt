The Geography Addicts are currently run by a Supreme Chancellor. The next highest position is the President of the Council of Ministers who runs the Council of Ministers and is the Supreme Chancellor&#146;s second in command. The Council of Ministers consists of the Ministers of the Homeland, Defense, Research, and Diplomacy. The Ministers are some of the most trusted advisors to the Supreme Chancellor. Next with less power than the Ministers but still more than a normal citizen there are officers who enforce the rules and keep people in line. There are three officers.
