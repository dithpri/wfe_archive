Be the most excellent that you can be, whatever that may be. Whether you wish to create a peaceful and orderly society, or revel in conquest and subjugation, as long as you do your best, who can blame you? Perhaps mired in the millennia of opinions and private agendas there&#39;s a truth to things, but we&#39;re all too busy trying to survive to figure it out, so may be most excellent win!
