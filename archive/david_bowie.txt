[color=pink]Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six)
Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three)
Check ignition and may God&#39;s love be with you (two, one, liftoff)[/color]

[color=Purple]This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You&#39;ve really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it&#39;s time to leave the capsule if you dare
&quot;This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I&#39;m stepping through the door
And I&#39;m floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here[/color][color=blue]
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there&#39;s nothing I can do[/color]
