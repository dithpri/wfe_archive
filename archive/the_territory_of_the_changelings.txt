[region]The Territory of the Changelings[/region] (([url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=442767][b]Flag Source[/b][/url])) are the sacred homelands of the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=441816]Changelings[/url].
Although ancient, the Changelings have largely remained in isolation.
In reverence of the large lush forests brimming with natural life; Changelings often spend their time worshipping their ancestral daughters, whether in ritual or at rest.

While their daughters ran amok in other lands, the Changeling lands have remained peaceful, practically untouched and preserved in their glory.
For this reason precisely, their territory has piqued the interest of outsiders.

Some seek to adventure &amp;amp; others seek to study the flora and fauna. 
Few seek to steal the glory and beauty of this land for material gain.
But - do be aware - that the latter are not welcome here.
