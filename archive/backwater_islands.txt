What happens when you uproot your region and relocate to the middle of the ocean? Backwater Islands happens. A retreat more than a region, the Backwater Islands welcomes anyone and everyone tired of life in the other, larger, more powerful nations.

A safe, moderately happy nation made up of fifteen (and growing due to land reclamation) individual islands with no fear for zombies, due to the relative abundance of salt water. The region is protected by 50m tall mechas/robots piloted by teams of people wearing colour-coordinated spandex. Also, there&amp;#39;s an old man with a shotgun. Don&amp;#39;t mess with him. Please.

As of now, there is no World Assembly Delegate. Subject to change (re: never)
