The Bonmondan Commonwealth (Esperanto: La Bonmonda Komunumo) is a commonwealth of federated states. The founding mission of the commonwealth is:

     &quot;To create a world in which nations are united by cooperation rather than divided by selfishness, a world in which nations collaborate to provide for all rather than exploiting the weak and increasing inequality, a world in which those with security and abundant resources reach out a helping hand to those in need.&quot;

If you are looking for somewhere to build bridges not walls, to share ideas rather than dwell in ignorance then this is the region for you. Come and say hi, diplomatic puppets welcome.
