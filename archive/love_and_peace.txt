Anyone can come, anyone can stay. Enjoy, and share your thoughts!

If you&#39;re a destructionist who loves to hate; you&#39;re welcome as well. Write out everything that causes your deep dark suffering!

For the builders; please don&#39;t hate them! They&#39;re suffering enough already, and there is no need to feed the hatred&#39;s vicious circle. The world is already in flames, because its much easier to hate than to love.

Lets make this region a relaxed, peaceful island where anyone can share any of their thoughts!

You&#39;ll be always welcome here, even if you just want a hug and then you depart!^

Love,
Ayla
