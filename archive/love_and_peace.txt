[color=pink]Love[/color] and [color=white]Peace[/color] is a region based on the principals of loving each other and admiring the world. You don&#39;t have to join if you don&#39;t want to, just take to heart our messages. Fueled by the [color=red]recent riots[/color] in Venezuela, the obviously [color=red]xenophobic[/color] border wall and the [color=gray]racism[/color] in Britain over Brexit, we plan to show the world (or maybe just you) how to love again.
