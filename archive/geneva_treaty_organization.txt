[B]Welcome to the Geneva Treaty Organization[/B] 

The Geneva Treaty Organization is a roleplay centered, modern-technology, realistic region that seeks to establish a player base of like-minded nations. The GTO has a regional map where nations can reside and conduct their roleplay. A mutual regional history also exists to give new players an idea of what this alternate world looks like. This region pushes players to seek true historical backgrounds for their nations and promotes roleplay that would fit a real functioning world. Whether it be roleplay with nations only or character roleplay, either is welcomed in the GTO.
