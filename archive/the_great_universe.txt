We are back! Long live TGU!
To the raiders: we may not be at our peak now, but we have a long cherished history that spans 3 and a half years. We are not just another embassy collector.
I do acknowledge and apologize that in the past I was a weirdo and not the most polite on here. I joined this game at a young age and I am sorry, as I know I did many things wrong in the past. Perhaps even irresponsible. But I never participated in raiding.
