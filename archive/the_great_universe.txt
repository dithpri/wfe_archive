[color=purple]Raiders, [i]we&#39;re not at our peak, but we got a long cherished history that spans 3 1/2 years. We&#39;re not just an embassy collector. I acknowledge &amp; apologize that I used to be a weirdo &amp; unkind on NS. I joined NS at a young age &amp; im sorry, I did many things wrong. Even irresponsible. But I never raided.
