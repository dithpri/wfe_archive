[b][color=blue]Hello, I&#39;m [nation=fodania], the founder of the [region]South Antarctic Federation[/region], we are a modern/futuristic style Antarctic roleplay region. We have recently melted Antarctica&#39;s ice, resulting in a mass attack from the rest of the world due to a massive loss of agricultural land.
