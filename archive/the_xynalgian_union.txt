A growing Union of nations where dictatorships may rest in peace, and smaller, socialist nations may rest easy under the protection of their iron-fisted comrades, by joining this Union you swear pro-xynalgasianism, as well as to not attack any other nation in this union, at the risk of being [b]invaded, ejected from the Union, and destroyed.[/b]

But as long as this guideline is followed, you can ask on the board for advice for any issue or situation you may need.
Good Day.

-Supreme Leader of the Xynalgas State, Athalwolf Einhardt Strauss
