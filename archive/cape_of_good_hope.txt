[color=#6B4423][b]The Cape of Good Hope[/b]: Nobody in their right mind would come here. Enter at your own risk.[/color]

This region prides itself on helpfulness, good conversation, and above all, its members. We have:
&#149; no offsite forum
&#149; no regional government
&#149; no drama
&#149; no endorsement rules
&#149; and no rules in general.

This is a quiet region... or at least, it was. Our people are raving mad, our leaders are worse, and the air is thick with pies. [b][color=brown]Congratulations to [nation=short]caffeine_addicts[/nation] on one year as our delegate![/color][/b]
