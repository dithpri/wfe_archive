After the discovery of Auraxis, research on the planet&amp;#39;s surface lead to the discovery of the ruins of an alien civilization called the Vanu. Alien artifacts led to the invention of Nanite and rebirthing technology, promising incredible leaps in human civilization. But the Terran Republic attempted to suppress research of Vanu artifacts, believing that if the people of Earth learned about the power held in Vanu tech, it would lead to a new world order.  This is where the Vanu Sovereignty was born. They seceded from the TR, taking many bright minds and radical thinkers with them. They&amp;#39;re main belief is that research into Vanu tech will yield the next step in human evolution.
