The Caldari State is built on corporate capitalism, led by eight megacorporations which divide the State between them. The State is guided by leaders who are determined to see the return to the meritocratic ideals of its founding fathers. Ruthless and efficient in the boardroom as well as on the battlefield, the Caldari are living emblems of strength, persistence, and dignity. Caldari citizens are a proud race built on the tenets of patriotism and capitalism. Dissent is crushed in most of the State save for designated Special Economic Zones, wherein the State allows democratic ideals and principles ushered in by citizens from other regions to flourish under the stipulation that these external influences be contained within the zones.
