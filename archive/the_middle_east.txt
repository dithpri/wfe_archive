 The Middle East is a region that roughly encompasses a majority of Western Asia (excluding the Caucasus) and Egypt. The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times, and throughout its history, the Middle East has been a major centre of world affairs. The Middle East is also the historical origin of major religions including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Many countries located around the Persian Gulf have large quantities of crude oil, which has resulted in much wealth particularly for nations in the Arabian peninsula. In modern times the Middle East remains a strategically, economically, politically, culturally and religiously sensitive region.
