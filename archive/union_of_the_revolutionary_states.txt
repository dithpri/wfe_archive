United We Stand,Divided We Fall 
What&#39;s the point of Legislation and Governance without freedom?Nations suffering from sicked and money eyed capitalist.Together we will stand overthrowing the system.What&#39;s the point of equality when there&#39;s no equity.We rebel for a purpose which is for FREEDOM.
We aren&#39;t corrupted or anarchist.We care for others and we will lead this revolution together where we will make every nation great again. SALUTE!
