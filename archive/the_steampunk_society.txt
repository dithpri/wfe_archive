The steampunk society is a region that believes steam, power and democracy should go hand in hand. This region is one that is highly secure and when threatened, will go into lock down and prevent invasion. The writings for parliament have already begun and it is highly recommended for joining the world assembly, as it puts you in line for becoming delegate for the high council. The high council asks that its members, once elected, will show the council symbol on their own flag (blue background not required) http://i.imgur.com/zhvo7tr.png
