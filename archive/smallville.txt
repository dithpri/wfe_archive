Smallville, Kansas has been known as the meteor capital of the World, since the day in the mid 1980&#39;s that a massive meteor shower destroyed much of the town.  Since then, there have been glowing green rocks everywhere and a lot of strange things going on.  Any fans of the show or the comics are welcome here.
