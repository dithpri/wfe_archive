The Atlantic Cooperative is a mostly right-wing authoritarian region with a few welcome socialists.

Socialists are not to be discriminated against, that is final. They are citizens aswell. This especially is the word of the founder. Abide by it!

The Great Founder is responsible for most happenings within the region.

To The Prosperity Of The Region!!
