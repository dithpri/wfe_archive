Promise and swear, by God and His Holy Gospels, that I always shall be my rightful King, the Mighty Prince and Lord, Pospy, King of the Kitefins, the Goths and the Wends, and the Royal House true and faithful. I shall also with my life and blood defend the Royal form of government and the rights of the council of the absolutes  all in accordance with the fundamental laws of the Realm, which I in all [their] parts shall obey and follow. This I pledge on my honor and conscience to deliver, so truly help me God to life and spirit.
