A region created on the bodies of great beasts that died fighting each other.

However trouble has recently ensued as these titans were not dead but merely stunned.
 
Whilst these creatures continue to regain their strength, the people of Mythicalis havecome together in hope of discovering a way to induce the monsters into an endless sleep.

One person was selected to over see this task. Born from the Snacirfa family, Charma took on the challenge. 
Will she forever be hailed as the Hero of Mythicalis and the Tamer of Beasts or will the test prove too great and leave us all doomed and vulnerable to the unknown.
