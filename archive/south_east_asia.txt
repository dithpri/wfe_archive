THE SEKHMET LEGION. Promoting desertification since 2013!

[hr]

[color=red]This region was raided and refounded by Osiris and friends in 2018, CTEd and got refounded a bunch of times after that, became an actual region, merged with another one, CTEd and was refounded again, and in the end, the last founder gave border control power to...an Osiran sleeper.[/color]

OSIRIS FTW! Again.
