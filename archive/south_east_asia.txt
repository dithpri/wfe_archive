Southeast Asia consists of eleven countries that reach from eastern India to China, and is generally divided into &#147;mainland&#148; and &#147;island&#148; zones. The mainland (Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam) is actually an extension of the Asian continent. Muslims can be found in all mainland countries, but the most significant populations are in southern Thailand and western Burma (Arakan). The Cham people of central Vietnam and Cambodia are also Muslim.
