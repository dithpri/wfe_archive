After long experiments with the fourth dimension, Earth scientists have made an incredible discovery &#151; they have discovered a new dimension that arose as a result of the collapse. It was a carbon-copy of Earth, frozen in time with no observers.

This new dimension has become a haven for the inhabitants of the Earth, who evacuated there to escape from global disasters and environmental problems. 

They&#39;ve called their new home Mirra.
