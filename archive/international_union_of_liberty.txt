Welcome to the International Union of Liberty. Rather than a government the IUL acts more like a political party for the World Assembly. Any supporter of democratic or republican viewpoints are welcome to join. The IUL will meet and discuss for every WA vote. We will decide how IUL member&#39;s should vote.. I, [nation]Goldenhemier[/nation], will act as Chairman until there is enough members to safely give authority to a World Assembly Delegate. I&#39;m not new to NationStates. [nation]Goldenhemier[/nation] is just a new nation of mine. [color=red]All Nations must be a  member of the World Assembly to join.[/color] Send me a telegram if you want to join, and I&#39;ll give you the password.
