We are a free, safe nation, and we welcome all. We hope you are at peace here! We tolerate all religions, and political views. If you are looking for a region that cares about your nation, our alliance is the place for you. Our region has the Olympics, regional and emassy wide contests, newspapers, and government. We will never bann or eject nations. If you want a region that cares about you, you have found what you have been looking for.

Thank you, and have a peaceful day,
Kellocracy, founder and president of Alliance Of The Amity.
