[b]Our first region, [region]The Ridge of Badgers[/region], was created by five fairly old nations as an alternative to the Axolotlum pact. After the destruction of the first Cthulhus Horde by reactionaries, the region was refounded by [nation]Cthulhus Second Horde[/nation] and democratized. The Immortal Diarchs of the ROB are Tony Earl and Robert La Follette Sr.[/b]
