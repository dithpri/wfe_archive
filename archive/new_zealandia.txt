[color=purple][b]Chancellor Elections Have Closed![/b][/color]
Once you are here, you can claim a space for your nation on the regional map, run for Chancellor in our elections, and occasionally take part in a role play. 
We are mainly a peaceful region, we don&amp;#39;t raid, but we may be soon forming a defender army.
If you are a member of the World Assembly, it would be appreciated if you could endorse our members. They will normally return the favor.
