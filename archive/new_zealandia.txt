We are mainly a peaceful region, but if threatened we respond immediately to any hostile raiders.
As a result, the area is password-protected. This password can change at any moment, for the region&amp;#39;s safety. Telegram us if you want the password to join.
We are a small group, but are beginning to expand. Feel free to vote in polls that influence our growth on the region&amp;#39;s page.
If you are a member of the World Assembly, it would be appreciated if you could endorse our members. They will normally return the favor.
