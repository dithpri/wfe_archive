[b][color=#0094FF][i]The God we worship stretch&#39;d yon heaven&#39;s high bow, And gave these swelling waves to roll below; The hemispheres of night and day He spread, He scoop&#39;d each vale, and rear&#39;d each mountain&#39;s head; His Word produc&#39;d the nations of the earth,
And gave the spirits of the sky their birth; On earth, by Him, his holy lore was given, On earth He came to raise mankind to heaven. And now behold, what most your eyes desire, Our shining armour, and our arms of fire; For who has once in friendly peace beheld, Will dread to meet them on the battle field.&quot;[/i][/color
