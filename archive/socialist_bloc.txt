Socialist Bloc
 Entry is required to be Socialist, or some form of it.
 Any non-socialist nation will be ejected from the Bloc.
 Do not spread anti-socialist messages in the chat.
We are, of course, socialists. We only let socialists in, no matter what type. We are against capitalism and fascism, as they oppress the proletariat!
