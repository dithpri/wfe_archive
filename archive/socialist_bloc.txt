[b][color=c62b29]Normally we at [url=region=Lily]Lily[/url] do fun, silly, and/or colorful WFE&#39;s. But due to recent events, it didn&#39;t feel like the right time.[hr]

For those unaware, Etika, aka Desmond Amofah, a streamer who made people laugh, smile, and always did whatever he could to make those around him&#39;s lives better.
Unfortunately, after untreated mental issues became more severe, he vanished on 6/19/19. A week later in the morning of 6/25/19, his body was found in the East River.
If you ever feel the same way he did in his final moments, hopeless and in despair, remember you are never alone and that [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=285075]seeking professional help[/url] is your best course of action.[hr]
