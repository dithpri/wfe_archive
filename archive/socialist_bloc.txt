[b][color=ff474d]Welcome to the[/color] [color=ff474d]Socialist Bloc[/color][/b]!

We are a revolutionary region which wishes to see all peoples united in peace under a global socialist paradise, through force if necessary. We welcome [b][color=ff474d]leftists[/color][/b] who wish to help us enjoy and spread the [b][color=ff474d]Revolution! [/color][/b]

Our region is controlled in cooperation of two important and powerful institutions: the Revolutionary [b][color=ff474d]Party[/color][/b] and the [b][color=ff474d]State[/color][/b] (which is elected).  The Party issues doctrinal statements, while the State is elected from Party members to rule the region.
