Scripture Quote of the Month: &amp;quot;My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all ; no one can snatch them out of my Father&amp;#39;s hand.
I and the Father are one.&amp;quot; - John 10:27-30
