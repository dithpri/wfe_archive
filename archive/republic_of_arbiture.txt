[hr][b][color=red]A Brief History:[/b][/color]
After the war of 2058, a group of survivors emerged and divvied up the world&#39;s land. These governments became the rulers of the solar system and expanded into the galaxy. Nations of the Republic of Arbiture defend against those who might threaten it. Members defected from Arbiture in 2064, and Arbiture ceased to exist. It has since revived.
