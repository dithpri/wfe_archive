The [b]Hidden Realm[/b] is a remote, isolated region located deep inside the subspace. It is a small network of different subspace sanctuaries physically isolated from the universe.

The [b]Hidden Realm[/b] is a super-maximum-security sanctuary - artificially created by [b][nation=short+noflag]the Therians[/nation][/b] more than 572,000 years ago. Since that time the [b]Therians[/b] successfully maintained their peaceful isolation.

There are some limited contacts to [region]Subspace Realms[/region].
