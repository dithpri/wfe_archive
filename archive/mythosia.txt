Mythosia is primarily hosted for the RFB community but may welcome and be open to the public in future. Mythosia is a roleplay region where players will roleplay as their individual nations and leaders in a vast and ever changing and expanding world. Player nations will be offered an opportunity to rise as a global power with the help of a mysterious global figure known as the Predit Empire.
