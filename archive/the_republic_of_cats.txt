Cats. CATS. CAAAAAAAAAAAAATS! (Oh yeah, and government stuff). Hello, and welcome (or maybe not if you don&#39;t want to join us) to The Republic of Cats. We are a region that respect the magic that is the Cattato. You wanted a serious region? Naw. Just look at the names of our countries! [nation]DonaldTrumpozia[/nation]! [nation]Beerlend[/nation]! We&#39;re way too awesome to be serious. And we&#39;re beyond Sirius XM, as well. Puns. Deal with it, because this is 2K16, and this is the future!
While you&#39;re here, please take the time to join the world assembly and endorse our World Assembly delegate, Cattatosia.
*The title of &#39;Member Nation&#39; will be given, in future, to those nations who are most active among the region.
