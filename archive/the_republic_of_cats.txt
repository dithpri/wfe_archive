We have been randomly invaded by DEN. We&#39;re safe now, thank goodness, after I reverted and removed all DEN nations, changes and tags.
We will not allow this to happen again, so we have enacted a password system. For inquiries in relation to said password, send a telegram to [nation]Newmerland[/nation] indicating why you want join the region. A background check will be taken and, if cleared, will be allowed to enter the region. To my knowledge, all nations currently in the region have the password.
