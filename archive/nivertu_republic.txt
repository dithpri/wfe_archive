The Nivertu Republic is a nation state which parliament or [i] the House of Communities [/i] &#151;as its main government body&#151;consists of the delegates from Communities. Any self-proclaimed nation state that joins the Republic must give up their status by changing their form of state to Community. Sovereignty is therefore held by the Republic. 

Roleplaying must be done using the [b]name[/b] of the assigned delegate, not the name of the Community.
