(DESCRIPTION IS A WIP)


[i]The Milky Way galaxy, a barred spiral galaxy containing between two and four hundred billion stars is the setting for this RP. Its name &amp;quot;milky&amp;quot; is derived from its appearance as a dim glowing band arching across the night sky whose individual stars cannot be distinguished by the naked eye. From your planet the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within.
