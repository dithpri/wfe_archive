The Weaver of the Worlds created everything in the Universe with the power of her dreams. She also gave birth to the Four Keepers: Castor, Lord of Life; Marcjalis, Lord of Death; Evelyn, Lord of Piece and Enlightenment and Dion, Lord of War and Chaos. They are guardias of the stability, but they&amp;#39;re still subservient to their mother. She is called also The Last Friend of Humanity and The White Dreamer.
The Five is celebrated in every full-moon night and solstices.
