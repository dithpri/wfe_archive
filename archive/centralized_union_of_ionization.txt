The CUI is a Union of one leader that has the executive authority to decide what happens in the region, though he only intervenes when needed too. He sits there while the rest of the nations decided what to do, what policy&#39;s to accept and its stance on matters. This can be veto&#39;d out by its leader. Basicly like a Father Knows Best State where everyone has their freedom, until it gets out of hand or slips up.
