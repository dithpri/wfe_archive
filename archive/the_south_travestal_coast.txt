[region]The South Travestal Coast[/region] was once thought to be a myth made up by indigenous tribes of the lands to the north. In recent times however people have sailed south and hit the mainland that was once thought to be myth. Rapid national expansion has caused this land to almost all be made up of separate countries in just a few years after its true discovery.
