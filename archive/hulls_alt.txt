[b][color=#00FF00]Merry Christmas to you all!![/color]

Storms and Snow in Wisconsin, Mythical Sparkles in Florida, and Rainy seasons in Oregon did not stop your feathery friends from [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], and [region]Sparklia[/region] from visiting your region and stealing your Christmas cookies and milk! Defenders were hopping about to stop us, but they decided to stop once they saw we were spreading our Christmas Cheer and Celebrations to Natives!

Hurry up and [url=https://discord.gg/cbfahneg]JOIN US![/url] for cookies and milk before Christmas morning arrives!!.
