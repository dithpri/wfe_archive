Every region is asked to send a representative.
Please Representatives, use the regional message board. Rules are simple, no racism, and refrain from offending someone on purpose. 
 Join the Army! Telegram Surrenderordie or The Borderlands of Roven for details. 
 Rules are in the international part of Surrenderordies factbook, as with extra information
Please when you enter, state what region you represent. This will make it easier for your vote to be heard.
