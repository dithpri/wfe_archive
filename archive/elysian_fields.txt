[b][color=#0047AB]A wonderful place, where everything is delightful. There are soft green meadows, lovely groves, a delicious life-giving air, sunlight that glows a soft purple, and everyone is happy and peaceful. The sound of music played on pipes and lyres fills the air and banquets occur whenever the inhabitants desire. It is a place where the great and good live after their deaths; a dwelling place of mortals made immortal through the favor of the Gods.[/color]
