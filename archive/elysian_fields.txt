[color=996633]Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
         I have been half in love with easeful Death,
Call&amp;#39;d him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
         To take into the air my quiet breath;
                Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
         To cease upon the midnight with no pain[/color]
