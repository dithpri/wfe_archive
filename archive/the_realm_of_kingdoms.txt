Welcome to the Realm! The inspiration for this region, its map and the Role Play are all based on George R. R. Martin&#39;s Song of Ice and Fire. Here, you will be granted a piece of the Game of Thrones Universe and will interact and, most likely, come into conflict with other Kingdoms in your quest for supremacy. Will you be content to rule your lands, or would you like to expand the power of your house? Will you sit upon the Iron Throne of will you bow down before the rightful leader of the Realm. Or will the rains weep o&#39;er the halls of your fallen house at the hands of another? These choices and more are up to you, but remember: &quot;when you play the game of thrones you either win or you die.&quot;
