The Order Of Christ has one goal in mind 
To create a STRONG region for all Christian nation&#146;s 

The Order of Christ is named so because in order to maintain order in the world 
we must put Christ Jesus FIRST in all we do. 

We do NOT allow none christian nations to hold any power or office 
You must be a christian nation to join 

While a member of the region you must follow all of the 10 commandments 
and you must conduct yourself according to the teachings of Jesus Christ at all times. 

WE DO NOT! Except Embassy request from NONE christian regions
