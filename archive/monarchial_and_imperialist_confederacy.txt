This region was designed with monarchies and empires in mind whether they originate in another universe or an alternate timeline, nations where the monarch is a figurehead will be admitted only as observers and will not be permitted to join the Royal Council nor have senators in the Confederate Senate. Each nation shall reign on their own, however the confederacy shall preside over the nations within this Union. The goal of the region is to raise the influence of each nation&#39; sovereign ruler within the region and make the world know of our might.[hr][url=https://discord.gg/w38Pmtz]Royal Council Discord[/url] [url=http://monarchimperconfed.freeforums.net/board/3/citizenship-application]Citizenship Application[/url] [url=http://monarchimperconfed.freeforums.net]Offsite Forums[/url]
