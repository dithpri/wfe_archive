This region was designed with monarchies and empires in mind wether they originate in another universe or an alternate timeline, crowned republics and commonwealths are also welcome as long as they have an official monarch that serves as head of state. Each nation shall reign on their own, however the confederacy shall preside over the nations within this Union. The goal of the region is to raise the influence of each nations&#39; sovereign ruler within the region and make the world know of our might.
