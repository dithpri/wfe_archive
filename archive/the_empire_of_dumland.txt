The Empire of Dumland has many purposes and philosophies. One of our main goals in the political theater is to assure the abolition of Democracy and voice in government. As we no it, Dumland, the grand and powerful land of Empires, is a land absent of any political freedoms. Solely the government can make decisions for their people. Imperialist, Communist, Militarist are all welcome in our loving society of Dictators and Tyrants.
