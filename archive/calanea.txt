Calanea is a multi-ethnic complex of recognized territories on the archipelago of what is called, &quot;Calanea,&quot; near the coast of California. It is commonly disputed whether to continue calling the confederation of territories Calanea, as it is most commonly known on the planet&#39;s most popular language as, &quot;the Channel Islands (of California)&quot;. However various self-named nations with a superiority complex on Calanea usually debate these disputes with the threats of launching a nuclear weapons delivery at whoever criticizes the name.
