I&amp;#39;d rather not get into detail about this rather nasty hideout of mine. It is a bit extreme of what I had planned to find as a backup hideout in case plan &amp;quot;Plastic Beach&amp;quot; ultimately failed. I didn&amp;#39;t expect civilization, but you get what you got. Might as well take advantage of my situation. I&amp;#39;m sure 2D will be okay with the situation, for the most part...
