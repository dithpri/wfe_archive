===============================================================================================

[i][b]What kind of region is this?[/b][/i]

[i]A moderation-heavy RP region based around the idea of having RPers take up the role of small nations and uniting a region in a world dominated by Great Powers.

Takes place in a custom world and lore heavily inspired by the Victorian and Post-Napoleonic Europe of OTL, though with a few changes.

Interact with the Great Powers, and use diplomacy to conquer your enemies! Or if you so choose... [b]force.[/b][/i]
