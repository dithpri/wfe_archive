Welcome to the Cuddle Commune! We&#39;re a little collective of socialist trans people and allies. We value non-sectarianism, and all socialist tendencies are welcome, from Marxist-Leninists to anarcho-communists. Other than socialism, we&#39;re also big on helping out and supporting our trans comrades. If you aren&#39;t a socialist and are curious about socialism or are an ally, you may join, but if you are further right than a liberal, you may not be welcome. This is a welcoming and safe place for all queer comrades.
