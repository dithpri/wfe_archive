[hr][b]&amp;quot;Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth the future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie! They do not fulfill their promise; they never will. Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people! Now, let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.&amp;quot;[/b] - [b][color=red]Charlie Chaplin[/color][/b]

[b]The Fash are so clueless, and The [region]Antifa[/region] are so kick-ass, that it can seize and confiscate a Fascist region twice.[/b]
