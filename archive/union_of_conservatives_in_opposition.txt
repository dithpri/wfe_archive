 We are a union of Conservatives in opposition to Fascism, National-Socialism, Communism, Socialism, Anarchy, and American Liberalism. We are accepting of all types of Conservatism, Classical and European Liberalism, Libertarianism, Republicanism, Centrism, and Alt-Right adherents. There will be no hate here accept for those we are against. Racism and religious discrimination will not be tolerated, neither will class hate. Proletariats, Middle-class, and everyone else is allowed. If you want, you can run for Senator or Justice, as a Classical Liberal, Old Rightist, New Rightist, Centrist, Libertarian, or Republican. Join the Blue Fleet or Blue Infantry to help us fight the enemy! Good luck, God bless!
