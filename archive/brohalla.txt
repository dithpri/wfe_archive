Welcome all to BROHALLA!  We are a geographically diverse region where ALL nations are welcome!  We are a roleplaying region and are in the middle of setting up our Regional Council.  We prefer that you are a part of the WA and that you don&amp;#39;t flood our region with your other nations (a 2nd nation is ok).  As of January 1st, 2014, the Parliament of Brohalla is up and running, with the regulations and rules to be sent via Telegram to all members of Brohalla.  Following these rules is MANDATORY.  No exceptions.  The Rulings shall be sent regularly, and frequently updated as needed.  All new Nations, please contact Tolmekkia to receive this Telegram sooner.
