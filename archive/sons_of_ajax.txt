Hi!

We are a small region based on the ideas of a republic/democracy.

Why are we better than most regions? We are smaller, which means you will have room to grow if you join us. Unlike all the bigger regions, where all the older nations take up all the space and leave you nowhere to go but down.

Come here to join a small group of people dedicated to having fun!
