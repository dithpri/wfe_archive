[b]&quot;Humanity can now breathe again. The Covenant has finally been driven back. The cost in lives- our troops and our citizens- has been enormous. But freedom never comes cheaply, and now, we rebuild. I promise this to every man, woman, and child on Earth and in its colonies. While we will continue to strive for a peaceful coexistence with other species, humanity will never again allow itself to be the victim of aggression. This is the moment we start to reclaim our rightful place in the universe. The World will change, the Earth will be ruled. Tomorrow The Whole Universe. Countries are fleeing, I will make things right, they will all see, no matter the costs.&quot;[/b]
