[region]The Baltic Federation[/region] is a small but steadfast society of allies and comrades in arms. All are accepted in and taken under our care but we are striving to keep this federation a sovereign region without being controlled by another troublesome region or the World Assembly. We are not fully against the World Assembly but we believe it is not always important to oblige to their rules. This region is mainly to support the growth and development of our allies in arms through military, economic, and political means.
