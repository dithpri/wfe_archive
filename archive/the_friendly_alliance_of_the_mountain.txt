The Alliance of the Mountain was Founded by Minerala and Ondura as a peace treaty between the two nations.  A peaceful Alliance, it shares the resources of the valley that both nations are settled in.

A voting system exists within the Alliance, both national leaders bringing their opinions to the multi-government managed city of Blinso.  They will usually debate on the matter before deciding anything.
