This region was once the headquarters of Nationalsozialistische Volksstaaten, a Silver-level member of Right Wing Uprising. It and others that were part of its network were liberated from Nazi control in August 2014 by The Nautical Brothers and Sisters of The Red Fleet, under whose capable guardianship this region will remain.
