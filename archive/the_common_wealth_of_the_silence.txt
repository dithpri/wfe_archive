I have no clue, but this seems like a good idea. At least at the time. So this is the region, don&amp;#39;t be a douche and elect a delegate that isn&amp;#39;t a communist or authoritarian dictator that will kick people and make the Common Wealth a bad place to be. Raiding and Warfare is up to the members and a vote will decide if and who we attack.  And finally this is a region that very much prefers capitalists and freedoms for the people above all else but frowns heavily upon anarchy and no control what so ever.
