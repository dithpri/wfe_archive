[i]Welcome to the [region]Secessionist Movements Union[/region], where you can freely denounce your former mother- or father-states.[/i]

Tired of being oppressed by an allmighty centralist state with a ideology you can&#39;t bring yourself to agree with? Afraid that your own rich cultural heritage may not be acknowledged enough? Eager to point out the differences to the central state? Fear no more, here is a safe haven for all the Basques, Catalans, Kurds, Quebecois, Scots ...

[b]-&amp;gt; This is currently a private region for a group of real life friends who are interested in secessionist movements, so I won&#39;t accept anyone. &amp;lt;-[/b]
