The Caudine Forks is a vibrant, newly established community, welcoming all the Shenbians. The valley is situated around the muddy watercourse of Shenzhen College of International Education. It is a rural arcadia with fertile fields dotted with lofty castles and mansions covered with untarnished white porcelain tiles. This region was a brave new world, just liberated (privatised) from the despotism of principal Mobsby through myriads of bloody, dauntless Revolutions. Thus, the members in Caudine Forks were free from the wrath of administrators, repressive state apparatuses and any draconian laws or regulations.
