The Caudine Forks is a vibrant, newly established community, welcoming all the Shenbians. The valley is situated around the muddy watercourse of Shenzhen College of International Education. It is a rural arcadia with fertile fields dotted with lofty castles and mansions covered with untarnished white porcelain tiles. This region was a brave new world, just liberated (privatised) from the despotism of principal Mobsby through myriads of bloody, dauntless Revolutions.
