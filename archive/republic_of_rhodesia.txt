Rhodesia, commonly known from 1970 - 1980 as the [b]Republic of Rhodesia[/b], was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe. With its capital in Salisbury (now Harare), Rhodesia was considered a de facto successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia (which had achieved responsible government in 1923).

Rhodesia achieved internationally recognised independence in April 1980; the nation was concurrently renamed Zimbabwe. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
