Welcome to the Republic of Rhodesia!
Sit Nomine Digna (May she be worthy of thy name)
Rest In Peace Ian Douglas Smith
The Republic of Rhodesia was founded on November 11, 1965 with the issuing of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by Prime Minister Ian Smith&amp;#39;s government. For 14 years Rhodesia stood defiantly against the world, and protected her people from the communist terrorists. In 1979 the communist terrorist Robert Mugabe took over the country, and after imposing his dictatorial reign, destroyed the &amp;quot;jewel of Africa.&amp;quot; This region is a living testament to that amazing county founded by brave pioneers, and preserved by courageous warriors. 
RHODESIANS NEVER DIE!
