[b]The Council of the FSE[/b] is now inviting all Empires to the Federation. Which is a council of all Empires, from strong Empires, to small and newly founded Legions. To keep things under control there is a founder, however, his only power is to eject or ban any Empire not compliant to the current laws. All Empires have a say in current issues within the FSE, as well as any current regional role-plays or debates. 
--There is yet to be a founded Constitution. The set Tech Level for the FSE is Future Tech.
