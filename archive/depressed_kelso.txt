When you join endorse YourAverageRedHead
Rules: no slurs, no racism, no hate speech, no spam, no typing undesirably long messages that take up the whole page, 
if you break these rules once, you will be ejected. Twice, and you and your alts will be banned. 
I will write the names of the nation/nations/alt accounts who break the rules in here.
