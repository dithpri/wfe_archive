When you join endorse the WA delegate, only people from a certain town that we&#39;re all from are allowed. Embassies are allowed though, no worries!

Rules: no slurs, no racism, no hate speech, no spam, no typing undesirably long messages that take up the whole page, no raiding, no spamming, no foul language, only 1 nation in WA at a time, no brain rot. If you break these rules once, you will be [b]ejected[/b]. Twice, and you and your alts will be [b]banned[/b]. If you break the rules once and do not break them again for at least three months, you will no longer be on your last chance.

Please, no raiding. Thanks.
