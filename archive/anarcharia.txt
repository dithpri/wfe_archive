[b]Anarcharia[/b] was once one nation, but [b]separists[/b] started a [b]civil war[/b]. [b]Anarcharia[/b] split into [b]two[/b] states: the [b]Republic of Anarcharia[/b] (or [b]West Anarcharia[/b]) and the [b]Dictatorship of East Anarcharia[/b]. Some citizens illegally [b]protested[/b] in [b]East Anarcharia[/b] and [b]most[/b] were sentenced to [b]death[/b] with [b]very few managing to escape[/b]. The escapees declared a section of land at the very north of the [b]Dictatorship[/b] a new nation: the [b]Democratic States of North Anarcharia[/b].
