The Region of Dagon offers friendly greetings and a cordial hand to all denizens of NationStates!

Dagon was founded out of appreciation for H. P. Lovecraft, Lovecraft&amp;#39;s works of weird fiction and the Lovecraftian Milieu (aka Cthulhu Mythos).

Dagon&amp;#39;s role-playing character and its [i]sinister[/i] impressions [b]do not[/b] represent [b]nor[/b] reflect the values, views and opinions of its [u]real-life[/u]  founder.

The Regions&amp;#39; founder regards and welcomes civility, chivalry, honor and noble deeds.

Embassies shall exchanged with friendly regions, even if core beliefs are not shared, as long as there is mutual due respect, absolutely NO appeal to hatred nor intolerance, and at least compliance with forum etiquette and NS terms &amp;amp; conditions.
