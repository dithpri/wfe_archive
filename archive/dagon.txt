The Esoteric Order of Dagon

-- UNDER CONSTRUCTION --

The Region of Dagon welcomes all nations and regions of NationStates.

Dagon was founded out of appreciation for the works of H. P. Lovecraft.

The Theocracy of Dagon, as well as The Fiefdom of Arlyeh, does not reflect the values of the founder, and rather tries to simulate the fictitious universe of the Cthulhu Mythos. :&#128; On the other hand, United Micronations and America Australis would be better attempts to exemplify the founder&amp;#39;s views, but then again, they are experiments.
