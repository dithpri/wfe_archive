Welcome Nation-States &amp;amp; Regions!

[region]Dagon[/region] was founded in appreciation for the literary works of H. P. Lovecraft.

Our region is vaguely based on the fictitious roleplaying Lovecraftian Milieu (aka Cthulhu Mythos), and any fictional [i]sinister[/i] impression [b]does not[/b] represent the views and opinions of its [u]real-life[/u] founder.

[url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=dagon]The Region of Dagon[/url] shall exchange embassies with friendly regions, even if we do not share the very same opinions, as long as there is mutual due respect, absolutely NO appeal to hatred or intolerance, and at least compliance with forum etiquette and NS terms &amp;amp; conditions.

Civility, chivalry, honor and noble deeds are much appreciated.
