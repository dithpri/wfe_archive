The Earth-Moon L4 Point is a position in space where the gravitational influence of the Earth and the Moon counter each other and allow for a stable position for many large space habitats. The L4 point is many millions of cubic miles in volume, allowing for many thousands of space habitats to orbit, but currently is only home to one - Mjolnir, governed by the nation of S&aelig;xryk. Mjolnir is made from the captured asteroid 1999 JM8.
