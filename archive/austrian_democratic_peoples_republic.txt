With no occupation zones, the [b]&Ouml;sterreichische Demokratische Volksrepublik[/b] was created in 1947 and became a loyal ally of the [b]Union of Soviet Socialist Republics[/b], and a member of the [b]Warsaw Pact[/b] in 1955.
The Austrian Democratic People&#39;s Republic was disbanded in [b]1992[/b], a year after the end of Communism in Europe.
