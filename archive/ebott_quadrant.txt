The Ebott Quadrant is a zone of space that a branch of the race: &quot;Monsters&quot; live in.
Its said those who enter this zone never return.
The zone is blocked by a huge energy field, making it so monsters cannot escape the zone, this zone was most likely formed by some of the human&#39;s greatest engineers.
You can come inside the field, but you can&#39;t get out.
The monster kind are looking for the right amount of power to destroy the field, yet they are still looking for a way to get out.
