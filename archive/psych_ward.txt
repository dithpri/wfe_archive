Psychiatric disorders can cripple those affected by them, including myself. I have struggled with absolutely debilitating depression and anxiety for a good portion of my life and will continue to. I was hospitalized this very recently for these reasons (and more explicit ones I cannot say, but I&#146;m sure you know). In the psych ward, I tried to get better but one thing this experience made me realize is how mentally unstable I actually was. It showed me how much of a problem mental illness has become in the modern world. We must raise awareness in any way possible and remove the stigma associated with mental health. That is what this region is about.
