On the discord we have a solo fallout RP and another RP that will be a Skyrim RP once we have enough players

It is based in the Mojave Wasteland
-You spawn neutral to all factions, unless have stated a desired faction
-Everyone starts out with a gun, clothing based on your character, a piece of paper with a note on it, 100 caps
