Specktri was founded by the Pinkie Lands. It has a climate similar to the more Southern areas of New England. The Pinkie Lands lives there because of its opportunity for growing crops, and to live in peace. The name comes from the language of the original population, meaning &amp;quot;Happiness.&amp;quot;

Pinkie Lands controls the land, but we offer a safe and happy land, without much micromanaging. Or, we&amp;#39;ll at least try. We&amp;#39;ll do their best to make sure everything is okay for the rest of the region.
