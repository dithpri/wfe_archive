The unofficial Valparaiso IN NationStates region, the Valley of Paradise was founded originally in 2018 by Biology Education student DE Becker, alongside Gabriel Zormier, Nicholas Cline, Thomas Shomer, et al. This region, sadly, is no more. From its ashes, a new region was born, founded by Biology Education and Humanities student DE Becker and Political Science and Philosophy Student Arthur Krafft. Its requirements are not strict; the main requirement to join is that you either go to Valparaiso University or have previously attended Valparaiso University, or that you currently live in Valparaiso. Beyond that, all forms of nations are allowed and accepted.
