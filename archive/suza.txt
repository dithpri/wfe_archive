The original Westron name for &quot;[i]Shire[/i]&quot; was [i]S&ucirc;za[/i], while the definite form (&quot;[i]The Shire[/i]&quot;) was [i]S&ucirc;za-t[/i].

In T.A. 1601, [i]Marcho[/i] and his the brother [i]Blanco[/i] led a group of mostly Harfoot hobbits westwards from Bree. They crossed the Baranduin and with the permission of King [nation]Argeleb II[/nation] they settled in the royal hunting grounds of Arthedain and founded the [i]Shire[/i]. Soon after (c. T.A. 1630), Stoors from Dunland came to this new land.
