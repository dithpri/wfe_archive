[b][i][color=#ffad16]And one day we will be free again
One more time we will be free again
And we&#39;ll break the chains
That bound us and tore us apart-

Cleansed by the tears of the fallen
Echoing fears of the warriors
Honor and glory will comfort us all
Living alone, dying alone, we make our final stand[/color][/i][/b]
