[b][i]Welcome to Staghorn Pines, heroes![/b][/i]

These woods are your second stop in your adventures with [nation=short]Amber the Far Seeker[/nation] as they lie near the entrance to an ancient dungeon. This forest, however, is currently being guarded by [nation=short]Brun Oakbreaker[/nation] at the request of the Bear Clan&#39;s Elders. Though the Scarcaster is unsure why he&#39;s been given these orders, he&#39;s been told to allow no one near the ruin we will be seeking!

Words won&#39;t be enough to convince Brun to allow us to pass as he is a bear of action. Whichever Clan should score the most points here will defeat Brun in a test of strength and claim the woods for themselves. In his defeat, Brun will go deeper into the forest to train, as the blow to his pride will overtake his sense of duty to the Elders.
