Welcome to [color=green]Angolis[/color]!

Founded in December 2009 by members of [color=green]JEA[/color], in association with [color=green]CAG[/color]; joined by others over time. If you don&amp;#39;t recognize the acronyms, tough; that&amp;#39;s all history now, and nobody cares anymore. Try the NSWiki. Initially, the region&amp;#39;s purpose and ideals were the same as those of its predecessor, but over time we&amp;#39;ve undergone an evolution - or is it devolution? - into a laid-back and lazy - if not quiet - community consisting of both old and new blood. If you&amp;#39;re looking for activity, the feeders are that way; if you&amp;#39;re looking for trouble, the Rejected Realms are that way. If you&amp;#39;re looking for roleplay, try our associate, [region]Atuthar[/region]. 

If you&amp;#39;re looking for casual and often slow-paced conversation...welcome.
