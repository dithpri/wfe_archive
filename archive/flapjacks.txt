We are a peaceful region, think of us as a bear, we do not mind others but never poke the bear. Elections will be held around once a month, anyone in the region can run for leader. If you are planing to vote take into consideration everything except friendship, or hatred. Even though I am the permanent leader it is not like that, it&amp;#39;s just so no one greifs. The real position will be fair and polls will be run every once in a while. Inactivate members are frowned upon.
