Welcome to [b]the Latin Empire[/b],

The Empire is headed by a Grand Master. Other Templar ranks include the Noble Knights, the Knights and the sergeants. Non Military ranks are currently not available. Every nation becomes part of the sergeant class by completing two simple steps: 

1. Flying the Empire Flag on their nation (It can be found here: http://www.nationstates.net/images/flags/uploads/rflags/the_latin_empire__373408.png)
2. Joining the World Assembly (it can be joined here: http://www.nationstates.net/page=un)

Knight ranks can be awarded by the Grand Master for admirable service to the empire and military expertise.
