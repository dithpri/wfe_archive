A region created in the image of The Multiverse, a fictional mythos created by Joaquin Arcino (me (view my work on Wattpad; my tag is JoaquinArcinOfficial)) that serves as a science fantasy haven of creative energy. No one knows about it yet.

Listen, I just wanted to create a region so I could bring some of my writing friends together and have a cool region thing that is part of my Multiverse, since I&#39;m getting back into this game sort of. Otherwise, hello! If you&#39;re just passing through, I&#39;ll see you starside. If you&#39;re joining, may I just say: welcome! You can never leave.
