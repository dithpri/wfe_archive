The 4th States of 1984 consists of co-operating states unnoticed by the big three, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. It does/will consist of mostly radically radical NationStates or radically non-radical NationStates.

Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia. The countries had been focusing so much on the inside, that they never noticed those areas that were insignificant to them. Those paradise isles in the Caribbean? A secret country in underground Antarctica, or a Anarchist State hidden in uninhabited rainforests? Maybe those who hid were different, promoting democracy and making &quot;political acts against INGSOC&quot;, or maybe following in their footsteps, creating an ultra-totalitarian state. That&#39;s who we are.
