On this day, Jumpy&#39;s birthday, no less, I retract embassies with Hydra. McMannia has shown repeatedly that he is unwilling to compromise, unwilling to change, unwilling to be a positive leader in Hydra. As such, I can no longer justify enabling his region. Forcing out Huo and Elfin was a poor decision by any measure of leadership. You will need to find your own jump point.
