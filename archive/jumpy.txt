[B]In memory of all the good times we had in Hydra, I&#39;d like to thank [nation]hydra_soldier_iii[/nation], [nation]wanheda[/nation] [nation=short]tom[/nation], [nation]the_great_wall_of_mexico[/nation], [nation=short]house_of_the_cards[/nation], [nation=short]bendicion[/nation], and [nation=short]varax_omni[/nation]

Jumpy was the tool through which I learned that raiding was about friendship, above all else. Through this region, and the raids that took place here, I proved my worth to myself, above all else. I&#39;ve moved on to other things, sometimes to the detriment of others, which I&#39;m not proud of, but I&#39;d like to thank you all for being so wonderful and supportive. I fell in love with raiding for the first time since DEN. Thank you all so very much. Hail Hydra!
