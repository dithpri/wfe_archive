[b]History:[/b] In 2065, after global collapse, five authoritarian regimes formed the *Liberated States of Authoritarianism* (LSA) to restore order and suppress chaos. The LSA ,centralized power, eradicated anarchy, and enforced ideological unity. Their military, the Unified Vanguard, expanded globally, imposing strict rule and the slogan &quot;Order is Liberation.&quot; Despite their dominance by 2100, underground resistance movements like Free Dawn continued to challenge the regime, as the struggle between order and freedom persisted.
