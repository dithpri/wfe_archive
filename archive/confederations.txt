[B][Region]The Black Hawks[/region] speedily made their way through this region dodging fendas left and right! Despite the opposition, [i]Steve The Birdman[/i] was able to capture the delegacy and claim this region for the bird folk. We followed this tremendous victory up by screwing around NS which was a lot of fun.
