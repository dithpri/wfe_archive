The five modern civilisations of the modern world.

Basically, these are the nations/regions/continents that form each civilisation:

Far East: China

Indian: India

Islamic: North Africa, Middle East, Bangladesh and Indonesia

Subsaharan: the Subsaharan Africa

Western: America, Europe, and Australia.

Some countries dont fit so much in a single civilisation. Examples:

Russia: culturally, is western, but rivalizes the west in geopolitical scenario.
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea: Far East culture, but are politicaly aligned with the west.
Kazakstan: half islamic, half western.
