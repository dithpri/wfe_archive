The United Republic of Free Nations is safe, peaceful haven for all nations of all types. But know that the Republic is founded on the principals of peace, freedom, and equality. No one nation shall have greater power than another. Each member of the Republic shall choose someone in their nation to represent them in the United Republic Senate which carries out the acts, laws, and bills that effectively govern the Republic. The Chancellor and Vice-Chair are not nations but fairly elected individuals that have served in the Senate. Upon joining, each nation must please state the individual to represent them in the Senate. The Founder does not control the Chancellor or Senate executively.
