The region of Cosmic Storm is a vast region. Bordered between a small ocean to the North, a huge mountain to the South, a large, frozen lake to the East and a wild ocean to the West, the region of Cosmic storm mainly lives of armorsmithing, blacksmithing and alchemy. Most of the region is covered in flatlands and has a arctic climate. The region&#39;s landscape is sublime; small, playful waterfalls, frozen lakes and neverending fields of green are just a sliver of the delicacy Comic Storm has to offer.
