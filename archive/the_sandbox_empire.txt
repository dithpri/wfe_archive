We got all kinds of sand: coral sand, glass sand, gypsum sand, silica sand, 
ooid sand, desert sand, lithic sand, mixed-carbonate sand, biogenic sand, 
garnet sand, volcanic sand, heavy mineral sand, continental sand, 
quartz sand, and sand with hematitic pigment.

Sunny, no clouds. Just a bright blue sky above and an endless ocean of sand ahead.[/b]
