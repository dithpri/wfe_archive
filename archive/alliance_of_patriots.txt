[Color=green] Welcome to the Alliance of Patriotism! The home of patriots and great members! Be free to explore the region and decide if this is the region for you![/color]

[color=yellow]This region is a newly found region, founded by [nation]Pruslandiia[/nation]. [/color]

 [color=blue] I suggest you join WA assembly and endorse the WA Delegate. Also listen to the founder, or the WA delegate&#39;s suggestions for the WA vote, if you can.[/color]

[Color=red] We, of course, have rules. If you follow these, then you wont be ejected and sent to the rejected realms! We might add new rules, but regardless, don&#39;t do it if you know its bad!

1. No racism
2. No hate speech
3. No triple-posting
4. Respect fellow members
5. Follow all staff&#39;s desicions.
6. Try following WA delegates&#39; recomendations.
6. HAVE FUN
