However, in this region we would like to welcome any dictatorship that wants to join us, currently our regional government works like this: The Founder, Greater Canada will be able to give titles that give you authority and entry into the council of great dictatorships, where via bulletin board, you can propose bills that must be endorsed by Greater Canada, the founder, in addition to this we are in open opposition to the resolutions of the general assembly on civil rights, that is, we defend the right of every nation to treat its citizens as it prefers.
For now we have no discord or forum
