Hello, new and old dictatorships, this is the league of great dictatorships, a new and small region, but I am sure that together we would make it great! However, in this region we would like to welcome any dictatorship who wants to join us, we are currently working on the creation of a regional government, but until now the founder, that is, I, Greater Canada, will use full powers, but we are open to advice on how to organize the regional government, in addition to this we are in open opposition against the resolutions of the general assembly on civil rights, that is, we defend the right of each nation to treat its citizens as it prefers.
For now we have no discord or forum, although we are working on it.
