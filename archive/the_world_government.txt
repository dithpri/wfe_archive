The World Government consists of over 170 nations ruled by the Gorsei, a strict council of elders residing in the Holy Land Marejois. Each nation retains their autonomy and will be protected by the Marines, the World Government&#39;s main military force, and in exchange each country must abide by the Gorsei&#39;s rules and pay tribute. The World Government&#39;s main issues are involving the Revolutionaries, a rebel group plotting to overthrow the establishment, and pirates, who the Marines struggle to keep at bay (no pun intended). Though the world government faces many challenges and threats, they are still the most powerful military organization in the world.
