Ciao! We are a brand new region which hopes to recreate historic Italy. I am a third-generation Italian American who is delving into the study of historic Italian government, and  I just discovered NationStates. I like the Savoyan Monarchy, as my name suggests, but I also enjoy pre-Savoyan governing. We will prefer alliances with historic places but will accept anyone. Welcome!
