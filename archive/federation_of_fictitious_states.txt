The [color=#8B0A50]Federation of Fictitious States[/color] was officially disbanded on 7th July 2017. At its October 2016 peak, it had 110 nations. The Senate (ex-Senators included Tinhampton, Wisgothistan, The Radical Progressives and Sovankia) legislated on the FFS between October 2016 and Balcones&#39; CTE on March 2017. Their May revival was a false dawn; TRP (who can log into our founder account) has not done so.

After major inactivity, two senators (then out of four) voted to disband the FFS; after United Slavik Republic&#39;s CTE, it became a two-thirds majority (hence the disbanding). We had good times here. Please enjoy this free copy of [i]The Second Coming[/i] by WB Yeats whilst you observe what has been.

Goodnight.
