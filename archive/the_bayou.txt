[b]Welcome to the Bayou[/b]

With flora and fauna in abundance, the Bayou is a place to relax.
There are plenty of spots to hang your hat, plus some great fishing.

Feeding the alligators is not recommended and may result in loss of life and/or assorted body parts. 

New recycle bins just added at the campgrounds. And a some new Kayaks which you can rent. 

Vending machines are located in the shed behind the visitor center.  What goes on the shed, stays in the shed; and please step over your passed out neighbors
