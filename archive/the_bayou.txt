[b]Welcome to the Bayou[/b]

With flora and fauna in abundance, the Bayou is a place to relax.
There are plenty of spots to hang your hat, plus some great fishing.


Feeding the alligators is not recommended and may result in loss of life and/or assorted body parts. 

The Region isnt dead, just resting
