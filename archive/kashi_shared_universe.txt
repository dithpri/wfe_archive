This is an [u]alternate, shared universe[/u], where the nations of todays Earth are non-existant, but they parallels and insperations. In this lore, the year is [b]plus 8 of what the real world would be (2018 now, 2026 here).[/b]

2018 culture would be 2018 culture, yet how do you think it&#39;ll influence your nation in this lore year, 2026? Or what happens in 2020, what would happen in 2028?

This helps to create a realistic, yet freely adaptable nation for a near futuristic setting, with cultures and historical events of the past in our realworld forming nations and stories that impact this greater world.
