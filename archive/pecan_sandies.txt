The Glorious Region of Pecan Sandia, commonly known as Pecan Sandies, was founded by Pygania on August 1, 2020. It is named in honor of the ideal cookie to dip into a hot cup of black coffee- the wondrous shortbread creation known as &quot;pecan sandies&quot;.

The region is known for its religious diversity, being a welcoming home for nations with religions not often represented in NationStates. Despite their differences, the nations of Pecan Sandia do have one thing in common- a strong commitment to traditional values tempered by a reform-minded approach towards minor social changes that are enacted as needed.
