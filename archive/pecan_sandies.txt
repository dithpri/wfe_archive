The Shortbread Region of Pecan Sandia, commonly known as Pecan Sandies, was founded on August 1, 2020. It is named in honor of the ideal cookie to dip into a hot cup of black coffee.

As of May 1, 2024, our region had a mere 213 embassies. At that point after going through multiple governors, [nation]The Free Black Republic[/nation] was appointed to the post. 

Since then, we have found true success as an embassy collector and achieved the following milestones:
500 embassies on July 3, 2024
1000 embassies on July 22, 2024
1500 embassies on December 3, 2024
2000 embassies on December 10, 2024
