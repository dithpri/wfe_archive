This is a military gameplay region that will be fighting DEN when and if they re-open we are spilt into STATES with a regional map
and we also have a state system as now shown:
Dark Green =Full Allies w/ Military
Light Green =Almost-Allies w/ Military
Yellow = Undecided
Light Orange = Almost Against Military
Dark Red = Against the Military
