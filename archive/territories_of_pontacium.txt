[b][i][u]Territories controlled by [nation]Pontacium[/nation].[/u][/i][/b]
Puppet nations created by Pontacium for the history factbook.
There are 4 factions here:[list]
[*][u]Territories directly controlled by Pontacium[/u]: Self explanatory; areas in the Pontaci empire (cities, factories, bases, etc)
[*][u]The &amp;quot;Tribal Laikas&amp;quot;[/u]: 1st Laika faction; operating traditionally, under Pontaci protection
[*][u]The &amp;quot;Soviet Laikas&amp;quot;[/u]: 2nd Laika faction; leading a communist revolution and fighting Pontaci intervention
[*][u]The &amp;quot;et cetera group&amp;quot;[/u]: These are really just weird nations that were made for whatever reason. Irrelevant to actual gameplay/lorestuffs.
