For nations that focus more inward than out. While we are not in threat of immediate war, I believe that in the future we will be. In order for us to be prepared for this, we must have a strong defense sector along with law and order. But in our case as of now (neutral) we must focus on the economy and people the most so they won&amp;#39;t revolt or leave in our darkest hour. I realize that we may not all agree on something, but if we combine our countries strengths and weaknesses, we shall prevail
