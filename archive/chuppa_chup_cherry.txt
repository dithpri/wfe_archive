We are all different people.
We founded this region with the belief of uniting our people and in it. We have shared ideals and wish to improve our quality of life whilst utilising the effects of Chuppa Chup Cherry lollipops. Their fruity natures truly encapsulates what we stand for in this region.

Our faith is in small balls of hardened candy on little white sticks.
May the Lord be with you all.
