Greetings and welcome to the lands of [b][i]The Holy Empire of Old Arcadia![/b][/i]
Old Arcadia welcomes all who are also in the persuit of something more valuable than land, gold or even themself. [i][u]Glory.[/u][/i] To be respected by friends and foes alike. To be immortalised, melted into history for an eternity. In unity there&#39;s strenght, and without strenght there is no history to make, no glory to gain. Under a guidence of [nation]Ramtiana[/nation] and other members of the Senate, you shall gain glory, not only for yourself but for all who are willing to walk with you side-by-side.
[b][i]Ave, True to Arcadia![/i][/b]
