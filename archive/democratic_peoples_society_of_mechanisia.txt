It seems that a more rigorous approach is required. Greetings and welcome! The Democratic Society of Mechanisia greets you! Both the region and the nation. This thing can get confusing. There are a lot of us. There&amp;#39;s the regular Democratic Society of Mechanisia, the various puppet states that were created to ward off invasions, and the one where everyone lives in a futuristic dystopia where children fight to death on live TV. Or maybe not. We&amp;#39;re not sure. We haven&amp;#39;t taken our medication, which reminds me: medical care. We probably should get some of that. 

If you have not submitted now, do so HERE.

Thank you.

Have a nice day!
