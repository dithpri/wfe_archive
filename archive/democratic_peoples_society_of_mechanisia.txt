Greetings! We can see that you are considering joining our nation. Happiness and joy! Simply proceed to kill all babies within your borders, construct statues of Nicholas Cage, and declare your undying loyalty to the Democratically Elected President. Your complete submission to our will only serves to enlighten you! But not too much! It hurts when it shines in your eyes! Remember, you have nothing to lose except all that you have not yet lost!

And of course, have a nice day!
