The Whisperplanes or the &amp;quot;Silent Valley&amp;quot; Is a secluded area, mostly surrounded by large montains in the form of a crescent called &amp;quot;Moon Mountains&amp;quot;. The land is great for farming due to the active volcano constantly spewing nitrogen rich ash from it&amp;#39;s top. It erupts every 5-10 years. Near the center of the valley lies a large lake called &amp;quot;The Mirror Lake&amp;quot;. Many fish and other animals including the &amp;quot;Wasindo&amp;quot;, a medium sized fish like reptile. Surrounding the lake is the &amp;quot;Fantizun Forest&amp;quot;, Home to the Dragon, A medium sized biped flying reptile, and the Winter Fox, a large white fox that hibernates during summer. Near the neck of the valley is a large fresh water spring that feeds into the Laseif River then The Mirror Lake.
