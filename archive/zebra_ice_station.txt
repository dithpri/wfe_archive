[b]Station Zebra[/b] a British meteorological station built on an ice floe in the Arctic Sea, has suffered a catastrophic oil fire; men have died and shelter and supplies have been destroyed. The survivors are holed up in one hut with little food and heat. If help does not reach them, they will quickly die. 

At present in an estimated position of 85&deg; 40&#39;N., 21 &deg;30&#39;E., which is only about three hundred miles from the North Pole. Its position cannot be known with certainty, because of the clockwise drift of the polar ice pack.
