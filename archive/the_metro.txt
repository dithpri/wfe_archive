An official Metro Region emulating that of the Game/Book series Metro (Notable Titles are 2033 and Last Light.)

We are looking mainly for metro themed Stations/Nations in order to enlarge our region. But accept most nations.

[b]Metro is based on a post apocalyptic scenario where Nuclear weapons have destroyed the world and those in Russia who survived had moved to the underground metros in order to stay safe and survive, but multiple political parties have re-risen since as well as mutant creatures that roam the above ground and the metro, threatening the life of all who live. [/b]
Can you survive the metro?
