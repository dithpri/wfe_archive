[b]&amp;#128058; [region]The Wolf Kingdom[/region] covers one of the greatest uninterrupted expanses of plain on the Earth&#146;s surface, sweeping from the Pyrenees Mountains on the French-Spanish border across northern Europe to the Ural Mountains in Russia. In western Europe the Kingdom narrows to 320 kilometres in width, but as it stretches eastward it broadens steadily until it reaches its greatest width in western Russia, where it extends more than 3,300 kilometers. The terrain is flat or gently undulating with numerous lakes and great forests.
