Sicily, the largest Mediterranean island, is just off the &quot;toe&quot; of Italy&#39;s &quot;boot.&quot; Its rich history is reflected in sites like the Valley of the Temples, the well-preserved ruins of 7 monumental, Doric-style Greek temples, and in the Byzantine mosaics at the Cappella Palatina, a former royal chapel in capital city Palermo. On Sicily&#146;s eastern edge is Mount Etna, one of Europe&#146;s highest active volcanoes.
