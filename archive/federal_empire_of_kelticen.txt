Welcome to Kelticen, a region full of tradition, patriotism and brotherhood.
Kelticen is geologically an idyllic forest region with crystal clear rivers, snow-covered glaciers and muddy moors. In order to ensure that this will still be the case in 2000 years&#39; time, our top priority is to produce goods and services that are ecologically sound and conserve resources.
Fraternity is not neglected within Kelticens, where there is a strict transnational duty of defence. As members within the region sign a neutralisation treaty, they are obliged to support only members of Kelticens in times of war and crisis. Breach of contract can lead to the exclusion of the respective member, this is determined by vote. (VETO right is possible)
