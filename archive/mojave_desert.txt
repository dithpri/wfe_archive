[i][b][color=red]The Mojave Desert is an arid rain-shadow desert and the most inhospitable landscape in all of North America. Situated in the area of Southeastern California, Southern and Southwestern Nevada, and in extreme Northwestern Arizona, it borders the Great Basin Desert to the North, the Sonoran Desert to the South and East, and the Colorado Desert to the Southwest. It is said that the Demon God, Lucifer, resides in an uncharted region here. Beware of him, lest ye incur an unimaginable fate!![/color][/b][/i]
