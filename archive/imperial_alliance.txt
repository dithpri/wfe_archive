I am happy to receive any and all new members. I hope to keep this region as liberal as possible, and wish to make it a place where ideas can be exchanged without fear of being kicked out. I will not kick you out based on inactivity, however if there is any inappropriate posts, I will eject you. So, free speech, to a degree. Welcome, and enjoy being a resident nation of the Imperial Alliance
