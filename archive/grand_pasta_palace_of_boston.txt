You are walking along the streets of Boston at around lunchtime, presumably heading to your favorite restaurant. You smell a heavenly scent. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; You think as you turn around. How could you have never noticed this before? It is a giant building, covered in neon lights, with a sign at the top of the massive building saying &quot;Your neighborhood Pasta Palace&quot; as you head in, there are fluffy red carpets lining the floor. The hostess directs you through the crowded building to a lavishly set table atop the second floor. She hands you a menu and walks off, busy with her work.
Specials:
Boston Seafood Pasta (it&#39;ll give you an accent!)
Spaghetti with llama butter 
Jacob&#39;s science experiment (yummy!)
OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE ITALIAN MAFIA
