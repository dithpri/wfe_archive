[region]The Deadlands[/region] are a Daedric realm of [region]Oblivion[/region] created and ruled over by the Daedric Prince of [i]Destruction, Natural Disaster, Change, Revolution, Energy, and Ambition[/i]. 

The embodiment of its creator&#39;s sphere, the dimension is fraught with natural disasters and destructive change. The realm is covered by an ocean of lava, scattered with scorched volcanic islands and ruined structures. Many lesser Daedra roam the realm freely, but Dremora dominate the hierarchy. 

Very little flora grow in the realm&#39;s hostile environment. Burnt grass and dead trees dot the landscape, while Bloodgrass, aggressive Harrada Roots and poisonous Spiddal Plants grow abundantly in the charred soil.
