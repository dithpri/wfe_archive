The Remnants of Omega was once a fully functioning (if boring) region, but it fell into disrepute and eventually crumbled into nothing, only to be lovingly restored by the rather great region of [region]Argantia[/region].

I&amp;#39;d write more, but in truth the region is still fairly uninteresting. To be honest, it only really exists because I decided to refound it on a whim. Jedze III, the original founder and Argantia&amp;#39;s second best evil nation accidentally left it uninhabited after the Halloween zombie event and so it was refounded before he noticed. 

So there you have it. A brief summary of the Remnants of Omega which gives no information about the actual region (which is no bad thing).
