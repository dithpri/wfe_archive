The Remnants of Omega was once a region created by [nation=noflag]Jedze III[/nation]. It was good, if a bit dull but then [region]Argantia[/region] was formed and the Remnants became abandoned. Obviously, we can&amp;#39;t just have this old region not doing anything so we refounded it and made it into a library and museum, existing outside time and serving as a monument to something.
