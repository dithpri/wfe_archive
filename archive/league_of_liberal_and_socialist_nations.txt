A country of social democratic-republics with liberal and/or socialist governments. We eschew all forms of hate, including conservativism, communism, capitalism, naziism, and fascism, and ignorance, such as libertarianism and anarchy. We embrace individuality while acknowledging our similarities and accepting those as well.
