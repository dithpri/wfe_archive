Carcosa is a fictional city in Ambrose Bierce&#39;s short story &quot;An Inhabitant of Carcosa&quot; (1886). The ancient and mysterious city is barely described and is viewed only in hindsight (after its destruction) by a character who once lived there. Its name may be derived from the medieval city of Carcassonne in southern France, whose Latin name was &quot;Carcaso.&quot;
