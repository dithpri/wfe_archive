[color=blue][i][u][b]Welcome to [region]Princium[/region][/i][/u][/b][/color]

[i][b][color=purple][region]Prinicium[/region] is a relatively new region founded by The United States of [nation]The Princia[/nation]. We consist of nations with radically different ideologies and economic systems united by the goal of collective empowerment through political and economic cooperation between all our member states. As a new region we provide a safe harbour to new nations to create their own path with the backing of all our member states and receive recognition for their achievements, instead of being overshadowed by older and much more established nations as in other regions.

All member states are encouraged to join the World Assembly and endorse the other delegates of the region and set their policies in accordance with the monthly regional agendas (TBA). [/color] [/i] [/b]
