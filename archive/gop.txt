[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided that, tonight, they had to [i]go fast[u]!!![/u][/i] Tonight, they raced across the [color=lightblue]NS skies[/color] as quickly as they could! All of them, that is, [color=pink]except one[/color], who was too busy making [color=red]airplane noises[/color] in the Nest, for some reason. The other Hawks flew and flew through [i]so many[/i] regions [i]so quickly[/i] that very little could keep up... except for an [color=blue]oddly colored hedgehog[/color] that was sprinting after them for some reason.
