[i][b]Eggtopia[/b][/i]

A land filled with the most diverse nations and peoples, from the Jews in Columbia to the free-ranging neckbeards in McTed, to the fursuit-sporting folk of Ronstars to the crack-fiends in the backalleys of the Jonesy Tribe, giving everyone in the region the freedom of being able to choose to be microchipped in Columbia, or not allowed to consume any capitalist products in the Country Film Land. The only thing bringing these nations together is the eggs that are left throughout the fields of the Center of Eggtopia each year, the annual egg-hunting event, attended by billions every year.
