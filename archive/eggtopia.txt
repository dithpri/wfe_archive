[i][b]Eggtopia[/b][/i]

The glorious, weed-infested lands of Eggtopia are dominated by gigantic forests ranging from [nation]The Free Columbian States[/nation] to [nation]Racur[/nation]. Closed-minded socialists, money-hungry CEOs and the average person attempting to make a living dominate this region. Each nation is so culturally indifferent it&#39;s difficult to tell where you&#39;re at, although good chances are you&#39;re in [region]Eggtopia[/region] (it&#39;s funny cause that&#39;s this region.)
