The planet of Paco is a large, Earth-like planet that is nearly twice the size of Earth itself. But something is off about this planet, all of the original inhabitants have colorful skin. Take Regurtans, for an example. They are blue. Or Graznians, they are green.

After the Unification Wars between The Regurtan Empire and the Independent Paco Army, Regurta eventually won and took over the planet. However, Regurta could not control ALL of the land on the planet for very long, as other nations from other planets came and took land.

Will you be the next nation to enter the fight?
