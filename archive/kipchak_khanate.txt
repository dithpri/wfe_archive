
Welcome to the Kipchak Khanate!

We all know democracy has it&#39;s flaws. 
It can bring dictators to power by vote, it can impose the will of a misguided majority on all.
So who am I to think that I know better, you will ask.
Well you are right of course, I am only the Sultan of Jetsu, but then again, who are you?
Can I trust your judgement as I trust my own? How can I tell you even mean as well as I do? 

If you mean well, and also if you are a true Democrat who wants to dabble in Despotism, the Kipchak Khanate is the ideal hideout and/or sandbox for you to try things out.
