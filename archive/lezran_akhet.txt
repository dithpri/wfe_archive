Welcome to the Akhet.

Apparently, as he is such a dictator, [nation]Sparkhill[/nation], has banished you from the region. This. This hellhole is where people want to return back to the promised land of Lezra. 

Enjoy your stay, because you won&#146;t be here for long. Either you&#146;ll be given the key back to paradise or will join the tower of souls who have been further bannished to the &#145;Rejected Realms&#146;. *Shivvers*
