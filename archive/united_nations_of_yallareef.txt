The [b]United Nations of Yallareef[/b] is an ideologically diverse region composed of six hopeful and hardworking states. Our nations are built on the foundation of a common goal: [i]to discover what type of social and political theory proves best for the people, the state, and their mutual well-being[/i]. We live by ideologies such as democracy, socialism, constitutional autocracy, capitalism, and amalgams of such philosophies. 

Each nation will one day decide to adopt the more perfect school of thought or use knowledge from it to make a nation they believe could be better. Ultimately, [i]Yallareef is about finding peace and perfection through acceptance, diversity and freedom to create a near-utopian society.[/i]

[b]Thank you, and all hail Yallareef.[/b]
