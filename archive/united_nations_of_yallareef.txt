The United Nations of Yallareef is a small region of an ideologically diverse set of nations, built on the foundation of a common goal: to find a more perfect coexistence and discover what kind of government is best for the people and their wellbeing. Once the goal is achieved, each nation will decide if they want to accept this more perfect school of thought or use knowledge from it to make a nation they think could be better. Ultimately, Yallareef is about finding peace and perfection through positivity and diversity.
