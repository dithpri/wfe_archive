[color=#ff69b4]Sometimes we all wish the world were different, so the NPA decided to make it so! We hopped over with buckets of pink paint and glitter and redecorated the place for free! You&#146;re welcome. Because we&#146;re so nice, we even left out a plate of cookies for you!

Want to join the fun and get even more free cookies? Join the NPA [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=485374]here[/url] and you can have whatever [nation]Konar[/nation] doesn&#146;t eat!
