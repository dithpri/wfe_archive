A region where day consists of twilight, while night; a starless, barren, black expanse. Temperatures are nominal for life, yet the source of this heat is unknown. There is no sun to be seen, thus phototropic plants do not grow. Other autotrophic species which do not rely on light are common. Animal life is relatively standard to that found in most regions, although many have adapted to the far darker environment. Without artificial light, it is extremely likely for individuals loose their way, likely to never be seen again.
