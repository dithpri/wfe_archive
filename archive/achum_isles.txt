The Achum Isles is a group of islands surrounded by a seemingly infinite ocean. The two main islands in the north and south are very rarely united but in this case, Ischin has managed to do the impossible.

The northern island is quite cold and mountainous, while the southern island is quite flat and usually around 22 degrees Celsius.
