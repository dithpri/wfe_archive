The Enchanted forest is a mythical land taken from Once upon a Time. Lush forests and  clear lakes compose this peaceful land. Home of magic, mythical beasts, learned people, The Enchanted Forest is truly an adventure from a fairytale. All new arrivals shall be given a officers place. I would love some people who are WA members!
