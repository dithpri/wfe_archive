Welcome to the Coalition!

The coalition was founded on the 25th of January. It stands as an organized region of free nations of varying government types and associations. With an active founder, this region is safe from any threat by barbarians or rogues. Currently, all political positions to be held are available! If you wish to apply for a position, simply post your desired position in the regional forum, and the other nations in the region will hold a vote by majority rule. In the event of a tie, the founder will decide who should hold the seat.

The Coalition is always looking for new member nations and states. For a secure, and new role-playing experience, as well as a place to host your begginer nations/states, the Coalition is for you!
