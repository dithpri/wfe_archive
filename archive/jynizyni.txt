[b][u]SHORT HISTORY ABOUT JYNIZYNI[/u][/b]

During the World War II, the region of Jynizyni was divided into two separate regions, the North Jynizyni and South Jynizyni.
The North was occupied by the Japanese forces while the South is occupied by the Americans.
After the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese forces decided to leave the region to the Americans as to prevent further conflicts and casualties.
The United States then made a resolution, recognised internationally, that North and South Jynizyni are now one region, making its now official name of Jynizyni.
