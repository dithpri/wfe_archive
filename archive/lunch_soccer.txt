It is time for a revolution in Lunch Soccer. Under new leadership we shall industrialize. We will also revolutionize the system before us. #DrainTheSwamp

Update 2/10/17: Unlike the failed leadership of [nation]Reborn Eorzea[/nation] that preceded us, we will be appointing people to positions to make the government more productive. It will take a few days to get things up and running, but believe me, it will be much better than [nation]Reborn Eorzea[/nation]&#39;s leadership. #DrainTheSwamp
