Did you ever hear the tragedy of Lord Keynes the Wise? I thought not. It&#146;s not a theory the Big Bankers would tell you. It&#146;s a Keynesian legend.

Lord Keynes was an economist of unparalleled insight, so powerful and so wise, he could influence economies to create demand. He had such a knowledge of fiscal policy that he could even stop recessions from happening. The demand side of economics is a pathway to many outcomes some consider unnatural.
