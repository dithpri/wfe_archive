(I was gonna call this region New Swabia, but accidentally called it Deutsche Antarktische. Lol, the internet.)

New Swabia (Norwegian and German: [i]Neuschwabenland[/i]) was a disputed Antarctic claim by Notsee Germany within the Norwegian territorial claim of Queen Maud Land and is now a cartographic name sometimes given to an area of Antarctica between 20&deg;E and 10&deg;W in Queen Maud Land.
