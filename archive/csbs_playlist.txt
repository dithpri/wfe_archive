Hey!

It&#39;s very nice to see you here, I am not really expecting vistors, but welcome!!

Recently I have found it theraputic to make nations and regions that mean things to me,
and I quite enjoy my music.

My taste is rather varied, goes from Punk Rock to Vocal Jazz and many genres inbetween,
And here are a few albums that have a special place in my heart, enjoy :)

I even have a Taylor Swift region, [region]CSBs Taylor Swift Era[/region], as a memory of that part of my life.

Not every album I like/have liked will be in here and that&#39;s okay, this isn&#39;t a full picture of my music taste, and I am okay with that.
