Welcome to the British Museum Reading Room ! 
A world of knowledge, silence, green shade lamps and efficient librarians with bun hair-dos. 

You know the rules : mobile on silent mode, no talking, no eating, no drinking. 
Expired card users will be shot, but pray tell us about a book you read. 

Enjoy your time
