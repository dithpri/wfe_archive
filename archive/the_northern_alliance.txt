[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] had a bunch of homework to do tonight. But instead of doing it, they practiced some good old [region]procrastination[/region].
Now the Hawks are stressed cause they have a bunch of stuff to do tonight, but who cares! We showed them that homework is just a [region]meme[/region], and that dogs and cats both rule (looking at you, [region]cats rule and dogs drool[/region]..smh)
In all seriousness...I got a bunch of stuff to do...help me out by joining [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org]the nest[/url] and becoming a hawk yourself.
