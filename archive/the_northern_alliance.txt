For all those who revel in the ice and cold, this is the place for you! No Frozen songs, though. Those are banned. Snowbirds are also banned and if you know what that means then you definitely belong (unless you are one). The Region&#39;s Animal is the Black-capped Chickadee, which does not leave for the winter, and instead enters regulated hypothermia in order to survive. Which is exactly what we should all strive for. Channel your inner Chickadee and brave the cold!

In all seriousness, open to all nations and eager to provide groups with a difference of opinions. Unless you start spouting Frozen songs, in which case... Well I already said.
