Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun, was built to guard against the Men of the White Mountains in the year SA 3320 by the D&uacute;nedain of Gondor, those Faithful N&uacute;men&oacute;reans who escaped the destruction of N&uacute;menor the year prior. It became the capital city of Gondor in TA 1640. In the year TA 2002, the city of Minas Ithil on the borders of Mordor was captured by the Ringwraiths, and renamed Minas Morgul. It was then that Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith.
