[region=Neutral Nations Assembly] is a region dedicated to the preservation of peace. NNA accepts any nation regardless of political creed, but sanctions can be applied to any nation in breach of international and regional law. The NNA is governed through common dialogue and cooperation between member states, although only WA nations reserve the right to vote on critical issues in the regional parliament. That being said, nations not part of the WA may form committees to scrutinize parliamentary and governmental proceedings, and voice their official opinion during any seating of parliament.
