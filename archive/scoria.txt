Scoria was originally founded in 2012 as a way to pass time in study hall! A handful of us got together, and started drawing flags, maps, and characters to dictate and hail from these notebook-bound countries! While we continue to honor the traditions which inadvertently formed Scoria, the world of the past is but a minuscule fraction of what it has become! 13 years of nations rising and falling, famed leaders, anomalies of wildlife and nature, sporting traditions, and much more!
