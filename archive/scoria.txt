[b][i]Scoria[/i][/b] was founded in 2012 as a near-future RP region, later expanding into a constantly evolving world-building project. We&#39;re a region of worldbuilders, artists and writers, and do most of our shenanigans on Google Drive &amp; Discord. For 9 years we&#39;ve been writing and telling the story of a world, a history across several eras complete with events, characters and conflicts. Scoria is is a series of adventures worth remembering.
