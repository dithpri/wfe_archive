Academica is a region that takes pride in education, research, and just being smart. The majority of Academicans are mathematicians, chemists, physicists, doctors, and other positions that require a superior intelligence. The rest of the population consists of slaves and low-class workers, employed by the government to perform the unwanted tasks that none of the educated citizens want to carry out, such as picking up garbage, cleaning out sewage systems, and making minimum wage. The children of Academica go to school for 12 hours a day, 200 days a year, for 18 years, because the DoE (Dictatorship of Education) wants to make sure that society doesn&#39;t f**k up its future and screw over the entire economy.
