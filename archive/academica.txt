[color=Red][b]Day-Z is upon us once again!
We will be closing our borders the moment the siege starts
Everyone must either kill the zombies or look for a cure
Keep track of the Survivors, Infected and Dead [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=zday_tally]here[/url]
Keep track on the status of the siege [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=news]here[/url]
Good Luck!

***IF YOU SIDE WITH THE ZOMBIES YOU WILL BE EJECTED FROM THE REGION FOREVER***
