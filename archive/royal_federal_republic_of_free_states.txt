[b]Welcome to the [color=blue]Royal Federal Republic of Free States[/color]![/b]

[i]What is the Royal Federal Republic of Free States?[/i] The Royal Federal Republic of Free States is a constitutional monarchical republic, consisting of federally-associated [i]free states[/i], dedicated spiritually to the Catholic Christian religion and practicing politically the principles of good government.

Ideally, a successor region to the former regions of [region]International Republican Union[/region]; [region]Federation of Free States[/region]; and [region]Central Pacific Empire[/region]; founded partially in their images, yet considerably distinct. We seek and find only the best possible nations with loyalty, charity, ambition, prudence, justice, and fortitude as our fellow Free States.
