[b]Welcome to the [color=#3457d5]Royal Federal Republic of Free States[/color]![/b]
[hr]The Royal Federal Republic is a [i][color=#3457d5]constitutional[/color] [color=purple]monarchical[/color] [color=#960018]republic[/color][/i], consisting of federally-associated [i]free states[/i], dedicated spiritually to the Catholic Christian religion and practicing politically the principles of good government.

We are a successor region to the formerly bustling, politically vibrant lands of the [region]International Republican Union[/region]; the [region]Federation of Free States[/region]; and the [region]Central Pacific Empire[/region]; founded partially in their images, yet veritably distinct. We seek and find only the best possible nations, exemplars of loyalty, charity, ambition, prudence, justice, and fortitude, as fellow Free States.
