[b][region]NEO-COLONIALISM[/region][/b]

The geopolitical practice of using capitalism, business globalization, and cultural imperialism to control a country, in lieu of either direct military control or indirect political control, i.e. imperialism and hegemony. The term neo-colonialism was coined by the Ghanaian politician Kwame Nkrumah, to describe the socio-economic and political control that can be exercised economically, linguistically, and culturally, whereby promotion of the culture of the neo-colonist country, facilitates the cultural assimilation of the colonised people, and thus opens the national economy to the multinational corporations of the neo-colonial country.[HR][B]CAPTURED AND LOCKED UP BY NATIONSTATES ANTI-IMPERIALIST FORCES [U][REGION]FIRST NATIONS[/REGION][/B][/U]
