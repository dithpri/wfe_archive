The Grand Alliance of Independent Nations is a friendly and open region where democracy and freedom are our goals. We are a refounding on the previous region, due to the death of our previous founder.

This is an open democracy that was formed to create peace and equality for all peoples no matter their race, gender, age, sexuality and beliefs. We hold elections for the President every 6 weeks and strive for an everlasting worldwide friendship.
