[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were craving some pineapple pizza, so they raided several regions to check. Unfortunately, they only found native salt pizza, which is a tragedy, but it was still filling. If you want want to join the crusade for pineapple pizza, come find us [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]here[/url]! Shoutout to ModGod [nation]Jakker[/nation] for banning all the fendas so they couldn&#146;t chase tonight!
