Here is lovely accepting little stay-over region. Our official language is English with a Brit accent. Our official Religion is Protestant Christianity.  Trying to get out of a region and having difficulty looking for another? Have too many Nations and want to put them somewhere? ALT Region has the perfect little hotel for you! Who knows? Maybe you will like it so much that you will stay.
