Just casual men in black tuxedos.... and maybe a few terminators around, robocop was slain, sooooo....the terminator population is booming right now. Oh don&#39;t worry about the shredder or shrieker, those are for nations who are bad men and women. We also have a repulsive emp, and a super thermonuclear missile, and obviously we have a machine called a reviverator, and these run off a breath of air or quarter. So if you need someone revived, well, you know what to do. Also, we have Amish people to rebuild our farms![b] [i](family guy reference)[/i][/b]
