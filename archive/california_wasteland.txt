The California Wasteland, once the Golden State, is now a post-apocalyptic nightmare. Stretching from the ruins of the L.A. Boneyard to the Mojave Desert, it&#39;s a barren, radiation-soaked land filled with diverse survivors, from scavengers to ruthless factions like the New California Republic (NCR) and Caesar&#39;s Legion. They vie for resources, like clean water and pre-war tech, traded with bottle caps as currency.

Governance is unstable, with the NCR seeking democracy, Caesar&#39;s Legion imposing tyranny, and the Brotherhood of Steel pursuing their hidden agenda. Life here is a constant struggle, marked by radiation, mutated creatures, and violence. Remnants of the past, like advanced tech, both promise hope and peril.
