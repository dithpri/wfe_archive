The Iroquois or Haudenosaunee are a historically powerful northeast Native American confederacy. They were known during the colonial years to the French as the &quot;Iroquois League,&quot; and later as the &quot;Iroquois Confederacy,&quot; and to the English as the &quot;Five Nations&quot; (before 1722), and later as the &quot;Six Nations,&quot; comprising the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora peoples.
