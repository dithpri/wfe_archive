The Pennridge Unified Treaty Organization (or PUTO) is a region of diverse ideologies and beliefs, and we work together for the common good. We all help each other in times of political or economic turmoil, and the opinions of our members are valued. If you wish to join, send a telegram to our WA Delegate asking for the password, and post in the message board your name so we can verify your identity. 

PUTO is currently in peace negotiations with the PNN (Pennridge Nationalist Nations).
