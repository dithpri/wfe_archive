The Pennridge Unified Treaty Organization (or PUTO) is a region of like-minded nations that prioritize civil rights, political freedom, socialism, and technological advancement. We all help each other in times of political or economic turmoil, and the opinions of our members are valued. If you wish to join, send a telegram to our WA Delegate asking for the password, and post in the message board your name so we can verify your identity. Any nation in violation of the three laws of PUTO (protection of your citizenry, protection of scientific advancement, and protection of democracy) will be given 10 days to change course or will be expelled from the organization.

PUTO is currently at war with the Pennridge Nationalist Nations (PNN).
