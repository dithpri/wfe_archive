The Pennridge Unified Treaty Organization (or PUTO) is a region of like-minded nations that prioritize civil rights and technological advancement. We all help each other in times of political or economic turmoil, and the opinions of our membership are valued. If you wish to join, send a telegram to our WA Delegate asking for the password, and post in the message board your name so we can verify your identity.

PUTO is currently at war with the Pennridge Nationalist Nations (PNN), an organization whose founder threatened military action against our members and attempted to overthrow our leadership. The PNN is a home for corrupt dictatorships, and PUTO will pursue any action needed to defend our members.
