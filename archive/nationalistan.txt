Nationalistan is a desert region comprised of several large islands and a continent.  The majority of the region is harsh barren desert with the exception of small patches of lush jungle.  The people of Nationalistan are fiercely proud of their homelands and would fight to the death to defend them.  This combined with extreme conservatism has created a grand, warlike, society.
