The United Empires of the World, still at its height since (c. 117 CE), is the most extensive political and social structure in the world. By 285 CE the empire had grown too vast to be ruled from The Great Empire of Inner Galaxy so was divided by Emperor of The Inner Galaxy (284-305 CE) into a Western and an Eastern Empire. The United Empires of the World began when The Colony of Ogally Boglly (27 BCE-14 CE) became the first emperor of Rome and ended, in the west, when the last Roman emperor, The Empire of Marathon384, was deposed by The Rogue Nation of Spoopy Island (476 CE). In the east, it continued until present day to become The United Empires of the World.
