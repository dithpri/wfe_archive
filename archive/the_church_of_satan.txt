Lucifer is primarily used as an archetype however there are those who revere him as a entity. Satanism venerates the individual, because you are ultimately responsible or potentially reprehensible for your own &amp;quot;moralistic&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;nerfarious&amp;quot; decisions/setiments. Indeed we advocate self-indulgance, but not hedonism or callous self-destruction. Satanism maintains that you should be good to yourself and those deserving of your affection, but never waste it upon ingrates or degenerates! We are an elitist organization seeking erudite, independent, and innovative individuals, not ignoramuses or mindless sheeple.

 &amp;quot;Do unto others as they would do unto you.&amp;quot;
