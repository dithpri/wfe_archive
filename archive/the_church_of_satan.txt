[i]The Church of Satan is an international organization dedicated to the religion of LaVeyan Satanism as codified in The Satanic Bible. The Church of Satan was established at the Black House in San Francisco, California, on Walpurgisnacht, April 30, 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, who was the church&#39;s High Priest until his death in 1997. In 2001, Peter H. Gilmore was appointed to the position of high priest, and the church&#39;s headquarters were moved to Hell&#39;s Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City.

The church does not believe in the Devil, nor a Christian or Islamic notion of Satan. High priest Peter Gilmore describes its members as &quot;skeptical atheists&quot;
