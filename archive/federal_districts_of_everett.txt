The Federal Districts of Everett is a region founded after years of civil war between the founding nations. The people of these founding nations then came to a truce and began to form the society that we have set up as the Federal Districts of Everett. Here, we accept nations o all kinds, and live under a well organized, and progressive regional government. If you want to take part in a newly formed region and help shape the culture of our society, please join the FDE today!!!
