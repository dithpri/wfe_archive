A region exclusively for Murray. Laws and (soon to be) officers are listed below:

1. One nation per person. Spam nations just make the region less orderly.

2. All &quot;Mod&quot; actions (actions by an appointed officer that exercises his appointed authority) must be approved by Delegate and Vice Delegates, unanimously.

3. Most decisions will be decided through polls, to keep democracy. This will include other laws.

4. No chat spam.
