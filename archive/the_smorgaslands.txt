A region exclusively for Murray. Laws and (soon to be) officers are listed below:

1. One nation per person. Spam nations just make the region less orderly.
2. Older nations get higher authority. As soon as possible, I will appoint old nations as higher rank.
3. Most decisions will be decided through polls, to keep democracy. This will include other laws.
4. No chat spam.
