Guided by the desire for freedom and helped by our revolutionary armed forces, [region]Caucasea[/region] has become an independent region. 

After the expulsion of the raxulan troops, the Caucasean Soviet Socialist Republic (Caucasean SSR) now unwaveringly aids the socialist cause to free more oppressed regions from the tyranny of religious imperialism.

All over the Caucasean steppe, the people rejoice as they hear the news of the raxulan defeat. The red flag is hissed in the Caucasean Mountains as a symbol of freedom and independence.

Part of the [region]Union of Raxulan Socialist Republics[/region], captured with help by [region]The Revolutionary Watchtower[/region] from [region]Raxulan Empire[/region].
