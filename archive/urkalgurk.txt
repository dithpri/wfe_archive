An amazing diverse region with a lot of uranium in the hands of children. Several country&amp;#39;s good and bad can be found here. Geographically urkalgurk is shaped like an elephant. The eastern sea contains an archipelago known as the Typolis Islands. The peninsula of Murauagea struts out of the south-east and the central landmass is known as Urkal Major Dispite the fact that there is no urkal Minor. Basically unknown yet still mighty Urkalgurk grows every day. Unknown also is how there is just so much darn spare land. 

Jesus Christ was once very famously quoted uttering the name of this hallowed region. On his deathbed he could be heard, &amp;quot;My children stay strong. May Ga....... U... Uh...... Urkalgurk.&amp;quot;
