[color=blue]Hello, welcome to the land of democracy and political freedom![/color] 

Created by me (Harold I), it has been fabulous to watch a baby region grow.  We are very close as a region, even more so now than when we first started out. I remember making a region that failed. So I made the rebelation and stuck with it. Waiting... until  at last I formed embassies with various regions and got a few nations here my efforts had come to some use. We have had regional troubles in the past, but all is now fine!
Thank you for taking the time for reading our regional factbook, if you are more interested, here is a link to more information!
