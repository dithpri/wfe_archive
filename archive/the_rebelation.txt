Welcome to the rebelation! 
[color=red]Please endorse I love golden retrievers for WA delegate until further notice[/color]

You may endorse 1 other WA member nation only for the reason of how things run here. Sorry, but this number should increase soon.

We are a very close region, and we have a constitution, a regional bank, olympics and an anthem:
