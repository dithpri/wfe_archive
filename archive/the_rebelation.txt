Welcome to the rebelation! We are a strong, medium and independant region, and we strive to get on with our neighbors. We have had a short history, being created in 2012. We are a democratic region, and we respect other people&amp;#39;s views and opinions. 
We have a national anthem, chosen by the wonderful nation [nation]The kingdom of Afalia[/nation]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1pP6K_e_Rg&amp;amp;list=PL06EFB7DC32C87434&amp;amp;index=20.
Our current delegate is [nation]The Kingdom of Afalia[/nation] who has just become our regional delegate, and I look foward to debates from all WA members involving issues raised by both councils.

[u]Harold I[/u]
King of [nation]The United Democratic Kingdom of Harold I[/nation] and the Supreme Govenor of The Rebelation
