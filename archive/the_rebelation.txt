Welcome to the rebelation! 
[color=red]Please endorse Afalia for WA delegate until further notice[/color]

We have regular WA delegate elections.

You may endorse 2 other WA member nations only for the reason of how things run here.

We are a very close region, and we have a constitution, a regional bank, olympics and an anthem:

We wish everyone well and good.
