[b]That&#39;s right! This region has been struck down and robbed by your friendly feathery friends, turned Wild Wild West Outlaws, [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. 

Nothing against ya fine docile natives, but we just wanted them green stuff, scenic landscapes, and the occasional standoffs to pass the time. And sadly, you were on the receiving end of the barrels of our guns. If ya wanna join us and maybe wanna do them feisty train robberies, the [url=https://discord.gg/cbfahneg]door to the saloon[/url] is always open for new misfits. See ya there Junior!
