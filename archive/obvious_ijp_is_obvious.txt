[region]Obvious IJP is Obvious[/region] originally founded by [nation]Islenzka Folk[/nation], whose claim to fame is a short-lived raid on [region]The Greater German Reich[/region] after moderator error resulted in the founder&amp;#39;s accidental deletion. Neither Folk&amp;#39;s raid nor his region survived an update.

[nation]Islenzka Folk[/nation] will be remembered among National Socialists, Nationalists and Nazi RPers for suppressing Billy Collins, William Stafford, Sherman Alexie and James Tate.

[region]Obvious IJP is Obvious[/region] is a protectorate of [b][region]BLITZKRIEG[/region][/b].
