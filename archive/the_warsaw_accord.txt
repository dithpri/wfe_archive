A small region of loosely tied nations, the WarSAW Accord stands united mostly on just a few key issues.

Firstly, nations of the Accord resolutely deny the authority of the World Assembly. 

Secondly, nations of the Accord are not held to any set standards of governance of their populace, barring one exception, as follows. 

Lastly, while debate between national governments is permitted, no nation within the Accord shall impose diplomatic or economic penalty on, nor take military action against, any other member nation.
