[b][region]National Socialist World[/region]

The German city-state of [region]Oldenburg[/region] is situated at the Rivers Hunte and Haaren, in the northwestern region of [region]Niedersachsen[/region] (Lower Saxony) between the cities of [region]Free Hanseatic City of Bremen[/region] in the east and [region]Groningen[/region] ([region]Kingdom of the Netherlands[/region]) in the west. On May 29, 1932, the NSDAP (National-Socialist German Workers&amp;#39; Party) received 48.4% of the state election, enough to put the National-Socialist party in charge of forming a state government and, significantly, making Oldenburg the first state in the united country of Germany to put the National-Socialists in power based on electoral turnout.[/b]
