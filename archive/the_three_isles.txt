Welcome to the Three Isles. This stunning region is renowned for its proud yet environmentally friendly trout industry. We are supportive of democracy mixed with socialism so that every one will be treated well. The official religion is Christianity but non-binary, members of other faiths and any other non-Christian groups are welcome as long as they are not disrespectful of any group. 

I hope you have a great time in The Three Isles.
