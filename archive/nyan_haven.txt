Isolated and hidden from the world as a secluded island, Nyan Haven is home to a small population of catgirls, with a smaller fraction of humans residing alongside them. It is a generally peaceful region where everyone can mind their own business and have a quiet yet blissful life.

(If you truly want to be a part of this region, you should be able to guess the password for it. ;3)
