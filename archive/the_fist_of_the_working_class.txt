This is a region for socialists, people who care about others and who want to make the world a better place, we do not allow capitalism. Why do we not allow capitalists you may be asking, because they support the most destructive system this world has ever seen.

This is a region free from the normal archaic rules about sexuality and not expressing your Ugandan culture that generally come from so called &quot;progressive regions&quot;

You can say what you want in this region, snitches are not acceptable, if you report something to the NS moderators you will be banned, if someone is actually bullying you come and talk to me and I will deal with it

I will teach you de wei, de wei of gommunism
