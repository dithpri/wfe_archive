The Borderlands are a harsh place- you must band together to survive. In The Anarchist States of Pandora, we raid, talk, and screw around- your rankings are considered by skill, not experience, and there are no set ways so govern your country- we all have our own way to govern, and struggle for power in the harsh wastes.
