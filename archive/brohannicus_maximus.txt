Hello, welcome to Brohannicus Maximus. No matter what your political ideologies are you can always feel free to join us.

Map of Brohannicus Maximus:
If you want to be put on the map say so on the RMB and where you want your nation to be in.(don&#39;t make your nation too big) In the future if the map is completely filled up nation might lose land to make room for other nations, but that will take a lot a members which we don&#39;t have right now.(there might just be a second map to fit the extra members in if we do get to that point)

You can declare war on other nations to gain more land on the map however we are not sure how the combat system will work yet, so as for now you can&#39;t declare war.
