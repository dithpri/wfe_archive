[colour=#349bcf]This region has became second puppet storage for me. Its main purpose is to send my puppets if I want &#39;em to CTE. No one besides me can enter it because the password contains [b]REAL[/b], and I mean [b]ACTUAL PERSONAL[/b] info. So, not to dox myself, I am [b]NOT[/b] accepting anyone foreign who wants to store their [b]OWN[/b] puppets here.[/colour]

[colour=#cf1925]Embassies, I, won&#39;t send. But doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t send it. Embassies are welcomed [b]IF[/b] I find it fitting. (Eg. Corv.)[/colour]
