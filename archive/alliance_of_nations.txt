[i]Because the AoN is apparently dying, I have proposed a union between our region, and our trusted ally and friend, the United Kingdom Alliance.  Should this union happen, which it inevitably will, all activities will be moved to either the United Federation of Independent States (UFIS), or another region, perhaps maybe something like the AON-UKA United Region.[/i]
