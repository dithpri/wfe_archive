[b][i]To all nations in the AON:  The Germanic Protectorate of Jaxionia will remain here as an &amp;quot;anchor&amp;quot; nation, to make sure that the region is not deleted again.  Don&amp;#39;t try to send telegrams to it, because it won&amp;#39;t respond.  Thank you, and apologies for this issue.[/b][/i]
