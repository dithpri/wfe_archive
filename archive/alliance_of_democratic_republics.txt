The Alliance of Democratic Republics is a region which is dedicated to democracy, liberty, justice, and equality.

Our region is ran by majority vote by our  member nations.  

Our WA Delegate is chosen by election, and serves for one month, taking office on the first of every month.  Any member nation may serve as Delegate.  There is no term limit, but no nation may serve more than two consecutive terms.   

While we have a founder, they exist only to help protect the region from raider occupation.  The founders will NEVER abuse their authority or strip the Delegate of Regional Control access.

Please endorse the current WA Delegate upon entering the region.  This will help prevent raiders from seizing control.
