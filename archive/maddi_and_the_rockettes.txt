WE ARE COOL...TRUST ME

We are a bunch of steam punk loving teens. Our favorite show is any Japanese anime, but we also are open to any European anime. As far as music goes, Blood on the Dance Floor and Black Veil Brides is everyone&amp;#39;s favorite bands. Those of us that are in school just are trying to make it through the day but the preps just dont get us :/. Like how do you know what Pokemon is? :/:/:/ Our flag pretty much explains everything else you need to know about us (her name is Steph).
