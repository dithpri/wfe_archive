Equinox is currently battling back the zombies by [b]RESEARCHING A CURE.[/b]

We are having a friendly competition with our friends in [region=Spiritus], the region who best survives Z-Day will earn bragging rights and a cookie. (I hope)

Coordinate curing the zombies with your fellow Equinoxians on our Discord Channel for Z-Day!; https://discord.gg/ppXQ8ym

We are also having a Halloween/Z-Day Festival on our forums make sure you join them; http://s4.zetaboards.com/EquinoxNS/index/
