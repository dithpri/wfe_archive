Apologies. Its a real shame that even after all these years, losers like [region=The Black Riders] still haven&amp;#39;t found something more fun in life at night than sitting at their computers to simultaneously click some buttons so that they can, really, write their names on a chalkboard. Kind of pathetic.

 Life goes on in the lovely region of Equinox. Please endorse your delegate [nation=Aequitas-Veritas].
