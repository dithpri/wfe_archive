The Brebinan Official Political Debate region was a region for [region]Brebina[/region]&#146;s citizens to hold political discussions and debates. Now, it is just a region which holds debates. We will host a new structured debate on a different topic every week, open to anybody from one of this region&#39;s embassies. This region&#39;s guiding values are [b]free speech[/b], [b]debate[/b] and [b]democracy[/b].

We accept embassy requests from most regions.
