The Brebinan Official Political Debate region was a region for [region]Brebina[/region]&#146;s citizens to hold political discussions and debates. Now, it is just a region which holds debates. We will host a new structured debate on a different topic every week, open to anybody from one of this region&#39;s embassies. 

We accept embassy requests from any regions with a political theme, except fascist ones.

Accept embassy requests from us if you or people in your region want to participate in political debates here!
