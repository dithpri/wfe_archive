Welcome to Tahlia!
We are the result of a fight between two nations, Axolotia and The Cool Krew. We just want a place to chill while being on both sides, but none at the same time.
We don&#39;t really like to talk, but if you want to, go ahead!

When there&#39;s two fighting, there is always a way to bring two sides together!

Puppet accounts (like Shadonyazal and Shadonyafand) are allowed. Why wouldn&#39;t I let you have them here if I have some of my own?
