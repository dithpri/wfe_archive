A union of the National Republics following the ideology of Habsburgism.
It has no relation to monarchism or a monarchy. It is an ideology surrounding the idea of a nation united by One Blood, One People, and One Republic. Radical Ethno-Nationalism, for normal people.



(OOC: This ideology is supposed to be abhorrent, that is the point, I don&#39;t support this type of ideology &amp;lt;3)
