[color=blue]Welcome to our region! Please endorse [nation]Willing[/nation]. He will be our delegate. [/color]
[b]The next election will be January 24-26. A poll will be posted for people to nominate themselves on January 23. No need to do it on the message board anymore. This will help simplify the process.[/b]

We are a region that strives for peace and prosperity, and although we may not always achieve it, we will as a region hold true to our values.

If you are new here, we hold elections for offices every week(besides executive, delegate, and vice delegate). You are free to join or just sit back and enjoy life as a commoner, but we do encourage our nations to vote in the elections.

Enjoy your stay in the glorious [region]The Norwegian Region Legion[/region]
