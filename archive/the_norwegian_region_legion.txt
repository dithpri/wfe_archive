If you are new here, we hold elections for offices every week or so (besides executive, delegate, and vice delegate). You are free to join or just sit back and enjoy life as a commoner, but we do encourage our nations to vote in the elections. We also have Challenger Cups every two weeks! Make sure to sign up!
