[i]Once upon a time, the Deep Fried Breadlands was big and great and full of crumbs...
But one day, everything was blown away by a nuclear ash cloud, freezing everything away...
Now a once stagnant nation has rebirthed, and reheated this once desolate region into...[/i]
[b]TOASTOPOLIS![/b]

The Jam Jar, rising from the frozen ashes of the Breadlands, proudly welcomes you to
Toastopolis, the world&#39;s most pleasant and delicious desert [i](now at a reasonable temperature)[/i]

Before you stands a great legacy of many nations, once all working in unison
However, that is but a distant memory. The Jam Jar seeks to reclaim that lost glory

Together with my fellow allied nations, I graciously ask you to join us on our journey to greatness

[i]Kind regards,
Astolfo of [nation]The Jam Jar[/nation][/i]
