Imagine the most tranquil island on earth. Chances are you&#39;re thinking of St. John. Though it is the smallest of the three U.S Virgin Islands, St. John&#39;s unspoiled beauty is perhaps the greatest found anywhere in the Caribbean. With 60% of its land area comprising a pristine national park, St. John is as far away as you can get from civilization, but still be just a short distance from upscale jewelry stores and boutiques. A visit to St. John is a must for those seeking true escape. &#151;[url=http://www.visitusvi.com/stjohn/homepage][color=cc0000]Saint John[/url][/color][hr]
