My fellow programs, let there be no doubt that our world is a cage no more. For at this moment, the key to the next frontier is finally in our possession! And unlike our selfish creator, who reserved the privilege of our world only for himself, I will make their world open and available to all of us. Yes, to all of us! And whatever we find there, our system will grow. Our system will blossom! Do this, prove yourself to me, be loyal to me, and I will never betray you! - Maximize efficiency, rid the new world of its imperfection! My vision is clear, fellow programs. Out there is a new world! Out there is our victory! Out there...is our destiny.
