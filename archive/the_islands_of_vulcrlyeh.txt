The Islands of Vulcr&amp;#39;lyeh are a chain of volcanic islands far from any other landmass. To be a bit more accurate, they are a chain of active volcanoes that are in a state of permanent geographic flux. The chain is really one supervolcano that has an open top located at the oceanic pole of inaccessibility.
