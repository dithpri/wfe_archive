Freedom of Compassion is a region with nations that value democracy and equality. Every nation has an equal voice and we promote discussion and debate. We protect the environment to save our Earth and better our living conditions. Furthering our knowledge with science and technological advancements is a priority for us as we understand that any stagnant region is going to die.  We do not tolerate hate and cruelty and we enforce justice. Spreading compassion and love is our first step to prevent hate in the world and is our main goal.
