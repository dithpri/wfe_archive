Founded by the strictest Isolationist nation in the South Pacific, the International Union of Isolationists was originally a joke between the leaders of a few budding nations. However, they soon came to realize that by remaining in their regions of origin, they would be interacting with the world on a much larger scale than if they created their own. So they did. And even though many of its member states are crumbling, horrid places to live, the citizens of the region still consider themselves to be the most prosperous on the planet. So ignorance really is bliss.
