Tyre is an ancient Phoenician city. The original island had two harbors, one on the south side and the other on the north side. It was these two that enabled Tyre to gain the maritime prominence that it did; the harbor on the north side of the island was, in fact, one of the best on the eastern end of the Mediterranean.
