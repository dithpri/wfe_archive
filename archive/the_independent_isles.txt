Just beyond The Rejected Realms is a quiet, and resource rich archipelago, perfect for settling Nations both new and old.  Cast out of your home region by a tyrannical warlord or a bigoted oligarchy?  Never fear, we welcome everyone.  It&#39;s like The Rejected Realms - but smaller and more up-market (the Rejected Suburbs if you will).

Just drop in and say &#39;Hi&#39;, and together we can build a new future.
