Elections are starting! Telegram the Republic of Coldwater if you are planning to run. Also, you will be debating on the forums for a period of one week, before the Democratic Process Begins. Everyone who is running must make an account on the Forums, so I can give them permissions to debate on the forums (the thread is usually locked to prevent spamming)
