The Constitution is almost finished, and we now have a formal government. The WA Delegate is the President, and deals with World Affairs, and he/she can veto laws passed by Congress, but only if the vote is 4-3. The President has a term limit of two terms Congress will be a body of 7 elected by the people every month. A member of Congress has a term limit of two terms, but can run again after another two terms of cooling off. Congress is the only body that can make laws and decisions.
