Welcome to the Council of the Indies and Africa!
Based off the historical &quot;Consejo de las Indias&quot;, this Region values the promotion of mercantilism, trade, capitalism, profits, and orderliness.

Looking for a relaxed, cosy, role-playing Region? Then you are in luck! Join us and further the commercial, political, and diplomatic interests of your colony in the name of your monarch! Just as in the historical Consejo, positions are available to those members, or &quot;Councillors&quot;, who desire more action within the Council or NationStates as a whole!

Remember to always raise a toast in the name of your benevolent King or Queen! Thus, I raise my glass of rum to His Catholic Majesty, King Louis XIV of France! Vive le Roi!
