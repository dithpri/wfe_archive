Millwake is a small, isolationist region that was founded by Steh Encan. We try to avoid external affairs as much as possible, and probably won&#39;t be online that often. If you would like, you can request to join the region, but we have to keep the place on lockdown to prevent raiding. 
(Sorry the description is short, but we have been raided twice and had our flag &amp; description replaced. I&#39;m sick of having to retype the entire factbook entry because some retards attacked while I was gone.)
