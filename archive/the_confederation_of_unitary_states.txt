This Union of Nations is a Pseudo-Confederation/Unitary system were power over the collection of nations use to be held by a single nation, but I can see now that only through direct action by every member can we get anything done. - Eylisia 
 
This &quot;Confederation of Unitary States&quot;
will continue in cooperation towards prosperity and wellbeing of every member nation within the region and though ideology may divide us we must remember that through cooperation.
&quot;We Will Prosper Together&quot;
