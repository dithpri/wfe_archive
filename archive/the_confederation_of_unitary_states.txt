This Union of Nations is a Pseudo-Confederation/Unitary system were power over the collection of nations is held by one elected nation, which is chosen monthly and whom also has to hand Vice-Prefecture/Premiership down to the second most voted nation in the primary election without exception.
 
This &quot;Confederation of Unitary States&quot;
will continue in cooperation towards prosperity and wellbeing of every member nation within the region and though ideology may divide us we must remember that through cooperation.
&quot;We Will Prosper Together&quot;
