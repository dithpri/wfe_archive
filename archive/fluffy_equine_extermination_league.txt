The  Fluffy Equine Extermination League is an organization of Exterminators, environmentalists, scientists and sentient lawn machinery devoted to the destruction of Fluffy ponies. From their secret, though conveniently well marked, basement lair; they fight a never ending and singularly ineffective battle to save the planet from the fluffy menace.
