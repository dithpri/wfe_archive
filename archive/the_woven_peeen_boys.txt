The founder of The Woven Peen Boys, [nation]Martysiphus[/nation], has near absolute power over the region. They have not chosen a WA Delegate or started a voting session voting for one. Our nation with the highest amount of endorsements, [nation]Economiss[/nation], is most likely to be the WA Delegate, despite them only having one endorsement from [nation]Tratyphus[/nation]. Recent polls have been placed to regulate the timing of peen placement. The poll concluded results to change peen placement weekly on 3-12-17 with three votes. This has yet to be put into place.
