We got all kinds of sand: coral sand, glass sand, gypsum sand, silica sand, 
ooid sand, desert sand, lithic sand, mixed-carbonate sand, biogenic sand, 
garnet sand, volcanic sand, heavy mineral sand, continental sand, 
quartz sand, and sand with hematitic pigment.

[b][i]Weather forecast[/i]
Sunny, no clouds. Just a bright blue sky above with a lone black hawk searching for prey. An endless ocean of sand ahead and among the dunes a small lily. Blooming like rooted in the richest soil. Defying the harsh conditions of the desert.[/b]
