[b] [nation]K0rr1ban[/nation] the birthplace of the Sith Empire, ravaged by war and because of this left the homeworld in shambles. Millions of Sith managed to migrate to [nation]Zi0st[/nation], the new capital of the Sith Empire. In a matter of months the Sith manage to take back [nation]K0rr1ban[/nation], and the homeworld seems to be developing slowly. After a year the Sith decide to seek out new worlds to conquer, thus taking control of [nation]Mandal0re[/nation] and [nation]Krayiss Two[/nation]. Which became the supporting columns of the empire. Now the empire seeks new lands to conquer and new nations to join the dark side.[/b]
