In the Peninsular War of the Napoleonic campaigns, the Battle of Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a serious setback for the French, and a mighty setback for Salamanca, whose western quarter was seriously damaged. The battle which raged that day is famous as a defining moment in military history; many thousands of men were slaughtered by cannon fire in the space of only a few short hours. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
