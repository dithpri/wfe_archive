[b]Salamanca[/b] is a city in northwestern Spain that is the capital of the Province of Salamanca in the community of Castile and Le&oacute;n. The city lies on several hills by the Tormes River. Its Old City was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.

In the Peninsular War of the Napoleonic campaigns, the Battle of Salamanca, fought on 22 July 1812, was a serious setback for the French, and a mighty setback for Salamanca, whose western quarter was seriously damaged. The battle which raged that day is famous as a defining moment in military history; many thousands of men were slaughtered by cannon fire in the space of only a few short hours. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
