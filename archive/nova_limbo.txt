A region for [nation]Khalite[/nation]&amp;#39;s puppets. 
It is a bleak and desolate place, of infinite white sands stretching in every direction, of endless starlit twilight absolving any sense of time, and waking dreams to warp the perception of reality.

[color=red]Nova Limbo is a prison of the mind, body, and soul. Though you hunger, though you thirst, there is no death. All ye who enter here, you are truly damned.[/color]

Other members of [region]The Coalition of Governments[/region] may use this region to store puppets, if they receive permission.
