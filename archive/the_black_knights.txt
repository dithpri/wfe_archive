Welcome one and all, to the Black Knights! We are a small region, born of the need for power. All like-minded nations are free to join. We do not seek power for ourselves, but for our people. We are not cruel, nor cowardly. We raise our militaries to protect, not to conquer. We set laws not to oppress, but to combat crime. We seek power in a quest for a peaceful world. Those with power, fear us! Those without, join us! We, the Black Knights, shall one day stand in judgement of the world!
