The Southern Pacific Alliance is a group of The South Pacific nations which broke away from the region and formed their own region in the Pacific Islands and beyond! We hope to gain some nations with a strong military and many people so our region can grow and prosper, although we also need more industry. The regions nations enjoy peace and prosperity within each other, although tensions have been rising between the sub-regions of Australasia and  Southern Asia- Singapore. We hope to see you join our region soon, and will welcome you dearly! Join today, in The South Pacific Alliance!
