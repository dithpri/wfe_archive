It is the year 2087, and the many races of the galaxy have finally reached into the void between stars, ready to expand.

Some have already met each other.

Some have remained in their solar systems for now.

And some have even began military conquest.

Which will you be?

The peaceful negotiator republic? The violent &quot;shoot first ask questions later&quot; empire?

Or both?
