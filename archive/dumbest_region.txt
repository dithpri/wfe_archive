[b]Atomic Fire and the ever living torment full Flames of Gehinnom[/b]

[i]It is still unknown when exactly the Great Nuclear War started and all of the old world that is known is when the dust of cities tumbled to the floor but even as time passed the reckless advance of civilizations continued and more nations are rising out of the atomic and melted wastes into a shattered, cracked, and dusty world. A large amount of the world is of course still suffering from disease, pain, and deep lacerations. The ground still seems to almost have a ghoulish glow and the air burns to breath as radiation remains an issue ever present in surviving society.[/i]
