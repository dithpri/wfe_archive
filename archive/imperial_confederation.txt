The [b]Imperial Confederation[/b] is a decentralized elective monarchy composed of several sovereign, multi-ethnic territories. The power of the [b]Imperial Emperor[/b] is limited, and while the lords of the Confederation owe the emperor their allegiance, they also possess an extent of privileges  that give them [i]de facto[/i] independence within their territories.
[hr]A [b]Diet of Electors[/b] may convene anytime to elect a new emperor from among their peers, insuring that the emperor cannot abuse his office. [b]Prince-Electors[/b], and subsequently, [b]Imperial Emperors[/b] must be members of the [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url][/b]. Lords who are not part of this international assembly are disqualified from becoming electors or emperor.
