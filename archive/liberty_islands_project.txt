Do you believe that adults have the right to make their own decisions about their own lives? Do you want to live in a place where adults are treated as adults? Where people take responsibility for their own actions, lives, and dealings with others? Where community is genuine and voluntary? Where your rights are fully respected, provided only that you equally respect the rights of others?

If you answered &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; to these questions, then the Liberty Islands Project is the place for you!
