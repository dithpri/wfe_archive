[b]&quot;The body is a temple; the sword, a prayer.&quot;[/b]

In the heart of this Dominion, the old faith of strength and grace endures. Here, nations gather to refine themselves through struggle and art, steel and sunlight. We reject the cowardice of comfort &#151; for beauty demands sacrifice.

The Protectorate of Sun and Steel extends its will to all who seek transcendence through discipline. Glory is not inherited. It is forged.
