[i]Bienvenue au Dominion de Sayville[/i][/color][hr][hr][color=#FDC82F]Founded on February 23, 2020, the [b][region]Dominion of Sayville[/region] (DOS)[/b] is a French-themed [url=https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Aspen]commonwealth and devolved subject[/url] of the [b][url=https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Aspen_Empire]Kingdom of Powhatan[/url][/b] located in the US state of New York (this region hosts government officials who have NS accounts). The Dominion is reigned over by [b]His Majesty The King of Powhatan[/b], represented by a (largely ceremonial) [b]Governor-General[/b]. However, most power is held by an elected Prime Minister and Executive Council (i.e. the DOS&#39;s cabinet/legislature).
