In the absence of any other World Assembly members, [nation]Qualvista[/nation] is hereby declared Acting Regional Delegate, until such time as a Delegate may be elected. Entreaties may be made to Qualvista on behalf of other member states.

All applications to join the Republic shall be declined unless representatives are previously known to member regions.
