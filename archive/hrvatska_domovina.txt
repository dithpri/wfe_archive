Hrvatska Domovina is a vast and naturally wealthy region. Abundant in natural resources, it is the home of Croats, an old European nation. Migrating to modern day Hrvatska, the Croats brought with them a deep understanding of how to care and nurture the land. They were also a well established elite warrior class, fiercely patriotic yet peaceful people.
