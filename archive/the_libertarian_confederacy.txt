We are a collection of different nations that hold ideals of social and economic freedom near and dear to our hearts. We support nations that have free election processes and respect the individual rights of each one of their citizens to live privately and trade freely. 

We are inclusive of many different variants of Libertarianism, so just because your views on certain subjects differs from another nation&#39;s does not mean that you are not welcome. Consider this a free zone in which you can discuss and debate with others without fear of ridicule.
