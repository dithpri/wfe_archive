It&#39;s so nice &#39;n&#39; new here. Oh, and we just learned apostrophes can&#39;t be in our region&#39;s name. Spaces of &quot;T Saulka H&quot; will do in lieu of apostrophes of &quot;T&#39;Saulka&#39;h&quot;.

Oh! We tried to agree on a flag based off all of our national animals, but couldn&#39;t make hyenas, jellyfish, octopus and crows all look normal together so we just added a solid black flag.
