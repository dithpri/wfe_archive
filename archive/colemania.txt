The region of Colemania was founded following the long and drawn out conflict which established the Authoritarian leader: Coleman.  Since the conflict, his empire has worked tirelessly to show the world that a form of totalitarianism is possible as long as the people are kept in the loop and the government does not infringe upon all freedom.  He also practices tolerance for other nations within the region and allows them to keep a certain level of autonomy as long as it does not threaten the stability of the region as a whole.
