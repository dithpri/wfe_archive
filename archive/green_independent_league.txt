[color=red][b]NOTICE: This region, some time in the next month or so, will be used as a training ground for the Enadian Armed Forces. Do not be alarmed at the sudden influx of seemingly suspicious characters. They are friendly and do not wish to cause harm of any sort. Thanks for understanding ambassadors![/b][/color]

*I have a backup copy of the factbook on hand, EUF Commander, so please feel free to change this WFE as you see fit as a sign that you have completed the training mission. Also, you may wish to change the flag.
