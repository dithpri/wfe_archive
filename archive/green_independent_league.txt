[b][i]In recent days, seeing the condition in my former region, I felt the calling to go back, run for office and attempt to help it in the way that I see most fitting. Therefore, I am locking down this &quot;foreign tie&quot; for the time being and will leave a puppet in my place to keep the region from C.T.E.-ing. If I win, this region will possibly lay dormant for the next 3 months. If I don&#39;t win, I will come back then, I promise. Thank you for understanding diplomats, ambassadors, and prospective &quot;Greenies&quot;![/b][/i] - [nation]Green Africa[/nation]
