[*]If you are interested in the Presidium or WA Delegacy, please contact the Founder.
[*]If you wish to join R/D exercises as a &quot;Greenie&quot;, all the GIL asks is that you refrain from obvious affiliation with this region. We have no military and do not reward for tours of duty or anything of the sort.
[*]We are truly independent and will establish embassies with anyone who supports democracy and reciprocates the offer.

This is a Semi-Direct Democracy based on the [b][url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vvHtifT1Ggu4rXUOppK8nQu4M7L9WlFziQ_9UFqMi8o/edit?usp=sharing]Green African Constitution[/url][/b] and the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=green_africa/detail=factbook/id=1069603]Carthage Manifesto[/url].
