[b][u][color=blue]American[/color] Resistance [color=red]Movement[/color][/u][/b]

We are the People of the United States. We are fed with our Federal Government trampling over our Constitutionally-given rights. The Founders would be ashamed of what we have become. We have let, faceless, special interest groups take control of our currency through the &amp;quot;Federal&amp;quot; Reserve. Republicans and Democrats spend us into oblivion with failed, overreaching nanny-state programs and imperialist wars. They have stripped away our national sovereignty, and are letting us be taken over by faceless, international globalist agendas. [i]They[/i] erode our freedoms, attempt to disarm us, in order to look after their own hides. But NO MORE!. We will fight for our [b][color=blue]Constitution[/color][/b] and [b][color=red]our Republic[/color][/b]!
