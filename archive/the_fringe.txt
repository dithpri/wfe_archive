The Fringe has a very varied biosphere. With lush forests, sandy deserts, long plains, and ginormous mountains. This is the only known land not taken by the Te&amp;#39;Chan. After their invasion from the south all known nations were forced to flee to here or be conquered. The only reason the Te&amp;#39;Chan haven&amp;#39;t invaded here too is because they&amp;#39;re currently engaged in a bloody clan war and haven&amp;#39;t reunited yet.

Nevermind, THEY&amp;#39;VE FOUND US!
