The Sovereign Allied Borderlands of Sabr (pronounced &quot;SABE - uhr&quot; like the sword) is a beautiful coastal region that lies between the Sea of Frequently Disappearing Merchant Vessels and The Generic Mainland Regions. Millions of Sabrians live peacefully in beautiful communes or in constant fear for their lives in squalor, depending on who you talk to. We humbly invite you to visit us and learn more about our people, but please do not feed the homeless around Citrusia Ammrentia City Airport. It discourages them from attaining real employment.
