The Sovereign Allied Borderlands of Sabr (pronounced &quot;SABE - uhr&quot; like the sword) is a beautiful coastal region that lies between the Sea of Frequently Disappearing Merchant Vessels and The Generic Mainland Regions. Millions of Sabrians live peacefully in beautiful communes or in constant fear of their lives in squalor, depending on who you talk to. At the time of its inception, Sabr has boasted the prestigious title of &quot;Newest Region to exist&quot;, and exercises military force to maintain its title against any new regions that would threaten it.
