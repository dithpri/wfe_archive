Hello World,

Our region is constituted of nations ruled and controlled by Political Scientists. We wish to observe, study and learn from the world and it&#39;s World Assembly. However, we will also judge and vote in the World Assembly accordingly.

This is a community of Political Scientists where we can discuss and analyze current events and theoretical debates on WA acts.

Do you have a degree in Political Science, or are you currently studying Political Science? Let me know and I&#39;ll give you the password.
Are you from another region and do you need the help of people with actual Political Science degrees on issues within your (RP/Sim) nations/regions/discords? Contact us!
