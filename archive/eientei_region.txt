Welcome to the Eientei Region!

As a friendly welcome, we all extend our thanks to you - fellow nation in viewing us if you have ever looked us up or, just found it and got interested!

So, what is the Eientei Region all about and what do we do?

This is where many of the people gather around and just do the plain most random of things. While maintaining the most random of things, we assure that this would rather be fun - than... suppose to say... bad?

THAT, in a nutshell is our region.
