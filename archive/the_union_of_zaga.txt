Welcome to The Union of Zaga

This Union is exclusively for the use of The Zaga Men, but we are a friend to all

We have a common currency, the Zaga Credit, which can be used by any of our member states but is optional. The countries that use this currency are known as the Zaga Zone

Please feel free to message the United Federation of Territories if you have any queries

And don&#39;t forget, it&#39;s immoral to tax people to fund orphanages
