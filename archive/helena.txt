To be honest, you can&amp;#39;t dispute one of the gorgeous names in the whole world. This region is for all the Helenas in the world, which is why it&amp;#39;s by invite.

However, please don&amp;#39;t get annoyed by the raiders. As brave as [nation=Minoa] may be (thanks to her for letting me use her Mac for this), we have more cunning tricks up our sleeve to make NationStates a little more less demanding.

And then again, I the founder&amp;#39;s British: what else do I expect: an escalation in good ol&amp;#39; moaning?
