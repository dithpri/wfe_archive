The Russo-American Axis(RAA) is a union of the Imperialist Republic of Russia and the North American Accord. The Axis was created after the Russian Federation attempted to covert back to Communism. The people of Russia rebelled against the Communist government to establish a Democracy. With aide from the Accord, the people were able to overthrow the Totalitarian government. The two nations signed a pact at Anchorage Alaska,now the capital of the Axis, to form a alliance to spread Democracy and stamp out Communism. The Axis has also taken in other nations that have overthrown their Communist government such as, China, Cuba, and Korea.
