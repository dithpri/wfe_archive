It is the dawn of the 23rd century, however humanity lives in a perpetual night.

The Earth is dominated by a sole dystopian superpower, which is [nation]Novaceus[/nation]. Inside Novaceus, the people have been completely molded to perfectly fit the needs and wants of its oppressive rulers, who govern the nation, and most of the world, proclaiming themselves to be gods. These false gods live in the utopian lunar megalopolis of [b]Aether[/b], detached from the rest of humanity. 

The world outside of Novaceus too is a constant nightmare. Living in a medieval-like state, the people suffer through hunger and extreme poverty, while living through perpetual warfare.
