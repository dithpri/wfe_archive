It is the dawn of the 24th century, however humanity lives in a perpetual night.

The world is largely in post-apocalyptic ruin, beset by never-ending wars, famines, and widespread extreme poverty. Much of the world is owned and run by men who deem themselves to be gods, living on a series of artifical red rings that surround the blue planet. The highest of such live in the utopian lunar city of [b]Aether[/b], and led by the God of all Gods, [b]Caelyre[/b].

Meanwhile, on Earth, vast fascistic superstates such as [nation]Novaceus[/nation] and [nation]Wagertia[/nation] dominate the thousands of tribes, kingdoms, and dictatorships that populate the world, yet, all are run by the same men worshipped as gods.
