Oh look at what we have here, some folks over at [region]The Anti Fascism Alliances[/region] are attempting to attack the proud region of [region]J o J[/region], this won&#39;t do. First, they attempted to attack us by refounding a spelling error, then they tried again when they took one of our former resident&#39;s abandoned projects. Both of these are laughable failures of &quot;attacks&quot;, and so now the professionals will get to work. This time, I found a region they apparently had been raiding with, so now I exterminate it for good.
