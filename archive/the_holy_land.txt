The Holy Land is a term which in Judaism refers to the Land of Israel. Jews as well as non-Jews have traditionally referred to this area as &amp;quot;Palestine&amp;quot;, as in the 1759 map which calls it &amp;quot;The Holy Land, or Palestine &#133; (with) the Ancient Kingdoms of Judah and Israel in which the 12 Tribes have been distinguished.&amp;quot;

The term is also used by Muslims and Christians to refer to the area between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea i.e. it includes modern Palestine as well as Israel. --Wikipedia.com
