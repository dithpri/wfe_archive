A region founded on the most important rights of Men everywhere; free markets, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and civil rights for all Men. The Holy Land is a region that disallows an authoritarian government to watch over you. This region of the world is Divinely inspired and is aptly named The Holy Land because all Men, religious, agnostic, secular or atheist, are blessed with inherent unalienable rights, endowed to them by their Creator.
