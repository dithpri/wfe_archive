The United Peoples&#39; Utopian Nations are a collective of nations who come together to democratically and civilly decide on ways to oppress their people and strive for supreme global power.

They are lead by their fearless (*ahem*) leader, Samuel Anthony who dictates what to do and when, whilst Ryan flirts with redhead saxophonists. The Utopian Nations are fueled by the rush of crushing nearby regions and oppressing the people, remember:

OPPRESSION=SUCCESSION
