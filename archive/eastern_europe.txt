[b]This region has been temporarily captured by the combined might of the [color=green][region]Europeia[/region]n[/color] [color=blue]Republican[/color] [color=red]Navy[/color] and its valued allies [region]The North Pacific[/region] &amp;amp; The United Imperial Armed Forces of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region], and [region]Albion[/region]!

Our sincere thanks goes out to The Imperial Sovereign Realms Army of [region]Osiris[/region] &amp;amp; [region]Balder[/region], [region]Mazeria[/region], as well as [region]Equilism[/region] for their generous reinforcement of this operation.

We heard that Mila Kunis was somewhere over here. We&amp;#39;ll be on our way as soon as she is located and delivered to President Kraketopia&amp;#39;s private chambers. All entering the region are required to telegram [nation]Tyler Farr[/nation] with their identity and affiliation or face ejection.
