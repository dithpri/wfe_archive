[b]Eastern Europe[/b] is a region with a rich and complex history, and is the birthplace of both polka and the pioneers of international socialism. Our men are acknowledged the world over as superior chess players and our technology is paving the way for an electric car for the people.

From tsars and revolutionaries to modern politics, from monarchies, socialists and democracies, Eastern Europe accepts all nations.
