Eastern Europe is open for business!  If you or your primary nation got ejected by [nation]Maricoen[/nation]&#39;s invasion forces, [i]and you were a resident of Eastern Europe [b]before[/b] they arrived in April of this year[/i], please telegram [nation]Bronstein[/nation] for the regional password.  We will slowly rebuild the region from within until our beloved [nation]Mother Bear[/nation] returns from hibernation.

Even in these trying times, it&#39;s yet another beautiful day in [region]Eastern Europe[/region]!
