[color=blue][b]Welcome to the Trinitairan Provinces![/b][/color]

[b]Now under the permanent control of the [color=blue]Drachenritter[/color] and the [color=blue][i]Drakonian Empire[/color]![/b][/i]

[color=lightblue]This region was founded and run by the former nation of [i]Utopius Maximus[/i], but now it and its days of power are over. The region now stands as the first conquered territory of the rising[/color] [b][i][color=blue]Drakonian Empire[/color][/b][/i][color=lightblue].[/color]

[color=lightblue]Out of respect for the former leader and the mercy of[/color] [b][color=blue]His Nightmarish Excellency[/color][/b][color=lightblue], who currently reigns from the throne of [b]Schweigenreich[/b], the Trinitarian Provinces, while functioning as a Drakonian outpost, will retain its nature of being open to all so long as they do not oppose[/color] [b][color=blue]His Nightmarish Excellency&#39;s[/color][/b][color=lightblue] authority.[/color]

[b][color=blue]Order of the Day:[/color] [i]All WA nations are to endorse [nation]Schweigenreich[/nation]![/b][/i]

[b][i][color=blue]For the Might of Drakonius![/b][/color][/i]
