This region was founded and run by the former nation of [color=red]Utopius Maximus[/color], but now it and its days of power are over. The region now stands as the first conquered territory of the rising [b][color=blue]Drakonian Empire[/color][/b].

Out of respect for the former leader and the mercy of [b][color=blue]His Nightmarish Excellency[/color][/b], who currently reigns from the throne of [nation]Schweigenreich[/nation], the Trinitarian Provinces, while functioning as a Drakonian outpost, will retain its nature of being open to all so long as they do not oppose [b][color=blue]His Nightmarish Excellency[/color][/b]&#39;s authority.
