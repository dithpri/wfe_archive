The [region]International Union of Workers States[/region] (IUWS) was founded by two socialist nations, [nation]Krasniya[/nation] and [nation]Czervenika[/nation] as a solution to rebuilding their economies after near annihilation from a large, fascist empire, which was hell-bent on destroying the world and killing any people in it who supported Socialism or Communism, or as a matter of fact anyone they didn&amp;#39;t like the look of.

The creation of the IUWS was immediately beneficial for both nations. It provided both nations with the means to share resources and technology to rebuild their economies to a state even better than that of before the Great War. The IUWS is now openly promoting itself to other Socialist and Communist nations.
