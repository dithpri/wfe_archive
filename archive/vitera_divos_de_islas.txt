In the year 206 the island cluster country of Sirke Tare was founded by twenty people who were led there when their boat sank. The twenty were Jafets, people who know exactly what happened in the first years of the world. They were thrown from their livelihood in Egypt when they contradicted the Pharaohs&#39; description of what happened. At this point in time the only people who are allowed to live In Sirke Tare are the few ancestors of Jafet, Adam, the first person on the planet&#39; son. When they moved onto the islands and made a home of it, they split into ten groups of one man and one woman and they would populate that island. Now all the islands are inhabited by their children and grandchildren.
