AHA! I used to own Cydonia but they wouldn&#39;t give it back so now I have CONQUERED THE MOON. Just like that other Irish guy! It&#39;s mine until I inevitably forget about this and somebody else takes the name for clout. THURSDAY IS TAPIOCA PUDDING DAY, OR ELSE! I won&#39;t be partaking and neither should you. All are welcome, naturally, but when I die THIS PART OF THE MOON DIES.

It&#39;s the moon. Live with it.
