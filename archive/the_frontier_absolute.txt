A large uncharted land with a constantly expanding map, nations spread about, colonies made, much much land undiscovered. 

We are a role playing group who operates off of a forum (Soon to be posted)
We are only restrictive to incredibly high-tech nations, everything from barbaric tribes to fascist republics can be found here.

We use role play populations, and have an honor code about all of the good stuff related to land forming.
