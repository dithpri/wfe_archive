[b]St. Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.
Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil.
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,
and do thou,
O Prince of the heavenly hosts,
by the power of God,
thrust into [region]hell[/region] Satan,
and all the evil spirits,
who prowl about the world
seeking the ruin of souls.[/b]
