[color=red]Cyclops woman got one eye in her head
mascara-clotted vision she is fed
cyclops woman can&#39;t see nothing at all
she got a pin-prick-spiral hols
she can&#39;t see nothing, nothing at all
she can&#39;t see nothing, nothing at all
cyclops woman dying in her shell
guilt got her trapped in nailed in well
cyclops woman is the eye of the world
who&#39;s reflection is the retina?
she can&#39;t see nothing, nothing at all
she can&#39;t see nothing, nothing at all
dialate, dialate[/color]
