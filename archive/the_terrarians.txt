A group of highly committed Terrarians, who are well prepared (and armed), and who are very conscious of the importance of the affect on the Environment (by the cursed Corruption and Crimson).

We are looking for new recruits! We are also looking to ally with other regions.
People looking for the Position of Delegate of The Terrarians may apply for the spot.

May we rid our great region of the evil Duke Fishron and Moonlord! May we all take up our Legendary Terra Blades, Unreal Megasharks and Mythical Last Prisms and banish the ancient Spirit of Darkness from this Great Region!!!!

We are ambivalent towards the Hallow but note it&#39;s fast spreading and dangerous nature as a possible future threat.
