With a self repeating arcane cataclysm at it&#39;s very centre, [region]Aetherium Locus[/region] is located within a transdimensional gaping maw, allowing for easy access to the furthest reaches of space. Here, modern day technology works together with medieval forms of newly discovered magic to overcome the challenge of survival in this air-filled near void- with the only tangible hallmarks being Asgardian floating islands, with sizes varying from a little more than an asteroid to continent-dwarfing monoliths, and the rivers, the size of oceans, connecting said islands together in a fluid concourse of sorts.
