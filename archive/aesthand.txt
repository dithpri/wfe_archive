Welcome to Aesthand, a democratic under construction region that is aimed to create a space for debate between nations and follow our goal of sharing our knowledge and helping one another.

The region&#39;s rules are being established, so you can help to write the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

In order to be able to participate in the region activities, you must ask for citizenship to the provisional government (pending approval).
