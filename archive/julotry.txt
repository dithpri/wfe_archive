The region of Julotry faced an epic battle back in 1863, unfortunately, we lost the battle. We lost approximately 2,800 people in that fateful battle. But, we stayed strong about it and moved on. Our history is not as well as others but, we&amp;#39;ve stayed calm and we have moved on. Our region is peaceful and has a large and strong army.
