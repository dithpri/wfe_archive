We are the grateful Fatherland, strong in heart and faith. Lead by The New Riech and friends, only a select few may join.

[b] [color=red] For all new members
When joining the Fatherland please send Animu and Mango a message stating who you are and what nations you own. Failure to do so will result in ejection from the Fatherland. 
If any current members make a new nation and move them to the Fatherland you must send Animu and Mango an update about which new nation you have. Failure to do so will result in that nation being ejected.
