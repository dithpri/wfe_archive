--Welcome to the Arab Nations!--
We are a region that currently only has a few nations, but will one day grow to be powerful, strong, you get the whole entire point.

We are still working on our description, so that&#39;s why none of the text wilk be in different colors, different styles etc.

It is encouraged for nations to change their currency to the &quot;awa&quot;.

Anyways, we are still looking for ideas we could do, if you have an idea, telegram [nation]Aikailia[/nation] about it, and he will respond to it depending on the time he sees it. Sometimes, it could be even in a matter of seconds.
