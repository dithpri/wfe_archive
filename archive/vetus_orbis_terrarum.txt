[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]Kantrias[/region] decided to go to explore the [color=white]snowy[/color] wonderland of Russia. 

We stole many comrades along the way, who were all suffering from crippling hair loss. Thus we set out to your region to find the cure for balding hair. 

We did 10 gopnik squats and chanted around a fire while burning ingredients from your region, which gave us magical powers to restore our comrade&#39;s hair.
