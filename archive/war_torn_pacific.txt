Welcome to the War Torn Pacific. 

The Pacific has been in a state of confusion, and as well Conflict. 

Let&#39;s bring the Old Pacific Back. We don&#39;t need to be allied with traders, backstabbers, or sneaks. The New Pacific Order, has for a year now, been infiltrating other sovereign entities. Because of this, their Embassies have been withdrawn from a good portion of their allies. 

Now I know what you&#39;re thinking... Whats this got to do with me? Well, this is a place you can rest your head. Whether you&#39;re new to NS, or are just sick of the conflict, come here to get a grip.
