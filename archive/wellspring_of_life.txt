The Wellspring of Life, also known simply as the Force planet, was one of many such nexuses of power that manifested in the depths of the galaxy. The Wellspring was powerful in the light side of the Force and was speculated to be the source of all life. It was not marked on any star map and had no official name. The planet was surrounded by a bright nebula. Upon reaching the surface, it appeared barren, save for luminescent geysers that released energy from inside the planet. Below the surface, however, were floating islands that were covered in plant life and immersed in the Force.
