The Coalition of the South is a region comprised of many independent and dependent states in the south-eastern region of North America. The Coalition owns small colonies from the Yucatan to Florida, but is based on a large island in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico between Texas and Cuba.

Within the past seven months, the Coalition has taken case to two major wars which have resulted in the dissolution of the majority of it&#39;s major nations. These areas have been abandoned due to the Three-Day-War and the Coalitional War. The former territories are being colonized by citizens from all over the coalition, soon, hopefully, they shall become independent States to start a new era of the Coalition of the South.
