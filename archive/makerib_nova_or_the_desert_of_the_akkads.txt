used to be brazil, but the earth&#39;s axis got flipped upside-down and the weather heated up and people cut down the trees and everything was bombed but no one remembers that. Now it&#39;s just the desert in the north, which a lot of former &quot;north&quot; african people migrated to when the sahara turned into a jungle and they were forced out by olive-skinned invaders. But no one remembers that. Now come and see the brazilian sahara, its blue-cloaked mercenaries, sandstone temples, obsidian minarets and vanilla-eyed girls. But be careful here and fear their estranged god, the Smokeless One, who seems very familar but perhaps is not. Very religious folk here, but they don&#39;t have a choice!
