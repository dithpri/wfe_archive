Half the worlds population has died from disease, famine, war, [i][b][u]AND THE GREAT SNAP[/u][/b][/i] is in disarray the country&#146;s that are left are in shock as their allies are gone and there people struggling to cope with the world as the great communist powers are looking like a utopia but little are wanting to give up freedom America and Russia stand as opposites but both are beacons of hope 
Germany once again has Europe within grasp will the Germans be able to unite itself and retake Berlin or will the Russians be able to reorganize in time. Can America recover will Russia be able to appease its populace and remain communist. It&#146;s a NEW DAWN who will rise and who will fall.
