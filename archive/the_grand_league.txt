We welcome migrating nation as honored guests please come and stay a while
.
Mankind -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today.
We can&#39;t be consumed by our petty differences anymore.
We will be united in our common interests.
And you will once again be fighting for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from annihilation.
We&#39;re fighting for our right to live, to exist.
And should we win the day, We will declare in one voice: &quot;We will not go quietly into the night!
 We will not vanish without a fight!
We&#39;re going to live on!
We&#39;re going to survive!&quot;
