[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were great at flying. They were, in fact, the fastest birds in town. However, they wanted to fly even faster by bending update to their will to hit all the regions they possibly could. In order to learn this power, they travelled to the Southern NS Temple in hopes of finding the ancient updater bender themselves: Violet. We just wanted to stop by and ask for a few directions to the, but upon seeing your region so empty, we decided to leave this note here instead. If anyone who sees this [i]does know[/i] where to find the NS Temple, please leave us a message [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]here[/url]!
