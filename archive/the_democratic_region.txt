This democratic region, were rules are passed through polls and each democratically elected president is allowed to start a political party in which you may chose they way you rule with the polls reflecting your approval rate. Only the President can establish embassies and he/she may pick a cabinet, also he can recommend and pass/veto polls decisions (if they regard government or laws.) The nations in our region may start a law if they can get at least 10 votes depending on region size. Also the election process will be observed by the Baltic Counties and if the president/WA delegate makes rules without approval of the region the Baltic counties will turn off his executive power and reverse rules until new president is elected.
