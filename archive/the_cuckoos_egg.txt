Welcome to [color=blue]The Cuckoos Egg[/color], the personal (but seldom visited) region of [color=red]Administrator Emeritus SalusaSecondus[/color].

The region is under the anti-marsupial stewardship of [color=green]TAO[/color] and the New TAO Order and its pursuit of the [color=green]Art of Nothingness[/color].

We occasionally engage in efficacious conversation but this is not one of those scheduled weeks.

[color=red]Requests for embassy exchanges from embassy collectors will typically be denied[/color] ... unless your region is unique or you have sent a particularly compelling representative to woo us.

In an effort to limit the spread of infection diseases, masks are now required in all public spaces of the Egg. Be advised, self-medicating with eucalyptus oil or roofur will necessitate immediate transfer to TRR.
