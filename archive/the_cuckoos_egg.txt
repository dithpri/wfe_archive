[b]Welcome to [color=blue]The Cuckoos Egg[/color], the personal [/b](but seldom visited)[b] region of [color=red]Game Administrator SalusaSecondus[/color][/b].
[hr]
The region is under the anti-marsupial stewardship of [b][color=green]TAO[/color][/b] and the New TAO Order and its pursuit of the [color=green]Art of Nothingness[/color].

[b]We occasionally engage in efficacious conversation but this is not one of those scheduled weeks.
[hr]
[color=red]Requests for embassy exchanges from embassy collectors will typically be denied[/color] ... unless your region is unique or you have sent a particularly compelling representative to woo us.[/b]

[i]WA Delegates may be given additional authority upon request. If you become elected as our WA Delegate and would like access to the regional admin page, please telegram [nation]SalusaSecondus[/nation] and request it.[/i]
