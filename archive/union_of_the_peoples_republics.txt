The Union of the People&#39;s Republics was created by The People&#39;s Republic of Solie Zerca on 7/04/2021. This union is meant for all People&#39;s Republics to have their own identity if the other Regions were not right for them. The union only has one standard to be a part of this Region is you must be a People&#39;s Republic, it doesn&#39;t matter what you have chosen as long as your countries name has The People&#39;s Republic in it. If your identity changes away from a People&#39;s Republic then you will have to leave. If the standards change everyone will be notified before it changes, however, there might be some exceptions to the standards. That is all the information that you need to be a part of the Union of the People&#39;s Republics.
