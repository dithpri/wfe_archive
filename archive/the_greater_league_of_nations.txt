Greetings World Leaders!

The Greater League of Nations is a new union of the greatest nations
and the ones that have greatest potential. Together we will grow stronger!

This is a democracy so we will vote on issues and have a
Collective legislative body. 

Role play is a major part of this game so don&#39;t be afraid to be 
ridiculous. Events will be staged regularly.

If anyone has any suggestions just let me know.
Have fun!
