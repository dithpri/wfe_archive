[b]Formerly a communist stronghold, The Soviet Vanguard has been seized by [color=red]Anti-Anti-Fascist[/color] agents, as anti-fascist forces were incapable of recognizing and thwarting the infiltration. The commies were unable to rally around the region&amp;#39;s cliched and discredited motto of &amp;#39;Workers of the World Unite!&amp;#39;, and as a result, this region has been liberated and cleansed of undesirable elements.  Childish and shameful materialistic class warfare tendencies are a thing of the past, for this region at least.[/b]
