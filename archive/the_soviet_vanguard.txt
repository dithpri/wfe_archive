[b]A former stronghold of [color=red]tyranny[/color], now liberated by [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=libertatem][color=blue]Libertatem![/color][/url]

[color=black]&amp;quot;Anti-antifa&amp;quot;[/color] cannot claim the moral high ground by fighting [color=red]Antifa[/color], as their purpose in opposing [color=red]Antifa[/color] is merely one of [u]hate[/u] with no desire to work together in expanding [color=blue]individual liberty[/color]. Added to the fact they are associated with [color=black]national[/color][color=red] socialism[/color], [color=black]&amp;quot;Anti-Antifa&amp;quot;[/color] merely puts their feet in their mouths when &amp;quot;liberating&amp;quot; [color=red]Antifa[/color] regions.

[color=gold]Libertarians and liberals[/color] cannot sit idly while both groups intend to destroy the pillars of civilization through their actions. [u]We must act.[/u]

[color=red]The Soviet Vanguard[/color] is now a testament to that.
