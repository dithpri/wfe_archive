[Color=cccccc]Former Founder: [nation]REATO[/nation]

A former stronghold of tyranny, now liberated by Libertatem!

&quot;Anti-antifa&quot; cannot claim the moral high ground by fighting Antifa, as their purpose in opposing Antifa is merely one of hate with no desire to work together in expanding individual liberty. Added to the fact they are associated with national socialism, &quot;Anti-Antifa&quot; merely puts their feet in their mouths when &quot;liberating&quot; Antifa regions.

Libertarians and liberals cannot sit idly while both groups intend to destroy the pillars of civilization through their actions. We must act.

The Soviet Vanguard is now a testament to that.
