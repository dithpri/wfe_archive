Former WFE: 
Welcome to Filastin, one of the few regions dedicated to the Palestinians and their plight along with Free Palestine, Haifa, Al Quds and Tel Aviv.
Sharon and Shamir rot in hell. Have a nice day. :D

Filastin will forever be Anti-Imperialist, Anti-Fascist, Green and Feminist.

In effect, the US and Israel are demanding that Palestinians not only recognize Israel in the normal fashion of interstate relations, 
but also formally accept the legitimacy of their expulsion from their own land.
