[b]Important note[/b] (for those who care about the Rocain project - BOTH of you): [nation]Trotterdam[/nation] has reset his database as the result of changes to stats documented in a recent news item. Most of the Rocain nations depend on this database to decide their issues. I have grabbed a copy of the last database before the reset. There will be a very gradual changeover to using the new data.
