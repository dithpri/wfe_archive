As a successor to the Ideals set forth by the Accepted Realms, The Even More Accepting Realms provides a home to all, as well as Blackjack and Hookers (minus the Blackjack) which the Accepted Realms do not have. Our primary belief is that nations have the right to govern themselves as they please, and are not to get themselves involved in the affairs of other nations. Should the Realms be invaded, all nations are expected to come together and repel the invaders. Serious conflicts between nations of the Realms will be resolved by the KRS. The World Assembly infringes on the belief of independent governing, as such there shall not be a regional ambassador, though individual nations may still attend.
