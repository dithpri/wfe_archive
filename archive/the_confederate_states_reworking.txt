The Confederate States of America (CSA), commonly referred to as the Confederate States (CS) or the Confederacy, was a government set up in 1861 by seven states of the Lower South that had declared their secession from the United States following the November 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln. Those seven states created a &amp;quot;confederacy&amp;quot; in February 1861 before Lincoln took office in March. After war began in April, four states of the Upper South seceded, and were admitted. The Confederacy later accepted two additional states as members (Missouri and Kentucky) although neither officially declared secession nor was ever controlled by Confederate forces.
