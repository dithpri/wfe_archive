[b]From a distant star life began,
[/b]
So say the Sacred Scrolls passed down to us from generations long before since the Great Exodus from Origin,
From that distant star, Twelve Colonies established in the three-star system of Othrys,
Twelve Worlds bound by culture and faith, divided by ambition and greed,
Yet man would perish unless they unite,
For grave danger would approach the Twelve Colonies, Ancient and destructive,
For all this has happened before and will happen again.
