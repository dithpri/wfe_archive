The Rim of Antoinette is a vast, crescent-shaped expanse at the outer edge of a once-great inland sea that has long since receded. Jagged cliffs of pale rose-colored stone mark its boundary, glowing faintly at dawn and dusk as if holding the last blush of a fading empire. The land is both beautiful and treacherous&#151;rolling dunes spill into salt flats, broken up by fractured canyons that bleed with mineral-rich springs. Strange crystalline growths sprout from the earth in places, catching the sun and scattering it into shards of color that make the horizon shimmer like glass.
