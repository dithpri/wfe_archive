A free land for like minded people&amp;#39;s. The role of government here shall be to let people thrive and fail upon their own merit. We embrace the concept that the only role of law is to prevent one man from infringing upon the inalienable rights of another. All men are free and created equal. Their rights are endowed by something far greater than government. 

Constitution to come soon upon discussion by member nations.
