The region of Freeblr is once more under the caring and nuturing wings of [region]The Roma Confederacy[/region]

Be wary, and tread lightly, Black Riders. The campaign has only just begun. Our eyes are ever watching, our minds are ever working, our hands, hooves, and paws are ever working to undo your damage,
and bring your [color=black]Tyranny[/color] to a [color=blue]swift[/color]

[color=orange]utter[/color]

and [color=red]TERRIBLE[/color] end!

Freeblr is ours, now and forever!

Long live the resistance!
