 We were a group of nations that escaped the grip of a regional super power and are now joining together to fight for democracy. We have joined together to find simple diplomatic solutions to our regions problems. Our top priorities are Social Welfare, Law and Order, and Environmental Issues. Us Pingdi Nations are liberal, democratic states that seek for peace.
We Are The Pingdi Nations!
