Southeastern Eurasia is a region open exclusively to societies whose geography is located within the area of modern day Southeast Asia (i.e., Brunei, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam).

Our focus is to highlight the polarization of politics in the region by creating imaginary societies that represent different strains of political thought.

Entrance to the region is password protected. New members must be Southeast Asian-themed nations.
