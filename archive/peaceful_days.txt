Time never stops flowing and seasons change, those innocent days of the past might never return.
Two sisters, eternally bound by blood and friendship, had one another in rainy skies and shining sun.
For they know deep in their hearts that no matter what, spring always comes and flowers will bloom.
Across time and space, does their story still continue?

A region which holds three connected nations, bound by fate. One a remnant with memories of long ago, when two sisters were still one. One in the present with compassion, hope, and trust. And one in the grim dark future, where two sisters meet again.
