The idea: What would it be like if they founded the European Union in 2019? This is a &#39;from scratch&#39; roleplay concept, where we&#39;re going to explore - each participant taking up either an existing or realistic European country - the foundation of a new European supranational entity? How will it develop? In what direction with both the union, and the countries within it, develop? Not sure which way this will go or not!

You won&#39;t be bound by the real life politics of the countries concerned, and you have the freedom to play them more to suit yourself. Feel free to change governments and engage with issues dynamically.
