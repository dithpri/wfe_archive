With it&amp;#39;s only neighbour being Atlantis, this land at the bottom of the sea is a perfect haven for all those who wish to pursue the art of Demon worship...well not demons exactly, but giant eternal aliens who now sleep awaiting the correct alignment of stars for their ascendency over Earth to commence once more. To help you fit in and avoid being sacraficed to the slime covered fiends that dwell here in R&amp;#39;lyeh, we have provided one of the common mindless chants heard throughout the cyclopean catacombs of the major cities; Ph&amp;#39;nglui mglw&amp;#39;nafh Cthulhu R&amp;#39;lyeh wgah&amp;#39;nagl fhtagn 
Have fun.
