Rlyeh is a region for the study of HP Lovecraft writings of fiction (mostly Cthulhu Mythos and some Dreamland cycle), his early poems, his works of non-fiction (eg Supernatural Horror in Literature), his influences &amp;quot;by&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; other writers.

Pretty much all nations are welcome, but Lovecraft-inspired are prefencial (please send a telegram and the password will be most likely send in reply).

Lovecraftian embassies are also welcome.

Note this is not a heavy-metal not a graphic gore region. Neither it is an occultist region. Invader and nazi nations/regions are NOT welcome.
