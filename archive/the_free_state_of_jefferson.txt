Jeffersonian democracy. The Jeffersonians were deeply committed to Republicanism in the United States, which meant opposition to aristocracy of any form, opposition to corruption, insistence on virtue, with a priority for the &quot;yeoman farmer&quot;, &quot;planters&quot;, and the &quot;plain folk&quot;. They were antagonistic to the aristocratic elitism of merchants, bankers and manufacturers, distrusted factory workers, and were on the watch for supporters of the dreaded British system of government.
