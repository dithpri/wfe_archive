[b][color=red] WELCOME TO TERRA HONOREM! [/b][/color] The region is dedicated to Rome and the surrounding nations.

[b][color=blue] LONG LIVE THE HOLY CRUSADES! DEUS VULT! [/b][/color]
While our region strives to be a region of peace, we are drawn by our enemies into a state of war. Some of our glorious members participate in raids, in them gaining Honor and GLORY.... for the Lord, of course. These honored crusades will reclaim the Holy Land as well as collect trophy regions to grow our empire.

[b][color=red]Some of our brothers will be drifting in and out on crusades. They are to be respected equally to those who stay here, as they are fighting for the Lord![/b][/color]
