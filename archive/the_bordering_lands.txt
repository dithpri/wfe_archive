The Bordering Lands is a set of several small islands and wastelands that border the outer edge of continents like Australia and South America. Their climates and governments vary wildly, but in the end, they&#39;re still generally aligned with one another due to mutual benefits; or, more likely, they&#39;re just agreeing to not destroy one another until the time comes.
