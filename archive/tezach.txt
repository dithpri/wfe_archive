It is a lush land that has a mountainous region to the north, and the southwest contains a desert, but also has a few plains dotting the oasis surrounding them. the southeast side is a lush grassland dotted by deep forests and rolling hills. The sea in the center is home to abundant life and is commercially fished by the nations that surround it.
