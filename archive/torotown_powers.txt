The [region]Torotown Powers[/region] were founded on March 20, 2014 by [nation]Davissia[/nation]. We stand for liberty from regional oppression and regional violence. We hold very strong alliances with The [region]Bubble Buddies[/region] and [region]The Land for Everyone[/region]. Anyone is welcome! We encourage not joining the WA but welcome those who do. Most members of the TT Powers are wanted as public enemies by larger regions, so anyone is safe and welcome here!
