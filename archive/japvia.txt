[color=navy][b]Japvia[/b][/color][hr][color=800000][b][nation=short]Embassy Policy[/nation]:[/b][list][nation=short]Note[/nation]:[list]Currently I am trying to set my embassies to fit nsEmbassy Oracle game in mind, with the goal of having only two embassies per region, the region ahead and the region behind each region in question. To make this work, all other embassies will need to be ABORTED, as they interfere with the game. Our goal is to have a very long string of embassy regions.

Not all of my regions will participate in this game.

The shorter this takes, the sooner we will extend embassies again.[/list][nation=short]Attention[/nation]:[list]I have no interest in extending embassies to any region that bans my nations, so stop spamming embassy requests.

I am not accepting unsolicited embassy offers at this time.[/list][nation=short]Info[/nation]:  [url=http://nsdossier.texasregion.net/embassyOracle.aspx]nsEmbassy Oracle[/url][/color][/list][hr][list][color=red]This is [nation=short]Dog Lake[/nation]&amp;#39;s puppet storage region[/color]
