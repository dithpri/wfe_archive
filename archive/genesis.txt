Genesis was first founded in 2003 when NationStates was in its infancy. 2005 saw Genesis have its first proper community which lasted between May 2005 and August 2006 seeing its population achieve a high of 38 in July 2006. The longest serving delegate during this period was a nation called [nation]Plustocea[/nation] who held to position for a combined total of around 4 months.

The region was initially re-founded by its current curator on the 23/12/2009. Genesis reached it&#39;s highest ever population of 53 during this time with its longest serving delegate being [nation]Diogenesia[/nation] who lasted just over 4 months. In April 2010, the community moved to the region of [region]Bloemfontein[/region].

This region now rests as a memorial to the communities which once resided here.
