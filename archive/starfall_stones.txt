[b][i]Welcome to [region]Starfall Stones[/region], heroes![/i][/b]

This mystical stone circle stands to the east of [region]Winterblossom Woods[/region] and is a sacred site to Armello&#39;s ancient Bear Clan. The Bear Clan&#39;s Elder Council has sent [nation=short]Sana the Forest Sister[/nation] here in search of one of the Wyld&#39;s most precious magical artifacts, a Spirit Stone. If she can gather enough of these Stones, the Elder Council says, she can purify the [nation=short]King of Armello[/nation] of his madness.

What Sana doesn&#39;t know is that in order for this circle&#39;s Spirit Stone to appear here, a spirit of the nearby forest, the Great Elk, must be lured into the circle&#39;s center. Whichever Clan scores the most points shall lure in the Great Elk, summon the Spirit Stone and earn Sana&#39;s allegiance, and the region along with it!
