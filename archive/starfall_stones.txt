[b][i]Welcome to [region]Starfall Stones[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

Veteran heroes may recall this sacred circle is a holy site for the Bear Clan. Thane has come here to train with Bear Clan monks who&#39;ve taken up residence in the nearby area since the death of the corrupted King.

Thane will make a powerful ally in the fight against Sargon but heroes will need to prove their strength to him. Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points will pass his test, claim this region and have their Rot cleansed!
