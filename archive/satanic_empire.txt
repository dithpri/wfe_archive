[b]Bonjour, have a glass of wine.[/b]

~[b]This new Refound is under the secular rule of Anastasia Tud&oslash;r Baudelaire.
[u]The culture has not been preserved here, but if the original founders want to have control over this region again, I will grant them it.[/u][/b]

[i][b]Anastasia Tud&oslash;r Baudelaire is a polythiest who believes in both the underworld and overworld. She can travel through both.[/b][/i][hr][b]Former WFE[/b]
[strike]All hail Satan! We worship Satan with loving embrace! Abrahamic religions will not be tolerated! We are Laveyan Satanists, not foolish devil worshipers! Insulting Anton Lavey will NOT BE TOLERATED!!! We will glady accept embassies between other regions so long as they don&#39;t violate our views.[/strike]

**[b]footnote:[/b] I have nothing against Satanists.
