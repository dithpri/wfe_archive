This region is basically a Bourbon commonwealth. Here, all the monarchies that are part of the Bourbon family formed a single faction. All the countries here are part of the Bourbon dynasty. We are a powerful nation that strives for peace and Catholicism. It is rare for our faction to go at war (unless necessary).

Current head of the Monarchy is [color=red]Don Sixto Enrique de Borb&oacute;n[/color], king of the [nation=short]Carlist Spains[/nation].
