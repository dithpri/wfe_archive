[color=#347235][b][u]The Region of Fell[/u][/b][/color] 
The region of Fell, also known as Felldroth, was created in the hopes to create a friendly community of roleplayers. A community that could collaborate on a joint history, and one that could grow as time went by. The community leader is currently working on creating a wiki for nation articles, and a forum where everyone can interact. If you&amp;#39;d like to join, simply send the founder a TG to get things worked out. Though in the future an application process is likely.
