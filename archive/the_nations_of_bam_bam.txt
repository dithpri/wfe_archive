All members are scholars enrolled in a Contemporary Communications course at Robert Frost Middle School. Active participation in this virtual world, will allow students to evaluate and develop their perspectives in the real world. Our delegation would be interested in constructing embassies with any region(s) of a mutual &quot;school class&quot; designation to enrich our experiences. Our region is a unique opportunity to explore and discover the dynamics of politics, diplomacy, and communication. After a hard fought democratic vote, we were united under the small but mighty Bam-Bam; the magnificent chihuahua of the regional founder and teacher, The Magnificent Mr. Wilson.
