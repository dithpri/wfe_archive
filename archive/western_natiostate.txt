&amp;#39;Western Natiostate&amp;#39; is the western side of the continent of Natiostate.

On this side, the private market is larger, and state-owned industry is extremely rare; political freedoms are lower, and the individual is placed above the society (both in and out of the political process); heavy taxation is viewed as theft, and as a result, taxes are much lower.
