This is a region that was ultimately made for the joke religion worshipping [nation]Cynetia[/nation] also known as Lord Freecoder, but as the months went by, our region has grown to become broader and more welcoming. This is mostly just a normal NationStates region. Small, but because of this, everyone can interact with you.
