Welcome to [b][color=green]Freecodism[/color][/b] my friend, this is a region dedicated to Freecodism where we jokingly worship [nation]Cynetia[/nation] and [nation]Yoshi Dynasty[/nation]. [nation]BEEG BEEG[/nation] is also the Holy Messenger Yoshi and is the leader to all Yoshis. [nation]Greater Alphadonia[/nation] is considered as the main prophet and minor god too.
