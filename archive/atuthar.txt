Welcome to [b]Atuthar,[/b] a roleplaying region.

The thing about Atuthar is that it&amp;#39;s casual and tight-knit. Everyone knows everyone here, but newcomers need not worry: we&amp;#39;ll fit you in, no problems. The RP is open to anyone who knows how to tell a good tale; we encourage solid and well-thought-out roleplay. At the same time, we try to maintain a friendly and free atmosphere. Participation and activity aren&amp;#39;t required if you&amp;#39;ve got other commitments; join in whenever you have the time.
