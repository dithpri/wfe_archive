[b]Father Donovan of [nation]Eaglemount[/nation] welcomes all nations to attend [region]The Church of Jesus Christ[/region] and post from embassy regions. Spirituality is critical for all nations and converts from all other faiths are encouraged to join us in our One Faith. 

[I]No embassies are permitted with Antifa or immoral regions[/i]

[region]The Church of Jesus Christ[/region] consists of all in Faith of the Triune God. By Grace given by Jesus Son of God, we are saved and by Spirit of God have become part of the family of God in the afterlife to come. It is not by works but by grace we are saved; yet we must proselytize to all nations to bring them unto God for His glory
