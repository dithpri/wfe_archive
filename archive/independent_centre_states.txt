RULES:
-No extremists.
-Must be a moderate.

BASICALLY I can&amp;#39;t be bothered whether you get involved in anything or not. There aren&amp;#39;t any forums. This region is for moderates who want to join a region but don&amp;#39;t want war, want to have to talk, want to feel they have to &amp;quot;stand in elections for local government&amp;quot; like in other regions.

Join if you want. If you don&amp;#39;t want to then don&amp;#39;t, obviously.
