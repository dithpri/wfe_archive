The sun is setting on all the great empires. We must face that, small factions like the Assembly are free from corruption and striving for greatness. Even as I write this our reach expands with embassies being built and votes made. Our military remains prepared for the coming wars that will come form the power vacuum created when the great empires fall. We will relish in this, and we will be triumphant!

We are a group of role players and writers willing to expand the reach and lore of our region. There are many roles and there is also an international court. Please apply to as many of these as you wish!!! To read about the lore behind this region see either the pinned factbooks or view the factbooks of the officers of this country.
