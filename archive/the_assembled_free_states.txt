The sun is setting on all the great empires. We must face that, small factions like the Assembly are free from corruption and striving for greatness. Even as I write this our reach expands with embassies being built and votes made. Our military remains prepared for the coming wars that will come form the power vacuum created when the great empires fall. We will relish in this, and we will be triumphant!

Our bonds are formed with the blood spilt during the September Uprising. Millions died. Our countries ruined and ravaged by disease and war. Separatists and Ultranationalists constantly vying for control. Destruction and death held us in it&#39;s grip.
