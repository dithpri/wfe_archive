Truly one of the greatest assemblies of all time. All are welcome to this prestigious community. Wars have forged bonds and made us brothers. Together we strive for greatness. Learning today. Leading tomorrow!


The sun is setting on all the great empires. We must face that, small factions like the Assembly are free from corruption and striving for greatness. Even as I write this our reach expands with embassies being built and votes made. Our military remains prepared for the coming wars that will come form the power vacuum created when the great empires fall. We will relish in this, and we will be triumphant!
