Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], and some stabby soldiers dragged General [nation]Miravana[/nation] out of bed to have some thorn shenanigans. It just so happened that thorning was one of the few things Mira would get out of bed for these days. With many mishaps, the mechanical mira did manage more masterpieces than melancholy misses.
