Welcome to the underworld, friend. Take a look inside, sit at our tables, eat our fruit, gouge yourself with anything you like, rejoice in our hospitality, live your lives and truths all at once, experience it all. Taste it, it is infront of you, taste the fruits of your labors, and stay, stay down here, in the underworld.
