Following a series of brutal wars, caused by the most appallingly inept diplomacy, this group of nations has risen from the ashes of the fallen empires that once ruled the world. Their aim: to do everything they can to prevent such a thing from happening again, even if that means descending to the levels of the once great empires and controlling everything. For in free thought, ideas are born that may be contrary to the greater good. So for a better future, we call for the rescinding of all concepts of self. A country should not be made up of individuals but a united mentality bent on increasing the glory of their country. For it is not the government&amp;#39;s job to work, only to maintain order while the people work for them.
