The British Empire comprises of the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. The Empire holds sway over about 450 million people. The empire covers more than a quarter of the Earth&amp;#39;s total land area. As a result, the political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. The phrase &amp;quot;the empire on which the sun never sets&amp;quot; is often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe means that the sun is always shining on at least one of the territories. Its mission is to expand Christianity and civilisation throughout the Earth lifting the savage populations of the earth out of darkness into the light of Britannic civilisation.
