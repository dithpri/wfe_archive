The Patriotic Precinct is a region on NationStates that was established as a safe space for any Patriotic nations, free of the tyranny of any Anti-Patriots.

On NationStates, there are significantly many larger and more populous regions who express their hostility towards Patriotism. The Patriotic Precinct accepts Patriotism and even encourages it.

Patriotism: We&#39;re proud of our nations, and they are proud of us.
