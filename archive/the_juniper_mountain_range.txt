The Juniper Mountain Range ( also known as &#147;The Range&#148; ) is a vast and extensive chain of mountains. This large religion is primarily composed of colossal, snow capped mountains, where the snow melts to form creeks and rivers providing water to the lush Juniper pine trees of The Range. 
	The Range has an extensive cave network at the same time being mildly volcanically active. The Region was discovered by the ATLISS corporation during a search for unclaimed territory, at the time, it was fresh for the pickings with the only inhabitants being the wild yet fat and lazy Maine Coons and sparse human presents.
