Altmora stands for the principles which built the West: faith, reason, justice, order, hierarchy, and family. States exist to serve  the nation, and the nation is the unique expression of a particular people. The nation-state is the true foundation of happiness and harmony.

The nations of Altmora absolutely oppose egalitarianism, communism, globalism, and all other insidious lies perpetuated by the Left.
