Altmora believes Western Civilization is the pinnacle of human achievement and supports its three pillars: Christianity, the European nations, and the Graeco-Roman heritage. States exist to serve  the nation, and the nation is the unique expression of a particular people. Every nation and every people has a right to exist in the native culture it prefers, homogenous and unmolested by immigration or invasion.

The nations of Altmora absolutely oppose egalitarianism, communism, globalism, the Left, and all forms of degeneracy.
