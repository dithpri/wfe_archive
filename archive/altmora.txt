Altmora believes Western Civilization is the pinnacle of human achievement and supports its three pillars: Christianity, the European nations, and the Graeco-Roman heritage. States exist to serve  the nation, and the nation is the unique expression of a particular people. The nations of Altmora absolutely oppose egalitarianism, communism, globalism, and the Left.

Everything&#39;s going to be alt right.
