Altmora believes Western Civilization is the pinnacle of human achievement and supports its three pillars: Christianity, the European nations, and the Graeco-Roman heritage. States exist to serve  the nation, and the nation is the unique expression of a particular people. We are nationalists, fascists, and traditionalists.

The nations of Altmora absolutely oppose egalitarianism, communism, globalism, and the Left. Antifa masks adorn spikes outside the region&#39;s walls. Our invincible Chad Legions will cast down the Left&#39;s childish superstitions and our dank memes will rule the waves.

Everything&#39;s going to be alt right.
