[B][u][color=blue]WHAT THIS REGION IS[/color][/u][/B]
I won&#39;t lie - a lot of nations here are just my puppets BUT there are a few people who aren&#39;t me here, so feel free to join in and talk about whatever.

I just wanna make this a pretty casual region for talking about dumb Japanese cartoons and superhero shows.

[B][u][color=blue]WHO SHOULD JOIN THIS REGION[/color][/u][/B]
