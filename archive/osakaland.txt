[B][u][color=blue]WHAT THIS REGION IS[/color][/u][/B]
I won&#39;t lie - right now, every nation here is just one of my puppets. BUT I want this region to grow so feel free to join and strike up a conversation with me (or maybe someone else, if there&#39;s someone else here)

I just wanna make this a pretty casual region for talking about dumb Japanese cartoons and superhero shows.

[B][u][color=blue]WHO SHOULD JOIN THIS REGION[/color][/u][/B]
If you are a nerd who likes Pretty Cure, old anime (pre-2000s), Japanese superheroes (think Ultraman, Super Sentai, Kamen Rider), or other dumb nerdy garbage - then you should join us!

If you&#39;re not - then don&#39;t, simple as that
