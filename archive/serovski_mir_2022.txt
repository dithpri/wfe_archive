Gem of Panem
Mighty city
Through the ages you shine anew

We humbly kneel
To your ideal
And pledge our love to you!

Gem of Panem
Heart of Justice
Wisdom crowns your marble brow

You give us light
You reunite
To you we make our vow

Gem of Panem
Seat of power
Strength in peacetime, shield in strife

Protect our land
With armored hand
Our Capitol
Our life
