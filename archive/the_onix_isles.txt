The world of Onix Isles mainly consists of water with three large continents and smaller islands scattered around the area. The world supports a wide range of ecosystems and environments, generally speaking the northern and southern areas are colder while the center is the warmest. The southern most landmass is reserved as a wildlife preserve, it can be used for hunting, fishing, camping and other recreational use, but no private land ownership is allowed.  There are many scientific research outposts throughout the area as well.
