ISB utopia has a categorization of citizens into a rigid class structure of &amp;quot;golden,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;silver,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;bronze&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;iron&amp;quot; socioeconomic classes. The golden citizens are trained in a rigorous 50-year long educational program to be benign oligarchs, the &amp;quot;philosopher-kings.&amp;quot; The wisdom of these rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources, though the details on how to do this are unclear. The educational program for the rulers is the central notion of the proposal. There is a general pacifism or pacifist attitude. It has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbors.
