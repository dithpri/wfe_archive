Various minor Nations put together to protect one another from those outside it, as well as to lead one another in keeping stability and enhancing civil freedoms.

Our leadership is mostly [color=#ab3333]left-leaning[/color]; Our governor is the Free Land of [nation]Sconymalm[/nation], and our World Assembly delegate and the successor to the [color=#0055dd]URNB[/color] is the United Socialist States of [nation]Ste Sern[/nation].

We are willing to open embassies in other regions, although we do not have current intentions to engage in hostilities or further diplomacy with other regions.
