 - territorial disputes are settled by a a rule of the majority
 - alt account vote has passed so everyone will be allowed to have a MAX of TWO (2) alts which MUST be VASSALS of their primary accounts. For instance, the Empire of East Rome controls the Bahamas, so they many make an alt which canonically is the Bahamas. Vassals will not be shown on the map. plz leave the region if u have an alt that doesn&#39;t follow these rules
 - if anyone dislikes these rules, they may be changed by a ruling of the majority
