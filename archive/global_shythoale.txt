the world is just a shythoale
 - territorial disputes are settled by a a rule of the majority
 - the alt account vote has passed so everyone will be allowed to have a MAX of TWO (2) alts which MUST be VASSALS of their primary accounts. plz leave the region if u have an alt that doesn&#39;t follow these rules
 - if u dont like the rules, just have a vote to change them
 - if ur in the WA endorse east rome
 - if u want to conquer, instead use diplo and make a convincing case to the rest of shythoale on why u should have it and they might vote for u to have it
