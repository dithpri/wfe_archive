Alti is a new region founded by the Republic of Lucayana. Lucayana is a new nation that recently gained independence from Keelines with help from the WA after decades of fighting. With help from their new allies that helped them in the past, they started a new region. Alti is a free region with many opportunities, monthly elections, and so many things to do. We plan on expanding our outreach as time goes on. I hope you consider joining soon. 

After most Nations left or ceased to exist, I and one other are looking to bring back Alti to its once great state, with more than just two nations. I do hope you consider joining, I won&#39;t leave until all hope is lost.
