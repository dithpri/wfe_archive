This place was founded nearly a year after Sulovian became a country. Everyone is welcomed here with open arms, as long as you can respect out rules/beliefs. Fail to do so and you will not be welcomed back. If you wish to come here we ask that you meet all of the federal requirements to be able to travel. We also accept people who are looking to flee from their country. We have ways of helping you get to us, without you getting caught. But you&#39;ll have to talk to our STO (Specially Trained Officers) Who will help you with that.
