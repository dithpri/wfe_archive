The Meisteria Union is a regional alliance founded on principles of egalitarianism, resource-sharing, and mutual defence. In the late 21st century, the once globe-spanning superpower collapsed under the weight of internal strife, economic stagnation, and mounting resistance to increasingly tyrannic policies. The union&#39;s goals are long-term stability and prosperity for it&#39;s members.
