The Great Houses have their origin in the ancient customs of the Chimer, a self-exiled Aldmeri sect who followed their prophet Veloth across Tamriel from the west. They abandoned their former nomadic lifestyle, and divided themselves into political clans, which would become the Great Houses Indoril, Redoran, Telvanni, Hlaalu, Dres and the Shadow House, Dagoth.
