The&nbsp;Kingdom of Westplain was a&nbsp;sovereign state&nbsp;on the Osean continent from 13 December 727, when it emerged from various&nbsp;Celtic&nbsp;kingdoms, until 1 May 1714, when it united with&nbsp;Tolcor&nbsp;to form the&nbsp;Commonwealth of Westplain and Tolcor. The Kingdom of Westplain was among the most powerful states in&nbsp;Osea&nbsp;during the medieval periods.

Nowadays, Westplain is more strong and influential than ever in Osea, and is a middle-great power over continental affairs. It is currently comprised of 27 counties, each with their own cultures and similarities, and differences between each other. This region holds Westplain&#39;s 27 counties.
