The&nbsp;Kingdom of Westplain was a&nbsp;sovereign state&nbsp;on the Osean continent from 13 December 727, when it emerged from various&nbsp;Celtic&nbsp;kingdoms, until 1 May 1714, when it united with&nbsp;Tolcor&nbsp;to form the&nbsp;Commonwealth of Westplain and Tolcor. The Kingdom of Westplain was among the most powerful states in&nbsp;Osea&nbsp;during the medieval periods.

The various tribal kingdoms that were united by&nbsp;King L&ograve;gar to form the Kingdom of Westplain, in 927, became part of the&nbsp;Yerogur-Sakanese Kingdom, an empire stretching across North Osea. The&nbsp;Jogundhai Occupation of the Yerogur-Sakanese Kingdom in 1212 followed by the Warring Khanates Period in 1230 creating a time of anarchy saw Westplain becoming free of foregin rule.
