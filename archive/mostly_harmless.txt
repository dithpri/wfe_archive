Welcome to Mostly Harmless!
We are an outer space region where every nation is a separate world and all are welcome.
Much is under construction so please pardon the inconvenience and address any requests or issues to the mice in charge.
So turn on your infinite improbability drive and explore your neighboring nations!
You might come across a prehistoric earth, or perhaps a fantastical wizarding world?
Whatever it may be grab your towels and your guides and make yourself at home.
Please be aware that if you anger the management the Vogons might decide that your nation is inconveniently placed and disintegrate it whereupon you will be forced to hitch a ride to some other region.
Much love,
The Galactic President XOXO
