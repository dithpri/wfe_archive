[spoiler=What is Raiding?]
[i]Raiding is war.  Raiding involves moving nations, called puppets, into an enemy region, called a target.  Once in the region all the invading nations endorse one nation, called the point.  If the point has the most endorsements at update, the time the game processes issues, then the point becomes delegate and the region is occupied or annihilated![/i][/spoiler]
