The homeland of the Yssag people. It&#39;s a large, relatively flat plain in an indeterminate rural part of the world, bordered by a desert, a small mountain range, and the ocean. It is largely tribal, although there are sparse areas of higher development, and even cities and industry. Most of it is warm and consists of savanna, although there are colder regions near the mountains that experience periodic snowfall.

The region is noteworthy for its language, which consists entirely of varying pitches and frequencies in regards to flatulence. Most Yssag culture is built around this, leading to a uniquely alien culture.
