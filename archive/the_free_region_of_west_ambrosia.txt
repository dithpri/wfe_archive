Tired of the increasing globalization of political issues, West Ambrosia has granted it&#39;s people the choice to leave and form their own world west of Ambrosia. The West Ambrosians aren&#39;t an anti-social group but believe political discussion should be localized rather than spread to other countries and regions influencing the ways of life of the free citizens of the world. West Ambrosia aims to provide as much service, freedom, and happiness to the people of it&#39;s region while maintaining little to no outside influence. We hope to avoid any conflict or outward influence to surrounding nations.
