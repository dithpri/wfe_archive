Idealogies are usually better than the way they are applied, we can take the well-known example of communism in USSR or China. The base idealogy is large bette. So the red star movement was founded not to follow idealogies, because they are utopias, but to make link between them, to make our own idealogy by mixing them. So we came up with the idea that the current society of consumption are pushing us to the hell, but it has his good sides, I don&#39;t think you feel really annoyed to have all what we have.
