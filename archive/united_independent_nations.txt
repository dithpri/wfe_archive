Greetings!

This region is now under the protection of [region]Libertatem[/region]. As a result of the petty attempt at a raid by [region]Civogi[/region], the Libertatem government has declared hostilities on Civogi, we do not let thugs bully our allies.

As soon as the region is stabilized, the United Independent Nations will be handed over to the natives, but a standing army will continue here in case of further attack.
