The Flux Islands are a group of--get this--islands that--wait for it--fluctuate in their geographical location. This series of sea and air based &amp;quot;landmasses&amp;quot; migrates together, either using powerful thrusters or gigantic boats, to new lands (or rather oceans) to seek a better climate for whatever activity they happen to be holding that day.
