The Known World is loosely based on the world in Game of Thrones. Name your nation whatever you want, but it should be clear which house/free city/area of the world your country is based on (remember just loosely, it doesn&#39;t have to be exact, I&#39;m based on House Targaryen). Other than that, I just wanted to start my own region and thought this would be a cool premise.
