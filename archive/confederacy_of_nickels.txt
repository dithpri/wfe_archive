We are the Brotherhood of Peel. All wolves will burn.
This region is a sanctuary for Brotherhood members ONLY. All others are not permitted entrance.
If you have any questions about our mission or the Brotherhood, wire your telegram to [nation]New Alaskans[/nation]
If you have any other questions don&#39;t bother sending a telegram. We won&#39;t respond.
The Brotherhood of Peel will rise.

Please keep in mind that this is a Brotherhood outpost, and the council operates off site as a defense against the WA.

Brotherhood members: &quot;Thank you very much!&quot;
