If you have any other questions don&#39;t bother sending a telegram. We won&#39;t respond.
The Brotherhood of Peel will rise.

Born from a far nation filled with highly intelligent animals, one free thinking group of segregationists abandoned their old home to ruin and founded the Confederacy of Nickels; A land free of wolves and any who defy the Great Banana.
