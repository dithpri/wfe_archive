Cool, and fictional roleplay. Focusing on good things and the majority! If you muddled about NationStates, or just want to enjoy yourself, this is a lovely place to be.

FICTIONAL ROLEPLAY:
Bloing is led by Phil Phildoo, and Maaclandia is ruled by a council. We have a lot of fictional characters, and if you wanna do some cool stuff, create your own characters, or wanna know more, all ya have to do is ask on the Board!

So just have a good time!
