The Kingdom of Foxenwood, though still a young and fledgling nation, was only recently united after years of civil war and bloodshed for over two-hundred years. The nation has its beginnings dating back to the 12th Century C.E., when the kingdom was once situated between the collection of coastal neighbors, known as the Free Republics, and the harsh mountain tribes of the Peak Mountain range encapsulating it. Before the unification of the kingdom Foxenwood was home to twelve families, the Foxes, the Axels, the Yrons, the Flowers, the Coals, the Gardeners, the Crosses, the Greenbloods, the Woods, the Oaks, the Ashes, and lastly the Peaks.
