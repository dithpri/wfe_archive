The Woodland Realm was a kingdom of Silvan Elves located deep in Mirkwood, the Forest of the Wilderland, beginning in the Second Age. Following the War of the Elves and Sauron, Thranduil of the Sindar ruled over the Silvan Elves. Those of the Woodland Realm were known to be less wise and more dangerous than other Elves, but were nevertheless one of the most powerful and legendary Elves of Middle-earth.

Legolas, a key member of the Fellowship of the Ring in the Third Age, hailed from here.
