The Independent Union (also known as The IU) was founded in 2016, after two nations came together and decided to form a free run government without restrictions from the many other regions.

All member nations of The Independent Union are encouraged to join and participate in the World Assembly. 

Nations are urged to endorse the WA Delegate and the Founder.
