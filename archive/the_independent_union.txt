 [color=red][b]IMPORTANT UPDATE:[/b] A recent discussion between myself, the WA Delegate and the Diplomacy Officer, we have come to a decision to merge our region, The Independent Union, and the region, the Unity Council together. Please swiftly resettle your nation in the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_unity_council]Unity Council[/url] region. You will have 72 hours to do so, if failed to follow the merger instructions your nation will be banned.[/color]
