The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn&#39;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#39;t, or where it isn&#39;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#39;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#39;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#39;t, and it follows that the position that it was.[hr][b]raided cuz u had a fascist tag..[/b]
