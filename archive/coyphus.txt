We will remember them.[/color][/i][/b][hr][color=#2566a7][b]G&#146;day, and welcome to Coyphus! Today is a special day, for Australians and New Zealanders. It&#146;s the 25th of April, and it&#146;s ANZAC day. ANZAC means Australian and New Zealand Army corps. On this day the forces from Australia and New Zealand landed on Gallipoli, in Turkey, during World 1. Here at Coyphus we remember the brave soldiers who fought hard against our enemies to save us from disaster. Without the ANZACs, who knows what would life be like today?[/b][/color][hr][color=maroon][b][i][u] &amp;#127462;&amp;#127482;LEST WE FORGET&amp;#127475;&amp;#127487;[/u][/i][/b][/color]
