[b][color=red]Hello, and welcome to[/color][color=#871717] Coyphus.[/color][/b][color=red] Today is Good Friday. Good Friday is a Christian holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary. It is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Great and Holy Friday, and Black Friday.[/color] [color=blue](Source: Wikipedia)
[/color][hr][color=red] On this day, we remember the suffering and execution of Jesus, son of the lord, who was sentenced to death by Pontius Pilate himself. This is the reason why the flag of Coyphus is blank and the banner is changed.[/color]
