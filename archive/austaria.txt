Welcome to Austaria, a world riven by conflict and intrigue, populated by proud nations and great city states. It is the cradle of Light and Human civilisation in a world overrun by darkness and evil.

We are a light fantasy RP region set in a late medieval world where faith and steel are the measure of a man&amp;#39;s worth while blood and gold fund the ambitions of the few. Will you rise and take charge of a great empire, or will you play the shrewd game of politics for your personal benefit? Either way all must join the Great Game or perish.
