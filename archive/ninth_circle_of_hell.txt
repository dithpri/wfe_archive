The alliance of nations which completely scorn any goodness and other mumbo-jumbo like human rights or anything alike.
The strong rule, opress, abuse, rape and rob the weak. The weak tolerate or die. Simple as hell.

Treachery is as welcomed as brutal power. All the means are accepted to achieve goals. The laws are only as strong as you may enforce them.

Sounds like a right place to live, eh? Then move here. But remember: no whines about amorality.
