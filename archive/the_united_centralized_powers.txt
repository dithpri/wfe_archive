Death to the Capitalist Scourge that has plagued the International Community for Centuries. Prepare for a new face of the world to be born, a face of triumph and unyielding honor. Now is the time Comrades of the world for us to unite as brothers and crush the unknowing Capitalist Regimes of the world. Freedom is paid for in blood, and fought for by those willing to serve. Let us remember the code that binds us, a code as old as time in memorial. Let us remember, always, that the test of a man&amp;#39;s bravery is not how he fights in war, but how he uses the spoils of that victory gained through war. Long live the United Centralized Powers, long may we reign dominant in the world.
