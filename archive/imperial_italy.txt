[b]This is the situation now: in a decadent Europe, weakened by vice, perverted by exotic habits, striving deliriously to attain the dreams of social-democratic humanitarianism, the only vital principle is Fascist Italy. Europe no longer has any faith: it does not attach any real importance to religious values, but only to money, to the individual, and the collective instinct for survival, to the pursuit of enjoyment, and to a peaceful life. Fascist Italy - Catholic, disciplined, and war-like - will be able to dominate Europe if it can defend its physical and moral health. This is our programme. &#151; Benito Mussolini
