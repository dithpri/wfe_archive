Die trockene Belagerung

Otherwise known as &quot;the dry siege&quot; a ash filled region next to a unnaturally sized mega volcano
Was known for it&#39;s constant strain of sieges and raids

Throughout valla kalt&#39;s history. Fire,and magma were commonly used as weapons of war to the point of &quot;ash fell&quot; falling from the clouds

Ruining the fertility of valla
And its people as a whole 

Originally the &quot;siege&quot; was of plains and mountains

Castles and villages strung around the region all flourishing.. that all changed when many of Valla kalt&#39;s volcanos erupted turning belagerung like many other regions to despair and decline.

Although unlike the other regions some say 
The damned still wanders the land in search for their bodies killing the living out of envy...
