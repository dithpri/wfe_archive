[color=#DAA520]Formal Greetings to all!

We welcome you to the Cordisian Confederation. Here we value peace, rights and freedom. All members of the Confederation have rights to express their political views. However, it is a somewhat small region, therefore regional offices are open to nations that wish to acquire them.

Many thanks.

[i]&quot;We lend aid, to all who yearn for peace.&quot;[/i][/color]
