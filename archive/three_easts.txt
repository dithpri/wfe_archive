Welcome to the [b]Three Easts[/b] - strange region of sovereign realms where each nation reflects a distinct vision of order, chaos, utopia, or the tragic dance between them. There is no single truth here - only endless versions of reality, coexisting on a fragile balance of mutual respect or strategic indifference.

The Three Easts welcomes those unafraid to question their own ideals. Here, everyone finds their truth.
