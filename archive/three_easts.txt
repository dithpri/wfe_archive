Welcome to the [b]Three Easts[/b] - strange region of sovereign realms where each nation reflects a distinct vision of order, chaos, utopia, or the tragic dance between them. There is no single truth here - only endless versions of reality, coexisting on a fragile balance of mutual respect or strategic indifference.

Within its cold forums and shadowy chambers, debate rages: What matters more - stability or freedom, tradition or progress, the individual or the system? While factions forge alliances, wage wars, and sign peace accords, the very structure of the region shifts - like water in a mirror, reflecting a sky before the storm.

The Three Easts welcomes those unafraid to question their own ideals. Here, everyone finds their truth.
