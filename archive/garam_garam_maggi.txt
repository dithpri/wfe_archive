Maggi Wastelands History:

The Maggi Wastelands was once shared by the GGM Nations as the official central capital named Gary Bachistan. 2 years ago, the Muffstanbul government was planning a secret nuclear attack on Bazzi Baschistan due to their anti-dark-skinned desi agenda. Bazzi Baschistani agents had already infiltrated the Muffstanbul government as top officials. Their plan was to release the nuke from the jet while it was still over Muffstanbul territory, but they were too late and accidentally dropped it over Gary Bachistan. The entire population was wiped off the map, and the blame was placed on Mustafa due to his infamously incompetent leadership.
