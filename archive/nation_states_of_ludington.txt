The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches are held by the Region Founder and active Delegate. If there is ever a disagreement between the Founder or the Delegate, the advantage will go to the founder. However, if the Delegate can access three votes from three other nations in the region, this action will over see the Region Founders veto or pass. If nations in the region do not like passed legislation, a eighty percent required vote among the region nations will terminate any passed legislation between the Founder or the Delegate.
