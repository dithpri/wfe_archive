The Nations States of Ludington (NSL) is a proud, young and growing region. We all have different political views but we have come together and united into an alliance. As of now, to join our region you must be from Ludington or have a friend in this region. You do not have to comply with our standings on issues or ideas. Our WA Delegate is from The Empire of Vakarians, our founder is The Kingdom of New England. The Allied States of the Royale Islands also plays a important role. These three nations as of now hold voting power in the NSL.
