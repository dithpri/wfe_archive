The [b]League of the Brotherhood and Unity[/b] ([i]Savez Bratstva i Jedinstva[/i], [i]SBJ[/i]) is a third-way communist front opposed to any teachings from Western Marxists ([i]bourgeois apologia[/i]) or Eastern Marxists ([i]reactionaries[/i]). It relies on the teachings of [b]Josip Broz Tito[/b] but also modifies some of the critical mistakes Tito made to avoid regional inequality and overreliance on foreign credit. The ideology of SBJ is [b]Neo-Titoism[/b]. We believe that market socialism is necessary for economic growth and positive social welfare. Still, we must not allow too much of the market influence so as not to distance ourselves and delve into capitalism.
