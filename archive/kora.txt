Kora is a welcoming region that allows all types of nations. Nations may come and go as they please. There is no regional government, allowing the greatest autonomy possible among nations in this region. The only region wide regulation is no members, current or former member of the World Assembly Legislation League (WALL) are allowed in this region. Any nation found to be hiding a current or former association with WALL shall be immediately ejected and banned from this region by the region founder. This is due to a fundamental disagreement with WALL&#39;s strategies and practices. All other World Assembly member nations are welcomed.
