Ruled by Ordoria, the capital and birthplace of Ordorian ideology, this collection of states is comprised of those who are willing to bring the best of every political system together. Within time, the combined effort of all involved nations will be able to find the perfect political system, one where inequality, poverty, and other problems of the people are but a nightmare, rather than a living one. The world needs a new way to manage itself, and the Ordorians have the ways to do it.
