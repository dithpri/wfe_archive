[B]The ERN, EPSA, TAC, and TEA went out for some fun in honor of the amazing, soon to be Honored Citizen [nation]Pichtonia[/nation]. The incredibly accurate, Europeian Tri-Barreled Shotgun/Party Cannon 9000 had great results! While a few party-poopers clogged Barrel C, the Party Cannon 9000 was still able to rain down fun and cheer across NationStates.
