The [b]Isles of Shoals[/b] are a group of small islands and tidal ledges situated approximately 6 miles off the east coast of the United States, straddling the border of the states of Maine and New Hampshire.

Appledore Island, in Maine, is the largest of the Isles of Shoals. Second in size, Star Island is located in New Hampshire. Smuttynose Island is the third-largest island. It&#39;ss allegedly the site of Blackbeard&#39;s honeymoon, later for the shipwreck of the Spanish ship Sagunto in 1813, and then for the notorious 1873 murders of two young women. The latter is recalled in the story, [i]The Weight of Water[/i] by Anita Shreve and in the film of the same name. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
