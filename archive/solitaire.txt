Patience (Europe), card solitaire or solitaire (US/Canada), is a genre of card games whose common feature is that the aim is to arrange the cards in some systematic order or, in a few cases, to pair them off in order to discard them. Most are intended for play by a single player, but there are also &quot;excellent games of patience for two or more players&quot;.

&#39;Patience&#39; is the earliest recorded name for this type of card game in both British and American sources. The word is French in origin, these games being &quot;regarded as an exercise in patience.&quot;
