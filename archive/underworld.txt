[i][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9AexiRyPc0][color=darkred]The dragon[/color][/url] [color=darkred] stood on the shore of the sea.
And I saw a beast coming out of the sea.
It had ten horns and seven heads,
With ten crowns on its horns,
And on each head a blasphemous name.
The beast I saw resembled a leopard,
But had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion.
The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.[/color][/i][hr][b][i][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RPkJeziNyI][color=darkblue]Through me[/color][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKggnBh2Mdw][color=darkblue]you go into a[/color][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5Nx5yw5Ihc][color=darkblue]city of weeping, [/color][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXH-to1LqpQ][color=darkblue]Through me[/color][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd60nI4sa9A][color=darkblue]you go into[/color] [/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t99bpilCKw][color=darkblue]eternal pain,[/color][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6vqPUM_FE][color=darkblue]Through me[/color][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XacvydVrhuI][color=darkblue]you go amongst[/color][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrdpliMfoAM][color=darkblue]the lost people.[/color][/url][/i][/b]
