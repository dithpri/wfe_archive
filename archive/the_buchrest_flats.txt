This is a very large region. Fit for only capitalistic nations who don&amp;#39;t wish to deal with similar problems separated. Newcomers are welcome, but not all ideologies are welcome here. Only conservative and libertarian ideologies are welcome. Other left-wing, communist/socialist ideologies are highly frowned upon by the regional community.

The militaries of this region are the strongest around. Though the nations are quite small, the technological advances within the militaries of the region are shared and/or traded within the regional community. With this power, TBF is nearly impossible to invade, Muhahaha.
