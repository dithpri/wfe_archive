The International Allies are a group of nations that focus on making the world a better, safer, and healthier place by reducing carbon emissions, using green energy, offering above average welfare systems, equal rights, eliminating crime, and giving everyone a fair and great change at a great life. Eliminating crime is tough, but can be done by making prisons less violent, and used as rehabilitation centers that fix the mental or physical cause of crime instead of punishing the crime itself. We also focus on making scientific advancements to improve this world, not harm it. To be a member of The International Allies you must have a Civil Rights rank of &#147;Average&#148; or above. You must also have a Political Freedoms rank of &#147;Average&#148; or above.
