&amp;#39;Purge the dissenter, crush the offender.&amp;#39;

&amp;quot;Let us remember the great victory over the vile, wretched mercenaries of the Army for Hire. We had proven ourselves to be too strong for invasion, and thus our enemies had attempted to corrupt us from within, but, with a great campaign of counter-infiltration, we managed to force the Army for Hire to it&amp;#39;s knees with their own agents. We had corrupted them from within like a cancer, and they had been fools to believe we could be conquered! Long live Newearthland!!!!!&amp;quot;
