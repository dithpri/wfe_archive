[color=purple][b]It&#39;s Dagger Day in [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region]! Once a year on the 29th of December, all the assassins come together to show some love to their favorite killing implement! This year we had plenty of new initiates joining in the celebrations! To show their stuff, they decided to host a knife throwing competition. One by one, they stepped up to the target and let their practice daggers loose, each hitting the bullseye right in the middle! Happy Holidays![/color]
