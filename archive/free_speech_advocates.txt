This region is here to protect the absolute freedom of speech that is inherent to all of mankind, and essential for debate and progress. As a result, we welcome all, from the reaches of the Holocaust deniers to the Communists to the anarchists to those who would see a great religious governance. We call especially on the outcasts, those rejected from their regions due to alleged &quot;trolling&quot;, or for their views. We hope to engage in lively debate and discussion, and bring other regions the full realisation that truth can only be achieved insofar as there s freedom to tell it.

Above all we believe in Voltaire&#39;s famous quote: &quot;I disapprove of what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it.&quot;
