Inside one of the larger cave systems, lies an underground complex where all of the dictators ruling in this region come together every year to dicuss issues, called the [color=red]Internation Council of Dictators[/color].  Dictators also use this complex to imprison, torture, and kill the most charasmatic and powerful civil rights activists, rebel leaders, and political rivals.  Like the [color=green]World Assembly[/color] there is a [color=orange]General Council[/color] and a [b][color=black]Security Council[/b][/color].
