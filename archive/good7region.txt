Formed by [nation]Frotesca[/nation] and [nation]Greater Souxesta Swakerienej[/nation]:

Independent and great.
Small but united.
Voluntary but cooperative.

Welcome to a newly founded region!
We felt oppressed between all those big regions.
Don&#39;t you? 
We are a small region. But we are independent. We go our own way. And every member can participate in governing. 
Thus, our small region is a democratic one. 
But, we have a new enacted policy of isolationism. Want to participate? Ask for the code to Frotesca!
