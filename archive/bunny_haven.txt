Throughout all of mankind&#39;s era, humanity has proven themselves incapable of protecting bunnies efficiently. Until now. This will be the one place where all bunnies may take sanctuary to thrive and prosper. I, the Bunny King, hereby vow to protect all of bunnykind. One day, we will rule this world. You needn&#39;t be a bunny in physical form, but in spirit! All are welcome to join us in our noble cause. Let the bunnies rise again!
