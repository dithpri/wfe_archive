In the year 2025, everything changed when a 4 kilometer asteroid named &#147;Hersh&#148; (nicknamed from its discover, George Hersh) crashed into Colorado. Causing a apocalypse across the world as a Ice Age covered the world for 3000 years, over 7 billion people died, with fewer than 100 million escaping to bunkers. Eventually humans leave the bunkers to build a new world. Nations have been forged in the remnants of North America, completely cut off from the outside world, what path will your nation take? The Date is 112 LTB (Left the Bunkers), marking 112 years after humans left the bunkers.
