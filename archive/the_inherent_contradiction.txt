&amp;quot;A revolution is more than a mere change of the prevailing political system. It implies the awakening of human intelligence, the increasing of the inventive spirit tenfold, a hundredfold; it is the dawn of a new science... It is a revolution in the minds of men, as deep, and deeper still, than in their institutions.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!&amp;quot; cries she
With silent lips. &amp;quot;Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&amp;quot;
