News: Election season is back in session! As always, send a slogan you want next to your name on the ballot (EX: Peace and Pigs) along with the formal name of your nation if you so choose and what you&#39;re running for. I have sent a more in-depth version of what you can do to all Citizens. Liberalia&#39;s choice has been updated with the new positions available. Good luck!
