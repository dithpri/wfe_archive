The Coalition of Fecal Producing States (CFPS) is located in a valley surrounded by large, breathtaking mountains.  It is renowned for it&#39;s miles of lush green fields, clean rivers, and god-awful stench that is constantly lingering in the air. A region home to a tight knit group of nations, The Coalition is dedicated to the agricultural production of animal waste product; for the purpose of mass exportation.  Countries in this region have large agricultural sectors and are dedicated to the regional goal of a global manure monopoly.
