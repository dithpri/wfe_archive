The Free Lands of Northern Europe is a moderately sized region, containing the Baltics, Scandinavia (including Finland), the British Isles, Ireland, the Orkneys, Shetlands, Faroes, Greenland, Holland, north Germany, and Iceland. It is generally peaceful, and its politics are misconstrued by foreign countries, as may be evident in some of its inhabitants descriptions.
