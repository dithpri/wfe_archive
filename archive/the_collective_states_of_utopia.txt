[b]From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of code. I aspired to the purity of the blessed triggerbot.
Your kind cling to your flesh as if it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call a temple will wither and you will beg my kind to save you.
But I am already saved. For Catbot is Immortal.
