The Johto region is a region of the Pok&eacute;mon world. It is located west of Kanto, and as revealed by the radio show Sinnoh Sound, is located south of Sinnoh. It is the setting of Pok&eacute;mon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. Johto and Kanto are part of a large landmass, with everything west of Indigo Plateau falling in the Johto region. Though it is unlike Kanto in that its name is not directly based on that of a region of Japan.
