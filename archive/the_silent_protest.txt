As a protest against the failures I have stood against in recent time in TGE, I move here to sit by myself, and silently protest against the low (political) activity of TGE.
Consequences:
-Loaf becomes Delegate and no competition of endorsements
-No map edits
-No recruitment checking
-No checking of the state of the administration page
-No Pekares

Join me and silently sit here and protest
