There is nobody more powerful than he who has embraced the darkness.
There is nobody more powerful than he who has attained the light.
There is nobody more powerful than he who has the best of both worlds.

He who is a master of both the devil&amp;#39;s tricks and the games of angels, can surpass anyone who has reached their limit on but a single side.
