The main objective of the IADN is the economic development of its members, through collaborative policies in the commercial market, and stabilizing political structures.  The implementation of its own currency used by the bloc helps as an entry barrier to the foreign market and strengthens internal trade relations.  Even with few members, temporarily, the group already shows signs of high performance in its early years.
