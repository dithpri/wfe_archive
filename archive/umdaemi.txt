A nation founded on the principles of communism, tyranny, oppression. When you join us, you are joining a proud group of powerful nations and leaders. While it isn&#39;t required, it is recommended that any nations not currently in the World Assembly, should join as soon as possible. Although it is not required to be a WA member you can not be an officer in Umdaemi without being a member. Our World Assembly Delegate can&#39;t do his/her job to the best of their power unless you take an active role in the world.
