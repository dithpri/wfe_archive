The Western Colonies is an active region consisting of a compassionate union of nations dedicated to achieving paradise on earth, through a new world order.

The region, created by Lord Asado of Tsemandia, is in character and is suitable for role playing. We are open to creating lore and a history of these nations, and the region as a whole.
