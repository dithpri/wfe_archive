The Western Colonies is a new, small region, consisting of a compassionate union of nations dedicated to achieving paradise on earth, through a new world order.

The region, created by Lord Asado, King of Tsemandia, is in character and is suitable for role playing. We are open to creating lore and a history of these nations and have a system of battle simulation ready to resolve any conflicts. The region is currently getting set up on government, but as of now, a map and flag have been produced. If you want to check out the current status of the Western Colonies, check out:
