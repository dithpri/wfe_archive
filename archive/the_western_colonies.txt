[color=red][b]WELCOME TO THE WESTERN COLONIES![/b][/color]

WestCol is a dedicated Roleplaying region, which has been active since 2012. In the past 7+ years this community has developed a vast and complex lore, spanning over three centuries in-context and involving hundreds of separate nations. If you&#39;re interesting in adding to the annals of WestCol, move a nation here and message [nation]Pyraz[/nation] to claim your space on the map! This region also possesses its own government and constitution, including a list of regional rules and guidelines, pinned under this regional description. Give them a skim to get started!
