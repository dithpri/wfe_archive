Are tankies comrades? No. They are red fascists. They are opportunists in fact. They simply pretend to be leftists and try to bring in impressionable people with their cool soviet aesthetics. Thomas Stalin, the inventor of state capitalism created Soviet China. The PLA (Pooh&#146;s Liberation Army) killed like 600 thousand students in Tiny Man Square. A tankie once told me &#147;I care about the people too.&#148; Yikes, not a good look. That&#146;s something that fascists also say. They try to talk about &#147;material conditions&#148; and &#147;class contradictions.&#148; They think they&#146;re so smart with their theory reading. Good thing that Chairman Vaush does all of the thinking for us. He reads theory for us and reads us quotes that justify voting for Joe Biden.
