The Arctic Circle is one of the two polar circles, and the most northerly of the five major circles of latitude as shown on maps of Earth. Its southern equivalent is the Antarctic Circle. The climate north of the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of larger continents have a generally mild climate as a result of the Gulf Streams, which make the ports of northern Continents  ice-free all year long. Regions inside of the Arctic Circle comprise of Small Archipelagos to Vast frozen deserts and glaciers and Tundras.
