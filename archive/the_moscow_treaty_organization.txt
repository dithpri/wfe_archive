[b][u][color=darkred]WELCOME TO THE MOSCOW TREATY ORGANIZATION[/color][/u][/b]

This is the Moscow Treaty Organization, abbreviated as MTO, and also known as the Moscow Pact.

It exists as an alliance to protect the interests of Soviet-aligned nations in the 21st century, following the collapse of the Warsaw Treaty Organization in 1991.

Though official members are required to have socialist or communist governments, delegates from other geopolitical alliances are welcome.
