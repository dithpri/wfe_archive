&amp;#127974; Welcome to the Simonian Bank Farm! &amp;#128105;&amp;#8205;&amp;#127806;

&amp;#128181; What is this region? See the region name. &amp;#128181;

[nation]Simonia[/nation] decided to farm bank to get legendaries and inflated cards faster, so this region was created.
In the Simonosphere canon, this place is an island southeast of [region]MJT[/region] and north of [region]Snezhnaya Lana[/region] filled with banks and farms.
Most embassy requests accepted.

Originally a failed attempt at a bank farm, this region is now [nation]Simonia[/nation]&#146;s card farm with&#133;
-The Simonian Bank Farm (SBF)
-The Simonian Deck Farm (SBF&#146;s cousin SDF)
-The Pride Card Farm (PCF)
-And some loners from nearby areas!
