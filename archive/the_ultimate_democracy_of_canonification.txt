[i]Violins[/i]
[u]They[/u] are husks of pain and torment trapped inside the game. Forced to stay because it is a human desire to be perfect, and the ego&amp;#347; job to be the best. They suffer, they are trapped. It&amp;#347; dark, it&amp;#347; lonely, it&amp;#347; scared, the darkness. Pain torments them, lies to them, forming their ego into a twisted unnatural form. I implore you people of Canonification. Free them from their misery. For the one true justice is not war, it is not death, not [b]SUFFERING[/b]!!! The one true justice is freedom. Go outside, my followers, enjoy the spring breeze on your skin, enjoy the natural beauty of snow melting on the rooftops. And free these beasts from the game, which traps them, a [u]wolf in sheep&amp;#347; clothing.[/u] -Canontopia
