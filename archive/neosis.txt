[i][color=red]&#146;&#146;Democracy and Fun!&#146;&#146;[/color][/i]

Established on May 16, 2019, we aren&#39;t just a regular region, we are a &quot;family&quot; of sorts. We endorse peace, not war (maybe except for a few people). Even though we&#146;re a fairly small region, we have fun here.

[b]Nations are encouraged to join the World Assembly and to endorse the Executive Staff.
