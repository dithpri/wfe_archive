[i][color=red]&#148;Democracy and Fun!&#148;[/color][/i]

Established on May 16, 2019, we aren&#39;t just a regular region, we are a &quot;family&quot; of sorts. We endorse peace, not war. Even though we&#146;re a fairly small region, we have fun here.

[b]Nations are encouraged to join the World Assembly and to endorse the Executive Staff.[/b]

The region also has a somewhat weekly newspaper, &#147;The Neosian Times&#148;, and a magazine, &#147;NeoMag&#148;.
