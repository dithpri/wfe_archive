Welcome! [b][color=#244280]Anterra[/color][/b] is a modern-tech, closed-world worldbuilding group. We were originally an NS region, but have moved entirely to our [url=https://discord.gg/xUYARD8]Discord[/url] and independent [url=https://anterra.miraheze.org/]Wiki[/url]. We&#39;re always looking for active and competent worldbuilders/roleplayers - or just kind people. 

If you&#39;re interested, join our [url=https://discord.gg/xUYARD8]Discord[/url] to talk about roleplaying, military topics, design, and banter! We&#39;ll guide you in the right direction.
