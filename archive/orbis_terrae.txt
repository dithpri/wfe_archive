It is the 1980s, and the world is on the brink of war once more. Following an extremely turmoilous period that began in the mid-30s and continued until well into the 60s, the world has been healing and rebuilding. Such times of peace never last, however. The United Kingdom of Goram, in their incessant lust for more territory, eyes up invading the weaker breakaway republics left behind the fallen Pragian and Dean Empires. In Africa, the Gibetan VDVR seeks to spread the tenets of Socialism to the neighbouring nations that had previously been Gibetan soil. In Europe, Iander, which fashions itself as a Union of Republics, intends to regain territory lost during the civil war, with the end goal to establish itself as a superpower once more.
