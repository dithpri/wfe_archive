[i][color=#a6bcb9]&quot;The hallowed halls of virtuous cynics waiting to be heard or not heard.&quot;[/color][/i][hr][color=#435b58]We are currently waiting to begin drafting a constitution.

All government activities, roleplay, and other fun will be held on our off-site forum which will be completed shortly.

Once the draft is completed, we will have a regional vote to enact it. From there, we can begin writing, amending, and voting to develop Cassius.
