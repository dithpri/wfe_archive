[b][color=#3ad1bf]Greetings and welcome to[/color] [color=#24756b]Cassius[/color][color=#3ad1bf]![/color][/b]

[i][color=#a6bcb9]&quot;The hallowed halls of virtuous cynics waiting to be heard or not heard.&quot;[/color][/i][hr][color=#435b58]We are currently waiting to begin drafting a constitution.

All government activities, roleplay, and other fun junk will be held on our off-site forum which will be completed shortly.

Once the draft is completed, we will have a regional vote to enact it, giving all those that vote citizenship. From there, we can begin writing, amending, and voting to develop Cassius.

Come chat with us on our chat server awhile: [/color][b][url=https://discord.gg/nxpCJgD]Click Here[/url][/b][hr][b]For the time being, World Assembly members should endorse [nation=short]A Classless Society[/nation]
