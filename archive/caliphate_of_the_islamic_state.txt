This is the [b]Worldwide Caliphate[/b] under the [b]Islamic State[/b].

As a universal faith, Islam envisages a global political order in which all mankind will live under Muslim rule as either believers or subject communities. In order to achieve this goal it is incumbent on all free, male, adult Muslims to carry out an uncompromising struggle ([i]jihad[/i]) in the path of Allah. This in turn makes those parts of the world that have not yet been conquered by the Islam an abode ([i]dar al-harb[/i]) of permanent conflict  which will only end with Islam&#39;s eventual triumph.
