Dravallian Fatherland pretty much this. Do what you want, as long as you don&amp;#39;t stop other people from doing what they want. Heres the rules in short:

       &#149; The founder isn&amp;#39;t going anywhere

       &#149; You like it here stay, you don&amp;#39;t then leave

       &#149; You want something then ask for it.

       &#149; You should try to keep personal freedoms high, but it&amp;#39;s only a sugestion.
