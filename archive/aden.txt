[color=green]If the king eats one apple from the garden of a subject 
his slaves will pull him up the tree from the roots.
For five eggs which the sultan allows to be taken by force 
the people belonging to his army will put a thousand fowls on the spit.
A tyrant does not remain in the world but the curse on him abides for ever.


We have crept into this corner of grief, 
turning the water wheel with a flow of tears. 
While a tyrant with a heart of flint slays, 
and no one says, &quot;Prepare to pay the blood money.&quot;[/color]
