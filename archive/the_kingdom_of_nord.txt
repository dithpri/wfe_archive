The Kingdom of Nord is an absolute monarchy with the Kingdom of Nordia Lys leading it. The Kingdom of Nord is known for its great cuisine and rich culture. Initially, the Kingdom of Nord was a simple tribe located on a stranded island, and they called themselves the Nordiaas. For the first 500 years, nobody knew about them until a group of explorers from the Kingdom of Nordia Lys discovered them and decided to start a war. Ever since, the Kingdom of Nord has become a place where culture and cuisine come together.
