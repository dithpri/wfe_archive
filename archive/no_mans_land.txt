No Man&amp;#39;s Land is a small semi-real island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, a retreat for non-interventionist isolationists. It strongly disapproves of the WA as well as all other instruments of NWO but will not fight them. No Man&amp;#39;s Land firmly believes that everyone should just be left alone, safe from state as well as any other form of intervention, encroachment or assault.

Currently, No Man&amp;#39;s Land&amp;#39;s only member country is [nation]Flondland[/nation]. Other nations seeking refuge from the world may apply for admission to Flondland&amp;#39;s regent Catholiban. WA and No Man&amp;#39;s Land membership are mutually exclusive.
