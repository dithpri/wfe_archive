Hello! Welcome to the International Centralized Region, or ICR for short. Currently, this region is of small size. To us, new members are signs of growth, and every single nation counts. Unequal treatment is strictly prohibited and no one, under any circumstances, shall be judged by their views or beliefs. 

You can decide to stay or leave whenever you want, and your decisions are none of my business. The ICR&#39;s political standing is mostly democratic, though our origins is of communism. We accept nations of any size, belief, etc. 

Additionally, we also value the economy and industry. Our military are as proficient as ever, using profits from businesses. With that said, I welcome you to these lands.
