A strongly pro-LGBT frontier if you couldn&#39;t tell by the name.

Site rules will be enforced here, and homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, or any other form of hate, [u]will result in a ban, a trip to the rejected realms, and suppression of all RMB posts[/u], so if you&#39;re anti-LGBT and you spawned here, save us a lot of trouble and move along to a new region (or create your own, which you can do at any time).

Please endorse [nation]Neu California[/nation] as the region delegate. They will endorse you back. You may freely endorse others, but make sure to keep under 50% of Neu California&#39;s endorsements.
