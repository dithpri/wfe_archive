Welcome to ULIF! Here are some details:
-Communistic and Capitalistic nations are both welcome
-At east 1/3 of nations are expected to join the World Assembly (more details on that later!)
-We expect all members to treat one another as equals, no matter what
The WA is where ULIF seeks to spread their message of left wing policies and expand democratic ideas and ideals. Members of the WA are asked to endorse at least one other member nation. Our WA Vice Delegate and Founder, &amp;#64;Meretica, is currently the only member of the World Assembly. We hope to change that by building up our region and encouraging others to join the WA!
