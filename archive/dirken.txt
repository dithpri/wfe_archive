A region full of variety of people and terrains. From the ignorant bigots of religious zeal to the intellects of compassion and the sub-culture of ganja grazing hippies. Dirken has every landscape a region could offer from the barren frozen tundra to tropical forest and beautiful beaches. We are a peaceful nation and mean well to all humans and the like.
