[hr][color=800000]re: EMBASSY OFFERS[list]I have no interest in extending embassies to any region that bans me (or any of my other nations). I am not accepting unsolicited embassy offers at this time. I am playing NSEmbassy Oracle and it requires all embassy offers to be ABORTED, not just ignored or rejected.

I am trying to string all of my regions together as a huge long chain connected by embassies. All of my minor regions will become an embassy region chain.

As for anyone who is spamming, forget about ever getting an embassy.

Not all of my regions are participating, and these will accept most embassy offers. See [b][region=United States of America][/b] for more embassy friendly regions.
