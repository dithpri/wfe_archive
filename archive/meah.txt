Meah is a region covering Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, and part of western China. The region is made up of mostly deserts, with nations surviving off of lakes scattered around the region. Meah is divided into two parts - West Meah, which consists of most of the deserts and lakes, and East Meah, which consists of almost all of the forest land and mountains. Despite covering a desolate region of the area, people living in this region survive off of the Caspian Sea, along with the lakes. We are looking to increase our nation and the countries living here. Will you be the next country to join Meah?
