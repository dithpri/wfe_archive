[colour=gold]Salutations, foreigner, and may you never have to fear us. We are the Kingdom of the Corvids, offering a secure refuge for our newly-turned-sapient family. Raven, crow, magpie; all of our descent and ancestry are welcome here. Even the jays. (Although they&#146;re a tad too optimistic for us.)
[hr]
Here, in the Kingdom, you can:
[*][b]Patrol[/b] the borders for [b]intruders[/b] and [b]ambassadors[/b];

[*][b]Fight[/b] for the [b]safety and security[/b] of the people;

[*][b]Go abroad[/b] on foreign journeys, whether it be for [b]diplomacy[/b] or [b]battle[/b];

[*]Or [b]stay at home[/b] and [b]document[/b] the past, present, and imaginative worlds of the land.[/colour]
