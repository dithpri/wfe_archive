[b]If you can be anything be efficient.[/b][b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and some Red friends from [region]The Communist Bloc[/region], were searching for the rumoured [color=goldenrod]Buried Pastry Stash![/color] said to be hidden by one of our fellow hawks and scattered around various regions! And lo and behold! We have found fragments of it in your region! We are so very grateful, that we have left a parting gift for your region! 

Unfortunately, many more bits and fragments are still unaccounted for. If you seek to aid us in the search, [i][url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Ring us up![/url]![/i] [/b]
