A simple yet robust alliance of the planet&#146;s future superpowers, united by only two binding philosophies, a willingness to seize international authority by any means necessary and enact our will on the world&#146;s population, and a virulent and unjustified hatred of the Italian people. All nations under the alliance accept two realities. The current leadership is weak, immoral, and insensible, and that the people of Italy must be eradicated wherever they reside. Current inter-alliance conflict strains the already uneasy peace, but the nations&#146; continued dedication to the acquisition of international influence and prestige maintains it.
