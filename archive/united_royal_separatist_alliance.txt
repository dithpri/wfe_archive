A simple yet robust alliance of the planet&#146;s future superpowers, united by only two binding philosophies, a willingness to seize international authority by any means necessary and enact our will on the world&#146;s population, and a virulent and unjustified hatred of the dogs that are the Italian people. All nations under the alliance accept two realities. The current leadership is weak, immoral, and insensible, and that the people of Italy must be eradicated wherever they reside. Such it is and so shall it be. Glory to the Alliance.
