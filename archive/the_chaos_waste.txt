Tales speak of a land immersed in perpetual darkness lit only by monumental pillars of flame that soar high into the sky. A place where time has lost its meaning and great champions from the past, present and future fight on, trapped in a world of eternal battle. Here nature itself is cast down, and the very landscape is moulded by the uncaring gods of Chaos. Here, even the earth rebels against what it has become: trees moan in eldritch voices, and the rocks scream their hatred into the skies.
