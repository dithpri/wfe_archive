This is meant to be a dedicated region for the Halo players/fans of the NationStates playerbase. Whether you&#39;re new to Halo or a veteran player since 2001, whether you&#39;re a casual player or a lore nerd, all who share the love for this expansive franchise are welcome to join!

Be [i]respectful[/i] and avoid[i] immature[/i] behavior. Insults and racist/sexist remarks etc. will [b]not[/b] be tolerated. Avoid excessive cursing and let&#39;s keep politics out of this, okay? 

Everything is still work in progress, but come and help us gain traction :-)

WFE and dispatches will be properly set up in the upcoming days.
