The Gypsy Union is a united group part of a region in the Abyss formed by groups of nomadic dark people. They believe that in the regions of the Abyss, everything is owned by the Abyss, and no one can permanently own any land or territory. The people of the Gypsy Union call themselves Void Gypsies for their free-roaming traditions. Void Gypsies travel across the Abyss in a circular pattern known as the Great Cycle.

Like the Abyss Hegemony, the Void Gypsies show some form of dislike or disdain for foreigners.
