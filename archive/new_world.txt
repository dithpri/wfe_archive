Hello ladies, gentlemen and others.

Welcome to the New World. We are a tiny, neutral, and accepting community that&#146;s going to try its hardest to make you feel at home. We promise that unless you say somthing racist or somthing we won&#146;t eject or ban you. There is a regional government, on-site role play (none of that complicated, off-site crap), instant citizenship and voting rights, and maybe more if we accualy get more to join the region.
