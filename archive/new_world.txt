[b][i][u]Welcome to the [region]New World[/region][/u][/I][/b]

[I]What happened to the world? Humanity. Humanity brought bombs, and soldiers, and war. A war that would tear the world apart. Now what to do with the remainder? The remainder is nothing but a loose grouping of empires, dictatorships, nations that need a leader. But, for the times being, there is no leader. There is war.[/I]

[b][I]Will you be the one to end the war?[/I][/b]
