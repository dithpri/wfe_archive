Welcome to the Northern Sacred States, a region consisted of religious and efficient nations. It&#39;s a wonderful place for sacred nations interested in both economic development and high integrity. Here are some requirements for joining us: 

1. Be highly religious: have an atheism rate lower than 15%.

2. Zero tolerance on corruption: have less than four kickbacks per hour.

3. Be an upper-middle income country: have at least more than $40,000 in your country&#39;s average disposable income. You also have to be considered &quot;good&quot; in economy.

4. Be a democracy: have a &quot;good&quot; classification in both civil and political rights.

If you don&#39;t have any of those, sorry, but I&#39;ll have to kick you. Please don&#39;t take this seriously...
