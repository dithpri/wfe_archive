[i][b][color=brightred]What have you done? Listen! Your brother&#146;s blood cries out to me from the soil. And so, cursed shall you be by the soil that gaped with its mouth to take your brother&#146;s blood from your hand. If you till the soil, it will no longer give you strength. [/color][/b][/i]
