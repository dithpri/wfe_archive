The extremely remote and isolated [b]Tkon Inversion[/b] is located deep inside an extra-dimensional subspace inversion &#39;bubble&#39;. Thus [b][nation=short+noflag]the Tkon Empire[/nation][/b] is among the most inaccessible and best protected civilizations existing.

The [b]Tkon Empire[/b] is holding some very limited contacts to the [region]SICON[/region] and the [region]GDI Alliance[/Region].
