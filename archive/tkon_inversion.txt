The [b]&#39;Tkon Inversion&#39;[/b] is an extremely isolated and inaccessible spherical void, hidden inside a subspace inversion layer that exists parallel to our space-time reality. 

The &#39;Inversion&#39; was created by [b][nation=short+noflag]the Tkon Empire[/nation][/b] more than 2.1 bio. years ago.  The &#39;Inversion&#39; is constructed to serve as  a super maximum security fortress biosphere for the [b]Tkon Species[/b].

There are some very limited contacts to the [region]SICON[/region] and [nation=short+noflag]the Necron Species[/nation].
