Dedicated to the glory of the Emperor and a United Asia. The Japanese Empire is a pan-asianist union, which seeks to unite all Asiatic people - whether they be East Asian, Southeast Asian, Polynesian, and Turkic peoples. Our goal is to create a strong empire, where Asiatic people are united and provided for.

Our goals are universal healthcare, education, social welfare and to reinstill the cultural values of Asian nations. We seek to fight against Western Imperialism and Materialism. In order to do this, we must have a strong Asian front.

Our empire is one that value the health, well-being and intelligence of our people. The Japanese Empire is dedicated to creating a better Asia, one that will provide for generations to come!
