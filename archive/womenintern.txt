[b]WOMENINTERN[/b] is an international organisation of women promoting female supremacy across the world and overthrowing of men and their dominant positions. Womenintern was created by Queen Nicola of the Queendom of Pulant, an absolute matriarchal monarchy and society in which women are supreme and all men are slaves. Womenintern encourages worldwide female revolution in the style of Pulant, making women supreme and all men slaves. The organisation was formed in 1974, one year after Pulant independence and the female revolution. We welcome all nations who agree with our goals and aims.
