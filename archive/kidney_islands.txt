[b][color=purple]Kidney Islands[/color][/b] is an archipelago comprised of many small, stunning islands renowned for their kidney-esque shape and wide variety of climates and landscapes. Some of the islands hide in the perpetually existing fog which the more melodramatic residents call [i][color=blue]The Mists of Obscurity[/color][/i]. No one is quite sure just how many islands are obscured by the Mists, but every now and again they will emerge from the shadows and reveal themselves.

Many of the inhabitants of Kidney Islands are devoted to the worship of a bizarre, kidney-stealing grasshopper god known simply as the Kidney Thief, though this has been slowly changing.
