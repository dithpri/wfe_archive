The Eral Islands, previously known as the Aurenda Islands, were freed from the genocidal ways of the Auren Empire during the Western Pacific War and the Auren Civil War. The oppressed Eral people rose up and overthrew the already defeated empire, clearing the way for a new era of peace and inclusivity in this oceanic paradise.
