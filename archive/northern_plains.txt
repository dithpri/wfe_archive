 In the northern region, there are mostly the plains. Those plains have a big amount of forests and lakes with the purest water from far mountains. The fields are filled with grass and flowers, but the fields are mostly surrounded by forests. The coasts of the northern plains are very well developed but have a problem with ice in the winter. The cities are placed on big distance from each other so the railways are the best option to travel between them.
