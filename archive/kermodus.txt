[region]The Black Hawks[/region] and Frens from [region]Kantrias[/region] did a super sneaky slide into your region! We rushed home, unpacked some bags, and then brought out our cloaks of sneakiness to visit your region and leave you this WFE!

We took some cookies from your fridge, drank your [color=pink]strawberry milk[/color], and went absolutely goblin mode, [color=blue]spray painting your walls[/color]. We hope you like the redecoration!
