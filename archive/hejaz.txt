Welcome to Hejaz! Hejaz is located in Saudi Arabia and is a long strip of land on the Red Sea that has the most fertile land in Arabia, and contains Makkah and Madina, Islams major holy cities. We are a Client Region of the [b][region]German Federation[/region][/b], but if we get enough people we would become a protectorate, which would give us a lot of autonomy. So feel free to join, and enjoy your stay in Hejaz!
