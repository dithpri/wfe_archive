[color=blue][B]Al-Hejaz, also Hijaz (literally &amp;quot;the barrier&amp;quot;), is a region in the west of present-day Saudi Arabia. It is bordered on the west by the Red Sea, on the north by Jordan, on the east by Najd and on the south by Asir.[1] Its main city is Jeddah, but it is probably better known for the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. As the site of Islam&amp;#39;s holy places, the Hejaz has significance in the Arab and Islamic historical and political landscape.[/B][/color]
