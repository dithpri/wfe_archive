The Northern Reaches of Southern Canada is for anyone; as long as they are from the continent of Carl or the vast wasteland of Gary. Or maybe you&#39;re from Bulgaria. We don&#39;t really mind.

We come together as a region to celebrate all things strange and slightly unholy, as well as things that are TOO HOLY (ie. Kittens, Baby Otters, and DOOM Eternal).
