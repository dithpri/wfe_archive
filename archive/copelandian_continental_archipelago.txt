the C.C.A. (Copelandian continental archipelago) is located in the south eastern region of the theyhatesean sea, and consists of one micro continent (Copelandia) with many small islands varying in size branching off its north eastern coast. While the micro continent is fully inhabited by the almost anarchic economic power house of the region &quot;The Armed Republic of Copelandia&quot; many of the local islands remain relatively uninhabited and fully open to any government willing to settle on them.
