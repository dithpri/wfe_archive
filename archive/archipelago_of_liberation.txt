Far into the ocean in a secluded part of the world lies the historical birth place of famous pirates, Gangsters, Thieves and Treasure Hunters. That was all hundred of years ago though since the last great pirate Captain Angelo &quot;Flintlock&quot; Smith founded what he called the Archipelago of Liberation a place where people could finally be free of the constraints of tyranny over the mind, body and soul. Smith later went on to name Unified Libertalia the capital nation of this region as a spearhead to ensure no one&#39;s freedom of life and liberty would ever be stepped on again
