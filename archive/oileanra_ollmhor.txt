Oile&aacute;nra Ollmh&oacute;r, (Eng: Huge Archipelago), is a collection of large islands to the far north. While forming five total nations plus a Special Administrative Region. While each country has their own laws and rules, the nations are forced to comply to majority selected laws similar to that of the W.A. and share the currency of the Ollmhorian Di (Pronounced: Die).

The Oile&aacute;nra Ollmh&oacute;r region also enters the Olympics as a single country instead of separate, thanks to a joint agreement to form the Oile&aacute;nra Ollmh&oacute;r Olympic Committee. Union Isle is exempt from this rule, entering as a separate nation.
