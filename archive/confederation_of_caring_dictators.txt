Founded in 2020, we are a region that aims to welcome people that are exiled or has voluntarily left the [region]Confederation of Corrupt Dictators[/region], aiming to nurture a community of dictators that are well accepted by the NS Community OOCly while embracing Dictatorship and our Right-wing Values ICly. We aim to be the premier right-wing RPing region, away from the shadows of the Confederation of Corrupt Dictators, and change the acronyms &quot;CCD&quot; to become something that is welcomed instead of the bad name under the &quot;dictatorship&quot; of Jocospor, ShrewLlamaLand, and whatever poor region that is.
