[Color=Black]Liberated:[/color] December 19th 2020[hr][i]SIEG HEIL! was the proudly energetic exclamation of praise used as a greeting, especially at social events during the Hitler Administration. The crowds answered Heil (Hail!) to the call of Sieg (Victory)

Today the greeting is a simple Heil! without exaggerated gestures.
Only the elite forces of the Reich are permitted to use the full version with salute, and only when in the new Reich&#39;s uniform. 
The first greeting, Heil Selber!, to show loyalty and pride in the new F&uuml;hrer, is followed by Sieg Heil![/i]
