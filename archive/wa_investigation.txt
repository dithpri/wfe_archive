How to create a nation with your desired WA category:

Choose the category.
Search for the nation with the decided category here.
Once you find it, look at the motto.
You&amp;#39;ll find something like &amp;quot;Sensible: 11111111&amp;quot;, this is the way to get your category, the following code will be the key:
0=no answer
1=Strongly Disagree
2=Disagre
3=Agree
4=Strongly Agree
The first thing will be the government type you&amp;#39;ll need, for example, Conservative. Then there will be the 8 digit code which is basically the answers for questions 1 to 8.

Enjoy your new puppet.
