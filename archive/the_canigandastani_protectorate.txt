Recently, there was an &amp;quot;invasion.&amp;quot; I use this term very lightly, as the attempt was an utter failure and the cowards are gone. We stood to protect those nations seeking shelter from oppressors. We sought to aid the helpless, the downtrodden, the poor nations who stood no chance. By taking over the region, they have compromised this promise. Now that NC is back, this will not happen again.  If you, or your friends, or anyone you know would like to try to usurp the power of New Canigandastan, remember this: You have already failed. Give up. We have assumed direct control of our region, and it will not slip from our grasp again. In light of the outrage that The Covenant have committed, a new foreign policy has been decreed: suck a fat one.
