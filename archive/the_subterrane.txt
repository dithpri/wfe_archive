The Subterrane is an enormous, sprawling cave network connecting the entirety of the world. In fact, it&#39;s almost like an entirely new world under the rest. Despite such, it&#39;s relatively well-lit, at least where Cugia&#39;s influence can be seen. The darker corners of it, though, are crawling with reptilians from beneath and beyond, though Cugia is losing this battle, and welcomes help, if not at the expense of their own territory or people.
