The ultimate land of social darwinism. A beautiful land where well endowed men and busty/big bootied women fight it out to the death. A land where violence is the norm, oppression is essential, corruption is rampant, lifting weights/running is mandatory, and bacon centered, high fat diets infuse too much testosterone into its inhabitants. Thankfully, all vegetables, low glycemic carbs, and laziness have been outlawed. Anabolic steroid, blood replacement, and genetic tinkering programs in each nation all promote the goal of the region, the search for human perfection.
