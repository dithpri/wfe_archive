This is it, thanks by others and myself, I come to this point. First lost, then got something, and then lost everything again, like when you sleep going to dream, and be awake then by you own faults.

Sorry&amp;#39;s was not enough anymore, whole long words of excuses wasn&amp;#39;t working anymore, I gone too far, too much drama, too much suffering others of me existing.

Its enough, I caused too much drama and suffering for others, its time to close the book.

Goodbye.

It was fine to know you all &amp;lt;3

NOTE, PLZ READ: I don&amp;#39;t feel depressed nor be suicidal, I just take a break, at least that&amp;#39;s the plan, don&amp;#39;t worry.
