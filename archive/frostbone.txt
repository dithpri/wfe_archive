Arctic region forgotten by time, with icy winters and giant sea creatures under the ice.  Libraries are cathedrals, folklore is religion, and problems are yours.  People live far away from each other, and loneliness is greatly appreciated.  Your neighbors won&#39;t be close enough to hear you screaming at night.
