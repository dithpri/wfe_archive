Omega Syndicate was formed when a corporation in a neighboring region that sucked dry all resources and enslaved many people. Friendly local corporations joined. Some arms dealers decided to stay. Technological nations joined the fight and offered space travel.So the Omega Syndicate is a loosely based collision of diverse but unified nations with common goals. Who become unified to destroy the tyranny of the corporation that ruined them by: going on late night sabotage of opposing military vehicle&#39;s, setting bombs off on oil supply lines, mid day theft of corrupt big banks, off shore stock piles of rations and secret espionage to collect information on our enemy.
