The Omega Syndicate was formed when a corporation in a neighboring region had agitated a revolution among some underdeveloped nations. Aside from revolutionaries; local organizations and even black market arms dealers decided to join and unity was truly achieved when super-technological nations joined and offered space travel. Omega Syndicate is a loosely based coalition of diverse but unified nations with common goals who became unified to destroy the tyranny of the corporation that oppressed them. Tactics included mass sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Now; power is distributed in complete equality among the nations, giving each of them a voice in the well oiled machine that kept them bound together through the uprising and beyond.
