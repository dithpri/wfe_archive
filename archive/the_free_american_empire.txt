The Free American Empire is an entity which is seen in Hearts of Iron 4 when the United States follows the fascist section of its focus tree. It is a fascist and unitary state driven by nationalism and a strong sense of &quot;America First&quot;, and aims to encompass much of the Western Hemisphere. This region has been preemptively founded to keep it out of the hands of radical leftists and rightists alike.
