[b]!Welcome to the coldest place on earth![/b]

the eastern ice fields are rich in diversity AND oil (not to mention ice). our government is a mix of socialism and democracy, so feel free to join no matter what form of government you have! we are always up for opening embassies! and if you want to become our delegate we hold an election every two months! but be warned we have a no-tolerance policy for bullying or any kind of rude behaviour.

we do hope you enjoy your life in the coldest place on earth
