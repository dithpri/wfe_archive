defend.[/color]

[color=red]There is an election every two
weeks on Monday (Eastern
time) for delegate, you are
only allowed two terms but
once we run out of candidates
we will start over.[/color]

[color=yellow] The runner
up will be Co-Delegate.
Current Co-Delagate[/color]: empty -[color=violet]has
the power of a delegate but
has to go through the current
delegate or founder first.
