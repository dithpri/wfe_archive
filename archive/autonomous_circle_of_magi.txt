[color=blue]Welcome to the Autonomous[/color] [color=lightpurple]Circle of Magi[/color], where Chantry has loose control with its restrictive laws and maleficars and apostates can train their magic, to a moralistic point. right now it&#39;s only working as Sir Merlin&#39;s puppet storage, but hopefully it will open it borders and release the knowledge of magic to all.
