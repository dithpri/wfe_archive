[b]Das Oberste Deutsche V&ouml;lkerreich [/b]

The Deutsches V&ouml;lkerreich is not the nation the world pleads for &#151; it is the one it deserves. Where others have traded strength for softness and principle for fleeting fashions, we endure. Here, duty outweighs indulgence, truth stands above comfort, and the call of blood, family, and homeland is unbroken. We are not shaped by the world&#146;s weakness; we are its reckoning, the iron reminder that order, sacrifice, and identity cannot be erased.

[i]Heil dir, V&ouml;lkerreich![/i]
