&amp;#10050; Our Five Principles:
1. We acknowledge the crucial importance of native European culture, the sovereignty of European folks, and accept confederates as the tireless pursuers of their interests and guardians of culture and folk.
2. We reject rampant internationalism and the insidious globalization and Marxism it entails&#151;opposing its many forms.
3. We accept a wide range of nationalist ideologues; from democrats to oligarchs to autocrats.
4. We consist of ethnic nations of Celts, Teutonic Germans and Nords, Brythonic Clans, Uralic Peoples, Slavic Tribes, and Greco-Roman Houses. 
5. We swear loyalty to our people first, to the our gods second, and to this confederation third.
