Our United States subjugates the whole world&amp;#8232;
Like a gigantic bear from the East.&amp;#8232;
The sheep wander aimlessly, without any cause,&amp;#8232;
Yet the Trump Eagle is on the hunt.

Our Brotherhood is a good life, 
Our generosity is without compare.&amp;#8232;
All those with us are strong,&amp;#8232;
All those against us, beware
It&#39;d be a shame if we had hardships.

To all those against us, it&#39;s not worth your while 
if we were to turn you to ashes
We thank you profoundly, and bow to you deeply,&amp;#8232;
From the mightiest nation in all the world.
