&amp;#28961;&amp;#39364;&amp;#12384;&amp;#12290;This is now a territory of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=bedetopia][color=cyan][B]Bedetopia[/B][/color][/url] and the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=bedetopian_network][color=cyan][B]Bedetopian Network[/B][/color][/url]!

The [color=cyan][B]Electric Dictator Bedebao[/B][/color] didn&#39;t forget about that little group of annoyances called The Iron Order... okay, he actually did and had to be reminded by [color=darkviolet][B]Pain[/B][/color], who had monitored their remote lands and waited for an opportunity to strike. So he sent Pain to go capture the [region]Iron Order Military Base[/region].

But wait, there&#39;s more! [color=cyan]Commander Ichi[/color] also noticed another vulnerability in TIO&#39;s defenses and asked Bedebao if he could go capture that. Obviously, he said yes, and Ichi captured this military base at the same time Pain was done with the first one! A double attack!
