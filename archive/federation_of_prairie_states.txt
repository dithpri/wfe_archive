So said He, in all his holy wisdom: &quot;Hot dogs are sandwiches&quot;
The forsaken crowd rejected His holy word, spewing hatred from their frothing maws
The non-believers&#39; minds rejected the truth of the Lord. They sought no reality other than that of which they had grown into
Their ignorance bred hate as is the nature of humans
Only by embracing the harsh truths of the Lord can harmony be achieved.
                                                                            -Albaugh, 5:7
