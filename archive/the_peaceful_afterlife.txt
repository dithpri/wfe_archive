This peaceful region doesn&#39;t do elections. This region is more likely to be the most peaceful region of all.
We let in refugees, or those who need some rest from the drama around nations or nearby regions, and we greet them with open arms. You can stay here all you want, Leave anytime if you desire. Idk anything else.
No, we don&#39;t have discord or such.

Just simple rules:
No swearing.
No exploiting.
No bullying.
