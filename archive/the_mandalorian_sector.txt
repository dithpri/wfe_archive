[b][u]THE MANDALORIAN SECTOR[/u][/b]
[i]&quot;This is the Way&quot;[/i]


The Resol&#39;nare (the Six Actions) comprises the core tenets of being a Mandalorian:

- Wear the armor.
- Speak the language.
- Defend yourself and your family.
- Raise your children as Mandalorians.
- Contribute to the clan&#39;s welfare.
- When called upon by the Mand&#39;alor, rally to his cause.

We accept all who adopt this creed; race, gender, or species be damned...you are Mandalorian!

OYA, MANDO&#39;ADE!
