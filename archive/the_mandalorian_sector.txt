[b][u]WELCOME TO THE MAN MANDALORIAN SECTOR[/u][/b]

This is the way.

We are Mandalorians, we are warriors. We adhere to the Resol&#39;nare. The core of what it means to be Mandalorian, it is a creed that gives us direction and focus.

The Resol&#39;nare, or &#39;Six Actions&#39; when translated from Mando&#39;a into Galactic Basic Standard, are the central tenets of Mandalorian life.

1. Wear the armor.
2. Speak the language.
3. Raise your children as a Mandalorians
4. Defend yourself and your tribe
5. Contribute to your clan&#39;s welfare
6. Rise to the call of the Mand&#39;alor

We accept all who live by this code
