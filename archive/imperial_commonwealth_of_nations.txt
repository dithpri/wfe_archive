The Imperial Commonwealth of Nations, simply referred to as the Commonwealth, is a political association of tons member states, the vast majority of which are autonomous territories of the British Empire. The chief institutions of the organisation are the Commonwealth Secretariat, which focuses on intergovernmental aspects, and the Commonwealth Foundation, which focuses on non-governmental relations amongst member states.

The Commonwealth dates back to the end of the 19th century with the British Empire giving autonomy to it&#146;s colonies due to fears that revolutionaries will turn them independent.
