The [i][b]Indian Ocean[/i][/b] is the third largest of the world&#39;s oceanic divisions, covering about 20% of the water on the Earth&#39;s surface. It is bounded on the north by the Indian subcontinent; on the west by East Africa; on the east by Indochina, the Sunda Islands, and Australia; and on the south by the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, by Antarctica). It is the only ocean to be named after the name of a country, i.e., India[/color]
