The United Alliance of Klingon Sympathisers

A community of comrades who sympathise with the Klingon beliefs of honour and unity. Formed by Flimxanthia, RedShift, and Crysuko, it is now home to a multitude of Nations, each with their own proud customs and traits.
The Alliance is a large cluster of islands to the slightly south-west of Spain. Geographically, the Islands are mainly forest areas, kept cool and hydrated by an air current from the north.
