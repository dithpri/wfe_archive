The United Alliance of Klingon Sympathisers

A community of comrades who sympathise with the Klingon beliefs of honour and unity. Formed by Flimxanthia, RedShift, and Crysuko, it is now home to a multitude of Nations, each with their own proud customs and traits.
The Alliance is a large cluster of islands to the slightly south-west of Spain. Geographically, the Islands are mainly forest areas, kept cool and hydrated by an air current from the north.

Notice Board:

Prepare for the undead, d-bags. We&amp;#39;ve got hordes of corpses comin&amp;#39; at us, and we ain&amp;#39;t going down without honour.
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
