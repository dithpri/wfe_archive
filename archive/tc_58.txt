[color=#661111]    TC 58 is an FT roleplaying group with a common canon, guidelines, and community to enjoy! Our aim is to maintain a close-knit group of fellow worldbuilding roleplayers in our quest to delineate TC 58&amp;#39;s mysterious history, stage potential trade conflicts that plunge the entire galaxy into chaos, and leave behind relics of our own for future TC 58 explorers to discover on our planets.[/color]
