[color=red]The League Of States used to be a somewhat active region, though it was always relatively small at its critical mass being 50 members. 
Originally founded by Wor kalai
Most of the original natives have perished and departed the region and in the regions final moments, its remaining members fled to The Democratic Union.

Now it had been refounded and memorialized by an extension of a former native. Though sadly the original flag could not be recovered and was instead replaced by the Bonnie Blue flag[/color]
