Circinn is a small region that fully supports isolationism and an abundance of civil freedoms. We focus on protecting our members as well as promoting equality, intellectual freedom, and independence. We are a close knit region, and if threatened will exact equal punishment upon those that wronged us. We are an efficient, quick-acting group and while we fully support alliances, if you seek to harm us, we will eviscerate you.
