Zohrastria is a new founded roleplay, silly region with an offsite forum in future. 
Welcome are dictatorships, republics, kingdoms, empires, socialist states, communist states ect... (basically everyone)

[B]WA Delegate:[/B] [nation]Stoskavanya[/nation]
[B]Presidency of the Council:[/B] vacant (More information below)

Presidency of the Council will only be important in RPs, its like a secretary general for the region who will be switched every month and is appointed by the wa delegate. The delegate cannot appoint the founder, himself or a nation that wasnt member of the region for a week. Every other nation has to be president of the council atleast once.
