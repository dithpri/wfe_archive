Are you a despotic CEO seeking to escape the rules of regulations of your region? Are you a deposed dictator hoping to regain some degree of power? Or do you simply believe in the principles of capitalism, anarcho-capitalism, the free market, and an unregulated private sector?

Then Dogbertland is for you. In Dogbertland we don&amp;#39;t care what other regions think of us or our practices. We only want your businesses and your nation to grow into economic powerhouses by any means necessary. Cronies, weasels, accounting trolls, and pointy haired leaders are always welcome.

Remember that while in Dogbertland your employees and citizens are like the rungs of a ladder; don&amp;#39;t be afraid to step on them.
