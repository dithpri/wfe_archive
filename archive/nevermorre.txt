[b][colour=#990000]&amp;#9765; Welcome to the [u]N[/u]efarious [u][url=http://nevermorre.boards.net/]N[/u]est[/url] of [region]Nevermorre[/region] |[/colour][colour=#2F4F4F]|[/b] [i]The [url=https://discord.gg/8QzWrsh]Gathering[/url] of the Flock[/i][/colour][hr][i][colour=#003366]&quot;Trust in hate, and love in fate; and I don&#39;t understand. Social grace, the human race... confuse me. These words I speak bring forth a world of emotions: Emotions of dreams lost, emotions of dreams found, and emotions of dreams I&#39;ll never see. So it is written, so it shall come to pass. But the question is: Will I or will I not find myself capable of regaining what it is that I have lost? But isn&#39;t that the same question that I have been asked time and time again since my childhood? Isn&#39;t the question really: Have I any dreams I&#39;d like to sell?
