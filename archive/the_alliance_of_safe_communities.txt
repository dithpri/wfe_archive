The zombies have attacked, entire sections of continents are left uninhabitable, but there is still hope.

Across the world people are banding together to form new governments and to start to take back the world from the zombies.

Some are democracies trying to maintain freedom, others are brutal dictatorships wanting to subjugate the other communities.
