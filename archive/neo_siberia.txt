Neo-Siberia is an extensive geographical region spanning much of Eurasia and North Asia. Neo-Siberia has historically been a part of old Russia, and was formally known as Siberia before the War. The territory of Neo-Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between the Pacific and Arctic drainage basins. Neo-Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central old Kazakhstan, old Mongolia and old China. Neo-Siberia is well known primarily for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of &amp;#8722;25 &deg;C, tundra and taiga forests, as well as its extensive history of use by old Soviet administrations as a place for prisons, labor camps, and exile.
