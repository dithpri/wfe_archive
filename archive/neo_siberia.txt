[b]Neo-Siberia[/b] is an extensive geographical region spanning much of Eurasia and North Asia and home to many different nations. The territory of Neo-Siberia extends eastwards from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between the Pacific and Arctic drainage basins. Neo-Siberia stretches southwards from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central old Kazakhstan, old Mongolia, and old China. Neo-Siberia is well known primarily for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of &amp;#8722;25 &deg;C (&amp;#8722;13 &deg;F), taiga forests, as well as its extensive history of use by old Soviet administrations as a place for prisons, labour camps, and exile.
