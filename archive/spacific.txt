[b][color=002F59]Welcome[/color] [color=FFFFFF]to[/color] [color=CB1324]Spacific[/color][/b][hr]This used to be the home of some seriously cancerous reddit nationalists and other similar cringe lords. Now it&#39;s administered as a possession of [b][region]Archnox[/region][/b] since we found them to be completely incapable of basic administration of the region. If you want to use the region for whatever reason, just contact [nation]New Europ[/nation] and he&#39;ll probably be able to sort it out for you.[hr]In demonstration of the incompetent traits of the previous owners of this region described above, the original founder of Spacific, [nation]Saxonacht[/nation] decided to nuke this fair land and ban everyone including himself, thus proving the necessity of our civilizing mission.
