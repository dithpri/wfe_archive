Euhemerism is the belief that myths and legends derive from garbled retellings of ancient historical events. Since antiquity, it has been among the most popular theories about the origins and meaning of mythology. To name only two examples, the medieval legends of King Arthur likely reflect the exploits of a real Romano-British cavalry commander in the sixth century AD, and many of the diluvian flood legends from around the world, including Atlantis, almost certainly derive from dim memories of the worldwide flooding that took place in 9600 BC.

It has been said that humanity is a species veiled with amnesia. Euhemerism seeks to lift that veil and unravel the mysteries of humanity&#39;s past.
