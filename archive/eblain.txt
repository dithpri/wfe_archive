[b]Oh... Hello![/b]
[b]I see you&#39;ve stumbled across our rather small region![/b]

[b][colour=orange]Here in [region]Eblain[/region], we take pride in our appearance. And no, I don&#39;t mean you have to have to constantly straighten your hair or wear tons of makeup. No, I mean that we take pride in what type of nations our region is housing. We won&#39;t kick a nation out If their civil rights, economy and political freedom is low, we&#39;ll help them turn that around instead.[/colour] [/b]
