[b][color=darkred]The Sekhmet Legion of [region]Osiris[/region] has darkened the doors of this region in celebration of the coronation of [nation=short]Syberis[/nation] as Pharaoh and in thanks to [nation=short]Neo_Kervoskia[/nation] for his leadership and strength.

Take this time to hide in fearful corners as the Legion settle into this desert in love of their new Pharaoh. Here, have some totally not mind control cookies. It&#39;ll be fine. 

If, absolutely not due to mind control cookies, you now feel an urge to join Osiris and conquer with the Legion, go ahead and telegram [nation=short]Greyghost[/nation] to get started! She&#39;ll get you started with a uniform and some definitely not mind control tacos for your trouble.[/color]
