Originally populated in 2100, the Gamma systems encompasses almost 30 different solar systems(28 to be exact). The United Systems Federation was drawn to the Gamma systems because of the iridium deposits found on the lush, life supporting, and particularly tiny world of Thelle.

By late 2111, the planet of Thelle had successfully revolted against the USF and established themselves as the primary authority in the Gamma systems. Today, the Gamma systems remain a haven for immigrants leaving USF space.
