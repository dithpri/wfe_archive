[b]Welcome to [color=red]Cyclone Valley![/b][/color]

Cyclone Valley is the tranquil home of a small but close-knit group of nations. Founded in 2012 by [nation=noflag]Terra Luce[/nation], Cyclone Valley became the secluded refuge for nations with common ancestry from the plains of I&amp;#39;Ohwa. [b]Anyone is welcome to join[/b]; please telegram our Regional Ambassador, [nation=short+noflag]Avextir[/nation], for regional information and embassy requests. Nations are asked to please endorse the Regional Delegate, [nation=noflag]The Narcoleptic Walrus King[/nation], and to not seek more than two endorsements. Thank you.
