Cyclone Valley lies between the mountains to North and the lush forests to the Southwest, on the plains of I&amp;#39;Ohwa. Initially settled by [nation=noflag]Terra Luce[/nation], Cyclone Valley has become home to [nation=noflag]The Hundred Acre Wood istan[/nation] and [nation=noflag]Avextir[/nation] as well. Cyclone Valley is an economic powerhouse, guarded mostly by The Hundred Acre Wood istan with most trade concurring between Terra Luce and Avextir. After recent turmoil on the region&amp;#39;s eastern border, land was ceded to grant [nation=short+noflag]The Great Gilded Guild of Gilded Gilders[/nation] territory to begin their nation anew.
