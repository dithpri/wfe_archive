[u][b][region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]Balder[/region], [region]The East Pacific[/region], [region]Karma[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] &amp; [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] are looking for our resident bot and fiancee, [i]Penny[/i]![/u]

If you have any information related to her whereabouts please telegram the Delegate or a Regional Officer [i]immediately[/i]. Sign up to our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]forum[/url] for the latest updates on the bot-hunt.

If you happen upon any Hawks handing out flyers, putting up posters or shouting seemingly random phrases such as &#39;[url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=reventus_koth]Koth[/url]&#39;, &#39;Fight me&#39; or &#39;[url=https://youtu.be/D2EDlsE2mdU]Moves Like Jakker[/url]&#39; - this is perfectly [i]normal[/i] behaviour, do not be alarmed. She&#39;s an innocent bot and we only want her back safe. 

We also ask, during these trying times, that you endorse the Delegate and Regional Officers as a show of solidarity.
