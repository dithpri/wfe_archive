The World of Naruto is a Fan-T region created primarily as a personal, yet massive, project of mine to create a dynamic region impacted by the actions of both the few and the many. Made up of dozens of countries, various villages and many, many leaders, this dynamic region is designed to, hopefully, be fun for everyone involved, just don&amp;#39;t be silly/ridiculous about things. We will try to have active threads every so often, as in most of the time, so that we don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;sour&amp;quot;, that way we can have the fun we long for so much. Welcome to the world of Naruto, make your choice!
