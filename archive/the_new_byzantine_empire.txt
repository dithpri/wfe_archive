A recreation of the might that once belonged to the Eastern remnant of the Roman Empire.

In the New Byzantine Empire, high priority is placed on respect and decency.  No one will be kicked out without full consent from the leaders of the region, and region decisions will usually be put to a vote, rather than made solely by the Founder and the World Assembly Delegate.

Here, the freedom of choice is held as sacred. Nations may take whatever political path they so choose.

The New Byzantine Empire is staunchly against raiding as said action involves a complete lack of respect.

May God bless you.
