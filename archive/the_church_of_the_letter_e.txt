[b]Welcome to [color=blue][i][u]The Church of the Letter E![/u][/i][/b][/color]
[hr][i][b][u][region]The Church of the Letter E[/region][/u][/i][/b] follows several basic tenants, outlined in the E-Bible which can be found [url=][b]here.[/b][/url]

All churchgoers are expected to follow them to the [b]Letter E.[/b]

We shall be very divine and devoted to the Letter E just as it is to us.
