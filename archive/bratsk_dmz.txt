It all started with some newly founded nations looking for land to call home. After a long march the peoples finally came upon the region of Bratsk.

Bratsk is a cold, remote region where resources are scarce. Non the less the different peoples settled.

All wasn&#39;t good however. The peoples had different ideas of how to divide the resources and rule the masses. Therefore a Demiliterized Zone was founded over Bratsk. Anyone joining the region are strictly prohibited to wage warfare within Bratsk borders. This does not prohibit them from military operations elsewhere however.

After this arrangement was done, the people settled down, looking onto a prosporus future, and an influx of new peoples.
