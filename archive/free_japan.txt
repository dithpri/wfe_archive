We&#39;re an alliance of weeaboos, otakus, Japanophiles, and/or casual anime fans. Made for weeaboos and by weeaboos, bound together by our love for anime, manga, and Japanese media, we fight to protect our waifus. Bound together, not by political ideology or interests or by geological location, but by shared interests and hobbies. Through the ideology of Weebunism, for our waifus, we will love and lewd, never neglecting a waifu in need.

[color=red]Through kinship and brotherhood we will persevere. Come join us in our weeaboo crusade.[/color]
