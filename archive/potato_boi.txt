Potato Boi is the name for several small islands off the coast of England that look like potatoes and have an abundance of potatoes. Long ago there was an all out war between the Gorillas and the Brahmin. In the end, the Brahmin won and got the first, biggest island, Fartnoondle, while the Gorillas got the second, slightly smaller island, Xyoin. The Brahmin and Gorillas now live in peace and have created other islands for Potato Boi. Some of the Brahmin and Gorillas merged and created  the Gormin, which fights off and ancient beast that still brings terror to some people.
