Potato boi is the name for 3 small islands off the coast of England that looks like 3 potatoes and has an abundance of potatoes. The Brahmin and Gorillas had an all-out war and created the first two islands. In the end, the Brahmin won and got the first, biggest island, Fartnoondle, and the Gorillas got the second slightly smaller island, Xyoin. the 2 animals now live in peace, and have created an island together, the island of Pumpkin Hole 1. The Gormin, (the merge of a Brahmin and a gorilla), still returns to fight an ancient beast that still brings terror to some people.
