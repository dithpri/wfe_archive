1: Zheng He travels east in 1421 and discovers and colonises the Americas.(Yuandongde)
1b: The Mormons are invited by the Yuandong Empire to establish theocracy under its suzerainty.(Deseret)
2: The Honno-ji incident never occurs and so Oda Nobunaga survives, allowing him to unify and modernise Japan into a powerful empire.(The Oda Teikoku)
3: In the Battle of Poitiers, John II of France does not send away two of his sons and is still defeated, resulting in him and three of his sons being killed.
