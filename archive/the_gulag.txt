[color=red][b]What is missing from G_lag? U![/b][/color]

This is a region for leftists of all kind, be they anarcho-communists or trotskyists, leftcoms or marxist-leninists. Or people that just like soviet ~aesthetics~
There aren&#39;t any strict rules for people that aren&#39;t in these categories, but please keep debate on a respectable level. I&#39;m not going to kick you out if you&#39;re an anarcho-capitalist, but if your debate goes into disrespectful fields, then you&#39;re ejected- or sent to an eternity in Siberia to do forced labour, whichever you prefer.

This region is casual, role-playing is allowed, as is debate or just chatting. Please be respectful and non-discriminating during all of these.
