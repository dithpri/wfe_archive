Former WFE: The International trotskyist alliance is a region commited to Trotskyism and the Fourth International.

&quot;I shall die a proletarian revolutionist, a Marxist, a dialectical materialist, and, consequently, an irreconcilable atheist. My faith in the communist future of mankind is not less ardent, indeed it is firmer today, than it was in the days of my youth.&quot; L.Trotsky, 27 February 1940 Coyoacan, &#39;Trotsky&#39;s Testament&#39;
