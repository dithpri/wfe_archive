Welcome to the Nationstates World Regions, home of the NationStates World Regions Community which started in 2002. We are a dedicated roleplaying community that welcomes anyone interested in telling a good story with us!

Most of our activity can be found on the off-site forums [url=http://z3.invisionfree.com/nationstates/index.php?act=idx.]HERE[/url]
We also have our own wiki which can be found [url=http://nationstatesworldregions.wikia.com/wiki/NationStates_World_Regions_Wiki]HERE[/url]

Our off-site forums is divided into Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa, and the Americas so there is a place for everyone. We also have maps you can request a spot on, just contact NRE on our forums.
