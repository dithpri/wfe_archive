 Confederation of the Great Plains is a new young region with in the NationalStates, founded in 1987 by President Scrooge McDuck of Ameriza. This is a libertarian, center-left paradise without bureaucracy unnecessary procedures. This is a magical world of a state inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. [i](I hope you have a good sense of humor, and a cartoon country, ruled by ducks, as the leader of the region won&#39;t confuse you)[/i]
[b]Attention![/b]The cross with stars on the region&#39;s flag only represents the idea of the region&#39;s structure in the form of the Confederacy, and nothing more. The flag has no connection to the American Civil War and has been intentionally modified.
