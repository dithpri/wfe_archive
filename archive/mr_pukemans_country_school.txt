My name is Mr. Pukeman, and I am the teacher and principal of my small country school. You and your guests are welcome to visit, but remember to follow these Classroom Rules:

-No speaking unless you have a good reason to do so.
-No swearing, shouting, or fighting.
-No reading, drawing, eating, sleeping, or chewing gum in class.
-No standing up in class or leaving without permission.
-Cell phones, laptops, and other new-fangled technology are not allowed in my classroom. Not even calculators are safe here.
-Come to class on time with your completed homework and all the materials you need for class.
[b][u]-NO FUN ALLOWED!!![/u][/b]

Students who break any of the classroom rules will have to serve detention during recess or after school.
