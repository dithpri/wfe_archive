Our people&#39;s lives have meaning because we the anguished refuse to forget! And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us! Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! My soldiers push forward! My Soldiers Scream out! My Soldiers RAGE!!!!
