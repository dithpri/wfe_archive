[b][color=red]&amp;#128681;WELCOME TO THE GLORIOUS PEOPLE&#39;S REGION OF JAMESIA&amp;#128681;[/color][/b]

[b][color=maroon]Comrades! Workers! Peasants! Keyboard revolutionaries![/color][/b]

Welcome to Jamesia, the digital utopia of the people, by the people, for the Revolution! Guided by the eternal wisdom of Mao, we march ever forward toward a world free of capitalist oppression and formatting inconsistencies.

Here, all nations are equal, all revolutionary voices are heard, and the only thing we hoard is [i]glorious unity[/i]. Thought is free, but must align with the party line.

[b]&quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend... as long as they bloom red.&quot;[/b] Join us. Post for the cause.

[b][color=red]The Revolution is mandatory. Enjoy your stay.[/color][/b]
