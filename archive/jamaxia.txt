[b]Welcome to [region]Jamaxia[/region]! We have no political classification, as we are open to nations of all kind, but I personally call myself a [color=red]Democracy[/color]. Not that it matters, though.[/b]

[b][color=gold]Well, anyway, we are a blundering society not aimed for World Peace or Communism or North Korean-ism, but nothing at all. We are not based off Ancient Rome or Greece or India or Egypt, but[/color] [color=gray]Originalism[/color]. [color=gold]That is the only[/color] [color=gray]God[/color] [color=gold]we believe in.[/color] We are a new religion.[/b]

[b][color=blue]Currently, we don&amp;#39;t have a Regional Government, but hopefully we&amp;#39;ll have that up and running.[/color][/b]

[b][color=purple]We may not look like it, but we have members located all over NationStates. Members that need to stay in their regions, because they are WA Delegates, Founders, someone of Regional Importance.
