Afro-Eurasia, or the TriCon (TriContinental) is a region that is currently only inhabited by the leader, Socialist Euraisa. If you want to join:
1)Send a telegram to Euraisa asking for the password. Typically replies within a week.
2)Be a nation with conscription and a strong police force
3)Be related to Socialism

After that, if you are in the region, you can send another telegram asking for permission to join a ministry.
Older nations are more likely to be accepted than new ones. (No bias however).
