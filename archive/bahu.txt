Bahu is a region first founded in 1465 by the following nations: Ghujan, Karaam, Khunum and Stanadin. It is probably the most unwarlike place on the planet and it is aiming to build it&#39;s economy on a huge trading empire. (We enjoy roleplaying) We would be happy for you to join us on this conquest of ours to build the best region we can construct. We are a completely right wing region and if you are otherwise then that is fine. We believe we can rule the world through nationalism.
