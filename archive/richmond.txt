Richmond is full of crazy people just having fun! Richmond was founded in October of 2012, after a few people felt pushed out of their &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; region. Here, they vowed anyone can and will find a home in Richmond.

If you have any questions, please ask our founder [nation]Rebel-topia III[/nation], or our regional crazy [nation]Grim Reaperess[/nation].
