The East Grestin Pact or Treaty of East Grestin, formally the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, was a collective defense treaty signed in East Grestin, Arstotzka, between the Obristan and three other Eastern Lustrush (Continent) socialist republics of Central and Eastern Lustrush in May 1976, during the Arstotzka-Kolechian War. The East Grestin Pact was the military complement to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon), the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Lustrush. The East Grestin Pact was created in reaction to the integration of Kolechia into the Northwest Treaty Organization (NWTO) in 1976 as per the West Grestin and Enkyo Conferences of 1975.
