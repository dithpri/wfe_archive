Hello and welcome to PointyHairedJedi, I hope you enjoy your stay and I only have a few brief rules...Please no spam in the Regional Chat Forum(RCF), and don&#39;t ask for positions like Officer or Staff, that lowers your chances of getting those positions in the first place. If you wish to become a staff member or officer please telegram The Stalinist States of Stalinism, and say why you think you should have this position, and we will hold a staff-wide vote and decide if you will get the position.

Enjoy your stay :D
