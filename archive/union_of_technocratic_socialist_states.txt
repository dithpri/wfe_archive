[color=red][b]&amp;quot;Administrators of the world, unite!&amp;quot;[/b]

A glorious socialist dawn awaits![/color]

The UTSS was founded by the leaders of Shmoolandia with the mission of bringing rational and effective governance to the whole world. It sees as its main enemy the moral and intellectual penury of the capitalist sphere, where all men live as beasts - the poor in body and the rich in heart.

To join the UTSS is a pledge: 

to rule with an [color=red][b]iron fist[/b][/color], but a [b]noble vision[/b]
to choose [color=red][b]rationality[/b][/color] over [color=purple][i]superstition[/i][/color]
to value [color=red][b]pragmatism[/b][/color] over [color=blue][i]sentiment[/i][/color]

and finally, 
[b]to hold the [color=red]State[/color] up as the principal vehicle of progress, social, scientific, and cultural.[/b]
