   In the beginning Jeb created the left and the right. Now the left was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of Jeb was hovering over the waters.

 And Jeb said, &#147;Let there be the right,&#148; and there was the right. Jeb saw that the right was good, and he separated the right from the left. God called the right &#147;right,&#148; and the left he called &#147;wrong&#148; And there was evening, and there was morning&#151;the first day.
