  Emperor Wu of Liang asked the great master Bodhidharma, &amp;quot;What is the first principle of the holy teaching?&amp;quot;

         Bodhidharma said, &amp;quot;Vast emptiness, nothing holy.&amp;quot;

         The Emperor asked, &amp;quot;Who stands before me?&amp;quot;

         Bodhidharma said, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot;
