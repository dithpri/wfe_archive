and endorse our WA delegate Solomto and also make sure to make friends and be nice with everyone.

Our rules have changed today the WA delegate will be elected every three months because we want a democratic region so the WA delegate at that time must make a poll to choose our next WA delegate and the winner becomes the WA delegate and everyone who voted for the winner those must endorse them and the next day we will inaugurate our new WA delegate/president.
let&#39;s keep this democratic system going.  And starting from tomorrow we will have an election for WA vice - delegate this will happen every three months as well.
