Caspian Sea, Russian Kaspiyskoye More, Persian Darya-ye Khezer: World&#146;s largest inland body of water and largest salt lake in the world, lying to the east of the Caucasus Mountains and to the west of the vast steppe of Central Asia.

The elongated sea sprawls for nearly 750 miles (1,200 km) from north to south, although its average width is only 200 miles (320 km). It covers an area of about 149,200 square miles (386,400 square km)&#151;larger than Japan&#151;and its surface lies some 90 feet (27 metres) below sea level. The maximum depth, toward the south, is 3,360 feet (1,025 metres) below the sea&#146;s surface. --Encyclopedia Britannica
