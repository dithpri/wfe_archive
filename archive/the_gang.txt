Ordale, vatos.

After I re-founded the region [region]Gang[/region], I realized what a stupid name for a region it was. (Calling a gang &amp;quot;gang&amp;quot; is like calling a country &amp;quot;country.&amp;quot;) I thought, it would be better if it was at least called &amp;quot;[u][i]THE[/i][/u] Gang.&amp;quot; So that&amp;#39;s what I did, Homes. I founded &amp;quot;[b][region]The Gang[/region][/b].&amp;quot;
