3/4 cup warm water
1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon vegetable shortening
1/2 cup milk
3 cups
all-purpose flour (approximately)

Pour the warm water in a large bowl.
Slowly stir in the dry yeast and continue to stir until all of the yeast is dissolved.
Add the salt, sugar, shortening, and milk to the bowl.
Stir until everything is thoroughly combined.
Mix in the first 2 cups of flour.
If needed, begin adding more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough chases the spoon around the bowl.
