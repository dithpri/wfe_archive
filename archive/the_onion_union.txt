On the last of each month, a vote will determine the next WAD.
The new WAD is put in office on the first of the next month.

The WAD can act however they wish upon election.

If the public is unhappy with the WAD, a vote is called for impeachment. If the vote passes, the member who got the second highest votes in the last election is chosen.

The process has two rounds:
     One: Any candidates can run for office, and cast their votes. Candidates cannot vote for themselves in Round One. If only two candidates run, skip to Two.
     Two: The two candidates with the most votes are put into a poll. The winner of this round becomes the elected official.

Consecutive term limit is two terms. After which, the member cannot run for office for a third consecutive term.
