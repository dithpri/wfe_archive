I&amp;#39;ve created this region as a place I can link back to my YouTube account 
(Rythmis lucidity) for any future subscribers or just people in general. 
Anybody is free to join, I don&amp;#39;t particularly mind who does or doesn&amp;#39;t join.
For anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t know already, I am a composer and I post my pieces to YouTube along with a few arrangements and an occasional musical challenge.
the results of the musical challenge will either be posted here, there, or both.
