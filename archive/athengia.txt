[b]THIS REGION IS FOR, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PUPPETS.[/b]

[i]Please note the following if you plan on joining Athengia: This is not an active region. It is simply a place to drop off your puppets and not worry about them. Do not expect this place to be bustling with activity. Do not harass other players. Do not spam. That is annoying. [b]You may recruit, as long as it has two sentences at the end explaining why you think llamas are better than manatees. Thank you.[/i][/b]
