Welcome to Kattegat, Ragnar&#39;s hometown. I plan to start a Viking-based region, where we can:

- Discuss Viking history
- Talk about Viking TV show
- Raid other regions with our mighty longships

I hope there are people who share similar interest, and willing to join me exploring this game and raiding its regions.
