&amp;#128783; The Realm of Exile &amp;#128783;

A fortress beyond the maps, where the banished find walls higher than their past, High stone gates bar the wind. Within, streets wind between torch-lit halls where the Outcast Council gathers. Every soul here has been turned away from somewhere else &#151; yet here, no voice is silenced, no home abandoned. The Realm stands not in defiance, but in permanence.

For the Banished
If you have been rejected, abandoned, or made unwelcome &#151; your journey ends here. The Realm&#146;s gates are heavy, but they open for you.
