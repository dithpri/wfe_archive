

From the ashes of JustDubs we have arise and been reborn to the [color=purple]JustAnimeNetwork![/color] Join us at [url=https://justanimeforum.net/]JustAnimeForums[/url]! and watch and share your thoughts on anime! Comment on the best anime or favorite voice actors or preach to the choir when they are going to localize that great japanese game in english! (because poor localizations make me cry)

We got it here but the real fun is to get involved in our friendly community! Play silly games in the Asylum, join clubs, nerdgasm on the latest tech...
Count on the community to welcome you with open arms!
