Elliotttopia was founded by The Great Elliott and is made out of the great nation of Elliotttopia and its puppet nations. A very large portion of the economy is focused on military expenditure to deter rebellious actions and uprisings. Extremely high taxes are imposed on the puppet nations throughout the region to make sure the economy is never good enough to be able to afford a proper military to rebel against the head nation of Elliotttopia. Re-Education camps are scattered throughout every nation and contain all those that oppose the government and its ideologies.
