We are a region promoting education, responsible ownership, and debunking negative breed stereotypes (especially pit bulls and rottweilers). We champion training and environment over breed.

Our Values: Breed neutrality, owner responsibility, accurate information, and animal welfare. We oppose BSL.

Our Goal: A world where dogs are judged by owners and actions, not stereotypes. Join us!
