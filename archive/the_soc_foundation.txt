Secure, 
Obtain, 
Contain.
That is our motto. Welcome to the Foundation, the largest paranormal organization ever. We are composed of researchers spanning multiple galaxies and different universes at some points. We are also the most well funded organization out of all other IPGs (Identified Paranormal Groups). Between governmental organizations and militant groups that use the paranormal as a tool for war, or worship. We are the most well maintained and well armed of them all.
