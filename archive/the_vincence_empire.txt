[quote=new_yi_empire;46587780]In December, JRN merged with TVE. I became emperor of a stagnant empire. We started off with loads of activity. I made some decent changes with TVE. I&#146;ve made my mistakes, everyone has. I leave as a historical controversy. Still after all this, I am still growing. Im still trying. I thank you all for sticking with me and supporting me. Now we all leave for greener pastures. I wish everyone the best.[/quote]
Regions to move to:
[region]ThunderClan[/region]
[region]Institute of Cellulose[/region]
[region]Callista[/region]

We are moving mostly to Callista for a informal merge, it is formally asked by the government that the region follows to Callista.
