[color=purple][b]The rightful successor state to [region]The Tavern[/region] and [region]The Vincence Kingdom[/region].[/color][/b]
[hr][color=burgundy]Here lies [region]The Vincence Empire[/region], killed by the ever looming inactivity virus that will soon destroy all regions on this cursed website. I was just like you, I wanted to be a big player in this little simulation game but I was arrogant and lost sight of what truly mattered. I made mistakes (like anybody would) and now here I am, alone in a dead region with nobody to talk to except for my own insane thoughts. Share my story, you could end up like me too![/color]
