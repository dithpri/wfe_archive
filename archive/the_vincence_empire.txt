[hr][color=#E759AC]Founded in 2020, TVE was once an active AltHist RP region, but after years of players leaving, it was time for the region to change, like all things. As of May 2025, we are operating under a new singularity, an oath to be as casual and fun as possible while allowing for creativity to flourish. Talk about the weather, politics (as long as you keep it civil), anime, whatever fancies you! This is a safe space for EVERYONE so let&#39;s do our part to keep this place magical like [region]The Tavern[/region] of old. &quot;Do whatever ya want as long as ya don&#39;t break my Rules Card.&quot; - Haruhi[/color]
