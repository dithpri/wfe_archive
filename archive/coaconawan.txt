Pronounced &quot;KOH-AH-KAHN-AH-WAHN&quot;, our region&#39;s name stands for &quot;Coalition to Condemn All World Assembly Nations&quot;
The 36 hour nuclear war we encountered should have been prevented by the World Assembly. Instead, it was designed by them. 
Scores of accords were intentionally violated in the name of a massive, purge-like event. Trillions of civilians from thousands of nations were brutally murdered by other nations, who acted without consequence.
The World Assembly MUST BE CONDEMNED. 
All who stand for our cause are welcome to join.
