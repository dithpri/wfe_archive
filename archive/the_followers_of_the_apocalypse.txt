A league of elite nations taking steps to prepare for the up coming apocalypse. What kind of apocalypse is coming? That remains to be seen. Our region is comprised of numerous types of nations. No forum threads for war or RPing have been started... yet, and any wars fought between member nations will be done via a set of combat trials, in order to avoid wasting lifes and resources, with the founder as referee(contact region founder, illKhan Kane Timberwolf of Thambia for rules and details). Membership is open, pending nation assesment. The founding nations(both of them) have elected the region to remain out of the WA, though individual nations who join are allowed to be members.
