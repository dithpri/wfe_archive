Hello. 

Do you feel like nobody gives a flying monkey about your gargantuan (pea-sized), omnipotent (feeble) and utterly awesome (completely pointless) nation? Are you done sticking to umpteen whack rules? Does it look like it takes as little as an incorrect inhale to get banned?

Then welcome to The Nations Nobody Cares About (TNNCA)! There&#39;s no rules unless you break the *real* law. Enjoy staying there without feeling like a downcast outcast.
