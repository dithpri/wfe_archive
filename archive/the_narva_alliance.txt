Welcome to the Narva Alliance, led by The Eesti Vabariik and the United Socialist States of Bulgaria. Created as a Alternate history scenario that diverged from the real time line of human history in 681 AD. After 1400, human history stayed relatively the same as the real time line of human history up until World War I and the late 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. For more information, check the world Map and history for each country in the Narva Alliance.

On July 26, 2016, we lost a Titan. Aquitastan ceased to exist as a country. We shall keep it on our map and history to remember the great country and the Long Duck. April 11 will be Regional Aquitastan Rememberence day. Goodbye Jim Jam. We love you.
