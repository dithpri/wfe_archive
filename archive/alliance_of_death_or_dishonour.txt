[colour=red]The world has fallen into an abyss of four sides. Democracy, blind followers of the World Assembly, idiots, and dictatorships.[/colour].

[b]I welcome it.
Ignorance is strength.
War is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
So choose between death...or, well...[colour=red]dishonour.[/colour][/b]
