[colour=red]The world has fallen into an abyss of four sides. Democracy, blind followers of the World Assembly, idiots, and dictatorships.[/colour].
We will rise up against the other three. Separated we will not prosper. But together we will kill! We will condemn the society we know...until our lives will be under living dictatorship.
I welcome it.
