[b][i]Welcome to Steephoof Flats, heroes![/i][/b]

These mighty plateaus are bringing you near to the end of your journeys with [nation=short]Amber the Far Seeker[/nation] and lie near the entrance to another ancient crypt forgotten by time. [nation=short]Zosha the Whirlwind[/nation] has come to this region to hone her combat skills in the high altitude. Being the Rat Clan&#39;s best assassin requires a great deal of practice, you see...

Zosha&#39;s skills could be quite valuable to navigating the ruins we&#39;ll be seeking out next. Whichever Clan scores the most points here will prove their intellect to Zosha and she will teach them some of her stealthy techniques. Plus this region will be theirs as she flies their flag atop the plateaus!
