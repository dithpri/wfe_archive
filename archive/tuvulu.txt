Tuvulu is a continent in the Pacific Ocean, with the continent split into two gigantic islands. Niett, Harshanistan, Jordanism and Makistari make up the bigger of the two, while Terebixia, GeorgemanV and Drunked are located on the smaller of the two. Dirkea, Flappistan and The Kingdom of The Bears are all archipelagos. 

Not only is the continent split geographically, it is also split politically. The larger northern island consists of either communist nations, or some form of dictatorship, whilst the southern half consists of democratic nations. Adding to the irony, the halves of Tuvulu tend to disagree on certain issues, with tensions between the two halves growing daily.
