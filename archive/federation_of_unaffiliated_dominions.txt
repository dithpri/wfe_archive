We at the Federation of Unaffiliated Dominions believe in teamwork and cooperation, except when we don&#39;t. We are a completely disconnected group of close-knit nations devoted to political autonomy, personal freedom, making that $$$, the environment, hunting wabbits, and whatever else we can think of at the time.

All hail the FUD!
