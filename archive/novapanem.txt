In penance for their uprising, each district shall offer up a male and a female between the ages of 12 and 18 at a public &quot;reaping&quot;. These tributes shall be delivered to the custody of the Capitol. And then transferred into a public arena, where they will fight to the death until a lone victor remains. Henceforth and forevermore this pageant shall be known as &quot;The Hunger Games.&quot;
