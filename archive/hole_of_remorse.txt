[b][color=#C41E3A]Welcome to the hole of remorse[/b]
[i]Trying to forget your past? No can do, those are your remorse and you regret that don&#39;t you?
But there is a fact that you need to know,
As long as your breath of life remains, this drop of blood, and this pain you will continue to endure, even when you die, can you forget it?[/i][/color]

[color=#FF1616][i]This pain, anger and mood are out of order, will you survive? Or will you just forget about it?
And again, you will just masquerade under your mask and hide saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;?
Trapped in this feeling, it feels... I can&#39;t explain it, you know it... yet I bury this feeling, this suffering itself in deep holes of remorse, empty halls, and my shadows.[/i][/color]
