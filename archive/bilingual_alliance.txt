[color=pink][B]We&#39;re for everyone who wants to join a region where speaking a language other than English is possible![/color]

[color=teal]There are lots of NationStates players who don&#39;t speak English or who speak something other than english, and we want to embrace this, instead of simply sidelining other language groups.[/color]

[color=green]We will always accept you for who you are[/color][color=red] (unless you make it difficult for people to express themselves or make people feel unsafe).[/color]

[color=blue]Please ask nicely for the password if you want to enter. We do thorough background checks to make sure you&#39;re not a raider! :)[/B][/color]
