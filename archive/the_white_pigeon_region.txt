this region has been taken over by [nation]Simon Shriver-Student[/nation] and [nation]DUUUDE that green junk[/nation] acting under the authority of the region [region]Big Lorenzi[/region]. All of you peasants will join Big Lorenzi by the end of the month, or bad things will happen. More on that later. We are a pair of ruthless coldblooded nations who care about no one and nothing. 


Have a great day, and you all will perish.

-Simon Shriver-Student 

Update on the situation...
You worthless peasants have ignored and disobeyed our orders. [nation]Figtails[/nation] and [nation]Dictatorship of Martha[/nation] have made their own region instead of joining ours. We cannot eject you scum from your own nation, so we are moving on to less disobedient prey.

DIE WORTHLESS PEASANTS
