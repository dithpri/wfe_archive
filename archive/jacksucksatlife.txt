[b][color=cyan]HAPPY SNOW DAY!!!!!!!! :D[/color]

&#133;or that&#146;s what I [i]would[/i] be saying if it wasn&#146;t 55 F out today :( 
Stupid global warming, making it so we don&#146;t get to play in the snow during a reasonable part of the year. Doesn&#146;t it know that a lack of snow cover is bad for our baby snow birds???? So inconsiderate&#133;
