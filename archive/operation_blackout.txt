[color=indigo][b]Welcome to Operation Blackout![/b][/color]

This is a spinoff region of the [color=brick]North American Federation[/color]
A post apocalyptic set region 260 years after the successful events of [color=indigo][b]Operation: Blackout[/b][/color]. A series of events that rendered most Old World technology completely useless. Guns do exist in this timeline but the skills of the gunsmiths are nearly lost completely. (I don&#39;t want people complaining on why we couldn&#39;t just reverse engineer them.)

Official rules on guns and other weapons will be decided on later.

We will have a map soon, and rules on how to claim.
