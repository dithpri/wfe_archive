This is a spinoff region of the [color=brick]North American Federation[/color]
A post apocalyptic set region 300 years after the successful events of [b]Operation: Blackout[/b], a series of events that rendered much of the West coast inhospitable, and most Old World technology completely useless. 

Guns are rare, and ammunition even rarer. With the art of gunsmithing lost to the world, men depend on their swordsmanship to turn the tides of war.


[i]Official rules on guns and other weapons will be decided on later.[/i]

We will have a map soon, and rules on how to claim.
