Welcome to [b]Afghanistan[/B]! 

Modern Afghanistan traces its origins to the Durrani Empire, founded by Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1747. The country has been recognised as a modern state since the 1919 Treaty of Rawalpindi - the result of three failed British invasions during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Since 1979, the country has suffered almost continuous conflict, beginning with the Soviet invasion, followed by civil war, and most recently the ongoing 2001 war, in which the United States toppled the ruling Taleban.
