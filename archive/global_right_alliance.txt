[b][color=orange]Welcome to the Global Right Alliance![/color]


Our region has been in long term decline for the last three years. In the absence of any revolution in NationStates or the advent of a new game we all feel like participating in, please don&amp;#39;t expect any real activity bar some wiffle-waffle on the RMB, or any departure from our long tradition of showing hostility towards newcomers and each other.


Please join [url=http://s11.zetaboards.com/GlobalRightAlliance][color=red]our forum[/color][/url] now to get involved!

Please endorse [nation=short]Chin-Chillas[/nation], your World Assembly Delegate.
