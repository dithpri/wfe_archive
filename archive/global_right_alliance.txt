[b][color=green]Welcome to the Global Right Alliance![/color]

The GRA was founded in 2005, has one of the oldest Defender armies in NationStates, and co-founded the [url=http://s7.zetaboards.com/FRA/index/][color=#C18D01]Founderless Regions Alliance[/color][/url]. We are known for our fierce debates, controversies, passionate dedication to free speech and political innovation.

The region is run by the People&#39;s Assembly and led by the Speaker.
