CU is a place for all kinds of communist and otherwise omnipresent and or corrupt governments to chill and do whatever it is we do. We don&amp;#39;t take it all that seriously, so come and relax or something. If nothing else, it&amp;#39;s a place to be. All nations are welcome, given they possess socialist and/or communist ideology.

Anyone entering the region for the sake of trying to pull our glorious nations into another region, or for the purpose of causing trouble, will be tossed into the nearest nuclear power plant&amp;#39;s cooling towers.
