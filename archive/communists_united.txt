CU is a place for all kinds of communist, omnipresent, and/or corrupt governments to chill and do whatever it is we do. We don&#39;t take it all that seriously, so come and relax or something. If nothing else, it&#39;s a place to be. All nations are welcome, come in, stay a while.

[quote=engala;32862978]Today, 13 October 2018, we celebrate 10 years since the region&#39;s founding. In that time countless nations have come and gone - some moving onto other regions, others ceasing to be. To those who have come and gone we thank you for your time with the region; to those yet to arrive we welcome you.
