South Oceania is a massive continent with all major weather patterns present. The region is prone to earthquakes, tornadoes and monsoon rains from Spring until the end of summer. The region is home to Zarkadia, a massive Stalinist socialist state. 
South Oceania&#39;s far proximity from much of the world makes Zarkadia relatively safe, though there are reports of pirates off the southwest coast and insurgencies in much of the country.
