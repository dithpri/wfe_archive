Well, you know what&amp;#39;s wrong with the world today
People done gone and put their Bible&amp;#39;s away
They&amp;#39;re living by the law of the jungle not the law of the land
The Good Book says it so I know it&amp;#39;s the truth
An eye for and eye and a tooth for a tooth
You better watch where you go and remember where you been
That&amp;#39;s the way I see it, I&amp;#39;m a simple man
