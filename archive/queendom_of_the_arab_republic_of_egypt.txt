This Monarchy is an Arab Republic
We have a Queendom that we all know
But there&#39;s something in our Arabic region
That socialists can never measure, that imperialists can never weigh

We got the Labor Party in power factor in that
We pull together, &#39;cause we&#39;re a perfect match
We stand as one,
We got the tools,
We&#39;re pulling it together and we&#39;re tearing up all the raids

We got a friendship that&#39;s unique to us
We come together in a way nobody else does
We work it work it &#39;cause we&#39;re building A dream
(We work our region like Egypt)

We got Saladin&#39;s Eagle on our flag and we got the National Anthem
We got it made so you understand
But there is someone in our Arabic region
That the Muslims worship , the great God Allah
