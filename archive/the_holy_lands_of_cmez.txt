The holy lands of CMEZ are run by several nations, a lowly region, yet powerful nations ruling over the region, Rad Albatenes is the founder of the lands, the original nation. More nations started conquering the holy lands, people of their nations are scared and sceptical. It&#39;s a large landscape, but not too large, only small amounts of nations are able to take over some parts of the lands. Very war driven, and no one runs the region, everyone is fighting for land.
