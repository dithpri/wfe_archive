The holy lands of CMEZ are run by several nations, a lowly region, yet powerful nations ruling over the region, Rad Albatenes is the founder of the lands, the original nation. It&#39;s a large landscape, but not too large, only small amounts of nations are able to take over some parts of the lands. Very war driven, and no one runs the region, everyone is fight for land.
