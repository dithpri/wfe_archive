The [b][color=mediumblue]World Archive[/color] [color=darkred](TWA)[/color][/b] is a diplomatic region, connecting all world nations who choose to participate within associated archipelago and alliance roleplay regions. Specific ambassador accounts (representing nations from associated regions) can locate here, and communicate globally -- as channels allow. World Archive embassy requests will not be accepted until new archipelago regions are discovered in roleplay.

This is a region focused on interregional diplomacy.
