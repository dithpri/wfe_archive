The [b][color=mediumblue]World Archive[/color][/b] is the lobby and holding region for the American Union (AU) roleplay story. Players that do not have land claims within the AU, non-nation accounts (RP media accounts, private organizations, etc.), and fans watching our story as it progress, can call this region home. If you wish to claim land in the AU, please check the regional land claims page to see which islands are available.
