[b][color=red]Welcome to the mystical lands of the Red Sun[/color][/b]

[color=darkred]Over the sands of time beneath the darkest of skies lies every man&amp;#39;s dream - the horizon, and past that, the Sun, it&amp;#39;s magnificent rays casting a red glow on everything it touches. It is under that we bathe, under that we live.[/color]

We live along The River and thrive among The Sands. The River gives us sustenance and trade from our brothers of Water in the North. The Sands give us minerals and stone. Under domes and spires of gold and glass delve our ever persistent great thinkers and scientists into the realms of philosophy and science. We rise monuments above humans in awe and admiration.
