[u][b]UNDER CONSTRUCTION[/b][/u]
[i]After all, Rome wasn&amp;#39;t built in a day![/i]

First a fascist region, then a communist region, [b][color=green][u]NOW AN ITA[/u][/color][color=gray][u]LIAN-HERIT[/u][/color][color=red][u]AGE REGION[/u][/color][/b], [i]kapeish?[/i]

[u]There are a few [b]RULES[/b], though.[/u]
[b]1. Be a nation respectful of Italy and Italians.[/b]
(Being Italian yourself isn&amp;#39;t necessary, but being respectful of Italy and Italians is.)
[b]2. Don&amp;#39;t be a fascist or a communist.[/b]
(Because those are the two groups that previously controlled the region by this name. And if they liked it so much, they wouldn&amp;#39;t have let it cease to exist. So fuggedaboutit, they ain&amp;#39;t welcome back.)
[b]3. Give all respect the Empress, [nation=short]Imperatrice Bellissima[/nation].[/b]

And there&amp;#39;s still some work to be done here before we can open up. Soon enough, though...
