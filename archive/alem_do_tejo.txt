[b]Nation of the week[/b]

The nation with the most accurate motto this days ([i]Foda-se t&aacute; frio[/i]), [nation=long]sta_durmi[/nation] is the same age of [nation]Salazar Dream Team[/nation]. It has a nice mix of policies: Nobody in, nobody out; atheism and prudism/no adultery/no divorce, among others. Also, it is in the cutting edge of the universe in many fronts, such as Highest Unexpected Death Rate, Most Politically Apathetic Citizens, Most Avoided and Most Corrupt.

The great region [region]Alem do Tejo[/region], internationally known for its random Francesinhas (1/100000 chances of the ingredients have the right stacking order), is located between Amadora and the Saarah desert, making it the most southern region Viriato ever laid its eyes on, before getting treachously killed in his sleep.
