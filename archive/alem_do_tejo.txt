[b]Nation of the week[/b]

The oldest nation in the world, formed even before [region]Alem do Tejo[/region] manifest destiny became clear (and also the latest to adhere to the region), [nation=long]Salazar Dream Team[/nation] seeks to emulate one of the greatest statists the world has ever seen. Connected to its roots (top 3% primitiveness worldwide), it has enacted policies that, one day, will make it rise among the nations and leave it [i]proudly alone[/i].

The great region [region]Alem do Tejo[/region], internationally known for its random Francesinhas (1/100000 chances of the ingredients have the right stacking order), is located between Amadora and the Saarah desert, making it the most southern region Viriato ever laid its eyes on, before getting treachously killed in his sleep.
