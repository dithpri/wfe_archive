[b]Nation of the week[/b]

The founder of this region [nation=long]dom_sebastiao_voltou[/nation] is a proof that it is possible to have a minimally sane nation. With one of the world&#39;s biggest foreign aid spending (10%) and generally pacifist policies (refused to develop WMDs), it also features a radically efficient economy with big state intervention (40%) and high taxes (57% income tax).

The great region [region]Alem do Tejo[/region], internationally known for its random Francesinhas (1/100000 chances of the ingredients have the right stacking order), is located between Amadora and the Saarah desert, making it the most southern region Viriato ever laid its eyes on, before getting treachously killed in his sleep.
