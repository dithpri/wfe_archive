Welcome to the Traditional Latin Empire or TLE!

This is a community focused on the Traditional Latin Mass and its beauty and center of Catholic Worship, and the issues within the Church. As Pope Paul VI said, &#147;from some fissure the smoke of Satan has entered into the temple of God.&#148; The time after Vatican II proved to be a disaster for the Church, the Liturgical Revolution (more like Devolution), one that we are still recovering from.

Even if you are not interested in this, all are welcome!!!

God Bless and VIVA CHRISTO REY!
