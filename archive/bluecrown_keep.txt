Welcome to Bluecrown Keep, former home of the Independents from The Vincence Kingdom, now mostly gone to [region]Callista[/region]. Currently this is a base for me to refound random things, and for people who are still loyal to the Crown. You&#39;re welcome to stay, but I have no plans to actively grow this region. If you want to get an RO job, you can ask me. 

Good regions are [region]Callista[/region], [region]Isle Of Wooloo Kingdom[/region], [region]NeutraIKEA[/region], or [region]First World Order[/region].[hr]
When I say I refound things, I do it because I&#39;m bored, and it lets me play make-believe with being a real raider. I just refound whatever I see has 0 members, especially fascist or commie ones. So I don&#39;t really have any ideological convictions, kay? Just lemme have fun =P
