Treaty:

  Any nation within the council must comply with the defense of the territory; and if not, then that nation will be revoked.
If the treaty is currently in force, no nation -if not reserved rights before hand- can lay a base or any facility on the land of the Antarctica Territory. The UN nations complying the treaty are responsible for any -environmental- destruction; and all countries agreeing to the treaty must come to the aid of anyone in need in times of crisis. Anything having to do with establishing a single government are not yet recognized: even if the treaty says it is; for it is up to the people to decide on a single government if wanted.
