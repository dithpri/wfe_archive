[color=A67120]Hey look at those Mountains, funny how they exist right?

Hello. This region is a gateway to many other regions. This is also where you can rest before scrolling through the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=world]1000s of regions[/url] and trying to pick on to stay in.  Let us just say, some of them are pretty nice. You might also be interested in being an Admin in this region and take care of the region. In that case, please telegram our founder, [nation]The nation that goes places[/nation] and ask politely whether you can become an Admin. [/color]
