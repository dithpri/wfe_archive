Mother Russia (transliterated as Rossiya-Matushka) is a national personification of Russia, appearing in patriotic posters, statues etc. The usage of the term &amp;quot;mother&amp;quot; in reference to a nation or culture symbolizes the &amp;quot;spirit of collectivity&amp;quot;.[1] In the Soviet period, the term (&amp;quot;Mother-Homeland&amp;quot;) was preferred, as representing the multi-ethnic Soviet Union. Still, there is a clear similarity between the pre-1917 Mother Russia and the Soviet figure, especially as depicted during and in the aftermath of the Eastern Front of World War II.
