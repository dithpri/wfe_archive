Nothing to see here. This might be my grave actually. Long Live the FWO! Long Live IWK! Long Live Theberstan! Hail queen Jodilee! If I do get Dos&#146;d, it&#146;ll probably be a good thing for me. I&#146;ll finally be able to move on. You all mean so much to me and I&#146;ll never forget you. It&#146;s sure been a journey. If I knew it was going to end today, well I don&#146;t know. You&#146;ve all been a great emotional support and thank you for your help and support that you&#146;ve given me. I wish there was something I could give back in return. - Mar 15, 2021
