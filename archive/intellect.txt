[region]Intellect[/region] welcomes any peaceful nation to our region.

We value curiosity and a desire to learn, so any nation that supports these values will easily find a place in Intellect.

However, any nation that invades or changes our region without permission from the temporary head, [nation]Saranla de Jaic Eron[/nation] will be immediately ejected and banned if deemed necessary. Permission to alter anything may be requested on the regional message board. 

That said, as long as you follow the rules, I can guarantee that you will have a good time in Intellect
