Here in Intellect, we prioritise independent thought above all.  Some of the key values that we support are:
- education 
- the economy 
- the freedom to question and criticise
- low crime rates 
- firm pacifism
- government funded university programs
- the importance of chocolate 
- low surveillance levels
- low involvement of the state in personal matters 
- legalised abortion and euthanasia 

Despite being a fundamentally secular region, we encourage differences in opinion/faith and we fuel debates. If you disagree with any of the points mentioned above, please join and tell us why! We welcome different perspectives; these are key in having a fully functional region.
