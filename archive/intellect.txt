Here, at Intellect, we prioritise independent thought above all. If you want, you could join our region. First, here are some key values we emphasise:
- education 
- the economy 
- the freedom to question and criticise
- low crime rates 
- firm pacifism
- government funded university programs
- the importance of chocolate 
- low surveillance levels
- low involvement of the state in personal matters 
- legalised abortion and euthanasia 

Fundamentally, we are a secular nation. However, here at Intellect, we encourage a difference of opinion and we fuel debates. If you disagree with any of the points mentioned above, please join! We welcome different perspectives; these are key in having a fully functional region.
