You look for anything resembling a cuckoo and notice a nice looking tavern at the corner with &quot;Cuckoo&#39;s Nest&quot; written in big bold letters above the door. 
As you sit down at the bar, a man approaches you:

&quot;I am the beginning of everything,
The end of everywhere.
I am the beginning of eternity,
The end of time and space.&quot;
