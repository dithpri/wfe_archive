Derhimmel is a continent situated between North America and Europe. The official continent has 26 nations situated on it, but in actuality here, only a few of them take part. 

The Derhimmelian Union is a union basing all the nations in Derhimmel as one (similar to the European Union). Countries in the Union have to abide to a set list of laws as based in the articles of the Union. Some of the mandatory ones include laws and regulations, foreign policy, and border control to name a few. Minority forms include communications, a unified currency, stricter laws on the previously mandatory regulations and others.

To move to Derhimmel, you must ask Inochia for clearance as we don&amp;#39;t let anyone in here.
