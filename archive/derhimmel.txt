Derhimmel is a continent situated between North America and Europe. The official continent has many nations situated on it, but in actuality here, only a few of them are in NationStates.

The Derhimmelian Union is a union basing all the nations in Derhimmel as one (similar to the European Union). Countries in the Union have to abide to a set list of laws as based in the articles of the Union. Some of the mandatory ones include laws and regulations, foreign policy, and border control to name a few. Minority forms include communications, a unified currency, and others.

To move to Derhimmel, it is recommended that you ask a current member nation, although it is not required.
