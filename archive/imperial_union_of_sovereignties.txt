                                           SOMETIMES MIGHT MAKES RIGHT

Our imperial union seek to conquer vast lands and unite peoples together for the supremacy of our empires.
As long as citizens abide by laws set out by the Grand Citadel they will have nothing to fear.
Of course other countries can still have some autonomy with Citadels within their countries, but the Grand Citadel is the greatest authority in the Union.
Our divine rule will make the world a better place for tomorrow and for future generations, even if they do not see it now.

                           REMEMBER SOVEREIGNS THE IMPERIAL UNION NEEDS &#147;YOU&#148;
