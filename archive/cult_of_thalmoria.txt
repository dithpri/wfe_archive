This region was founded by players from Politics &amp; War, seeking to bring the Cult of Thalmoria and the word of the Great Prophet Thalmor into the NationStates universe. This colonization attempt was inspired late one night on Friday, January 12th, when an episode of Lysander Radio spiraled into the depths of insanity. This insanity ultimately led to a well-organized mission to bring Thalmoria&#39;s reach into a new era, founding the Cult of Thalmoria within NationStates.
