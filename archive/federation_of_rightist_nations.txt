The Federation of Rightist Nations is a region for all right-leaning nations, and any nation following a right-leaning philosophy is welcome, such as libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, fascists, populists, neoconservatives, paleoconservatives, the alt-right and so on. Left-leaning nations are perfectly welcome but not encouraged.
