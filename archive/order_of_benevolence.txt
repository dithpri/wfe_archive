Welcome to the Order of Benevolence, a region ruled not by an iron fist, but laced with ideas of population control and creating a brighter and more unified future for the people that serve within our states. 

All nations are welcome, no matter the ideology they may have and the goals they may pursue. The only condition is the acceptance of the total authority which the party of Supreme Benevolence holds atop the region and the interest in regional stability, which must be upheld in order to further our goals as a region.
