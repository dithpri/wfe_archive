In order to join you must use a new puppet.
Only the Chair may know who is controlling a puppet.
This is for the following reason:
If you do not know who your fellow members are, then you can&#39;t betray them, willingly or otherwise.
If you wish to join the committee you must tell the chair who you are a puppet of.
