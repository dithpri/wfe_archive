[color=red]BEFORE YOU JUDGE QUOVV, READ THIS FIRST:

QUOVV DID NOT STEAL THIS REGION FROM CHRISTIANS!!! IT WS OCCUPIED BY [region=Cimmeria], BUT WAS THEN TAKEN BY QUOVV WHEN THEY TURNED IT INTO A PUPPET REGION

QUOVV IS GOOD!!!!![/color]

[color=violet] If you are looking for the original natives, they are here, [/color] [region=New Christians United]


[color=blue]Quovv has grown attached to this region, he wants to keep it.[/color]

This region has outed the cimmerian supporters for the sacred order of Quovv!

Note that we did not capture this region, we just saw that it had been previously occupied, and that the natives already established a replacement [b](this was because of inactivity of much of the region)[/b]; with the invaders long gone, we saw that Quovv needed this region most.
