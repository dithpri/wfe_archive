[color=red]BEFORE YOU JUDGE QUOVV, READ THIS FIRST:

QUOVV DID NOT STEAL THIS REGION FROM CHRISTIANS!!! IT WS OCCUPIED BY [region=Cimmeria], BUT WAS THEN TAKEN BY QUOVV WHEN THEY TURNED IT INTO A PUPPET REGION

QUOVV IS GOOD!!!!![/color]

[color=violet] If you are looking for the original natives, they are here, [/color] [region= New Christians United]




Attention! This holy coup shall lead this region to salvation.

This region has outed the cimmerian supporters for the sacred order of Quovv!

Note that we did not capture this region, we just saw that it had been previously occupied, and that the natives already established a replacement; with the invaders long gone, we saw that Quovv needed this region most.

Praise him, Praise Quovv!
