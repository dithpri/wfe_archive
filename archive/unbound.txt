No gates, no crown, no leash. Here, authority is a rumor and order is whatever the loudest voice can hold onto. Outsiders don&#39;t last long; insiders don&#39;t stay sane. You&#39;ll find cliques, whispers, and shifting loyalties in the smoke. If you came looking for rules, you&#39;ve already made your first mistake.
