The Outer Rim Trade Routes is a space themed roleplay region that ties in it&#39;s gameplay with politics through the Galactic Council and Senate. All participating members are given a seat on the Galactic Senate where they are capable of creating, debating, and voting on, bills that will decide the course of the game. 

Once a month all members of the Senate will vote upon a new Galactic President who will assume the role of WA Delegate.
