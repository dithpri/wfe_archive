This is the re-introduction (The previous one is invalid; I was gone for ages and the password got changed) of the United Holy Empire of Boletaria, Lordran, Drangleic, and Greater Yharnam (the nations of Demon&#39;s and Dark Souls and Bloodborne), and seeks to become the premier military and industrial force in the world, so that the world might be mended, that the Age of Dark may dawn, that the throne may be occupied, and the Holy Blood be harnessed. The link to the forum is: http://w11.zetaboards.com/The_Souls_Empire/index/ All who wish to be part of such a region are welcome! There is a password to deter invasion, so telegram me if desiring to join!
