[i]&quot;Welcome to a Newer, Better Rome. Behave carefully, or death will appear.&quot;[/i]

Hello fellow Romans!
I give you: The New Roman Republic!
Here, we are a nice republic, that goes by the rules.
We are located near Italy, which is in Europe.

If you do not follow the rules, I will not be sorry kicking you off.

RULES

1. Follow the rules
2. Be respectful to everyone
3. If consulting the Leader (Me), Say &quot;Hail, Outer New Rome,&quot; then consult. (You have three chances. Once, a private warning. Twice, a public warning. Three times, an eject &amp; ban)
4. Say &quot;Please&quot; and &quot;Thank you&quot; when appropriate.
5. No trolling

Thank you, Romans,
