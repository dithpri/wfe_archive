Welcome, cadets, to the International Air and Naval Academy! Here, we&amp;#39;ll train you how to fight in the air, on land, and on sea! You&amp;#39;ll learn the mechanics of raiding, defending, espionage, military lingo, and much more! I&amp;#39;m the Commandant of Cadets, the Northern Allied Americas, or AAS.
