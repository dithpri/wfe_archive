Tauropa is a continent famous for the vast inland sea at the center of the landmass, leading some to dub Tauropa as &#39;the ring continent&#39; or, more playfully, &#39;doughnut-land&#39;.
Tauropa is a large continent and is home to many various and distinct nations. Due to the inland sea - neutrally known as &#39;the Center-Sea&#39; due to the sheer number of distinct names different cultures use for it - communication and trade across the continent has always been very good.
