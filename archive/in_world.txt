[b][color=red]Why&amp;#8230;.hello there![/color]

I bet you&amp;#8217;re surprised to see us visiting your region, huh? (Well&amp;#8230;probably not as surprised as [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=magna_aurea][i][color=red]some people[/color][/i][/url] are, lol). Well, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], along with their friends from [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] and [region]Sparkalia[/region] thought that your region was entirely lacking in festive cheer, so we decided to put up some holiday decorations! Our services are free of charge, as always :P
