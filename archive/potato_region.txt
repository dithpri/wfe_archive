&quot;We must be the Great Arsenal of Democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war. I believe that the [Fascist] powers are not going to win this war.&quot; - President Franklin D. Roosevelt
