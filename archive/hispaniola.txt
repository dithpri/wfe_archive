Hispaniola is the 22nd-largest island in the world, located in the Caribbean island group, the Greater Antilles. It is the second largest island in the Caribbean after Cuba, the tenth-most-populous island in the world, and the most populous in the Americas.

The island contains two sovereign nations, with the Dominican Republic occupying the easternmost 64% of the island&amp;#39;s area, and Haiti the remainder. It is the site of the first European colonies founded by Christopher Columbus on his voyages in 1492 and 1493. -- Wikipedia.com
