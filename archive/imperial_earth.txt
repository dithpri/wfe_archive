[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

This region was previously owned by the now moderator nuked region of [region]The Greater Germanian Reich[/region], and was the previous regional project of the founder of discount TGGR. [region]Imperial Earth[/region] was at one point an ally to [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation], and was involved in several diplomatic and military affairs across NS. This region has been permanently seized in order to keep out all communists, anti-fascists, neo-nazis, and fascists.
