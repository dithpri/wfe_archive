Once upon a time there was a region called Pax. All nations in it were peaceful &#150; except the ones that weren&#146;t &#150; and had a great time until the Violence Plague swept through the region. Pax was reincarnated, and several nations moved back to Pax. Again, all nations became extinct, due to the Sadism Virus this time (evidence indicates that [nation]Satan Servants[/nation], who was resident in Pax II for a time, was to blame) but this time there was a lone survivor, [nation]Northeast Mayfly[/nation]. Northeast Mayfly founded Punctuation Pax, and welcomes any peaceful, grammatically correct nation &#150; although they won&#146;t turn you away even if you&#146;re not. And so they all lived happily ever after.
