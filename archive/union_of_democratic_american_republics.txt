This Union of Democratic American Republics (U.D.A.R. for short) is an anti-Facist union of nations. the member state&#39;s nationality is irrelevant. The only way that you can&#39;t join is if you&#39;re a harsh dictatorship or a communist nation. The alliance is for small (or large) nations that need protection from communists and dictators. The founder and WA delegate will be the same until the next election (in two months.) The Overseer is not a very significant all it does is to report most problems to the fouder and/or WA delegate.
