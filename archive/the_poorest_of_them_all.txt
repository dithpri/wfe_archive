Seriously? After I shutdown the first &amp;quot;raid attempt&amp;quot; (I don&amp;#39;t know if what failure that was if I consider it a raid), you come back with different people and expect what? A success?? Well I hate to break it to you, but you will not take this region, no matter what you try to do. So please, don&amp;#39;t waste my time with your foolish acts of tyranny.
