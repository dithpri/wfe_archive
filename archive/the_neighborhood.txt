[i]Welcome to our happy little community, where everyone&#39;s your neighbor![/i]

But this is no ordinary neighborhood! Eccentric residents, extraordinary occurrences, and the most unusual of propositions! This is perhaps one of the most unstable living areas NationStates has ever laid eyes on, but by forces beyond our comprehension, moving away is out of the question. Engage in neighborly disputes, egg people&#39;s houses, oust Helen in our next community gathering, and steal people&#39;s gardening equipment. Anything goes in this chaotic hellhole of a neighborhood!
