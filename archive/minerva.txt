[hr]Deo Proximo[hr][i]We are a neutral and independent region built upon the virtues of Fidelity, Humanity, Dignity, and Justice, with the purpose of promoting a united, moral, and creative society.[/i][/b][hr][b][u]Principles[/u]:[/b]
[b]&#149; Duty[/b] &#151; To honor one&#146;s obligations, whether imposed by God, or adopted voluntarily. All action is governed by obligation.
[b]&#149; Tradition[/b] &#151; God has established the World, and has imposed His laws upon it. To cut oneself off from the past is to separate oneself from Creativity. We reject Post-Modernist Nihilism.
[b]&#149; Harmony[/b] &#151;  We recognize the unity of Humanity, as well as the Natural and Spiritual, the Legal and Mystical, and the individual and social spheres.[hr][b]&#149; [u]Endorsement Policy[/u]: Open[/b][hr]
