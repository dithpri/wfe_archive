The [b]Hyperborean Ocean[/b] is a vast ocean in the far north of the globe. Mostly encompassing the polar arctic regions of the northern hemisphere, the ocean is home to many islands, archipelagos, and nations that call the rough seas of the north their home. Formerly one of the more quieter, isolated parts of the world, globalization and the discovery of offshore oil has set the formerly peaceful region on the course to become a flashpoint for future global conflicts.
