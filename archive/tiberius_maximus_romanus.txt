[color=red][b]Hail the Empire![/b][/color]

Welcome to the glorious region of [b][region]Tiberius Maximus Romanus[/region][/b], ruled by Imperator Maximus [b][nation]FUHREER UNION[/nation][/b]. This region was formed by revolting against European powers. But now all of us live peacefully, so don&#39;t think we are barbarians just because we have a weird name in Roman that we don&#39;t understand a bit of. 

[color=blue][b]~Feel free to contact our Vice President [nation]Infinity Council[/nation] for being a part of the Empire.[/b][/color]
