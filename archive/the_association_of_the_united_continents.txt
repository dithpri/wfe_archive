The region of TATUC was originally created as a type of meme region against communists and anarchists. However, it is now a region where nations can unite to fight together in semi-serious roleplaying war situations with other nations. We have recently renovated and &quot;revived&quot; our region, so we will be a lot more active in the coming times.
