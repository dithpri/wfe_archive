[color=green]Fascism is a path to darkness. This region, when it stood, encouraged the weak and foolish to follow that path to their doom. As such, the founder sank to the depths of disgrace, and the Knights of The Eternal Order moved in to fill the void.  Quickly and devastatingly, all those who stood in their way were banned, and this region was silenced forever. This region is now a trophy of the international anti-fascist and anti-Nazi movement, and once again the Fash have been dealt a blow, for never again may this region harbor those of Nazist hatred.
