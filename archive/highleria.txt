A land once known as North America, after plagues and famine swept through the region causing unrest in the population, the governments collapsed causing almost a pure reset of civilization.This led to a new age of diverse leaders and people, ruled over by the military of whenwassia but power of the region is delegated to the other leaders allowing them to control their own provinces as they please.
