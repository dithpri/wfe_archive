British Canadians are not the first nations to settle what is now Canada, but were the founder nations that built what everyone else takes for granted. Our people are the English and Scots and under the UK flag we drove off the French and Spanish to claim the land for British. We welcome our celtic neighbors as we did with the Irish.
