[B][COLOR=black]FOUNDATIONALIST PARTY OF AMERICA[/COLOR]
&quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, [u]indivisible[/u], with liberty and justice for all.&quot;

[i][color=#0457d3]Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: &#147;In God is our trust.&#148;
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O&#146;er the land of the free and the home of the brave![/i][/color][/b]
