The WTA is an organization devoted to trading, national sovereignty, expanding democracy, liberty, freedom, and protecting nations that cannot protect themselves. The WTA originated from the Six Nations, a tight coalition of democratic nations seeking to protect their autonomy and defend themselves from outside threats. With many of those threats put to rest following the [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=508210]Treaty of South Olpen[/url], the Six Nations unanimously agreed to expand their ranks and work towards helping the world at large.
