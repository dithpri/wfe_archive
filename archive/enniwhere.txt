Hey, RPers of [region]the South Pacific[/region]! Does [region]Psomewhere[/region]&#39;s current story have no opening? Is [region]Knowhere[/region]&#39;s present RP too serious?

[b][u][i]Welcome to Enniwhere![/u][/b] No rules, no regulations, this is a place where you--yes, [b]you[/b]--can feel free to be bad at roleplaying, whether intentionally or not![/i] 

Godmodders will battle to the [i]n[/i]th death. 
&quot;Plots&quot; will be hijacked, merged, or split.
Nothing will be personnel, kid.
It will feel [b]good[/b] to be [b]bad[/b]!
