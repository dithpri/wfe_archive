Welcome to Loveland

A peaceful region that has been attacked by raiders in the past. Looking for anyone interested in joining this new region that wants to become a regional powerhouse.

1. We want to grow to become a global influence.

2. We want to eventually get onto the security council.

3. We want to have off-site forums in the future.

4. We are looking for members that are interested in setting up a regional government.

5. We are looking to have fun with this game and help those that want to further their nation within this game.

We welcome all to Loveland...
