-&amp;gt; We are here to serve a sanction to those of socialist, and other forms of authoritarian governments or both far right and left wing parties. Others may join as well, we always want a new comrade among us. As long as you don&amp;#39;t infuse our great society with doubt, we&amp;#39;ll welcome you any time. 

-&amp;gt; We are here to love all our comrades, and we will work the hardest we can to keep our region alive and thriving. That way we will be able to provide a sanction for our nation.

-&amp;gt; We are beautiful nation, based on socialist ideologies, so we are an equalist group, based on semi-democratic systems.
