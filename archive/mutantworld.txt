Nearly a thousand years ago, the world was
plunged into a terrible war that destroyed
mankind&#146;s civilization, plunging him into
centuries of darkness from which he has
still not fully recovered. The aftereffects of the war
&#151; radiation, plagues, mutagenic chemicals, uncontrolled
nanotech &#151; have worked profound changes
but on life itself, mutating people and animals in
ways that are sometimes benign, sometimes horrific.
It&#146;s a strange new world... one rife with danger
and adventure!
