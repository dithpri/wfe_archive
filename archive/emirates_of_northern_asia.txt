In the &#145;Emirates of Northern Asia&#146; or the &#145;Next Reality&#146; a comet has crashed in the middle of Asia, separating it into three sections, North, South, and West. This is the North Centrist Alignment of Asia and the Meteor that has crashed contains microbes of new, evolving life, (Dinosaurs exist again) so now Asia will have to upgrade their militaries to compete with the opposing reptilians. Will Asia work together and fortify against the creatures, or prepare for war against eachother?
