It&#39;s clear you&#39;ve stumbled upon us somehow, so let me show you around. We first started as multiple regions, merged into one called [region]Alamiralia[/region], and lost that one&#39;s founder. This is its successor state. The rules are still mostly the same; roleplay is still in effect and nobody talks trash about the delegate. So, kids, new to the region or not, have tons-a-fun and play on!
