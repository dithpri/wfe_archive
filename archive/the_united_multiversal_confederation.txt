It&#39;s clear you&#39;ve stumbled upon us somehow, so let this holographic message show you around. We first started as multiple regions, merged into one called [region]Alamiralia[/region], and lost that one&#39;s founder. This was its successor state. However, this region has since been dissolved by a referendum polled among the last remaining citizens of the former Alamiralian Commonwealth. We have since moved to [region]New Hyperion[/region]. All of us will be found there post-exodus.

To my fellow Alamiralians, thanks for the memories! To the future!
