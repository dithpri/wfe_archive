[color=blue] The [b]Reality Council[/b] ([b]ReCo[/b]) is an inter-reality organization founded many years ago, that was brought to Nationstates January 2012. More information can be found [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=reality_council/detail=factbook]here[/url].

Within Nationstates, the Reality Council sought to establish a very weak Regional Confederacy. Members of the Confederacy all declare that they are members, and are put on the list of members (found at the bottom). The Council itself has no power.

The Council, originated from the Council&amp;#39;s Home of [region=Land of Power].
