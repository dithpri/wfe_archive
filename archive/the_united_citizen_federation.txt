The Federation is a conglomerate of national entities intent on the preservation of militaristic idealism and the promotion of the inherent good that society is capable of.

The Federation is dependent upon the body as a whole to perform perfectly; thereby The Federation is only as strong as it&amp;#39;s weakest member, and the advisory board will ensure that all are capable of performing to standards that meet the needs of this ideal model.

The bottom line, however, is this:  You shall only govern if you have earned the right to govern.
