The Kovinash is a small but dynamic republic balancing tradition and modernisation. Its strengths are a diverse economy anchored in trade and culture, resilient communities and an active civil society. Key vulnerabilities are climate exposure on the coast, infrastructural gaps inland, and the need to equalise opportunities across regions. With steady governance and investment in human capital, Kovinash&#146;s prospects for inclusive growth remain promising.
