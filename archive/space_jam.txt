Space Jam is a place for most, but not all. I want this to be a small region, with most people just talking about and supporting other ideas. Space Jam is about countries being mainly eco-friendly, nice to other nations, and many more diplomatic things rather than dictator-like actions. If you want to join, go ahead. Keep in mind you might be kicked if your country doesn&#39;t match our standard of compassion for others.
