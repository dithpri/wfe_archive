[b]The Democratic Republic of Zimbabwe[/b]

[hr]

Zimbabwe&amp;#39;s government is a corrupt authoritarian tyranny that regularly violates rights to shelter and food, freedom of movement and residence, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and protection of the law. It is also notorious for using child soldiers and oppressing minorities, most notably white and GSRM Zimbabweans. What could have been a triumphant revitalization of the country following the end of white Rhodesian rule has been prevented by the rule of Robert Mugabe.
