As was carried forward in the past by the region [region]Corporate Conservative[/region] by its founder Rephias and original members such as Verak, New Corporate Conservative proudly carries forth the banner of social and fiscal conservatism. 
Though the original members are gone forever, and their region founderless and in a state of neglect, and decay, their ideas live on and this region shall remain dedicated to capitalism, ultra-nationalism, and militarism.
