&quot;Ex Tenebris, Lux&quot;
          
Upon a shining river and luscious land,
A collection of idiots who back each other in world affairs.
The people of this land call themselves &quot;Lawlandian&#39;s&quot;, and join together in the betterment of our fellows.

This region will remain private as a group of friends. We thank you for your understanding.
