[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by! 

[color=red]My timing was called the best today. Hoorah for the Somerset Guard and their constant wits despite all the cider! A pleasure to serve today and force myself up. UIAF shall rule supreme and always carry the Imperialist Mantle![/color]

[color=blue]Fairy wanted a mention. I caught a Fairy once and it was dying so I said I believe and suddenly its mortal wounds were healed. I still know that Fairy today &amp;lt;3[/color]

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!
