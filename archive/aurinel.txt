If the world ends, that is not the end of history.

637 years ago, the world came to a crashing end, but civilization survived. While most of history before the Cataclysm has been lost, new societies and civilizations have arisen. New lines have been drawn, mainly between Humans and Anthros. Life has been primarily pastoral, but the rise of the steam engine is beginning a new revolution: a technological revolution that has begun to restructure the base organization of society.

As the skies grow smoky, so do the hearts of nations. New ideologies are arising, and the old orders must either adapt or be crushed by the inexorable advance of history. The last chapter of Civilization has come to an end, and a new chapter opens.
