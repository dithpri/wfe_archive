Aurinel is a changing world. For thousands of years, people have lived dominated by the rhythms of nature and the world. Now, however, the rise of the steam engine has begun to revolutionize the way nations work. As the skies fill with smoke, so do the hearts of nations, and as gears move the machines, so too do they begin to move the minds of all sentient beings.

The times, they are a-changing.
