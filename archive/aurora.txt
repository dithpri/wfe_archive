Aurora is a modern-tech RPing region, with an emphasis both on realistic, quality RPing, and upon each player&amp;#39;s freedom to RP in their own way. If you want fun, personalized RPs with good writing and appropriate realism (including geographic and population caps), then Aurora is the place for you! 

This region is still in the planning phases, and we&amp;#39;d love to hear from you. Contact us by TGing [nation]Norvenia[/nation], or on Espernet IRC at #RegionAurora (this channel may not be in continuous operation).
