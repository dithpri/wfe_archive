[b]Eight Knights of [region]Albion[/region]. They waited in the fortifications of Fairfax, ready to strike out against Quebec. No Battle of the Plains of Abraham for Wolfe today. No. Today the forces of Albion are supreme. Without a murmur of resistance either from the soldiers of the region, or from the self-styled &amp;#39;defenders&amp;#39;, they overcame their quarry and seized control of the Quebec. Today the Knights of Albion don&amp;#39;t march on! Today Albion stays! Today Albion is triumphant!
