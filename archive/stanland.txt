In this pristine land under the beautiful Constitution, you can live life the way YOU want to, not how a far-off Congress wants you to. The government is there only to do what the Constitution says. Anything more, and we EXPECT a rebellion. The economy of the region is fueled by the might of capitalism, and through the will of the people. Our god, Stanek, watches over us everyday to ensure our safety and our freedoms remain the strongest on the planet. Join us in our quest for glory in becoming the model nation for all to follow!
