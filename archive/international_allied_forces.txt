The IAF is a new region that is now fledging out. Being as ambitious as it is, and having Zatryae, an economical powerhouse for its age, as the executive, the IAF will quickly gain after a lose. Just don&amp;#39;t try getting on the nerves of any IAF members, or you&amp;#39;ll be seeing ALL OF the IAF economy at work against you.
