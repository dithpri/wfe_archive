Welcome to the Insane and Right, reserved for states who recognize and realize the harmful hegemony of the World Assembly, with sympathy towards raiders, despite the aggression, due to being the main threat to the World Assembly and assorted defenders. Note that we do not view the World Assembly and the Defenders as vile, but rather that we view them as preserving a vile hegemony that needs to be stopped. We believe their hearts are in the right places, but that their methods are not.

Formerly just libertarian, but our founder&#39;s puppet isn&#39;t.
