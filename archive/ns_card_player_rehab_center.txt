A safe place for nations to escape the NS card cycle of doom.
No cards are allowed.
Nations in NSCPR found holding cards will be ejected.

How does this work?
NS players create card sober nations and place them into NSCPR. Nations must refrain from owning cards, drawing cards and buying or selling cards. This demonstrates control or a lack thereof.
Can you handle the challenge?

Embassy requests will be accepted in the order received.

Note: March 21st raid by TBH was a complete and utter failure thanks to [region]Liberalia[/region] defenders.  Thanks out to all of them.  Glad you guys could familiarize with the place for your possible later medical needs.   Region will remain in lockdown for the foreseeable future.
