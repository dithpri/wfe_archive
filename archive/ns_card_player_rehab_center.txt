A safe place for nations to escape the NS card cycle of doom.
Unauthorized cards aren&#39;t allowed.
Nations in NSCPR found holding illegal cards could be ejected.

How does this work?
NS players creating card sober nations can place them into NSCPR. Nations must refrain from owning or playing with illegal cards. This demonstrates self control or a lack thereof.
This of course will be a challenge.  

Embassy requests will be accepted in the order received.
