Norlandia is a loose collection of states in the northern reaches of the planet Arrakis. They share a similar culture based on spiritual animism and prize water above all on this dry planet. To greet one another they bring four fingers to the forehead and spitting on the floor is considered to be a sign of great respect or a bond of agreement. &quot;Spice&quot; is their most prized resource -- a sort of hyper-caffeine which eliminates the human need for sleep for days at a time.
