The Zone is a 200 Km area around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant that is, quite simply, a man-made Hell. From lethal pockets of radiation and terrifying mutants, petty criminals who murder for their own Amusement and strange, impossible anomalies resulting from a mysterious second explosion in 2006, the Military keeps a strictly enforced border around the Zone. Even still, brave men and women, known as STALKERS illegally live and work in the Zone for numerous reasons. Death is common, fear is omnipresent, and you will be on your own. Suit up and prepare yourself for the struggle of your life, STALKER.
