Tired of watching over your own people? Have someone else do it for you! We will strive to monitor the actions of each and every individual (and yes, that includes you) in our region, ensuring a safer, better tomorrow.
But don&#39;t worry, we aren&#39;t an invasive species. If anything, this is like a habitat for your policies to run wild. We&#39;ll just be there with a camera in hand, filming your nation as it prospers... or burns.

Welcome to our new members! Enjoy your complementary titles, and the benefits or lack thereof that come with them.

Upon making a connection with [region]The Embassy[/region], we will now be able to spread our sights to other regions! But don&#39;t think that means you&#39;ll have it any easier, the walls have ears - and eyes as well.
