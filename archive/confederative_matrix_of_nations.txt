[color=blue]The Confederative Matrix of Nations, or Matrix for short, is an innovative political project on NS. A matrix is an array of elements that differ, yet act as a unit, giving the matrix special mathematical properties. This Matrix too has unique political properties: strong political ties between members in the Assembly, yet much sovereignty retained by nations. There are also elections for WA Delegate and for constitutional changes.

All nations are invited to join this Matrix: a region filled with politics and fun. Early birds are guaranteed to play an important role in constructing the early community and forming its politics. Join the Matrix &#150; a region like no other.[/color]
