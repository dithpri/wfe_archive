We are the soldiers, fighters for our freedoms! We must come together to create a greater Earth for the People! Let no bureaucrats stand in our way. We must take up arms, settle our differences and defeat the evil politicians, and rid our nation of the horridness some may call, laziness. So join us in the revolution of form a greater earth!
