The Taborite Directory is the union of all nations that came to be after the great anarchic empire of Gypsy Tabor went out in a nuclear blaze of glory because it was funny. The union is named after the elite armed forces of former Gypsy Tabor and lead by a state that considers itself to be its successor. The union&#39;s economy is focused on building giant toilets.
