Just a place to chill and discuss MTG stuff. Standard, Modern, Pioneer, EDH, Arena or whatever crazy format you&acute;d like to talk about.

talking about other games is fine as well, but would be nice if you keep to the fantasy stuff (plz no csgo)
if u wanna talk politics join the forums or whatever.
