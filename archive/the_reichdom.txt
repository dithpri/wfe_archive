The name might be serious, but the group is still fun. This group is more of a Roleplay and electives region. You can get elected for different classes along with Roleplay. If members of the dead Aukum are here, they will put out all the RP rules. Quick side not this region is not hate speech or anything offensive to people, Just for fun.
