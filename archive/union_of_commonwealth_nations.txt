On September 17, 2013, the UCN was liberated by the combined forces of [nation=short]Belgieria[/nation] and [nation=short]Tinshein[/nation] from the hands of a small raiding region known as [b][region]The Ring of Fire[/region][/b] (which was liberated). After achieving independence, it became a founding member of the [b] TF Associates&amp;#39; Program[/b] and helped paved the way for the admission of several other members, creating a strong, secure network of regions within the Trade Federation.
