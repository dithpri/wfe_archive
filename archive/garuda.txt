This is small region. All of the regions here are canadian so far, (Ontario, Quebec and BC so far) but if you arn&amp;#39;t, don&amp;#39;t be afraid to join up. We are pretty non-aggressive and small, so if you&amp;#39;re just starting up, this is the place for you. We&amp;#39;ll tell you all about our pet polar bears and igloos :). It&amp;#39;ll be fun just come.
