[b]This here is the Plateau of Bonne Esperance![/b]

Although, now that I think about it... [i]We&#39;re not on Earth[/i]. We&#39;re on a small little planet about half the size of [u]the Blue Marble[/u]. This is why we have a lot of options for where to establish a community.

But the Plateau is a good place to start with, given its calm nature.
We demand to each nation present here to be read the rules of the Plateau before doing anything else.
We are focused here, on a trade, pacifism, and fairness.

When messages are published on the message board, especially after a rule change, the commanding nations [b][u]MUST[/u][/b] and [b][u]WILL[/u][/b] send you a message.

Please endorse the ruling nations of the region, as to increase our standing in the WA.
