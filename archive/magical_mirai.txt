Original description:
[i]Welcome to the Grand Hatsune Miku Alliance - also known as the Magical Mirai. This land is filled with various specialised Mikus&#39; Mirai Departments, Regional Interests Control Centres and proud Mikuists who come together with only one goal -- to bring about the true &#39;Magical Mirai&#39;.
