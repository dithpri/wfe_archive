Rules: one the nation can&#146;t be all ways be in war  but it must be considered a possible war to finish the fight hint (that&#146;s a halo iii renfence)
Two the nation needs a identity so no pure random cringe that makes Johnson go say what 
Three  no unknown aliens that can&#146;t be destroyed but they be killable but they can be unstoppable
And finally no random changes to your lore  but you can change your flags for events
