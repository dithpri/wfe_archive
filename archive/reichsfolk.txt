[b][u]Territory of the International Anti-Nazi/Fascist Community!!![/b][/u]

[I]Invaded: 30.08.17[/I]

[I]Secured: 23.09.17[/I]

[color=blue]This former Nazi/Fascist hellhole (sandcastle) was slowly, stealthily infiltrated and destroyed (ruined) by:

- [region]The MT Army[/region]
- [region]The Red Fleet[/region].
- [region]The Pacific[/region] Order (NPO).
- [region]The South Pacific[/region] Special Forces.
- [region]Ruining Nazi Sandcastles[/region].

We would kindly like to thank [nation=short]Hogwarts Pride[/nation] for supporting this operation after his failed Security Council proposal to condemn [region]Antifa[/region].

Fascists only speak a language of hate and violence! 25 enemy casualties occurred during this operation.[/color]

[color=red]Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region]. and we are everywhere![/color]
