[color=#8A0808][i][b]Greetings![/b][/i][/color] [color=#0101DF][b] Also known as the New Dominion Alliance Organisation (NDAO), we are a group of nations that primarily conduct defence operations on allied regions from invaders. Previously known as the Major Powers, this region was refounded as the Dominion Powers. Join us as you can become one of the army nations that serves protection and justice to allied regions.

[color=#900C3F][b]Under the WA Umbrellas Act, regions that have already established embassies with Dominion Powers can now request for endorsements from Dominion Powers to help them gain control of their region should they be under attack. Send a telegram to the Founder, Vice-Delegate or Security Officer if needed any help.[/b][/color]
