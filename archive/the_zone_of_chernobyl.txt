The Zone of Alienation, or simply &quot;The Zone,&quot; is the 60 km wide area of exclusion that was set up around the Chernobyl NPP following the 1986 disaster and extended by the second Chernobyl disaster in 2006.
The Zone of Alienation stretches between the borders of Ukraine and Belarus, and is kept protected by the Ukrainian authorities. Due to the radical decrease in human presence and activity, wildlife has flourished in the Zone and the area is often described as having been &quot;reclaimed by nature&quot;. Following the 2006 disaster, animals and plants have been grotesquely mutated and deadly anomalies abound.
