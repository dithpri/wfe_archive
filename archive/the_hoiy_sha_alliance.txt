Back In the middle of 2021, The Holy Sha Alliance seceded from The Heirs of Rome. Everything was good until Winter, 2022, When a great plague ravaged the Holy Sha Alliance, killing 87% of the Holy Sha. Major nations like Yesmanland, Of The Tyrannical Frogs and Yeettown usa survived...but in the end, Yesmanland voted to disband the Holy Sha. The Holy Sha stayed dead for months, until 4/21/2022, when the three great nations came back together...forming the Holy Sha Reformation.

LONG LIVE THE HOLIER SHA!
