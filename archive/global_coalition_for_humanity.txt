Welcome to the [b]Global Coalition for the Betterment of Peace and Humanity[/b], or the G.C.B.P.H for short, or the G.C for even shorter.

The GCBPH is an international union based on the furtherment of [u]peace among nations, and the development and protection of Humanity. [/u]

The G.C is a [b]free speech region[/b], meaning it encourages socratic dialogue and debate among its member nations, and prefers not to suppress messages unless absolutely necessary.

The G.C.B.P.H was born yesterday, so it is still under construction.
