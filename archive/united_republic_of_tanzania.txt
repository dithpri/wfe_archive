Tanzania is an East African country known for its vast wilderness areas. They include the plains of Serengeti National Park, a safari mecca populated by the &#147;big five&#148; game (elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo, rhino), and Kilimanjaro National Park, home to Africa&#146;s highest mountain. Offshore lie the tropical islands of Zanzibar and Mafia Marine Park, where whale sharks swim through reefs.
