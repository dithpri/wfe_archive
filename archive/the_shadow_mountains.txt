Dedicated to freedom and fighting for your beliefs, the Shadow Mountains is a dangerous place. This means that people don&amp;#39;t care about who you are so much as what it is you do and whether or not they can trust you. Fairness is a priority, whether in fighting (be it for freedom or revenge) or government. Do whatever you wish, so long as it doesn&amp;#39;t harm someone else, and if so, you should be prepared to deal with the consequences.
