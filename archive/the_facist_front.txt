Greetings Komrades; Slavs, Balkaners, Germanic and Scandinavians, anyone who will listen. The discrimination towards our great way of ruling is over with this declaration; We are here! We are not alone. We will face the past and future with bullets of silver and will of iron. 

We will be a shimmering island in a sea of intolerance and stagnant ideologies. The rebirth is here.
