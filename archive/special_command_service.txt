DEFCON LEVEL: 5 

The very existence of the SCS is a regional secret requiring a top-secret level classification to access. For this reason, formally we DO NOT EXIST! Only senior staff of Commuria and a select few region leaders even know of our existence.

It should go without saying that the leaking of anything from what we do is considered an Act of Treason!

The exact size of the organization shall remain unknown and the true location and names of the nations involved shall remain secret.

You are now the eyes and ears of Commuria and its allies.

please note: after 1/20/18
all new members will be sent a copy of the SCS directive via Email, it will be removed from the factbook
