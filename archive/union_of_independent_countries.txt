The UIC is a mutual defense pact, so if one member is attacked, the rest would back the attacked member. The UIC is also a technology and military sharing group. The UIC is split up into 3 main councils, the Council of State, which is responsible for maintaining membership of countries, the Council of Defense, which is responsible for maintaining military stuffs, and the Council of Representatives, which is responsible for making sure that all members are equally represented. There are Federal Elections every month, for the CoD, CoS, and the CoR.
You are REQUIRED to ask for reps for any of the three councils. So, yeah rules are in the discord.
