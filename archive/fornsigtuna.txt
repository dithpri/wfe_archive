[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] noticed that there was trouble coming from your region. We saw some smoke, and [color=red]fire blazing[/color] around parts of your region. 

Being upstanding citizens of society, we drenched your entire region with [color=blue]water[/color] to put out the fire. As we approach summer, these incidents will only become more and more common. 

Stay safe, and don&#39;t let fires start near you!
