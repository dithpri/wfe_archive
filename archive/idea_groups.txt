You haven&#39;t lived, man.
C&#39;mon, like none of you has ever picked up a dead bear off the road with the intent to bring it home to Westchester and skin it for the meat but forgot it in your car and went to a big dinner at Peter Luger steakhouse and didn&#39;t drink at all but you were with a bunch of other people who did and then you had to go to the airport but of course now you had a dead bear in your car but fortunately or not fortunately you also had an old bicycle and decided to fake an accident in Central Park and so you did and then flew off to wherever.
