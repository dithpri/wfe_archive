The ILA - Interplanetary Landing Areal is a region reserved for landingships and stations from nations of other galaxies and universes all across the multiverse.

[b]I will leave this region as soon as I find a region that is willing to take a new nation in this game, not just some nation to fill their region, but someone who they really want. A new partner and member. Don&#39;t throw your telegrams at me pretending that a newbie knows what to do.[/b]

Regions I am willing to join:
- Take me by the hand and explain me how your region works
- Talk with me
- Have fun
- [b]DISCORD[/b] as main communication tool
- Roleplay

Regions I am NOT willing to join:
- Spam me with telegrams explaining what to do before I can even join
