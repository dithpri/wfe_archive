A collection of island and coastal nations in the South Sea, struggling for footing in a hostile world and fighting for the dream that we all share - the hope for tomorrow. Open to all viewpoints and walks of life. We value justice, freedom, prosperity, security and long walks on the beach for all citizens. Our flag is cool. Send a Telegram to the offices of Grand Zephyr or West simathia for the region password if you are interested in joining us - we are always accepting new members and looking to grow!
