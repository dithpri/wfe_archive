The continent of Northermark was originally inhabited by various tribal semi-nations. This changed when the Teotians arrived and forged a nation out of those willing to follow. Many tribes joined, seeing them as the best option to unite against the hated Khergit raiders. In the aftermath of this unification several wars have been fought. And new nations have arisen. Both from other tribal confederations, and from different foreign invaders carving out their own little pieces of the land.
