[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr]

Initially captured by me in 2020 from [region]Raxulan Empire[/region], but I let them have it back after hostilities ended since I didn&#39;t really want this region. Then they lost it again... Now, in 2024, I have returned for good.
