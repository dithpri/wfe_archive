[color=blue]Welcome to The Pacific Northwest, a region with diverse environments and beautiful coastlines.[/color]

[color=green]The Pacific Northwest is a region dedicated to democracy, freedom, and peace. Our region welcomes most nations, however we have a left wing bias, so liberals are encouraged to join our region. Debate is encouraged in the region, and we strongly encourage nations to get involved in the region.[/color]
