[b][color=blue]Gentlemen, Fascism is a party, a political doctrine. But Fascism, while being a party, the political doctrine is above all a total conception of life. So the fascist, whether he&#39;s writing in the newspapers or reading them, going about his private life or talking to others, looking to the future or remembering the past and the past of his people, must always remember he is a Fascist. Thus he fulfills what can really be said to be the main characteristic of Fascism, to take life seriously. Life is toil, is an effort, is a sacrifice, is hard work.[/b][/color]
