Lumen is a large continent composed of various island nations.
Lumen is split into luminants: the Northern, central, eastern, western, southern and etrean luminants.
There are many different sources that lead to the conclusion that all of Lumen was once united into one large continent, though the rising tides have split it into the 6 Luminants known today.
