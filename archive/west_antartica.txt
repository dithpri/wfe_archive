[colour=#6f94b0][b]Welcome to this Cold Hell.[/b]
An island that is usually too busy trying not to freeze to deal with anybody outside of it. We mainly consist of nations trying to transition from modern to futuristic tech, and think that it would be funny if people took us seriously. No, we aren&#39;t Antarctica, we&#39;re a small island near Antarctica named Antartica. It&#39;s quite simple.
