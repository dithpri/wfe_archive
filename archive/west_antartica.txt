[colour=#6f94b0][b]Hi, uwu![/b]
This island is usually too busy trying not to freeze to deal with anybody outside of it, so [region]Elmos Small World[/region] came right in, uwu!
We noticed you had embassies with some rather unsavory regions. Those, and all others, will be closed uwu.

It is recommended to join the WA, and required to endorse our WA delegate, [nation=long]Rysetz[/nation], if you have.

Have a nice day. :)[/colour]
