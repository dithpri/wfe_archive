[region]States of Spiritual Incarceration[/region] (aka SoSI) is association of several different states, united after an uncertain cataclysm, before that existed independently and separately from each other. 
From now on, they are forced to work under a common flag for the general or personal benefit, while at the same time establishing connections and contacts with each other, moreover, trying to prove that they, too, are important for the world. What all this will lead to is still unknown, since new states continue to appear in the region literally out of nowhere.
