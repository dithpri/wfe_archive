puppet storage for [nation]SherpDaWerp[/nation]&#39;s card puppets. I always have gift space on my main, do you?

TG [nation]SherpDaWerp[/nation] for any card inquiries. I don&#39;t tend to keep cards on these pups though, so it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll have one you want here. You might see one on [nation]SherpDaWerp in TNP[/nation], though.
