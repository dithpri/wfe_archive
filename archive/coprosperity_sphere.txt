The Co-Prosperity Sphere, also known as the CPS, a concept that was developed in the Empire of Japan and propagated to Asian populations, and which officially aimed at creating a self-sufficient bloc of nations that would be led by the Japanese and be free from the rule of Western powers. The idea was first announced on 1 August 1940 in a radio address delivered by Foreign Minister Y&amp;#333;suke Matsuoka.

An earlier, influential concept was the geographically smaller version of the co-prosperity sphere which was called New Order in East Asia , which was announced by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe on 3 November 1938 and was limited to East Asia only.
