&amp;quot;Si vis pacem, para bellum&amp;quot; - If you want peace, prepare for war.

Welcome to the sovereign Region of Horses &amp;amp; Bayonets....a diverse, stable, and mutually supporting dominion led by our benevolent Regional Founder, His Most Awesome Excellency Baron Murphy von Hindlicher. We are armed and dangerous, we do our own stunts, and we will generally reject your reality and substitute our own. Woe to those who trespass on the sacred soil of our Region! Be forewarned.....mess with the best, die like the rest.
