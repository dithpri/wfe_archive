Welcome to the Sovereign Region of Horses &amp;amp; Bayonets....a diverse, stable, and mutually supporting dominion watched over by our benevolent Regional Founder, His Most Awesome Excellency Baron Murphy von Hindlicher. We are armed and dangerous, we do our own stunts, and we will usually reject your reality and substitute our own. Be forewarned: Mess with the best, die (or be banned) like the rest. Join us if you dare!
