The Western Atlantic is a region comprising the continents of Ambara and Vasconia as well as a number of islands in the Atlantic Ocean. To her east lie the ruins of the the Holy Western Confederation and the states that were borne from her, neighbouring the oriental nations of the land that Westerners have come to call Transmontana.

While there is some fantasy stuff here, this is primarily a region for those interested in (post) modern tech, relatively realistic type role-plays, both diplomatic and character based.
