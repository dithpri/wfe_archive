The Western Atlantic is a region comprising a large continental mass and several smaller subcontinents/large islands. Much of the Western Atlantic consists the ruins of the the Holy Western Confederation and the states that were borne from her, neighbouring the oriental nations of the land that Westerners have come to call Transmontana, and many states descended from European settlers on her eastern shore. While there is some fantasy stuff here, this is primarily a region for those interested in (post) modern tech, relatively realistic type role-plays, be it diplomatic, military, or character based.
