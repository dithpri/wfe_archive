[b][color=bluye]The Land of the FREE? 
Whoever told you that is your ENEMY.[/color][/b]

[i][color=grey]Your blue white &amp;amp; scarlet hypocrisy
Pitying the blindness that you&amp;#39;ve never seen
That the eagles of war whose wings lent you glory
They were never no more than carrion crows,

Dignity is that nation without nationality, 
that murmur of the heart no matter what blood lives it, 
that rebel irreverence that mocks borders, customs and wars.

For all this, &amp;amp; for all those for whom Justice is denied. 

No Justice, No Peace. 
An injury to one, is an injury to all.[/color][/i]

[b][color=black]Thank you to TITO, [region]Fort Triumph[/region] &amp;amp; [region]NeoConfederate States of America[/region] and their ill-judged trust in us as &amp;#39;natives&amp;#39; to protect the region.[/color][/b]
