[b]Welcome to [color=gold]New[/color] Talos![/b]

A community of fierce, flamboyant, colorful, and superfluous characters call this place home; they&amp;#39;re a stubborn and hardy kind, having beaten off three raids by those silly Black Rider kids from down the street. There&amp;#39;s a lot history here - from the Vanishing of Eleutheria, to the to the First Exodus, the Great Return, and now the Second Exodus that led to the creation of New Talos. But no matter what happens, we&amp;#39;ll always be a community; we&amp;#39;ll always be Talos. [i]We&amp;#39;re back, baby![/i]

Talos is a place for pretty much anything - socializing, joking, roleplaying, debating; if it isn&amp;#39;t raiding or being a jerk, go ahead an try it.
