[b]Welcome to [color=gold]New[/color] Talos![/b]   [color=grey](no, the Greek one!)[/color]

A community of fierce, flamboyant, colorful, and superfluous characters call this place home; they&amp;#39;re a stubborn and hardy kind, having beaten off three raids by those silly Black Rider kids from down the street.  Talos is a place for pretty much anything - socializing, joking, roleplaying, debating; if you&amp;#39;re not a jerk and willing to be part of a community, chances are you&amp;#39;ll be welcomed on the Isle of Talos.
