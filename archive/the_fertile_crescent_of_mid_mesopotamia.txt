What used to be a barren land torn apart by warring nomads is now the cradle of civilisation, all thanks to our lord and saviour Huey Long. In 0 AL he descended from the heavens, and preached upon mankind the faith of Zoaroastrianism. Thus, the chieftans put down their swords, and began building cities, and so nations emerged. However, after a dozen years of peace, love, and good business, the people are tiring for a new era of glorious conquests. Only time will tell if the world will continue to prosper, or if chaos shall be once again unleashed.
