The Principality of Chasolve and those nations which recognise Chasolvean hegemony form a distinct region of the world. This Chasolvean sphere of influence has been known as &#147;Wernoyd&#148; since the establishment of the Principality. Nations located within Wernoyd are expected to comply with certain directives from the government of Chasolve in return for various forms of assistance. Future expansion of the Wernoyd region may lead to the creation of a regional union, with a greater degree of input from other nations into regional directives.
