Mid Moon Sealand is a sunny, full of seals and other cute marine animals area.
It isn&amp;#39;t a place for those who suffer from vertigo.
It seems that Jupiter himself, millions of years ago, has chosen this place
to invent the lightning.
The lush vegetation promotes the good mood of the inhabitants, hospitable
for this reason.
This is a pacific region where swans run for a better world and for a future without war.
Whiteswans like blue lakes, trees, sun in the sky and little swans growing healthy and happy in this oasi. Beautiful tigers protect the Empire.
