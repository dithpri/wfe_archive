The Secular Triforce is an alliance where nations are scientific, sensible, tough and war-mongering but also completely insane. It was formed by three atheistic groups who broke away from their own country due to bring persecuted by Christians. They formed an alliance so that they could properly defend themselves from religious persecution. The founding countries were the Democratic States of Doubtland, the sensible one, the Dominion of Strife, the tough one, and the Armed Republic of Near-Insanity, the bonkers one.
