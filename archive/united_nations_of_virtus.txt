United Nations of Virtus: a region accepting of different types of nations and political ideals, founded by tech lovers and military tacticians. Nations of all types are welcome, as long as they do not harass other nations. We are now in the midst of getting a regional system and establishing roles right now, to join in on the fun telegram [nation]Airmount[/nation] or [nation]The Allied States of Borderlands of Gavin[/nation] for the password. We&amp;#39;re mainly pretty relaxed within the region, and we hope to become a flourishing region.
