Makkah (classically known as Bakkah) is the spiritual center of Islam. It is the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The first revelation of the Qur&#39;an was received by Muhammad in the Jabal An-Nur (Mountain of Light) of Makkah. Makkah is centered around the Ka&#39;bah, which was built by the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael (peace be upon them). Every year, millions of Muslims from around the world visit Makkah to perform the obligatory pilgrimage, known as the Hajj and the lesser pilgrimage, known as the Umrah.
