The Order of the Gallowglass is a confederation of nations bound by ties of faith, heritage, and martial tradition. Inspired by the legacy of the Gallowglass warriors &#151; Gaelic-Norse and Anglo-Norman mercenaries who served as the mailed fist of kings and chieftains &#151; the Order stands as a brotherhood of realms, united in oath yet sovereign in rule.

The Order is neither an empire nor a kingdom, but a loose confederation of independent Gaelic-Norse, and Anglo-Norman polities who gather under a shared covenant: to preserve their ancient traditions, defend their liberties, and stand as one against all threats.
