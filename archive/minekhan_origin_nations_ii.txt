In response, we decided to [b]rise from the ashes[/b] of our previous existence, crafting a new region that embodied the [b]very image our raider [u][i]despised[/i][/u][/b]. Embracing the role he cast upon us, we constructed a region steeped in fascist ideology, a calculated move to vex our antagonist and to turn his false assumptions into a [b]self-fulfilling prophecy[/b]. In doing so, we transformed into the monsters he perceived us to be, not out of belief, but as a defiant act of [b]rebellion[/b] against the unjust actions that were inflicted upon us.
