[b][color=2c73e6]Welcome to Modr&aacute;&amp;#345;eka- The Blue River.[/color]
[hr][color=e69b07]What is this region about?[/color]

[i]Through these nations flows the Modr&aacute;&amp;#345;eka, the metaphorical river of eternal [color=2c73e6]courage, loyalty, and freedom[/color]. This region welcomes nations of all kinds, with any nation being allowed to join.  We have a system of elections and meritocratic succession, to give [color=2c73e6]all nations[/color] the possibility of rising to the top.[/i]

Like many other regions, we have some restrictions on who you can endorse. There is no endorsement cap, but you [color=red]must[/color] endorse [nation]Hinlyia[/nation] before you can run for elections or endorse other nations.
