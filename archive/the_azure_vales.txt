The Azure Vales is a large continent with a large chain of large and small islands along its eastern coast. To the north lies the Ruby Mountains, a series of large peaks and valleys that divide the north from the south, and to its south lies the Obsidian Wastes, a vast desert. To the east lies the Golden Basin, a large network of flatlands and rivers.
