The Voluntary Libertarian Police States are dedicated to the Zero Aggression Principle and committed to the prevention of creating, or agitating for, involuntary restrictions or &quot;laws&quot; against anything but actual physical aggression.

We protect ourselves from aggression.  Our Volunteer Black Vans protect us from Legal Tyranny... 

If have become, or are trying to be a Libertarian Police State, we&#39;re accepting Volunteers.
