[b]Hello! Welcome to the IDSU![/b]

Just an FYI, this isn&#146;t a region actually for the IDSU, it&#146;s just a name I though of on the spot. Basic RMB rules are: OOC must be marked as such, no swearing, no slurs, be kind, and when RP is going on don&#146;t clutter the board with a ton of posts for one message.
