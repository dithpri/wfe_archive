[i]Welcome to [region]Extaria[/region]! We are a [b]mostly[/b] friendly Region, I guess.[/i] I know everyone says that, but most of the time they are filled with a bunch of communist or monarchist losers who do nothing in their spare time but insult other regions and nations. [i]No, I am [b]not[/b] being a hypocrite. Well, maybe I am, but no one cares about your opinion.[/i]

I will not lie and say we are a democratic region, not like those other regions that have 1000+ nations and the WA Delegate has his own group of friends that rule the WHOLE region, and everyone else has no voice whatsoever. But, maybe they do, but there are so many voices that just one voice is not heard. That&amp;#39;s the problem.
