Well, we got raided. I&#39;ve done damage control, but I don&#39;t know how long this will last. I&#39;ve been kicked from the position of WA delegate, but I still have exec power, so all of the changes these raiders made have been undone and the perpetrators banned from the region. Until such point as I can believe we are secure, I&#39;m passwording the region and establishing temporary authoritarianism. If you need anything, message me. That is all. -Marcx
