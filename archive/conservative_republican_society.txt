For all those conservative republicans who are suppressed by the liberal democratic party. Jk, for anyone really, liberals, conservatives, bipartisans, you name it, you&#39;re welcome here.
We won&#39;t tolerate: 
-Hate speech, death threats, belittling or demeaning nicknames, hating on someone because of their religion, or racism. We&#39;re all human here, and we&#39;re civilized.

I&#39;m sorry if you&#39;re offended, but you&#39;re gonna have to deal with the flag.

Freedom of speech is regarded highly, second only to freedom of religion.
