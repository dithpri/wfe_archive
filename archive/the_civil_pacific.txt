The Civil Pacific is a simple alliance of Pacific nations that are either nonpartisan, centrist, or otherwise nonextreme and individualistic in their dominant ideology. This alliance implies trust and peace among its members and only requires that a nation be voluntarily accepted by the majority of existing members to be included.
