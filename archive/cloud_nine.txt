Cloud Nine is a miracle of technological wonder. Artificially created by the time travelers collectively known as the Source alongside aerospace construction specialist Sarlacc Industries, the entire region was designed as a massive mobile continent that floats at altitudes ranging from 25,000 to 35,000 feet above the earth&amp;#39;s surface.

Some of the brightest minds of every field call Cloud Nine home, which offers great freedom for innovation. While the official government is formed by the Republic of Atmos, the day-to-day administration of the region falls on Atmos Macrotechnology, a corporate conglomerate that boasts it&amp;#39;s own autonomous laws and serves as the primary export facility of Atmos and Cloud Nine itself.
