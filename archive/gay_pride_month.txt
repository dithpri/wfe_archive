Gay Pride Month is an abhorrent display of identity politics and I was surprised to find that this region was not already founded. Every month is the month where people should be proud of there heritage, race, and sex, not some random arbitrary month where everybody is supposed to suck up to certain groups. While I personally do not agree with the &quot;LGBTQXYZ123LMNOP098&quot; movement, I think that if you&#39;re going to practice it in your own bedroom where it belongs, it&#39;s fine (under a secular view that is). When you start forcing everybody to wear rainbows and force them to conform or else they&#39;re a Nazi, that is when I draw the line.
