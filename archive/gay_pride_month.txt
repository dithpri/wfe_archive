Your sexual preferences should not define your personality and dominate your every day interactions, and should not grant a month where you get special treatment. If you say want to be treated the same, then act like it. &quot;Gay Pride Month&quot; is discriminatory on an existential level, in the sense that it deems one demographic worthy of exceptional praise over others.
