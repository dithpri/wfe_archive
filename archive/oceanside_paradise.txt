Pristine and untouched by industry or consumerism, this land covers a broad swath of territory encompassing every type of ecosystem and is highly dedicated to the preservation of all of them.  Coming here means leaving ideas of currency behind and living in what seems to be an entirely different paradigm-- One possessed of a level of compassion thought unheard of in the outside world.  Because of this, it keeps itself very isolated and is suspicious of visitors, yet welcoming of them once they have proven that their intentions are pure.  You don&amp;#39;t have to imagine all the people living life in peace, with no money or religion, here;  That&amp;#39;s simply the reality of this Oceanside Paradise.
