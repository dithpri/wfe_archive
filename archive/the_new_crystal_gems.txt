If you&#39;re evil, and you&#39;re on the rise
You can count on the four of us taking you down
&#39;Cause we&#39;re good and evil never beats us
We&#39;ll win the fight and then go out for pizzas

We are the Crystal Gems
We&#39;ll always save the day
And if you think we can&#39;t
We&#39;ll always find a way

If you could only know, what we really are
When we arrived on Earth, from out beyond your star
We were amazed to find, your beauty and your worth
And we will protect your kind,
And we will protect your Earth
And we will protect your Earth,
And we will protect you!

 The odds are against us, this won&#39;t be easy, but we&#39;re not going to do it alone!
We are the Crystal Gems!
We&#39;ll always save the day
And if you think we can&#39;t
We&#39;ll always find a way
