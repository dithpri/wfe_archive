[u][b][region] The Monarchist Concordat[/region][/b][/u] is a relatively small, national-sovereigntist region that supports your right to lead your nation to glory. We focus on player interaction, creating an amicable community, and operating a [b]unique and vibrant RP[/b]. All right-wing or monarchist nations are welcome. We are vehemently anti-Islam.

[b]COMMUNISTS AND MUSLIMS NEED NOT APPLY[/b]

Most regional activities, including our unique roleplay, happen via the [url=https://discord.gg/GatAEpu] Regional Discord[/url]

[b]IT IS THE OFFICIAL POSITION OF THE MONARCHIST CONCORDAT THAT THE WORLD ASSEMBLY IS A REPRESSIVE AND ANTAGONISTIC ORGANIZATION. WHILE WE DO NOT RESTRICT A PLAYER&#39;S RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO BE A PART OF THE WA, WE ACTIVELY DISCOURAGE MEMBERSHIP. WE SIMPLY WISH TO BE LEFT ALONE.[/b]
