Founded by British in 1766 the calradic lands fell into anarchy and chaos after the American revolution. War was rife until 1800 Richmand led the remnants of the British people with support from the British empire and setup decromatic state around dirhim and they became dominion  of the British empire and for a 1000 years they prospered under the British rule. By the dawn of the 29th century those are gone and British calradi is again falling into decline, the empires influence fading, states under British calradias control are declaring independence and the dominion after suffering massive crashes in population because of famine, war and citizens fleeing is helpless to stop it and a greater threat looms.
