Hidden deep within the Ironspine Peaks, the Ironspire Dominion is a testament to dwarven ingenuity and strength. Founded by clans seeking riches in the mountains, it has grown into a sprawling underground empire rich in iron, gold, and mithril.
Protected by towering stone spires adorned with dwarven runes, the Dominion is ruled by a council of elders under the High King, descended from the founding clans. It boasts formidable defenses and a renowned military.
While largely isolationist, the Dominion trades its exquisite metalwork and gemstones with outsiders who dare traverse the treacherous mountain passes. Visitors are cautiously welcomed, respecting dwarven customs and laws under the watchful eyes of warriors clad in finest dwarven armor.
