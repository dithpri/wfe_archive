A limitless expanse that is accessible only to dreamers. Stretching from the unknown abode of the Gods, Kadath, to the underworld, to the ruins of Sarkomand, the Dreamlands are populated by a wide range of people who worship a wide range of gods. 

Firmly rooted in the H.P. Lovecraft Mythos, the Dreamlands are open to any RP-ers who desire to write weird Fiction/Sci-Fi.
