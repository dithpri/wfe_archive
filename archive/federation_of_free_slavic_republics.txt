The Federation of Free Slavic Republics, or F.F.S.R., was founded by The Republic of Arkstotzka from the ashes of the Soviet Union. As Arkstotzka&#39;s influence gained after 1991, it slowly annexed Russian territory until enveloping of all Russia under the Arkstotzkan banner. Other nations such as Poland, Lithuania, and other small former Soviet satellite states joined, with Arkstotzka, under a common banner of the F.F.S.R., once again becoming a major political and military force. The F.F.S.R. is a staunchly anticommunist alliance, knowing all to well the effects of the failed system.
