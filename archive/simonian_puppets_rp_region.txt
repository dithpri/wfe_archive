An 100 square kilometer equatorial island 500km southeast of [region]Majestia[/region] and a place for the Greater Simone Squad members to chat with each other when they&#39;re bored! Other nations can chat too, but this is an RP region. You might find it weird to see someone chatting with themself, but I have to do something with all my puppets.
Like [region]Majestia[/region] and [region]Snowyland Lana[/region], this region will have lots of polls for you to do. This region triples as an extra poll region and a card farm region.
Anyone can join, though I suggest you not to. Please consider joining [region]Majestia[/region] before joining this region.
[b]Rules:[/b]
1, You must RP as your countryball in a tropical island here at all costs.
2, Any WA members in this region will be ejected and if they come back, banjected.
