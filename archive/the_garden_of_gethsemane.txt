The good King Dagobert
Was hunting in the Antwerp plain.
The great Saint Eloy told him,
&amp;quot;Oh my king, your Majesty
Is out of breath.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Indeed,&amp;quot; the king told him,
&amp;quot;A rabbit was running after me

The good King Dagobert
Was writing verses the wrong way.
The great Saint Eloy told him,
&amp;quot;Oh my king, let fools
Write songs.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Indeed,&amp;quot; the king told him,
&amp;quot;You will write them for me.

As soon as Dagobert died
The devil came running.
The great Saint Eloy told him,
&amp;quot;Oh my king, Satan&amp;#39;s coming soon,
You have to confess.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Alas,&amp;quot; the king told him,
&amp;quot;Couldn&amp;#39;t you die for me?&amp;quot;
