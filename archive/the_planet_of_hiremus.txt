A collection of nations actively involved in the canonized events, played out in RP, of the Planet Hiremus. 

In the First Age, nations rose to power in a bloody struggle for control and influence. The countries of that time were strong and weak both, powerful and timid, reaching for the stars and scrabbling over land borders all at once. Men sailed on stars, took to the skies and swam deeper than deep. Republics rose, and fell. Then the Others came, from beyond the void and the void itself. Gods took Hiremus as their fighting ground, broke the seas and the world. Now the lands are settling. A Second Age. A dawn of nations.
