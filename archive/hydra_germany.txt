There will come a day when the current structure of political and philosophical thought shall fail. When that happens, HYDRA will reveal itself as the thankless guardian of mankind, having guided and protected humanity throughout all its fragile, tempestuous and uncertain existence.
On that day, primitive concepts such as democracy and tyranny, anarchism and fascism, communism and capitalism, individualism and collectivism will all fade away, having been reduced to absurdity, and there will be only HYDRA.
Cut off one head; Two more shall take its place!
Hail HYDRA!
