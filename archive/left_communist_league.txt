Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of Marxist-Leninist states that proped up throughout the 20th century. Left Communists declair themselves as more Marxist and as well more socially libertarian than the more elitist communists that came to power in nations like the USSR, China, and North Korea.
