Welcome to the Year [b][color=blue]AD 2165[/b][/color].

If you would please read the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=earth-2165/detail=factbook/id=212743]Introduction of the Region and RP Scenario[/url]

Rules:
1. Your nation is based on where you live IRL.  As if [b]The Collapse[/b] were to begin very soon. (the option of beginning the nation where you were BORN is open, especially if where you LIVE is somewhere completely crowded/isolated/etc so as to better balance the Role-Play Environment.
2. You must have been invited either by Me: [nation]Earth-2165[/nation] or another Region nation (who would&amp;#39;ve been ultimately invited by me)
3. This RP is much more serious than others I&amp;#39;ve witnessed, so no Sentient Beings other than HUMANS. (That goes doubly strong against Ponies)
