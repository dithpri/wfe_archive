[color=#2fcec6][i]Welcome to the City in the Sky[/i]![/color][hr][hr][color=#278c87]I am just getting things rolling here, but the plan is to have a regional convention regarding establishing a government and continue on from there! I personally think an elected council of nations, each of which head a different aspect of the region, would be an awesome way to get everyone involved.

I am working on an off-site forum like most regions have and once we get the people, we can establish our own Discord chat server too! 

Let&#39;s see what we can do! Let&#39;s talk on our RMB and get things moving![hr]For some steps on how to get started, [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=770232]see this Dispatch[/url]![/b][/color]
