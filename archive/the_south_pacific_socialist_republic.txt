[b]In April 2013,[/b] [b][color=#BF0000]The South Pacific Socialist Republic[/color][/b] assumed direct control of The South Pacific. Under the guidance of Chairman Milograd, the People&#39;s Revolutionary Committee waged a ten day way against the oligarchs of the region in hopes of gaining their freedom from repression. Unfortunately, due to broken game mechanics, the tyrannical oligarchs were eventually able to regain control of the region despite Comrade Milograd&#39;s superior skills, and the entire worker&#39;s front was unjustly removed from their homeland.

Unbroken by this, the revolutionary vanguard lives abroad and will one day reclaim what rightfully belongs to them &#151; the people.
