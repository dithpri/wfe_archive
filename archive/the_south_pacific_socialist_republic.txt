[b][color=#bc0000][region]The South Pacific[/region][/color][/b] marches forward as we attempt to [b][color=#cfad18]free ourselves from the shackles of oppression[/color][/b] that the tyrannical oligarchy has strangled the masses with for far too long. The proletariat has been held hostage by those whom control the means of production: oligarchs who have lopsided &quot;influence&quot;. It is time for us to fight for our beliefs and reject this tool of oppression. [b][color=#bc0000]This is a protest.[/color][/b]
During our harmonious transition period, [b][color=#bc0000]everyone should endorse their revolutionaries.[/color][/b]
[hr][B]There are no endorsement restrictions, comrades.[/b] The endorsement cap is a tool of oppression that the oligarchy used to prevent the people from having an equal amount of influence, and thereby say, in relation to them.
