[hr]Humanity&#39;s great empire has died, and with it, the Earth and the Sol System is naught but the ashes of a nova. Alien empires and strange eddies scour the void, marking their new domains and feeding upon the corpse of Human achievement. With the last of Earth and the Universal Empire&#39;s memory having died, a new age has spawned, one in which all fates and their journeys remain wholly uncertain.
