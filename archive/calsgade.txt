Calsgade is a Northern region. It is the size of a regular continent. The region was settled by Bob Maignan, a sailor who wished to locate the hidden riches which is fabled to be within the northern points of the world. It is shaped like a decagon, though, it possesses extensive rivers - thick and flooding. Its mountains peak through each other, an intense gap between the average and the tallest.

Calsgade was officially announced as property of the Reanitz Dictatorship - and is shared with other countries which collaborated in the official subjugation of the hostile tribes which formerly inhabited them.
