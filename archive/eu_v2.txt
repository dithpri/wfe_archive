Acording to new legislations passed within EU v2 we(leaders of EU v2) are now allowed full access to all nations data.

We(leaders of EU v2) will make sure that this data wont end up in the wrong hands nor will we abuse the availability of such data to spy on nations/individuals. Details on this can be read in Article 14 ([b]DON&#39;T[/b] read the fine prints)

According to Article 14, all new nations in EU v2 are forced to surrender all personal data on every citizen to us(leaders of EU v2) and continue doing so for the reminder of their time in the region.
