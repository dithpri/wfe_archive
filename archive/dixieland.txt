Constitution of the Confederate States
We, the people of the Confederate States, each State acting in its sovereign and
independent character, in order to form a permanent federal government, establish
justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity--invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God--
do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America.
