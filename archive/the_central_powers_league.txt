[b] Welcome to the Central Powers League [/b]

For too long have mighty old regions ruled NationStates. Regions guarantied to survive by their numbers and advancements. Where can newcomers hide from those ominous shadows? The Central Powers League is here, our objective is to fight back those Empires that dominate our world and revoke our right to rule! We shall not fall, our walls shall rise high to defend ourselves from such giants and our weapons will be sharpened to kill such titans. A new world order is on the way, we shall bring it or die trying!
We do not discriminate for your ideology or government, we only ask you to aid us to power. We shall slay the Dragons above us and steal the sky from them!
