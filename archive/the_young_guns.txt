We are a group of talented young students that offer entertainment and background music for any circumstances. Performing a mix and fusion of Jazz, Funk and Swing tunes, as well as classics from all eras, we typically play large scale functions or small close quarters engagements, and are happy to cater to your events needs. Our fee is negotiable but we usually charge up to $200 for an hours work, and are happy to speak to you about possibilities with other engagements and are happy to tailor the &quot;Young Gun Experience&quot; to your exact needs and specifications.
