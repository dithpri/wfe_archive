On December 20th, 2020.  Dictatorships abroad were tired of being hated on and shamed for wanting power, then they had an idea!  A new region called &quot;Land of Dictatorships&quot; formed, members are forced to not have civil rights or political freedom in their country.  Additionally, the delegate has a full dictatorship in the region, no democracy exists here.
