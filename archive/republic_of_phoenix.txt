Welcome to the Republic of Phoenix! We all come together to create economic success and to have many votes in WA to get our ideas across.

Government:
President - Sonclia
Vice Presdient - TBD
WA Delegate - TBD

Senator - TBD
Senator - TBD
Senator - TBD

Council - TBD
Council - TBD
Council - TBD

First, when a vote comes up in the WA, it will go to Council to determine the vote. Then, to Senator to vote on. After that, the President, VP, and WA Delegate will vote on it. Which ever choice has the most wins in each group, will be the official choice of the PR!
