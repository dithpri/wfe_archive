[b]Currently, all nations within the cordial regions may have full regional message board access. In addition, feel free to send a telegram, embassy request or such, anytime you like! Finally, this region should not be affected by the World Assembly as it has no WA member nations nor delegates. Have a nice day! [color=yellow]&amp;#9787;[/color][/b]
