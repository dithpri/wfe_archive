[b][color=#000000]Territory of [region]The Black Fleet[/region]!!!

Captured: Nov 28 2020

This former DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST region has been captured by the mighty Fascist Marines of [region]The Black Fleet[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.[/color]

[color=E9141D][i]Socialism will not be tolerated by the moral majority of this world. We cannot allow civil and moral degeneracy to spread to impressionable youth, because they as future leaders, must be responsible and respectable members of society[/i][/color][color=#000000]

We are FASCIST and we are everywhere!
