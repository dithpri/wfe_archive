NEWS: PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON FRIDAY-SATURDAY. Sign up by Friday, 12:00pm to run. Telegram me any questions you have or if you want to run.
Goals:
~To create a functioning, democratic region
~ To have the WA delegate be just a representative of the region, beholden to the wills of it&#39;s members and Regional Legislative Assembly via RMB poll
~A constitution, official ( like in the U.S) Or unofficial (like in the U.K)
~To conduct votes through the RMB chat so that both the ordinary nations and Regional Legislative Assembly members can vote
