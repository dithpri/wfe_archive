Upon the Great Ocean rests the vast land of Continentisle. From the northwestern realms of the tri-nations, to the southeastern beaches; the midland sands, and the bordering forest... we really don&#39;t know all too much about it, to be honest. There&#39;s pretty much enough space up in the northwest, none of us have really gone much farther south. But! It is a great place, full of majesty (we&#39;re pretty sure).
