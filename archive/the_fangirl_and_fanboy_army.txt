Oh, when we were but young Fetusi,

We roamed the Great Fetus Land for centuries, until we saw others like us. Those others resided in different settlements, but still tried to help out and accommodate us permanently or temporarily at least. But The Wild Fandom-Fetusi saw differently. They saw themselves being themselves, and being creative, without much Chaos, and so this Region was born.
