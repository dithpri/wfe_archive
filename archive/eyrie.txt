The [b]Eyrie[/b] is an ancient castle and seat of House Arryn, one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility, within the Vale of Arryn. It is situated in the Mountains of the Moon astride the peak known as the Giant&#39;s Lance, several thousand feet above the valley below. Although small compared to the seats of other Great Houses in Westeros, the Eyrie is considered impregnable to attack. During winter years, the Arryns seek refuge against the cold at the base of the mountain in the Gates of the Moon.&#151;[url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eyrie][color=336666]A Wiki of Ice and Fire[/url][/color].[hr]
