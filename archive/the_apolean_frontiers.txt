Welcome, gentlemen, to The Apolean Frontiers. Astronauts, War Heroes, Olympians--you&#39;re here because we want the best, and you are it. So: Who is ready to make some nations?

If you have any questions, please ask them in the Regional Message Board at the bottom of this page. This unique region is hoped to become home to many nations. Oh and, you can turn off recruitment telegrams in your settings.

Please contact your current WA delegate [nation]Catlibia[/nation] or Recruiter in Chief [nation]Teapeneion[/nation] if you wish to support our organization. Reminder that endorsing anyone else is treason! :) This region is currently still under development, please direct any questions you may have to our organization.
