Welcome to the heart of the Midwest! Here in the Greater Illinois region it is full of amazing farm land with great hot summers and nice cold winters! If you don&amp;#39;t like looking at pretty much nothing but corn, the small-town scene is not for you, but you can make your living in the Chicago of Rockford area. Any and all people are invited!
