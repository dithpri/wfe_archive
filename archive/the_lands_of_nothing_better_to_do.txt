As the &quot;leader&quot; of New Porcupinea, I have returned after 9 months to find my nation in the same perfect state that I left it: complete chaos. I did find, however, that the more organized nations of my region had fallen out of leadership and disintegrated. This has prompted me to found and head a new region: &quot;The Lands of Nothing Better to Do.&quot;

Feel free to do whatever you wish here, but I and only I will keep the password of this region to ensure that those here are nations whose leaders are known.
