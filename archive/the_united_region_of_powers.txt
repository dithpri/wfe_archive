[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by!

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

We took this region with force and we had one lone [nation=short]Isidor C Stark[/nation] being dumped by [nation=short]magentaFairy[/nation] when she saw [nation=short]Joshannia[/nation] from [region]Albion[/region]![/b]
