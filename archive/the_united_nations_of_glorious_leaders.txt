The world calls us &quot;dictators&quot;; they denounce our rule and say we have no right to control our people like we do, but our people know different. They know that we know what is best for our people, they know that what we do, we do for them. We feed our people and we defend our people. We defend them from starvation, from wars and from dissident strife. We are the stable bedrock from which the garden of our nations can grow and thrive. United we stand strong and now we can stand strong together. Join together with The Republic of Abesa to fight against the naysayers and to help our nations thrive.
