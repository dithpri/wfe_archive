Cat world is a large open tropical region. With many many many many many (gasping.) Many many many many many many birds. there are many many other animal. The whole thing is in a giant soup bowl on a mountain. and somtimes when it only rains one side it tilts. And the cats there can talk and walk on two feet. And in the middle of cat world there&amp;#39;s a big statue of a ball of yarn. And if the soup bowl tips over molecular displacment technology is used to re-orientate it. Or it was but that technology was too expensive to operate since it uses 400 volts of electricity per machine, and there were 25 of the machines on each side. Now we use gyro technology.
