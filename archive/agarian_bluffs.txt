A land of jagged mountains and dry, endless crags; the Agarian Bluffs are a massive series of plateaus ruled by none other than Bovril de&#39;Fontaine, Grand High Commissar of Bovvalia. The land is dry and dull, but recent cultivators have begun their journey into making the land fertile and habitable. They&#39;re doing a damn fine job.

Currently, the plateaus can support a multitude of nations... but only Bovril de&#39;Fontaine himself can regulate who lives here.
