The Northern Kingdom is a collection of the hardy snow-weathered peoples who enjoy a harsher and more exciting life then in the south. Warfare is seldom used as a means to gain. It is instead used as a reason to defend the North and its allies. The North is very loyal to its people and allies. It will stand for the oppressed and the weak in times of struggle.
