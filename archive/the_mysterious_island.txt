[color=006699]Welcome, curious visitors, adventurers, seafaring nations, castaways, pirates, monsters, merpeople, stowaways... Feel free to explore the volcanic cliffs of The Mysterious Island and its surrounding waters.

The Mysterious Island is home port to the [nation]Nautilus[/nation], Captain Nemo&amp;#39;s submarine roaming the oceans, and to [nation]Oceanography[/nation].

If you seek to construct embassies with this maritime outpost, please telegram the Captain. Prepare to wait a little for a reply, as signal strength isn&amp;#39;t always reliable on a voyage under the sea.[/color]
