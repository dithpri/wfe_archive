Greater Roldaine is an alliance formed by Roldaine to protect the smaller, more innocent nations as they build their strength. 
The general of the Roldainean Army best put it as &quot;Those who threaten the leaves of the wreath shall be hung by it.&quot;

All new nations are welcome, if you are over 600 million members you are recommended to request to help by mailing Roldaine or the Sprucians.
