[b]I have been informed by the esteemed gentleman from [nation]Woryand[/nation] that I made an error in a previous tag when referring to the raiders as the &#39;Sarge-squad&#39;. The correct terminology is &#39;MinorGang&#39; and for this mistake I am terribly sorry. In penance, I promised to tag 21 more regions to spread the word and draw attention to my shame. If you have been adversely affected by Sarge-squadgate and would like to lodge a complaint, you may do so in the following [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]discord[/url], or on these [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]forums[/url]. You may also express your distaste by joining [region]The Black Hawks[/region].
