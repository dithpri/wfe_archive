The Verse is a collection of about 300 star systems situated in the Milky Way. After Earth was attacked and annihilated by a unknown alien race, the remnants of humanity fled to the stars. Some spread out throughout The Verse. Over time, a superpower arose in the region, that of the Federation of Norilova, which controls 100 star systems, with 25 other protectorate systems as well. The Federation, as most denizens of the Verse call the Federation of Norilova, has the largest navy in the Verse, along with plenty of loyal soldiers. They keep order in the Verse for the most part, but are isolationist to other powers in the galaxy, mostly out of fear that whoever destroyed Earth would do so to the Verse.
