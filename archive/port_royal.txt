Large Sign-board next to the town reads: &quot;Pirates welcome! aaaarrgg!&quot;

Governor: &quot;Hey, who made the sign? It should read that &#39;pirates will be hanged!&#39;? You all know we do not condone pirates (unless they are maybe acting as privateers) Also have more patrols around the taverns, they are getting rather loud of late. There will be order in this town.&quot;

Pirate jokes welcome.
