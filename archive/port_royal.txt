A large sign-board next to the town reads: &quot;Pirates welcome! aaaarrgg!&quot;

Governor: &quot;Hey, who made that sign? any sign like that should read &#39;pirates will be hanged!&#39;? 
You all know we do not condone pirates (unless they are maybe acting as privateers) 
Also place more patrols around the dock taverns, they are getting rather loud of late. 
There will be order in this town.&quot;
