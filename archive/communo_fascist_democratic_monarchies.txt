Hello. As it is hopefully made clear from the name, we accept any kind of ideology. Be it a fascist, a communist, or anything else, we accept you.

Discussing ideologies is okay and I encourage it. But no name-calling and such. Keep it to a discussion, not a full-blown flame war.

Keep chat discussions civilized. While occasional swearing will be allowed, try to keep it to a minimum before I need to suppress your posts.

Ok thanks bye
