[b]While we might have let the fascists take another fascist region without interference, we discovered on their [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=31690355]RMB[/url] a delightful advocacy of ethnic cleansing. A region that endorses members supporting ethnic cleansing doesn&#39;t deserve nice things, even if the raid is a personal vendetta against a white supremacist. That job can easily be done by regions that do not show hate. The fascists formerly raiding this have only [nation]Estonland[/nation] to thank for this. Next time you want to claim superiority, have a region that does not have members that openly indulge in hate speech. 

This raid brought to you by [region]The Pacific[/region]&#39;s Legio Pacifica, [region]The East Pacific[/region]&#39;s Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army, and [region]The North Pacific[/region]&#39;s North Pacific Army. [/b]
