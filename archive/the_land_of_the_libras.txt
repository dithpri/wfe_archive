&amp;quot;A balance weighs and measures; and so do Libra natives. Librans seek equality, harmony, and balance. The scales are also a symbol of justice.

Libra&amp;#39;s symbol is the only symbol in the zodiac that is inanimate (it is not represented by an animal or person).

Where is Libra in your chart? This is the area in life where  you strive for balance and equilibrium. If this part of your life seems unbalanced, you seek to change that. It is in this sphere of your life that you strive to be fair and just.

The glyph, or symbol, of Libra represents the setting sun. It also resembles an &amp;quot;equal&amp;quot; sign, though it more accurately reflects an &amp;quot;approximately equal to&amp;quot; symbol. Again, Libra&amp;#39;s drive to compare and balance is represented in its glyph.&amp;quot;
