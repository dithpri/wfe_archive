[b]The weather is starting to get cold, and [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their lovely friends from the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy went out to get some hot chocolate together. Sadly the marshmallows they got to go with it were scattered all around NS after being stolen by the evil Overgoat, and they found some of the marshmallows here and stopped by :3
