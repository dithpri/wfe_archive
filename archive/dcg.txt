Welcome to the Dragon Common Grounds also referred to as the DCG.

Fell free to talk about anything with anyone as long as it isn&#39;t discriminating or majorly offensive to anyone else.

Things here are generally laid back. We are an accepting community and if you need help feel free to ask around.

Polls are posted regularly, and if you have any suggestions to improve happiness in this region I encourage you to send a telegram to one of our Ministers and/or post on the message board with your suggestion. Constructive feedback is always welcome.

Enjoy, have fun, and remember &quot;Death is almost always fatal.&quot;
