[b]Galilee[/b] is a region in northern Israel. Traditionally refers to the mountainous part and divided into Upper Galilee. In the modern common usage, Galilee refers to all of the Israeli area that is beyond Mount Carmel to the northeast, extending from Dan to the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, along Mount Lebanon to the ridges of Mount Carmel and Mount Gilboa north of Jenin to the south, and from the Jordan Rift Valley to the east across the plains of the Jezreel Valley and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the coastal plain in the west, including Beth Shean&#39;s valley, Sea of Galilee&#39;s valley, and Hula Valley, although practically it usually does not include Haifa&#39;s immediate northern suburbs. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
