Hello! Welcome to The West European Region!

NEWS:
We recently had a raid. We&#39;ll try to get this gone soon.

RULES:
1 - No raiding.
2 - No swearing in the chat.
3 - No insulting people.
Okay, have fun!
-Oslo Republic, founder

Note: While I want this region to flourish, it can become inactive, so please don&#39;t make it die.
