Founded by [nation]Vasilires[/nation], and co-founded by [nation]The Fasselmoor Islands[/nation] [now annexed/replaced by [nation]Badakshan[/nation]], and [nation]Juphna[/nation], the Balkan Pact follows the same general idea of previous pacts along the peninsula, however, this pact does [i]not[/i] take place in the actual peninsula, rather a large collection of archipelagos and large islands forming up most of the nations known here.

This Pact is generally economic and militaristic, and isn&#39;t to form a single nation/region amongst the three.

All trade and immigration between these nations is free, no restrictions, similar to that of the modern day EU.
