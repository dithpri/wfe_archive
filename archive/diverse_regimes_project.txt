This is a personal playground in which I test various types of state and government; a pocket universe of my diverse creations. Here, sophistry reigns and no ideology extends beyond its experimental interest; here, any limited viewpoint will be heard echoed from the surrounding void, for your comfort.  

Each nation is created by me, and a select number among my many faces join regions according to my proactive judgement and real interest, rather than enticement from mass-produced promotion telegrams.
