This is a personal playground in which I test various types of state and government; a pocket universe of my diverse creations. Here, sophistry reigns and no ideology extends beyond its experimental interest; here, any limited viewpoint will be heard echoed from the surrounding void, for you comfort.  

Each nation is created by me, thus recruiters have little to do here. My many faces join regions according to my proactive judgement and real interest, rather than enticement from mass-produced promotion telegrams.
