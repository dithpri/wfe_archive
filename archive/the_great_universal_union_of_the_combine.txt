The Great Universal Union, which simpler, less advanced minds call &quot;the Combine&quot;, stands as the pinnacle of intergalactic administration and prosperity, a testament to the unyielding will and benevolent foresight of its benefactors. The Union is comprised of countless controlled colonies and annexed worlds, all of which are bound by the common goal of advancing the Combine&#39;s grand vision for the cosmos. Its governance is a perfected, well-organised autocracy, which has eliminated the inefficiencies of democracy to ensure that progress is swift, righteous, and without dissent.
