Noricum is a diverse, infant region. The founder of Noricum doesn&amp;#39;t have total sway over it, the people who are in it do. If it weren&amp;#39;t for them, Noricum would fail, so they deserve a very large say in what the region is like. It looks forward to growth and the road to the NationState world stage. A map is included and the developer tries to keep it up to date as possible.
