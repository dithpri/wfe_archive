This region was created as a memorial for the victims of Anti-White Genocide perpetrated by the liberals and others in countries such as South Africa and Zambia. Communists and other left-wingers are not welcome here and will be ejected on sight.

Residents can feel free to elect a delegate but attempted invasions will be crushed and the invaders will be ejected and banned.
