[b]ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT[/b]

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; French: Organisation de coop&eacute;ration et de d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomiques, OCDE) is an intergovernmental economic organisation with 35 member countries, founded in 1960 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It is a forum of countries describing themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy, providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seeking answers to common problems, identify good practices and coordinate domestic and international policies of its members. Most OECD members are high-income economies with a very high Human Development Index (HDI) and are regarded as developed countries.
