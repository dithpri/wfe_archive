Here in the [b]OECD[/b] we try to foster a environment in which member nations can prosper on a economic and social level. Here we do not judge how a nation is politically run or if it is a capitalist or communist country. The only thing that truly matters here is HDI and to a smaller extent civil rights.

The [b]OECD[/b] is also democratic alliance and the opinions on all matters here are decided by the member countries.
