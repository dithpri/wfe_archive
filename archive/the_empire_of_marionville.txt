we are a advanced nation of a mixture of powerful rulers, presidents, and empires. which gladly take our militarism with pride and glory. we will stand strong if provoked. and if people dont agree most of our nations members will stick happily with our guns. but like i said we are a mixed nation so do not be surprised you might actually find some friendly faces in our nation.
