Oh no! [region]the South Pacific[/region], you lost your password? Good thing I was here to refound the region and add it to my empire. This here is what you get for trying to condemn me, we don&#39;t take kindly to that around these parts. I actually am sorry about you guys losing your RP and stuff that was in here, but business is business, so this region is now mine.
