Gravity&#39;s Rainbow enjoys taking in new and veteran nations of all political leanings. Dictatorship? Come barge right in! Socialist paradise? We&#39;ll share the region and its resources with you!

The existing nations believe they can influence those recently joined to adopt many civil rights, some political freedoms, and socialist economics. These existing nations believe they accomplish this by being well respected, though it seems their mission is accomplished through conquest and under the table trade agreements. 

In short, if you have a nation with much more than meets the eye, Gravity&#39;s Rainbow is the region for you.
