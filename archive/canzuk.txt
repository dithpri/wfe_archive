CANZUK is an acronym for a cultural, diplomatic and economic community comprising Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom as part of an international organisation or confederation similar in scope to the former European Economic Community. This includes increased trade, foreign policy co-operation, military co-operation and mobility of citizens between the four states with an imperial parliament headquartered in London. The new parliament would deal with internal trade, foreign relations, defense and other issues that affected the entire federation.
