[b]The Royal Bard wrote a song for this day:[/b]
&amp;quot;On the great holiday of Thanksgiving, 2013,
our Monarch returned from Vacation Mode.
Black Friday, to conquer, the Land Manatees Paradise
for the Kingdom of Dark Point and the region of [b][region]Pantheon[/region][/b].
Glory to this day! O Pantheon, rejoice!&amp;quot;

[b]The Monarch of [nation]Dark Point[/nation] hereby proclaims:
&amp;quot;In commemoration of this great day, my subjects shall eat Land Manatees, not Turkeys, for Thanksgivings in Dark Point.&amp;quot;[/b]
