[b]With tensions soaring high in other directions, and political discourse sometimes providing heated exchange, the Naval forces from The [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy decided to leave our home borders for the evening, and dock at the long lost [region]South Europeia[/region]. Just like our homeland of [region]Europeia[/region], we filled our time with wonderful work, delirious discussion, and most of all, we continued with building [i]a civilised democracy[/i].

If you&#39;d like to join our sailors in their evening dalliances, we&#39;d love to share a drink or two by your side.
