The Andromeda region was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Sector in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, a man in a wheelchair named, Andromeda. The people who founded this land said it was destined for great civilizations to spread across it. They wanted a land of prosperity and kindness, what they got was truly unexpected. Now all across the lands large corporations, organized crime syndicates, and militaristic factions reign supreme. People who suffer from disabilities are excommunicated and forced to roam the lands. They move in hordes, often referred to as Speds. This land was meant for wondrous destinies and now all it is a land of forlorn hope.
