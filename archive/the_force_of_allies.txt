The History of the Allies

Many years ago, a group of countries, each run by a fierce dictatorship, decided to join together to revolt. Thus the Allied troops formed together and overthrew their oppression and were allowed to form a new nation. However, with each country unable to stand on its own due to war damages, it was quickly realized that the alliance must continue until proper funds can be raised to fix the city. Today, The Force of Allies still stands, working together should they ever be attacked again.
