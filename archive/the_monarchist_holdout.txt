Welcome to the Monarchist Holdout. We are not a place for democracies with kings and queens as social figures, we are a region for countries and states that center around an individual and their family to some extent. If you vote in the WA against a decision made by the Monarchist Holdout, you will be banned. The criteria for being in the Monarchist Holdout are:

*You must not be a single or Multi-Party Democracy

*You must not support non-monarchist movements

*You must not be an anarchy

Any and all nations who fail to meet this criteria will be banned, regardless if whether or not you joined that way or not. Your country will be reviewed on occasion as determined by the King, and when you apply for the position of Officer.
