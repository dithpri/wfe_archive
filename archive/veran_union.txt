Vera is a small continent home to a host of diverse nations, may of whom are rivals with a long history of violence and conflict. In an attempt to stem this violence many have joined together to found the Veran Union. A nominally neutral and independent organization meant to represent the region as a whole, the VU is heavily influenced by the largest and most populous nation in its jurisdiction, Tyra Vera.
