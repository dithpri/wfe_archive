The Haleo Region consists of a variety of differing types of countries based on their government, economy, law enforcement &amp; defense, social services and their health. These are just some of the many subjects of differences that these nations within Haleo share. A collective gathering joined by the bright yellow star, the region provides such stability through a protection plan called the Haleo Authority Defence Pact (HADP) which calls for the armament of every country to aid another member state of Haleo in the case of a foreign attack.
