Way out in the ocean, far from any civilized land, lies a dilapidated harbor on a relatively empty island. The inhabitant of this establishment is an old sailor, known only as [nation=short+noflag]the old harbor master[/nation]. Many navies have come to claim this harbor and use it for their operations. The quiet old sailor has not resisted. But, for now, all have left once the harbor&#39;s usefulness had passed.
