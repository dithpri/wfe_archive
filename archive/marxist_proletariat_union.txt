[I]Liberated: 11.05.18[/I]

[color=red]Former participants of the [region]Regional Defense Committee[/region] and [region]Antifa[/region] in 2012.

Liberated from Nazi [region]KAISERREICH[/region] by the mighty Anti-Nazi/Fascist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region], it shall be protected as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

It&#146;s liberation serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]
