One Korea believes in mutual prosperity of all nations involved, despite any political, economic, or social differences.

Although originally founded as a physical unification of the Korean Peninsula, the two nations have become far too different from one another, and both excel as sovereign nations. One Korea aims to change the approach from a physical unification of governments to one of trade, brilliant minded people, and mutual prosperity.

One Korea is not just for the Korean people, but in the broader sense for any nation willing to accept political differences and encourage mutual growth.
