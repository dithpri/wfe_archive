Pull up a chair and drop that landmass into place, friend.[color=purple]Afrikyuresia[/color] might well be the place for you. There is no regional government - no supranational union you have to work to please; no international law you are forced to abide by; only roleplaying and chumminess. Or possibly fear and panic at the possibility of being forcibly annexed and having your vital regions conquered.

[color=purple]Afrikyuresia[/color] is a region based upon the geography of Afro-Eurasia. Here, you can roleplay, make new friends, chat about, offend several political factions at once, or maybe just make fart jokes at passersby.

Always remember one thing though: [color=red]never fight a land war in Asia.[/color]
