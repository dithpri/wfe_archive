Welcome to The Haags, a cross-national alliance of Haag nations. We are a broad coalition of different socialist-aligning nations.

[b][u]Membership Criteria[/u][/b]
Haag nations require insignia of being such. If your nation can do it, you can use a form of [i]Haag[/i] in your title which is sufficient as designation.
Once that is done, send a Telegram to either [nation]Vimansk Land[/nation] or [nation]Haag[/nation].
If your nation is not able to use a title, you are still free to apply for membership to join without Haag title, however as second class citizen until you are able to do so.

[b][u]WA Policy[/u][/b]
As we&#39;re a password protected region with a Governor, there are no obligations towards the WA.
