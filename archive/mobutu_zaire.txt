Zaire, officially the Republic of Zaire (R&eacute;publique du Za&iuml;re), was the name of the state that is now called Democratic Republic of the Congo as it existed between 27 October 1971 and 17 May 1997. Founded by Mobutu Sese Seko, the name of Zaire derives from the Portuguese word &amp;quot;zaire&amp;quot;, itself an adaptation of the Kongo word nzere or nzadi (&amp;quot;river that swallows all rivers&amp;quot;).
