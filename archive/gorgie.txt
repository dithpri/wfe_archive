This is Gorgie, a group of islands in the Northern Hemisphere just south of the Arctic Circle. A map will be produced in due course. Welcome :)

Whilst the nations of Gorgie will not be playing an active role in the international community for the foreseeable future, due to a need to focus on internal development, in the future we will be more than happy to interact with other regions and have a louder voice in international politics.

Open for Embassy requests.
