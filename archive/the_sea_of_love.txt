[color=green][b]Welcome![/b]  We in The Sea Of Love embrace all that is fabulous and intoxicating... well, not [i]all[/i] that&amp;#39;s intoxicating, but quite a bit of it anyway.  Come on in, and stay as long as you like![/color]

[color=red][b]Please note:[/b] We welcome WA members to our region with open arms, but we frown upon endorsement collecting.  If a nation happens to be unfortunate enough to obtain WA Delegate status here, it will be promptly ejected.  All WA member nations residing in this region are considered duly and fairly advised of this policy by virtue of their very presence here.[/color]

[color=purple][b]Raiders/invaders will be smacked and banned.[/b][/color]

Long may The Sea Of Love continue to be [b][i][color=red]F[/color][color=darkorange]A[/color][color=gold]B[/color][color=green]U[/color][color=blue]L[/color][color=purple]O[/color][color=violet]U[/color][color=magenta]S[/color][/i]![/b]
