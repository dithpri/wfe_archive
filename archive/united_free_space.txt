After what happen in the past we are here for the future!

Note:I&#39;m sending TG to the last resident/native active and ask if he wants to become a officer. If in 24 hours i don&#39;t get a reply i will assume he don&#39;t have more interest in the region. As such, since there is no founder and the risk exist for this region to become a raider&#39;s jump point, i will put the region to rest and will close it down, thus removing a potential treat to all other active regions in NS that are at risk of being raided in some way or form!
