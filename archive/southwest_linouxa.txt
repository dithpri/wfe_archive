[b]This region, of the greater area of Southwestern Linouxa, is a test for the superior region of [region]The Avniitaraan Commonwealth[/region].

It is to test things such as growing the region, managing it, etc. Afterwards, when it feels as though I, [nation]Versylle[/nation] [Namsirie is a puppet, repurposed for this test], know what I&#39;m doing and have decent knowledge on management, I&#39;ll request that all nations move to the Commonwealth, mentioned above.

Until then, I am glad that you have decided to help this test, and I hope that you stay for when the test is over to move to [region]The Avniitaraan Commonwealth[/region], if it gets decided that the test is successful![/b]
