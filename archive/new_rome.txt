Welcome to New Rome, the original name of Constantinople. New Rome is traditionally reported to be the name given by emperor Constantine the Great to the new imperial capital he founded in 330 at the city on the European coast of the Bosporus strait, known as Byzantium until then and as Constantinople from that time to its official renaming as Istanbul in 1928.
