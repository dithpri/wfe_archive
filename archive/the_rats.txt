[i]They locked me in a room...[/i]

Home of [nation]Volikara[/nation]&#39;s old r/d puppets (and other puppets I don&#39;t want to farm), and an embassy hub for regions I have taken over. Refounds can be found down the left hallway, over at [region]The Crazy[/region]

Main puppet storage can be found at [region]The Rubber Room[/region]
