Welcome to [b]The Coalition of few[/b].

We are a secluded region of the world. We get our strength from knowing eachother, and sharing our knowledge. Therefore outsiders may not move to our region without permission, as they would weaken our social integrity.

[b]The Coalition of few[/b] was founded by the kingdom of Nuovo Mundo to be able to continue our existence in the midst of numerous giant regions pushing our borders, waiting for it to collapse under the pressure of endless amounds of invitational telegrams.

And now, I proudly present our mascot [url=http://nervous.nl/images/woudstra.png]&amp;#39;Woudstra de decoupeerzaag&amp;#39;[/url], with thanks to our most serious partner Henk.
