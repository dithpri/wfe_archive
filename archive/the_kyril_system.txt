Located in the Andromeda Galaxy, the Kyril System consists of 5 planets. Balder, a gas giant, with the moons Forsetti and Tyr trapped in it&amp;#39;s orbit. Xeria, a lush green alien planet, home of the Wixilan. The burning planet of Acies orbits closely to the sun, Kyril, with temperatures ranging from -10 degrees to over 150 degrees. The ocean planet of Una consists of 92% water, the other 8% made of grassy islands dotting the planet. Orithya orbits elliptically around Kyril, it&amp;#39;s composed of mostly slate and ice, making it very cold.
