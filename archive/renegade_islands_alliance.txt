[b]Nations of the Region: [/b]

I am Stick, the surviving member of the [nation=short]OSK Syndicate[/nation]. I am from the nation [nation=short]Saint Kitten[/nation]. I have been successful in our mission.

[b][i]Your region is now without a government.[/i][/b]

I have destroyed the Constitution of the RIA. There are no laws that tell you how you [i]*static*[/i] for the time has [i]*static**[b]Hello?[/b]**[/i] and forever. [i]Override the frequen-*static*-ing higher. Good. We got Stick![/i]

[b]The Constitution is GONE![/b]

The constitution has been stolen. A Constitutional Convention has already been formed, and a replacement constitution will be presented to the region! We will restore order in the RIA! This is a great opportunity to make changes that will include more members. [i][B]Join the forum to get ready for the discussion![/B][/i]
