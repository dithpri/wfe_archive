The Alaska Federation is home to many different nations, but notably the sister nations of the Armed Republics of North and West Anchorage, which control the region, with the entire Eastern half of the region taken up by Eastern Soviet Alaska, which surrounds most of the nations. The Northwest corridor is taken up by the country of Northwestern Alaska, and the small Koyuk Bay area in the west is one of the farthest points to the west in the area.
