Halo hereby thanks [nation]The Legion of War[/nation] for his/her quick thinking on Z-Day 2013, and their effort to stymie the zombie scourge which threatened our region.

By the power vested in me, [nation]Skillcrossbones[/nation], [i](your on-again, off-again delegate)[/i] I bestow an imaginary medal upon his/her chest, which will remain for all time.
