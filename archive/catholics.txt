[b]Catholics[/b] is a community of Christians loyal to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. We hold traditional Catholic beliefs, including in the Trinity and the Immaculate Conception. With the Holy Spirit at our side, we are devoted to the Catholic faith.

We also hold sacred the tenet of free will and free speech, as without these, no true salvation is attainable: [i]&quot;For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&#39;s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&quot;[/i]

We ask only that dialogue remains civil and respectful.
