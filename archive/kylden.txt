[b]Kylden is a militaristic socialist region that opposes all forms of foreign authoritarianism that not in line with The Founder. The region is ethnically nationalistic and self-sufficient, adhering to anti-authoritarian doctrines that will not tolerate subversionists who disrupt Kyldellian society. In Kylden&#39;s universe, violence serves as the supreme authority, and Kyldellians will not tolerate despair in the name of the Kyldellian society, The Founder, and its freedom.[/b]
