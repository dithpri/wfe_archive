One of the largest archipelago seas in the Shattered Sea was formed by glacial retreat, emerging after the last ice age. There are more than 50,000 islands in the Shattered Sea, although many of them do not measure half a hectare (one acre). Some of the islands are close enough to be connected by bridges.

Islands of the Shattered Sea were never coastal mountaintops, however. They were formed by post-glacial rebound. In this process, land that was squashed by the weight of heavy glaciers during the Ice Age slowly regains its shape, like a sponge. Because post-glacial rebound is still occurring, islands continue to rise from the Shattered Sea.
