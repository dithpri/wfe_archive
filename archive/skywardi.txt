Hey raiders! Delegate only has WA power, you can&#39;t do anything else.
We welcome all nations.
We accept most embassies, those who are denied or aborted or closed off, leave us the fork alone! If you do get an embassy, check out the dispatch pinned to the region and read it. Share it with your leaders, please.
Please stay safe during the ongoing pandemic!
Oh, endorse our delegate [nation]Skywardi[/nation]! This is a requirement for all WA nations.
