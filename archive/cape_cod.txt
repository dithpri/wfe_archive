[b]Cape Cod[/b] is a geographic cape extending into the Atlantic Ocean from the southeastern corner of mainland Massachusetts, in the northeastern United States. Its historic, maritime character and ample beaches attract heavy tourism during the summer months.

Like Cape Cod itself, the islands south of the Cape have evolved from whaling and trading areas to become resort destinations, attracting wealthy families, celebrities, and other tourists. These include the large nearby islands of [region]Nantucket[/region] and Martha&#39;s Vineyard. Both islands are also famous summer tourist destinations, commonly accessed by ferry from several locations on the cape. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
