The Nations of Cheesepuffs is a community in which everybody can join. We are a relatively new region and we have only been here for a few days. This region does not attack other people, but nevertheless maintains a strong military for defense. The region will have no forum and is meant for people who are gaming casually. Also, we welcome role-playing and debates about real-life. We also want everybody to be friendly to everybody else. This community does not have any other rules and should be very diverse.
