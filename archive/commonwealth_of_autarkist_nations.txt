For those who dislike the idea of a &quot;world community&quot; and &quot;helping outsiders&quot; or those that want to help foreigners but like to be self reliant, the Commonwealth is considered a prime candidate. In the commonwealth, nations avoid most outside interactions and interactions inside the Commonwealth are kept to a minimum. You may do what you wish inside, but it must be done in your own land. Helping others inside is recommended, but purely optional. The WA and its Delegates have been relegated to a voting force only, and the SSAP has exclusive authority to uphold the peace and quiet. All countries are permitted to enter as long as they are self reliant.
