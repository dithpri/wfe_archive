Mayhem has arrived on The Island of Charleston as Great Charleston and South Great Charleston rage war on Surviville and Glastopia, ultimately vringing the other two nations, Greater Charles and Storadge into the fight. On the first day of war on the island, it has left the allied forces Great Charleston, South Great Charleston and Greater Charles clinging onto their military and money. South Great Charleston announces that tomorrow will be bringing larger wars from them and Great Charleston, while Greater Charles tries their best not to be involved.
