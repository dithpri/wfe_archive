An personal use region - anything from issues playing, trading cards, puppet storage, embassy collecting, interregional interaction, roleplaying, and more - all with a Sonic the Hedgehog theme.

The tags are basically just stuffing for visibility and don&#39;t reflect anything in terms of views or gameplay, so any nations and embassies feel free to come, chat, and ask questions! It&#39;s cool here.
