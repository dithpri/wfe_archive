A new world is possible. The age of exploitation, where wealth and power are hoarded by the few, must come to an end. No longer shall the fruits of labour be stolen by capital, nor shall governance be reserved for a privileged elite. We, the people, declare our commitment to a system that ensures economic justice, individual liberty, and a corruption-free government.
