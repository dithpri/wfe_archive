The Lunar Neighborhood is a region located in the Tycho crater on the Moon. It was set up by a small group of sheep herders in the United States who took the government&amp;#39;s opportunity to colonize the Moon. They then encouraged their neighbors to do the same and founded the Lunar Neighborhood using a Confederate flag. They use this flag to symbolize rights and independence. If you would like to join, you should just send a telegram. If you join, you should, but don&amp;#39;t have to have a lunar based nation. If not, you could be ground communication, mission control, etc.
