Welcome to the United Region of Democratic Socialists (URDS, or UR for short). The goal of this region is to provide countries ruled by Democratic Socialism to come together as one. There is no confusion or mistreatment of others here. The only requirement to join is to be ruled by a Democratic Socialist government.
