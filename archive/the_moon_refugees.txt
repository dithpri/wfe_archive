Welcome to The Moon Refugees, founded by [region]The Moon[/region] escapees who want something more than cheese jokes (although still necessary) and 10-day embassy proposals. If you&#39;re tired of talking to yourself in zero-gravity silence, this is your new launchpad.

No strict government, no WA drama, just regional projects, meme-lore, maybe even a Moon civil war if you&#146;re into that. Roleplay? Sure. Factbooks? You bet. Meme flags? Mandatory.
