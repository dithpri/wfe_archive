Everytime I think on the actual situation of the World, I ask to me, why all of this happened? why that much people are that agressive, like the [region]Mau puppet storage[/region] that recently raided us. This World is falling into a great depression, and the people is oppressed and out of control, but we can change it, we can fight for our goals and fulfill them, and we must do it together, like one nation, like one united world, ruled in excellence and fairdom.
In this faction the freedom is real, the justice is real, and all of this is regulated by fair and clever people so the corruption can&#39;t exist.
People, join us to join the region that will change our world and make it grow with us.
People, in name of the progress, we must keep together!
