[b]That&#39;s right! This region has been struck down once more by your feather friends of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] for having suspicious Bunny activity!

The battle against the Bunny persists! This time we had to find enough carrot to feed the increasing number of bunny prisoners we have. And to also power our new anti-bunny ray gun!!

With enough carrot, we shall finally be able to erase all bunnies from the world! Do not worry, the bunnies are still safe, we have them all under training at our Nest. If you want to look at the bunnies, head now to our  [url=https://discord.gg/XYGgUtxm]Discord server[/url] and pet them.
