This region, that was meant to serve as a continuation of the despicable darkspawn legacy of The Black Riders and DEN, has thankfully ceased to be. This community did not last very long before being absorbed into HYDRA Command, but it served as a firm reminder that many darkspawn were more than willing to return to their loathsome existence as rules violators and harassers. The Grey Wardens are committed to wiping these blight bringers from our world and all darkspawn should fear our wrath.[/b]
