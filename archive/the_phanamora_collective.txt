The guiding principles of governance in Phanamora are inclusivity and compassion.

The majority of governance in TRAPPIST-1 is decentralised, in order to flexibly accommodate the needs of different localities and population groups. However, the legislation of devolved territories must be additive with respect to the principles established by the  Executive Conclave; that is, any legislation must have as its goal the effective administration of Collective principles within the local territory.
