The Terran Empire is a collection of nations that have agreed to dominate and enslave the world. They all work together under the watchful eye of the Dominus of One to achieve this goal.
Dictatorships preferred, there is no need to be a &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; nation to partake in global domination, all one needs to do is join up! 


(Star Trek fans: yes, THAT Terran empire!)
