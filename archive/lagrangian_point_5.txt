Also known as L5. One of five positions in an orbital configuration between the Earth and the Moon where space colonies are affected only by gravity and can be part of a constant-shape pattern. The Lagrange point marks a position where the combined gravitational pull of the two larger masses provides precisely the centripetal force required for space colonies to orbit with them. Colonies built at L5 tend to have minimum interaction with other nations not affiliated with the Commonwealth.
After all: Sit amet terrae, terrae sit amet. Let the problems of Earth, be Earth&amp;#39;s problem.
