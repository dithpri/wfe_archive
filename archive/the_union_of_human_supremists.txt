All men are created equal, but all men are superior to everything else.

This is how the world should be, yet sadly, Hippies do not allow this, they spread their ideals of &amp;#39;equality for all&amp;#39;, to dimwitted masses, and force Humanity to live amongst inferior beings, which have so foolishly been labelled our &amp;#39;equals&amp;#39;.

This is a primitive belief, and progress will tear it down and rip it to shreds, so that Humanity may ascend to the top of the scrap pile, where we shall erect a statue of our glorious victory for all to see, this is the future, and we must embrace it.
