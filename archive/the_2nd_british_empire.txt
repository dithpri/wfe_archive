Once the largest Empire in history, The British Empire rose and fell. For better and for worse like all great powers it created great wonders and large scale consequences that are still felt today in 2016. It was my desire to re create a historically accurate version of her here in N.S. Hopefully as a Historian such as my self it would be a great side project victory for us to take part in this adventure for (hopefully) years to come. Join us my friend!
