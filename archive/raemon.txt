LessWrong team member / moderator. I&#39;ve been a LessWrong organizer since 2011, with roughly equal focus on the cultural, practical and intellectual aspects of the community. My first project was creating the Secular Solstice and helping groups across the world run their own version of it. More recently I&#39;ve been interested in improving my own epistemic standards and helping others to do so as well.
