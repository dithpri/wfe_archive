Once upon a time, there was a region called [region]Maxwell Cat Land[region]. Many of you might remember a nation called [nation]Pugeullaendeu[nation], especially if you were frequently on the chats of Europeia; six months ago. A small popup state called Larcin emerged, and a brutal civil war started. Larcin had won, engulfed all of Pugeullaendeu, and soon had most of the land on the island. Dobharchu, a small, very [not] known country (also you might recognize that name from the Europeia chats 6 months ago) came and received the rest of the land. And they are making space for you! Join the Larcin-Dobharchu Empire today!!!
