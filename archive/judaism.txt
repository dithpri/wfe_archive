[i]He has shown you, O mortal, what is good.
    And what does the Lord require of you?
To act justly and to love mercy
    and to walk humbly with your God.
- Micah 6.8[/i]

On behalf of the Jewish people and everyone in the world who holds the principles of justice dear, the Jewish Justice League thanks you, [nation]BlackGreenWhite[/nation] for this great service. Shalom.

What was once a monument to hate is now a beacon of hope to the world.
