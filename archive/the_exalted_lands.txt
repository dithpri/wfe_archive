The Exalted Lands were founded as the successor region to The New Inquisition. Our focus will be:

1) An in depth roleplay system.
2) Diplomatic neutrality (we will not endorse defenders nor raiders, and the region as a whole will not be driven by a political ideology so that individual nations are free to cultivate their own).
3) An active Government with authority that isn&#39;t limited by an inactive founder which will determine WA positions.

Please be sure to endorse whomever is the WA delegate. More endorsements means more influence in the WA.

Our initial government will be a &quot;Limited Monarchy&quot; until we have a large enough membership to form a more democratic system.
