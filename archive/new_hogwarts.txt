Small region for a group of friends. We run things the way we want. Who needs ulkagurk.


History runs deep in NH. The struggle between Talzmania and Benenatistan have baptized the region in blood and fire. Pavlovistan excels at science and space exploration while Marcelitani wins the annual futball tournament on a regular basis. The people of Stephtopia Islands feel a special bond with the citizens of Benenatistan, and Shansylvania was built deep on the principles of hoping people leave them alone. The Typolis Islands are known for their constant laziness, and Valteria has very progressive civil rights. 

For some reason, the geography of the region is always changing.
