The Imperial Federation was a supranational political union established in 1948, uniting the dominions, colonies, and territories of the British Empire into a single federal state. Formed in the aftermath of the Second World War, it was conceived as a strategic and political response to the decline of European colonial empires, the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union, and the need for postwar reconstruction and unity among English-speaking nations.
