&quot;The assembly will be voted by general consensus in three-monthly elections using FPTP, staggered so no overlap will occur with the Cabinet elections. Any regional member can enter the race, and the top 7 will be elected to the Assembly, with the most popular candidate becoming the Leader of the House, and the other 6 becoming MPs. These elected officials will send a secondary nation to the assembly region.
The roles of the Assembly are:
-To debate legislation provided by the Cabinet.
-To approve new Cabinets.
-To provide a check on the Cabinet&#146;s power, including the ability to call no-confidence votes on cabinets if a 2/3 majority is achieved.
-To edit, create and vote on legislation.
