The West Pole Department of International cooperation or WPDIC for short is a branch of the [region]The West Pole[/region] dedicated to establishing or maintaining relations with regions.

All embassy requests are excepted
We welcome all types of players. However if you want a more active/functioning region I recommend our parent region [region]The West Pole[/region]

This region is still in construction and while all help is appreciated I would recommend going to [region]The West Pole[/region].
