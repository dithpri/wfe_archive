Welcome to The Intergalactic Corporate Paradise, where many peaceful nations reside. The region&amp;#39;s friendly nations are welcome to all, but are always minding their own businesses and not interfering in others&amp;#39; affairs. The region is run by a capitalist democracy called The Executive Board. The region is set in an alternate world where every nation is either a planet, star system, or multiple star systems. The regional capital is the star system of GovCentral.
