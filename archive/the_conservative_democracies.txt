Hi my name is Leo and I founded The Conservative Democracies. Here we believe in right-wing conservatism and capitalism but anyone is welcome to join us (even puppet nations). We are active on the World Assembly and feel free to endorse who you see fit in our region.

Please contact [nation]Silver-Tree[/nation] for tips on cards.

All embassies welcome :)

We stand firmly against raiders.

Join now if you want to!
