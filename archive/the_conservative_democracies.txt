Hi my name is Leo and I founded The Conservative Democracies on the 30th November 2019. Here we believe in non-extremist, right-wing conservatism and capitalism but anyone is welcome to join us (even puppet nations). We are active on the World Assembly and feel free to endorse who you see fit in our region. Also, please consider proposing an embassy with us to join the many doing so already!

Please contact [nation]Silver-Tree[/nation] for tips on cards.

NOTICE: While [nation]The Crossland[/nation] may be active sometimes and will never be sent to the boneyard, I have other priorities in the real world to attend to. Please feel free to post a message on the region board instead if you have any queries as my telegram inbox gets full quickly.

Leo, [nation]The Crossland[/nation]
