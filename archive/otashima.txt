[b]Otashima[/b], the great realm of a thousand islands.

The world of Otashima is similar to ours, and yet different as well. Home to a vast array of cultures, political systems and ways of thinking, Otashima follows an alternate history where East Asian nations attained global dominance after closely beating their European counterparts in the race to industrialisation at the turn of the 19th century.
