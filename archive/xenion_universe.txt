Xenion Universe is small artifical universe, created by [nation]Xeelee[/nation] race as refugium from their eternal fight with Photino Birds.
Hovever, most of [nation]Xeelee[/nation] soon continued elsewhere, while leaving only small colony as their backward guard post.

This universe is connected to multiple other universes via Xenion Rifts, both space and planet-bound versions.
Multiple other races were invited to come through, and some even established their colonies in Xenion Universe
