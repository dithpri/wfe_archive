[b][color=navy]Eid Mubarak! Those who have been observing Ramadan are welcome to season their food with the tears of the fascists that have been trampled underfoot here. This sorry excuse for a region has been [i]cleansed[/i] by the antifa supersoldiers of [region]The Order of the Grey Wardens[/region]. All people are created equal and have unique and beautiful contributions to make to our world, except for you lot, you can buzz off.[/b]

[i]Blessed are they who stand before
The corrupt and the wicked and do not falter.
Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just.
