[B]Final Statement - Office of the Lord Chancellor[/B]

I have had my 24 hours of entertainment.

Good riddance to this region.

Bowing out gracefully,

[nation]Picts[/nation]

Remember my rise from nothing to the highest office(s) of the region on two separate occasions in less than 2 years.

I will be painted as a monster, but, no one can doubt my talents when my my heart is in the cause.
