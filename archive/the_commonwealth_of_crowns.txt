To all members, and allies.

Our WFE will be down until a decision is made regarding the future of our region. I assure you that I am working with all members of the government, and will be taking all of your opinions into heavy consideration. So please, feel free tp contact me or give your opinion in the forum about what should be done regarding Picts/Sudweca&amp;#39;s warnings of further attacks against us. We will be taking his warnings seriously, and will also be taking your opinions seriously. Stay safe, stay observant, and immediately report ANY and ALL suspicious activity to any of the Cabinet members, even to the judges of the Court if necessary, so that I may take appropriate action. Thank you, and have a nice day.
