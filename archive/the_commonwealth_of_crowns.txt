Originally founded on 20th Nov 2010, the Commonwealth of Crowns has long-stood a bastion upholding the ideals of monarchism across NationStates. Now, the region strives to provide a truly unique, fully interactive community with a range of experiences on offer. With our own map, system of government and vibrant community of nations, why not join today?

Even if you are not a monarchy, do join us and we are sure you will be one once you are amongst us !
