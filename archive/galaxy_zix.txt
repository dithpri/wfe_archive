A relatively young galaxy, in which the majority of stars are short-lived blue stars in a chaotic mess of stars being born and dying. Most civilizations starting here usually are destroyed by their star&amp;#39;s death or from close-by supernova in their immediate stellar neighborhood before they can achieve FTL, but some find ways to live in this chaotic galaxy they call home.
