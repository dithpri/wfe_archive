[color=purple]Welcome to the great region of the [/color] [color=blue]Antarctic Federation[/color]
Slightly less terrible than Saint Paul Minnesota, and home of the [b]Antarctic Order*[/b]

Everyone is welcome, except assholes(the only exception to this is Masostan). That&#39;s the only rule we really have, though let&#39;s face it, we will [i]probably[/i] screw you over if you do somthing we dislike. The main thing we don&#39;t like is annoying people(again, excluding Masostan). Other than that, just have fun, chill, and  maybe blow stuff up.


*We aren&#39;t 100% sure what the [b]Antarctic Order[/b] is yet, or why it&#39;s in bold, but we will figure it out eventually
