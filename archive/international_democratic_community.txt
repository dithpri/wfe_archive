Welcome to the region,
[b][region]International Democratic Community[/region][/b]
or [b]IDC[/b] for short. [hr][i][b]What is IDC?[/b][/i]
[i]&quot;We are a [b]Community[/b] of [b]Democratic[/b] Nations that are [b]International[/b]. What else did you expect?&quot;[/i]
We here at [b]IDC[/b] are a cozy, democratic bunch that formed from the ashes of two dying regions.  Sort of like if two dying stars merged together to form one that is still going. Let&#39;s just hope it lasts. Anyways, you might want to read the Charter before you do anything else.

[b][i]What is this &quot;Charter&quot; you just mentioned?[/b][/i]
I&#39;m glad you asked!  The Charter is the founding document of [b]IDC[/b] and essentially the constitution of the region. [i]Check it out:[/i] [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jQxq57O0kLNn6tH-mNFemNVzp0mJx24yZNqDp6QGXwM][b]IDC Charter[/b][/url]
