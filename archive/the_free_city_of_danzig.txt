This region was created by [region]the Greater German Reich[/region] as one of its [i]Reichsgaue[/i] (administrative divisions of annexed territory). It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascist[/b] forces.

Now Danzig is free again.
