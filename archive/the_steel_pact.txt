The Steel Pact (formally, the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation, and Mutual Assistance) is a collective defense,economic and political treaty. The Steel Pact was the military complement to the Ctalnhian government, the leading and now defunct galactic state. The Steel Pact was in part a collection of far left sympathizing planets but was primarily motivated by the desire to maintain control and law &amp; order on said planets with the huge military potential of the Ctalnhian army.

The Steel Pact&#39;s largest military engagements were aimed against other planets to establish puppet governments or completely assimilate said planets into governments of either the Ctalnhian central government or local sympathizing governments.
