The Phoenix
At the end of its life the Phoenix will build itself in nest that will then ignite; both nest and bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, reborn from the ashes a new Phoenix will arise. The Phoenix is destined to live forever and regenerate when hurt or wounded by a foe, thus being immortal and invincible - a symbol of fire, divinity, and rebirth. WE WILL ARISE! All hurts will heal, all struggles will be won, all problems resolved, and all heartache will be soothed away by the burning flame. To be born again from the ashes!

We are looking for a RP manager, a defender to start a defense force, and an ambassador to build inter-regional relations.
