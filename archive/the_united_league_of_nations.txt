My good friend [nation]Cardoness[/nation] has agreed to provide some leadership, at least until we get going. Everyone is requested to endorse them until the first election.

Speaking of elections, I am drafting a proposal for a Charter, which will call for all major positions to be filled by election, and which I plan to present to the members on Friday the 11th of April. The members will then be free to adopt it, amend it, or scrap it and write a new one from scratch. This is your region, I&amp;#39;m just here to keep the peace. Until the passage of a Regional Charter, Cardoness will be the Interim Delegate and Acting Speaker of the Regional Assembly. I will appoint other key positions as the need arrises.
