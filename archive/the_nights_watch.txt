[b]Night gathers, and now my watch begins. 

The Nights Watch[/b] is the military order established to protect the region of [b][region]St Abbaddon[/region][/b] from the threat of invasion. 

There are two branches that make up The Nights Watch: The [b]Rangers[/b] and The [b]Builders[/b]. The Rangers are the updating force of the Order. The Builders are a non-updating force that strive to maintain healthy endorsement levels as well as enforce a strict endorsement cap in our home region.
