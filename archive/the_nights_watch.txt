[b]Night gathers, and now my watch begins. 
We are the sword in the darkness. 

The Nights Watch[/b] is the military order established to protect the region of [b][region]St Abbaddon[/region][/b] from the threat of invasion, and to defend the realms of natives from the invaders. 

There are two branches that make up The Nights Watch: The [b]Rangers[/b] and The [b]Builders[/b]. The Rangers are the updating force of the Order. The Rangers fight to protect all regions from invaders just as others have done for us when our region was under attack. The Builders are a non-updating force that maintain the wall of influence and endorsements that will protect St Abbaddon from occupation.
