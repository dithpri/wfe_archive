[b]Night gathers, and now my watch begins. 
We are the sword in the darkness. 

The Nights Watch[/b] is the military order established to protect the regions of NationStates from the threat of wildling invasion.

There are two branches that make up The Nights Watch: The [b]Rangers[/b] and The [b]Builders[/b]. The Rangers are the updating force of the Order. The Rangers fight to protect all regions from invaders just as others have done for us when our region was under attack. The Builders are a non-updating force that strive to help natives be preemptively stop invasions.
