[b]Charlemagne (c.742-814) was a medieval emperor who ruled much of Western Europe from 768 to 814. In 771, Charlemagne became king of the Franks, a Germanic tribe in present-day Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and western Germany. He embarked on a mission to unite all Germanic peoples into one kingdom, and convert his subjects to Christianity. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne emperor of the Romans. In this role, he encouraged the Carolingian Renaissance. When he died in 814, Charlemagne&#146;s empire encompassed much of Western Europe, and he had also ensured the survival of Christianity in the West.[hr]A History Site Protected by [nation=short]Charlemagne Guard[/nation] of [region]The Great National Socialist Empire[/region][/b]
