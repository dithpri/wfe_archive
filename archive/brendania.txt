Brendania is a large land mass located towards the Gulf of Mexico, but expands into the Pacific Ocean. It is inhabited by a subspecies of Humans called Brendans. Brendans are known to be relatively antisocial and hostile to anyone that&amp;#39;s not one of them. They are also relatively mentally unstable and often descend into insanity as they grow older.
