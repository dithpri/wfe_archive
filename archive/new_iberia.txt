New Iberia was named after the Iberian Peninsula. Both Portuguese and Spanish settlers settled onto the island of New Iberia, with the Spanish settlers naming their new nation &quot;Vatrine&quot;. 

Soon, New Iberia was united under the Kingdom of Vatrine in 1932. However, the Kingdom fell apart when several different dictators rose to power in their respected regions. One of which lead the &quot;Greater Vatrine&quot; movement, a Fascist, Anti-Communist, Anti-Democratic movement. This nation is undoubtedly the most powerful nation on the Island of New Iberia. Greater Vatrine is still lead by the Fascists, and is not expected to change soon..
