Post Southeast Asia is a region for experimenting with the game&#39;s political compass from an anti-capitalist and anti-state perspective. We welcome all players of similar political ideology whose purpose in using nationstates is:

1) to create political entities which attempt to represent your actual political thinking or ideology
2) to create political entities that attempt to mock previous, current or hypothetical states
3) to participate in discussions on the Post Southeast Asia Regional Message Board (PSARMB)
4) to create cool flags and factbooks

Peace be with you.
