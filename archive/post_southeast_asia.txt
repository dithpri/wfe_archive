[b]Post Southeast Asia[/b] is a region for experimenting with the game&#39;s political compass from an anti-capitalist and anti-state perspective. We welcome all players of similar political ideology whose purpose in using nationstates includes one or more of the following:

[b]1)[/b] to create political entities which attempt to represent your actual political thinking or ideology

[b]2)[/b] to create political entities that attempt to mock previous, current or hypothetical states

[b]3)[/b] to participate in discussions on the regional messageboards

[b]4)[/b] to make cool flags and factbooks

Peace be with you.
