The Union of Miquamean Socialist Republics is a vast federal Marxist-Leninist state, governed by a single party from the planned capital of Kommarok. Its constituent republics operate under a centrally-planned economy, and its society of 85 million citizens is built upon principles of collectivism, with state-guaranteed healthcare and education and a culture that glorifies labor and the collective good.
