    Welcome to the Japo-Roman Empire! We are a prosperous region, with a high standard of living. Due to your recent relocation, you may want to message with some of the other nations (although they might not respond; we are very busy people.). Just so you know though, there are a couple of rules. First, any statements that are seen by the president as racist, sexist, or overly rude. Second, Nazism, due to its gross discrimination, will result in a permanent ban and eviction. Now that that is out of the way, I can truly say: Welcome to the Empire!
     -Sincerely, King Marius IX of Daaseland
