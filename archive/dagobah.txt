In the centre of the planet Neptune, high up in the sky is the land of Dagobah. It is the home of the Capitalists and Corperate Executives. Windhelm is the capital city of Dagobah there are 540 stock exchange terminals. The terminals are so efficient that through each terminal, 800 speculators can buy and sell stocks at one time. The roof is covered with solid gold, and the walls around Valhalla are made from giant gold pillars made from the blood of communists. This is the place where our citizens who had died after obtaining great wealth would come for their afterlife. Free from greedy taxes and socialists who think we should give our hard earned cash to those who cannot be bothered to get a real job.
