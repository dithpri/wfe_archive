[color=red][u][b]Welcome to The Soviet Orthodoxy Representing Rational Imperialists[/b][/u][/color]

The Soviet Orthodoxy expounds policies grounded in an alliance of the progressive ideals of Imperial Socialism and Radical Eco-Technocracy, with a forward-looking attitude of tolerance and peaceful coexistence between all peoples of good will. Similarly, the Orthodoxy is fiercely protective of both the sovereignty of its constituent member states and the inherent equality between nations.

While it is currently in its initial stages of planning and expansion, and much organization is still yet to be completed, the Orthodoxy offers many opportunities for ambitious, well-to-do nation-states intrepid enough to take part.
