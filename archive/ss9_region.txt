Welcome to the [region]SS9[/region] region where we treat everyone as an equal, and make no discrimination towards Dictatorships or Democracies. As this is a school project we ask that you follow the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=faq#etiquette]general rules of etiquette in the forums and in telegrams to each other.[/url] 

You are currently governed by [nation=shortnoflag]AUSTIN EMPIRE[/nation], your WA delegate [nation=shortnoflag]ivenoo3[/nation] and most importantly the Glorious Prime Minister [nation=shortnoflag]mshamilton[/nation].  In other news,we&amp;#39;ll be trying out a new format for voting on the WA issues as [nation=short+noflag]Ivenoo3[/nation] has to give up their right to vote. You&amp;#39;ll be seeing the new format soon.
