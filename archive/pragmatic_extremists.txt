This is a [nation=short]New South Hell[/nation] experimental region.

This is my fourth attempt to create a region of nations occupying all eight corners of the ideocube. This one is pragmatic instead of logical, based solely on observed issue effects  for other nations.

It appears to be working.

Note: The region welcomes additional residents. However, the ultimate regional goal is to stay in the top 10 most Extreme regions in NationStates (in July 2010, we were 9th). Any nations caught contributing to regional moderation will be &amp;quot;asked&amp;quot; to leave.
