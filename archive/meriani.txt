Meriani, a rather large and isolated piece of land. Famous for it&amp;#39;s freezing cold blizzards in the north, to it&amp;#39;s blistering heat in the south. The nations of Meriani used to be under one banner, the Merianian banner, before a long and bloody civil war errupted. It was then the region split. The nations all still speak a common language, Merial, even after the split. The region is renouned for it&amp;#39;s rare wines and exotic birds. In the present day, tensions arise as old rivalries spark, once more.
