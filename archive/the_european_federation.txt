Welcome to the EF!

The European Federation is a fully functional democratic region looking for determine members to serve in our regional government and military. The region was first founded back in 2011 by [nation=New EuropeanFederation] before it was merger into Persekutuan in early 2012. The decline or rather NLEPP takeover of Persekutuan gave way for the Federation to re-open it&amp;#39;s regional doors to bright and interesting members both old and new.
