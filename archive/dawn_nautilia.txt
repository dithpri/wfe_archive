Here at Dawn Nautilia, we go for a theme of post apocalyptic.

[i]The year is 2142. Humanity&#39;s once glorious space-faring empire has collapsed, and earth and been destroyed. All that remains are various colonies on one planet, known only as Nautilia. What will happen to your colony? Will you mutate or mix with the natives? Will you stay Pure human? Will you survive at all? Your story is waiting to be told.  [/i]

Dawn Nautilia is a place to hang out, make friends, and have some fun! Come on, and join in!

We have a discord server. I&#39;m looking for people to manage it, since I&#39;m not very good at managing Discords myself. If you win the Discord Manager spot, you will be given full control over it. Here&#39;s the link for the discord. https://discord.gg/n3ezqX
