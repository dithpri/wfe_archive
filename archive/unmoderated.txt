[b]NO MODS, NO MASTERS[/b]

Welcome to Unmoderated. If you see this region&#39;s name in another region&#39;s embassy list, it means that region (generally) doesn&#39;t file moderator reports and prefers to arbitrate disputes by itself without any oversight.

We accept all embassy requests, but if your region does have an embassy with us, please try to abide by the following standards:
1. Don&#39;t file reports or otherwise petition for moderator involvement in any area.
2. Try to follow site rules as best you can. Just because we want a society without lawmen doesn&#39;t mean we want one without law.
3. Stand up for freedom of speech where possible. And do tell your friends about us!
