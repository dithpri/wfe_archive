Welcome to Unmoderated. If you see this region&#39;s name in another region&#39;s embassy list, it means that region prefers to arbitrate disputes by itself without any oversight, if at all possible.

We accept all embassy requests, but if your region does have an embassy with us, please try to abide by the following standards:
1. Don&#39;t file moderator reports unless you need to. They&#39;re busy people.
2. Follow site rules as best you can. It&#39;s up to us to make NationStates a truly great place to be.
3. Tell your friends about us!
