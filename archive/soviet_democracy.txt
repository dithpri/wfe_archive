Founded March 2nd, 2018, Soviet Democracy was a sizeable and active community once home to hundreds of nations and was notable for its highly effective World Assembly membership and endorsement programme, which at the height of its success led to nearly two-thirds of its over 150 members holding WA membership, the 3rd highest average endorsements per nation on NS, and accumulating unheard of influence for a relatively new region. 

Various dispatches from the region&#39;s history are available for viewing below. All of us who once called Soviet Democracy home are grateful for your interest in our historic region.
