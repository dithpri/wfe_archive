So we&#39;ve decided to vote against free speech, against freedom of press, against human rights, and finally against the right to vote.

Sadly we democratically removed democracy before asking the people&#39;s opinion on the most important of issues ; the right of children to work.

That&#39;s going to have to come around at the next election, set in 3 famines and 2 failed coups.
