[b]An attempt at rebellion failed, leaving nothing but dust and echoes.[/b]

In early 2018 several citizens of the Confederacy of Layem fled and created their own region, Auroara. After only 40-50 days, their region collapsed after their founder [nation]SkyKnova[/nation] couldn&#39;t deal with leading a region of scum and villainy, and gave her region over to [nation]Mauroa[/nation] to destroy it all and banject everyone in it.

This goes to show if you fight against the Confederacy, you will fail and it will only bring nothing but an empty region with empty hopes. Hail Layem, Hail the Confederacy. Layem go Brach.
