A small territory, tucked away in the far reaches of the Secondary School&amp;#39;s hallways, Room 101 is noted for it&amp;#39;s climate control, which is kept under lock and key and accessible only to few (though there are rumors that Comrade Brennan has found ways around this).  Citizens are typically spotted sporting white shirts, Gangnam Style is the latest craze, and there are rumors of a disease called &amp;quot;senioritis&amp;quot; beginning to appear.
