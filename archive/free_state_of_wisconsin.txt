[b][color=blue]&quot;Fascism establishes the real equality of individuals before the nation. The object of the regime in the economic field is to ensure higher social justice for the whole of the Italian people. What does social justice mean?

As the past century was the century of capitalist power, the twentieth century is the century of power and glory of labor.&quot;[/b][/color]
