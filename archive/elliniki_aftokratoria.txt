The power vacuum left by the fall of Athina and Sparti was filled by Filippos II of Makedon (382-336 BCE) after his victory over the Athinaios forces and their allies at the Battle of Chaironea in 338 BCE. Filippos united the Elliniki city states under Makedonios rule and, upon his assassination in 336 BCE, his son Alexandros assumed the throne. Alexandros the Great (356-323 BCE) carried on his father&#39;s plans for a full scale invasion of Persia in retaliation for their invasion of Ellinikae in 480 BCE. He led his army into Aigyptos, across Asia Minor, through Persia, and finally to India. After a series of struggles between the Diodachi, General Antigonos established the Antigonidon Dynasty in modern day Elliniki Aftokratoria.
