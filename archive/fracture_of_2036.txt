It was a breaking point. Fueled by tensions mounting for 23 years and an ongoing oil crisis, the election of 2036 brought the North American continent to civil war, one that started so cold you&#39;d not know it until you had rifle in hand. An assembly in 2038 agreed on one thing: [b]secede[/b]. That or face years more death. So on November 1, America as we knew it was no more. 241,300 deaths for essentially naught; luckily no more.
But that&#39;s only the beginning of a whole new chapter for the continent.
