The administrative Region of Magna Vendia is constituted by sovereign nations which all submit to [nation]Zrakia[/nation]. The nations are sovereign to the point where they may wage war within the administrative region for territory, but every state is under the obligation to provide 10% of its armed forces to the Regional Guards, keeping peace in case of foreign invasion - in this case also all internal wars must be put to armistice.

The regional map and glossary will come later. Join and introduce yourselves.
