[hr] Between 9-11 August 2008, one of the biggest battles in NS history took place in this very region with nearly 230 nations involved. This region is now property of [color=red][b]Cruor[/b][/color] and remains to honour the fallen. Thank you to everyone who took part way back in Summer&amp;#39;08 and for making it a battle to remember. [hr]
