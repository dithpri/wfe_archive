[i][color=darkred]Occupied by &quot;[b][u]Essotori&#39;s Golden Girls[/b][/u]&quot;[/color][/i][hr]Historical region known for being a notable breakaway region from the KAISERREICH, inspiring similar rebellions in the KAISERREICH and the Bunicken, and having stupid mottos like &quot;To lead is to serve!&quot; They had a Greek aesthetic because they larped as Byzantines(despite naming their region Agia [i]Germania[/i]) and eventually ended up merging into Adefion. Unfortunate schmucks. Eventually the region died pretty hard. Their Nationstates branch fell under occupation by raider parties, and it&#39;s discord was disgraced to become the debating arena between A-rod Thij, Vacatio, and Otto. Recent attempts to revive the community have not yet, and likely never will, see success.
