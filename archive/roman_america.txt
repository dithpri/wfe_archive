A formerly Roman American region, until a corporate takeover by Ravengaurd International. Since then their have have been several rebellions, two of which have been successful. One by Las Respublica Veneta(which purchased its independence) and one by New Ravengaurd. All three countries are currently hostile to each other. After a conflict between Ravengaurd and New Ravengaurd led for the temporary demise of both nations, Respublica Veneta took over as founder of the region. Questions remain on when the shareholder&amp;#39;s of Ravengaurd will come out of their &amp;#39;vacation&amp;#39; (they are not hiding from the violence and chaos sweeping through Ravengaurd) in Respublica Veneta&amp;#39;s capitol.
