[b][color=red] I reply that the blood spilled pains me just as much as the blood spilled by all human beings. But there are still harrowing letters and I am still tormented by them because I know that Israel was founded by people like me only less fortunate than me.  Men with a number from Auschwitz tattooed on their arms, with no home or homeland, escaping from the horrors of the Second World War, who found in Israel a home and a homeland. I know all this but I also know that this is Begin&amp;#39;s favourite defence and I deny any validity to this defence.[/color][/b]

Ironically, it has been re-founded by anti-fascist Semites.
