The Realms of Aeternum is the unofficial term for the nations occupying the region of Aeternum, a magical landscape filled with treasures, demons, relics from bygone ages, and nations vying for the mighty title of Magistri Arcanum Mortis. The landscape of the Aeternum is constatnly changing as nations join and leave, or simply fade away. Occassionally strange peoples from other regions will come to take the glories of the Aeternum for their own, but the Magister Defensionis stands ready to call the myriad nations to fight against their common enemy. Est Aeternum nostrum!
