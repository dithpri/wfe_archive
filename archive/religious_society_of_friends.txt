[u]Weekly Advice &amp; Queries[/u] (No.3) Do you try to set aside times of quiet for openness to the Holy Spirit? All of us need to find a way into silence which allows us to deepen our awareness of the divine and to find the inward source of our strength. Seek to know an inward stillness, even amid the activities of daily life. Do you encourage in yourself and in others a habit of dependence on God&#39;s guidance for each day? Hold yourself and others in the Light, knowing that all are cherished by God.
