The Kharazi Jungle is an area south of Shilo Village on Karamja. The jungle is home to the Kharazi tribe and several species of wolves, birds, and other animals, most of which are aggressive. To the north-west is the entrance to the Viyeldi caves which has a role in the Legends Quest. Along the southern beach are several vanilla plants, which players will find a use for during the Sir Amik Varze subquest of Recipe for Disaster. Roughly in the centre of the jungle is a pond with special water and near it is a location where special Yommie trees may be planted. Along the jungle there are several black totem poles which players will have to get rid of during Legends Quest.
