[i][b]Hoenn region[/b][/i] is located south of Sinnoh, and southwest of both Kanto and Johto. Hoenn boasts many dramatic environments from rainforests to deserts, but its most striking feature is its abundance of water. There are several large and populated islands off the mainland only accessible via water routes, many of which are deep enough for diving. Much of the interior area is forested or mountainous, so most notable cities are found on the coastline. Hoenn seems to have a warmer climate than other regions, similar to an equatorial climate. The Hoenn region is unique and famous for its tropical-like environments. ([i]Est. 24.Aug.23[/i])
