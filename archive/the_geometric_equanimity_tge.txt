At long last, The Dark Creator has been defeated, his empire laid to waste and his influence dispelled from all the lands.  The day of judgment is at hand.  The Geometrix shall be remade, cleansed of all its corruption and of those who have defiled my name.  My light will reach into every corner of The Geoverse, consuming all in its path.  None shall remain to defy me, for in my Geoverse there is no darkness, only The Creator.
