[color=ff1d8e]You know its true, you my male boo,
Now sing the chorus with me if you&#39;re feeling the same way too.

Bromance, nothing really gay about it
Not, that there&#39;s anything wrong with being gay
Bromance, shouldn&#39;t be ashamed or hide it
[i]I love you[/i] in the most heterosexual way.

Hold me
To a promise that I&#39;ll be the kind of the friend that in the end
Will always keep you company
Because when the world gets tough
And times get hard
I will always love you, I&#39;ll be your bodyguard
Cus you&#39;re my bestie, and if you test me
I&#39;ll prove it time and time again, I got your back until the end
A brotha from anotha motha never knew how much I loved ya
