Greetings and welcome to the Federation of Malaysia!

This is a new region that was created for all Malaysians, though others are welcome as well. The aim of this region is to promote political discussion on philosophical and current and policy issues affecting Malaysia, and also to discuss ways to move forward with solutions. National politics can also be discussed in the message boards, regardless of whether one supports Barisan or Pakatan or other groups, though users are encouraged to be respectful to those with different views.

Enjoy your stay! = )
