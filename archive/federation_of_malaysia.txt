This region was created for all Malaysians, though others are welcome as well. The aim of this region is to promote political discussion on philosophical and current and policy issues affecting Malaysia, and also to discuss ways to move forward with solutions. National politics can also be discussed in the message boards, regardless of whether one supports Barisan or Pakatan or other groups.

We respect freedom of speech here, but would appreciate it if participants would refrain from name-calling and profanities, as such things are not conducive to intellectual discussions.
