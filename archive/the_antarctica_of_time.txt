We deduce from Euclid&#39;s fifth postulate that parallel lines can never meet. However, Euclidean geometry was discovered to be but an approximation, when Einstein developed the theory of general relativity. Spacetime itself is not a Euclidean space, because it can be curved. Furthermore, Einstein&#39;s theory of special relativity shows us that time is observed more quickly as we approach light speed or weightlessness. This means time cannot possibly be linear, for it is not constant in any direction. Alternate universes therefore cannot be a series of parallel time streams which never meet. Time is actually Antarctica-shaped.
