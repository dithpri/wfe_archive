[b]Welcome to [i]The Holy Union of Empires[/i]![/b]

This region is a community for Empires, Kingdoms and other forms of monarchies. Though we generally lean conservative, nations of any political leanings and ideologies are more than welcome.

We aim to be a peaceful and social union, and thus we kindly ask you to respect that. We also ask you to endorse our Vice-President [nation]The Manderithe[/nation] as our Regional Delegate in the WA.

Come and help us build this region. If you have any questions feel free to ask.
