Side 3 is located behind the moon, at L2, and is known as Munzo. Side 3 was the only Side to never use the &quot;open-type&quot; colonies; instead, they used &quot;closed-type&quot; colonies, which removed the glass &quot;sky&quot; panels and was a completely &quot;solid&quot; cylinder with no open view to space. This allowed each colony to house greater capacities of people.
