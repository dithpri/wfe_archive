A massive continent that spans 70% of the Pacific Ocean&amp;#39;s floor. Here, the entire continent is kept safe and alive by a massive dome, which is kept at a constant and pleasant -15 degrees Centigrade in order to keep a thick layer of ice around the dome for structural support. The citizens of the countries in the dome had no idea as to how they arrived in this massive dome. It was unknown to the outside world until recently when it was discovered by a fleet of rouge Japanese submarines during World War II - all of which were promptly destroyed by the nations within the dome using their massively superior technological weapons.
