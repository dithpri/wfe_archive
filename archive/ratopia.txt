[b][color=red]Welcome to the Lovely Ratopian Society!![/color][/b]
[hr]&amp;#128000; [color=orange][i]Founded by [nation]Toothbox[/nation] for the representation of the Ratopians [/i]&amp;#128000; [/color]

[color=green]Ratopia is a relatively peaceful region consisting of people with [b]somewhat strange and radical ideology[/b]. Each nation within it is very different, but Ratopia is very accepting and is willing to hear them out-- just so long as those values are [b]not[/b] forcibly imposed upon them. [/color]

[color=blue]With [nation]Toothbox[/nation] as an executive authority, Ratopia will be a [b]massive[/b] empire with success [b]beyond comprehension[/b] in any way that its leaders want, which will dictate our influence on the world itself.[/color]

[hr][color=purple][b]We will make a remarkable difference.[/b][/color]
