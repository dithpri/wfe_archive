An ancient region forged in fire and tempered in blood, spanning four continents and most notable for the diversity of its racial groups, cultural styles and political systems. It is a realm divided by conflicting ambitions, ideals and methods and consumed by perpetual warfare and political and religious machinations, where the screams of the innocent oft go unheard between the clash of the righteous and the wicked.
