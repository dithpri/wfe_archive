Welcome to the fortress of Kol Korran, a compound that takes up almost an entire district of our capital city, Edur Ithindra. This is the military headquarters of our sovereign nation, and also the point for networking our region holdings and independent allies (or just friends and nice people from around NS. Military resources can be used for peaceful purposes too). 

Security State: DEFCON 2

All forces, prepare for battle!
