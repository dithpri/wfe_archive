Dontoksheet is a closely knit community comprising of players who agree that the game is bombarded by unnecessary telegrams and regional activities that you don&amp;#39;t really want to get involved in. DTS believe that one should have the ability to legislate (or dismiss) issues and interact with nations that you actually want to interact with without the constant nagging of recruitment telegrams and whatnots that make the overall experience more appalling for you. At DTS, we aim to deliver those expectations to you by not doing anything. DTS promise and we deliver.
