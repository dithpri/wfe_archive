Here we have a lot of fun. If you follow the rules. Please follow the rules. There aren&#146;t many of them. 

Remember, this is based on WW2 to Cold War. No modern weaponry is allowed. Only items invented from 1980 and below are allowed. Nukes can&#146;t be magically mass produced. You must follow the ideals chosen nation, and you cannot exceed the land granted to you.

Those are the only rules. Y&#146;all should be able to reason easily, and understand what goes and what doesn&#146;t. Have Fun!
