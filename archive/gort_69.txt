[b]On the night of February 21st of 2023, the once silent Arbiters of Chaos hailing from [region]The Infinity Incursion[/region] awoke from their slumber and started their crusade against all of those who haven&#39;t seen the light. A total of 17 regions fell to the powers of darkness and chaos on this night, including the very region you&#39;re visiting now.

[color=9d0e0e]The only option is to embrace the chaos and become one of the Arbiters today, unless you too want to become another victim of The Incursion. Also nice region.[/color][/b]
