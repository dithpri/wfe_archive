the entire continent is regarded as a single region. As the area is so vast, there is a huge variety of climate and terrain, ranging from the cold marshes of the north to the hot deserts of the south. Three races dominate the region: Ponies, changeling and deer. There are also insignificant minorities of buffalo, dragons and griffons. The ponies live on flat plains, arid drylands and sparse woodlands, the home of the deer is in boreal forests, tall mountains and swamps, while the changelings inhabit dark forests and marshlands. Each of the major races of the south have nations of their own. Equestria is by far the largest and most industrialized nation in the world, regarded as the haven of ponykind.
