The Arab Alliance is a region that treats all nations equally; except capitalists, fascists, and other centro/rightist ideologies. we will give the freedom of democratic choices, and even limit the regional leaders power. We force no nation to participate in Islam, and anyone who puts inappropriate messages on the board will be banned by a vote. we welcome all Arabs, and hope all nations find our free, democratic region as much as a home as any other region.
