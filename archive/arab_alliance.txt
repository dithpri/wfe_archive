The Arab Alliance is a region that treats all nations equally. We give the freedom of democratic or non-democratic choices, and even limit the regional leaders power. We force no nation to participate in Islam, and anyone who puts inappropriate messages on the board will be banned by a vote. We welcome all Arabs, and hope all nations find our free, democratic region as much as a home as any other region.
