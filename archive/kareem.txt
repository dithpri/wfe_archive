[b][u]This helpless region was annexed by the forces of &amp;quot;The Death Knights&amp;quot;![/u][/b]

[b]This region is now property of &amp;quot;The Death Knights&amp;quot; and will have two given purposes; to be used as a puppet storage or to be used as a jump-point. Beware that we are not only just raiders but also an a imperialist group that wishes to expand its empire. We will gladly take regions off your hands permanently if you show no interest in refounding them!

We are doing you guys a big favour... better this region being controlled by us than to fall into the hands of The Black Riders!
