Here you can be whatever you want, just don&#39;t have an iron-fisted grip on everyone in the region if you have power. If this happens,then you will be ejected and quite possibly banned from the region, after receiving a warning. If you would like power, just ask the Founder. If you want to be in this region, telegram the Founder, and they will tell you the password (I am taking these precautions because the region got invaded once).
