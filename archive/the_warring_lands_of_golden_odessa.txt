The Golden Lands of Odessa. The warm rays and gentle sunlight pour over the plentiful wheat fields, cool breezes swaying through the valleys. The cool winds carry up the tallest mountains, the shivering mines supplying the entire region. The falling rocks lead to a sinking plateau with moss riddled forests, the hills painted with wildflowers, bees, butterflies, and more. The secrets of these woods trickle out into a bone dried desert, the home of the Golden Odessa Oasis, where the regions mana pool lies, supplying the regions magic power.
