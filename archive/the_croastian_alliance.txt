[u]Welcome To The Croastian Alliance[/u]
[i]The Croastian Alliance was founded by the Croastian countries to maintain peace and stability, which then joined by the neighbouring countries. Today, the Alliance stands firm against invaders and infiltrates using methods deemed suitable and humane. Sanctions, peacekeeping forces and humanitarian efforts will be used against a nation which goes against laws of the alliance and humanitarian rights and laws.[/i]
