The Novoselic National Army is the main military force of The New World United Alliance. The NNA takes command from their honorable General, S. Shah from their capital of New Asher. The soldier&#39;s training is both tough and primitive as the NNA specializes in moving silently, quickly, and efficiently. They are able to move whole divisions without alerting the their enemy. They make their enemy fear every step into their land, as every step they make further seals their fate. The NNA will surround, harass, and dispatch of entire divisions and even entire armies as they move into their land. [b]Unite the Countries![/b]
