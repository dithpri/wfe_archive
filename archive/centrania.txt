Centrania is a region based on a fictional continent named Centrania, located in the Atlantic Ocean. It is very unknown in the world, with many isolationist countries being on it. The region follows a somewhat alternate history, due to the fact that there is another continent on the Earth. The South-Eastern parts of the continent were influenced by the Spanish during colonial times, and by the East (Soviet, Non-aligned) in the more recent history. The North-East is of mostly Muslim orientation, and the Western parts of the map may be interpreted in any desired way. Factbooks are reccomended, as to increase realism, and make the region more interesting.
