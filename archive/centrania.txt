Centrania is a region based on a fictional continent named Centrania, located in the Atlantic Ocean. It is very unknown in the world, with many isolationist countries being on it. The region follows a somewhat alternate history, due to the fact that there is another continent on the Earth. Factbooks are reccomended, as to increase realism, and make the region more interesting. [b]Centrania is open to join, and officer positions might be assigned[/b]
