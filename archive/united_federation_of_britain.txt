Originally anti-fascist, this region was occupied by the [region]Union of Fascists[/region]. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b].

Most of its remaining occupants have been evacuated by international relief services and the FJA military. Full withdrawal was planned for December 27th, but what the heck, it&amp;#39;s Christmas season. United Federation of Britain will live on for at least a while longer :)
