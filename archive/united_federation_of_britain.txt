Originally anti-fascist, this region was occupied by the [region]Union of Fascists[/region]. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b].

Most of its remaining occupants have been evacuated by international relief services and the FJA military. Full withdrawal was planned for 12/27/12, but what the heck, it was Christmas season. So the United Federation of Britain lives on!
