Originally anti-fascist, this region was occupied by the [region]Union of Fascists[/region]. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b].

Its remaining occupants are now being evacuated by international relief services and the FJA military. Fascists, if you want the land back, you will have to wait until around December 27th, by which time the innocent people of United Federation of Britain will be safe and the resources salvaged.
