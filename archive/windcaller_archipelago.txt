The Windcaller Archipelago is a large chain of islands with frequent storms and high-speed winds. It is estimated that there are a dozen islands of varying sizes. Large, heavily forested islands to the north provide some shelter from the wind, and smaller, mineral-rich islands to the south supply economic opportunities for the nations of the region. The region is generally warm, hospitable, and rich. The local animal life is exotic, but increased human presence has led to thousands of imported animals from all over the world.
