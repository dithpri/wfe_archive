Glory now and forever to the Kingdom of Spain. 

God bless Isabel and Fernando, catholic monarchs of Spain, reconquerors of the iberian peninsula and discoverers of the New World, those who filled it with catholic churches, convents, universities, hospitals and much more. Those who forbid slavery and stopped the barbaric aztec practicies.
