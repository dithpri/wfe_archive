The gulf is warm and heated by the burning sun rays from the heavens. The beaches are white and the water is crystal clear. Palm trees grow on the sand, and the mountains are tall and relentless. They&#146;re blasted by snow and ice. Here your country can grow prosperous without lots of confusing rules. You can send your country here, in the Gulf.
