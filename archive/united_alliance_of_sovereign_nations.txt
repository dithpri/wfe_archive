[b][color=3a85ff]Welcome to the United Alliance of Sovereign Nations.[/color][/b]
[hr]
[color=ff2121]We are an Alliance of mainly libertarian nations who have come together to form a force for good. All of our nations are signatories to the regional [i][b]Free and Fair Trade Agreement[/b][/i], and the military, intelligence and various other national entities are joined together to create their respective regional organisations.[/color]
[hr]
[color=3a85ff]The Alliance is governed by a Council consisting of the WA Delegate, Founder and one other publicly elected officer. All laws enacted will be available for viewing in the [i]Alliance Dispatch[/i] (under construction). [/color]
