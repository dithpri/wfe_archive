Seleucia on the Tigris was a major Mesopotamian city of the Seleucid, Parthian, and Persian empires.

It stood on the West bank of the river opposite Ctesiphon. The two royal centers formed the metropolis of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.

The city eventually faded into obscurity and was swallowed by the desert sands, abandoned after the Tigris shifted its course.

The region is now under Greek stewardship.
