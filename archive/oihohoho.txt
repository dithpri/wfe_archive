Welcome to Oihohoho, the hidden ohio-like island in [region]Coyphus[/region]!
Here there is a lot of Coryphius (not Coyphus) plants native to DJDJJregiona, which is [nation]JCH[/nation]&#146;s
region. And we also have stuff that our even more crazy than Ohio itself. Ethensia tried to invade us, but failed (HAHAHAHAHAHA)
And also, we have these giant crazy weird psychopathic killer rabbits that some guys in cars tried to fight, and we&#146;ve got walking and alive teeth&#133;. we don&#146;t know where they came from.

Also, dropping stuff is illegal in Oihohoho, so DO NOT DROP STUFF OR ELSE YOU WILL LIVE IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
