[i]The [b]West Indies[/b] is a region of the Caribbean Basin and North Atlantic Ocean that includes the many islands and island nations of the Antilles and the Lucayan Archipelago. After the first of the voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas, Europeans began to use the misnomer West Indies to differentiate that region from the Indies (South Asia and Southeast Asia).[/i]

[color=#12ba94]Most of us have migrated from the [region]Caribbean[/region]. Others have most likely went on an island-hopping expedition and ended up here just for a quick respite.

Either way, no matter which group of islands or coastal areas you originally resided, anyone is welcome in the New West Indies![/color]
