Welcome to one of (I hope) the most peaceful regions in all nation states. The NSPU&amp;#39;s focus is to establish a world of peace and for there to be at least less wars. I, Haichianga wish for more peace within nation states and the creation of a powerful union to ensure peaceful resolutions to conflicts.
