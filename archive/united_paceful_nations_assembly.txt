In the UPNA, every peacefully nation is welcome.
We want to be as democratic as we can and, for that reason, we want to stay being a little region.
We are tolerant with every kind of ideology, if this is peaceful. Every nation has the right to express its free opinion and to ask for rules and vote them.

Welcome everyone.
