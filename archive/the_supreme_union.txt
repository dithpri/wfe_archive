Welcome to our region. Here at the Supreme Union, we have a developing, democratic regional government, which everyone can be part of.
We also constantly have friendly community discussion, about almost anything! And perhaps one of the most interesting and enjoyable parts of our region is our advanced, modern tech role play, which everyone is welcome to join.
