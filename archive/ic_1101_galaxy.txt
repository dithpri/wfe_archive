Here, in the region of the IC 1101 Galaxy, you can Roleplay, if you are a space-themed empire, or you would like to play in a fantasy world. Some things that I will post are going to be the region&#39;s map, and how you can carve out your own part of the galaxy for yourself. You can play as a humanistic nation, with humans being the founders of your nation or the rulers of your nation. Or you could play as an alien nation, and be a native alien tribe, or be an alien empire. All further information will be disclosed in the region&#39;s map dispatch.
