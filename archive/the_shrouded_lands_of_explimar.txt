An Almost Uninhabitable area of the world, unknown to most, and shrouded in mystery to others. Long ago, the area was filled with creatures of myth and legends, fairytale and fantasy. They died out unexpectedly and quickly, for unknown reasons. Some believe that they were hunted down by their ancestors, others believe that they were befallen by disease and Famine. The Kingdom of Orana, the rulers of these strange lands, generously allow all nations to join and continue on with their own customs, styles and such.
