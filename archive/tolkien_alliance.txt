The Tolkien Alliance stretches across Middle Earth. 
A looming war between Gondor and Mordor has everyone on alert. 
But wether you wish to join the fight on one side or another, create alliances of your own, trade with your neighbors, fight with them, be a rouge nation of mercenaries, or take part in a shifting web of treaties, and politics, the war will keep you busy. 

Or maybe you want to relax, enjoy the beautiful landscape from green forests, to white mountains, to endless grassy plains, and live in peace and serenity...   Middle Earth has plenty of room for you.
