Armatiste is a newfound region which accepts nations of varying political views in a hope to generate intellectual debate. It is found by the Samopolis City State, a Capitalist Tyranny who supports prosperity through expanding its education system in order to allow the proletariat to work up the caste system. A Delegate will be appointed through a democratic vote which all members will be able to participate in. The Region is open to all genders and races as patriarchal society and racial discrimination are ways of the past.
