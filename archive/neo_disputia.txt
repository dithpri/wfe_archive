The New Regime is now in the past. Welcome to its successor, Neo Disputia, the thriving region that probably won&#39;t last very long!

Neo Disputia&#39;s might is built upon the flourishing Solaris Stock Exchange, where shares of the region&#39;s dominant corporations are bought and sold. A subsidiary of Opulent (a financial conglomerate that is notable for printing currency), the Solaris Stock Exchange is ahead of its time in the greatly profitable business of investing. 

Neo Disputia is officially headquartered in the Creozavarian capital city of Creo-Omnora. However, Solaris, a progressive city located in Serazorelian Creozavaria, is where the stock exchange is based as well as much of the country&#39;s finance industry.
