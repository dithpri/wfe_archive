This region was established by expatriots of [region]the Greater German Reich[/region] during [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;amp;t=217101]the invasion of January 2, 2013[/url] led by [region]Asgard[/region]. After the invaders retreated and the GGR returned to a semblance of normalcy, &amp;quot;The Greatest German Reich&amp;quot; was abandoned. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] as a tribute to the invasion.
