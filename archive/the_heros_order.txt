We are a growing nation. Here, we give our people democracies. On the last day of every month, we hold elections on who will be in the house of Executives. After the elections, the 4 people with the majority of votes become Executives. Executives can be kicked out by the High Inquisitor. The High Inquisitor and the Executives will vote for a Chief Executive, the leader of the Executives, from the Executive party. The Executives can also hire Judges. The Executives request for someone to be banned, so the Judges look into the situation and decide if they want to ban that person. The Judges should have high regional power.
