[region]Alastasia[/region] is a free, democratic, capitalist, and independent region that is open to all nations, including those that are not free, democratic, capitalist, and independent.

We love [region]Ethaysia Two[/region] citizens and [region]Extaria[/region]ns. Please don&amp;#39;t question this.

WA Delegate position is always open! Go ahead! Endorse each other! I think we all know you want to.

This region is not themed after a real life place. Don&amp;#39;t even try it. But we still love [url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ro.html]Romania[/url]!

All formal embassy requests will be accepted. Why? Because we [i]can[/i] and we [i]will[/i].

Sister Region of [region]Yekaterinburg[/region], [region]Electricity[/region], and [region]Ethaysia Two[/region].
