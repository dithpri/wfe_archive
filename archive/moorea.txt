[b][color=#1C69A8]Moorea[/color][/b] is a volcanic island in French Polynesia lying 11 miles northwest of Tahiti. Both Moorea and Tahiti are members of the Windward Islands, a group that is part of the larger [region]Society Islands[/region] archipelago. &#151;Wikipedia

Believed to have inspired the mythical [region]Bali Hai[/region] from James Michener&#39;s Tales of the South Pacific, Moorea is one of the most scenically striking islands in French Polynesia. 

Moorea may be considered Tahiti&#39;s little sister, but she steals the spotlight every time. The island is a true reflection of the laid back Tahitian lifestyle and the warm, welcoming character of French Polynesia and its people.
