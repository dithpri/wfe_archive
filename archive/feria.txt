[i]United We Stand, Divided We Fall.[/i]

This is the motto of Feria. Seeing all the superpowers in the world made the nations of the region both envious and fearful. Seeing this, the Fiefdom of Oeconia proposed an alliance with seven other nations in the area. They immediately accepted, and Feria was born. Since then more nations have joined the region. The nations of Feria have promised to defend each other in times of war, and support each other in times of peace. Feria contains governments of all kinds, from socialists to monarchies to democracies.
