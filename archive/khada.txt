Khada is a geographically diverse region with biomes varying from lush river valleys and hardy mountain ranges to warm Mediterranean coastal regions. Khada&#39;s mountainous terrain has left it somewhat isolated and protected from outside threats. This has fostered strong feelings of independence among the populace of the region and feelings of uncertainty with the unification of Kheora and it&#39;s rise onto the world stage. With the mountainous topography making effective governance and quick civil and military response difficult Kheora has been wracked with internal conflicts, with most issues stemming from separatism.
