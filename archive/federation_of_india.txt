India, a fascinating region, framed by the daunting Himalaya&#146;s in the north, Arabian Sea in the west, Bay of Bengal in the east and Indian Ocean in the south contains an astonishing variety of geographical features like eternally frozen glaciers, deep rain-forests, fertile valleys, blistering deserts, and palm sprinkled silvery beaches. India&#39;s diversity is reflected in the 17 major languages and 900 dialects. The magnanimous diversity in traditions, rituals, art, music and dance, drama, literature, movies, recreation, sports and cuisine across the breadth of the country never fails to amaze observers.
