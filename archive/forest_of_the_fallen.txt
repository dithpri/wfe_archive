The forest was occupied by Insaniragica after the nation was exiled from their lengthy residency in the north pacific during the 2019 Z-day. 
Instead of huddling together with a bunch of other exiles Insaniragica set out for independence and found a place of it&#39;s own in the forest. 
The Forest of the Fallen is rejecting all embassy requests at this time.
Requests for the construction of an embassy will result in a ban from our borders.
