Welcome, fellow Proud Nerds, to NationStates! Be sure to post in the regional forum who you are on Facebook so we can keep track. Join the WA if you feel like getting super into this game, and if someone wants to be our official delegate to the WA let me know so I can start making everyone endorse you. Remember, you don&amp;#39;t have to follow any doctrine or political leaning here. Choose what you want, rule how you wish, and don&amp;#39;t be a dick to anyone. Well, you can be a dick. Just don&amp;#39;t do it a lot. 

Ok, you can be a dick a lot if you can be funny about it.
