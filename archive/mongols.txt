Mongols are a Central-North Asian people living in Mongolia, a large region lying on either side of the Sino-Russian frontier. This region was separated after World War II into Inner Mongolia, controlled by China, and Buryat Mongolia, controlled by Russia. Although most Mongols live in Mongolia, large numbers live also in China outside Mongolia. Owing to wars and migrations, they are also found in some Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan.
