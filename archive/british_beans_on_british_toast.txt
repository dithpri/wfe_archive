In Britain&#39;s land, where rain doth fall
Beans on toast is king, above all
A simple dish, with beans in a tin
On toast it&#39;s served, with a grin

It may not be fancy, or haute cuisine
But Brits love their beans, it&#39;s no mean feat
The toast is lightly toasted, the beans are cooked
A combination, that&#39;s simply hooked

It&#39;s quick to make, and easy to eat
And for some reason, it can&#39;t be beat
From breakfast to lunch, or even dinner
Beans on toast, it&#39;s always a winner

So here&#39;s to beans on toast, the humble dish
That Brits love, without any wish
For anything fancy, or grandiose fare
It&#39;s beans on toast, and we don&#39;t care!
