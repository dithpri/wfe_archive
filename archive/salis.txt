Salis is a planet located in the Aurel system, and is the home of humanity, where all of life is presumed to have evolved instead of on Earth. In this universe, Earth does not exist. All life evolved on Salis in this universe, including humanity; subsequently, all of human history also took place on Salis instead of on Earth. Human history is different, but human technology levels and understanding of the universe around them is the same as the present day on Earth. We do not have spaceships any more advanced than Crew Dragon, Soyuz, Tiangong, and the International Space Station. We do not leave our world regularly, and it is still very, very expensive to do so.
