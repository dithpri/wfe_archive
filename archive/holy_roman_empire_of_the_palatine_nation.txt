The Holy Roman Empire of The Palatine Nation is the collection of lands and territories under the Valorum Crown and Monarchy. The Holy Roman Empire itself is a unitary state, with each constituent territory having no autonomous powers. The Head of State is The Holy Roman Emperor, currently Karolus XII, who serves as both The Legislature and Judiciary of The Palatine Nation, and retains sweeping executive power, though some of his powers are delegated to the Chancellor of The Holy Roman Empire, who serves as Head of the Palatine Government.
