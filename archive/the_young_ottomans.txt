We are here to ensure peace, justice and tolerance upon all people in our Alliance. We  would like to establish Pax Ottomana again with our ancient motto:

&amp;quot;Devlet-i Ebed-m&uuml;ddet&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;The Eternal State&amp;quot;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&amp;quot;O my son!
From now on, it is for us to divide; for you to unite!
For us, sloth; for you, warning and encouragement!

My son!
Be patient, a flower does not bloom before its time. Never forget: Let man flourish, and the state will also flourish!&amp;quot;

Sheik Edebali  (He was a respected Turkish religious leader, who helped to shape and develop the policies of the growing Ottoman State.)
