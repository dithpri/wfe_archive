The Isle of Aldovia is a remote, little island out in the middle of nowhere. Founded by the vikings of Scandinavia, the place is riddled with old looking shacks, battle axes, and the skeletons of their enemies, that have been around for centuries. Most things get around here get passed down to generation after generation. Thus the reason why Rachael, the newest member to the oldest generation of Fulkners, has her great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great Aunt&#39;s knickers on.

Anyways, this little region is always welcoming newcomers.
