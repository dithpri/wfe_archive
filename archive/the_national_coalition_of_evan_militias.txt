 Welcome to the [b]National Coalition of Evan Militias[/b] [b](NatCoEM)[/b]. This region consists of nations that have chosen to host and support local Evan Militia cells.
     
 The Evan Militia itself is a group of Evan Empire funded supporters helping to promote the Evan Empire and take down aggressor nations. In order to accomplish this, the Evan Militia advertises the Evan Empire through diplomatic means and also conducts missions to help remove the nations that oppose the Evan Empire and its allies. If you wish to join the Evan Militia, or have a task for an Evan Militia cell, please join the [b]NatCoEM[/b] and negotiations can begin.
