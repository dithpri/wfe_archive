La Alianza del Progreso (&quot;Alianza&quot;) is a commonwealth of allied nations united under the objective of political and defensive cooperation. Cr&aacute;pulas get out.




It&#39;s obligatory for member nations, except for The Armed Republic of Testigos de Tadeo (Ministro de Salud y Control de plagas), to possess the official icon of La Alianza on their flag, in any form. The only communist country allowed here is The Emirate of Crapulopolis.
