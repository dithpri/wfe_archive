[b]Welcome to [color=AA0100]La Alianza [/color] [color=D0C2C2] del [/color] [color=black] Progreso![/color] [/b]
La Alianza del Progreso (&quot;Alianza&quot;) is a small but active commonwealth of allied nations united under the objective of political and defensive cooperation. 

[i][b][strike]Cr&aacute;pulas get out[/strike][/b] Everyone[/i] is welcome here. We used to not accept communists and [i]cr&aacute;pulas[/i] before, but now we do.
We are especially interested in nations that value the virtues of freedom and equality ([i]libert&eacute; &amp; &eacute;galit&eacute;[/i]), but it never hurts to have a war-loving dictator ally. Most of us speak both English and Spanish. 

[u]Please send a telegram to [nation]Nueva_Olivos[/nation][/u] if you are interested in joining our region, or if you have any questions. Btw, you can simply call me [nation=short+noflag]Nueva_Olivos[/nation].

Thanks for visiting! [i]See ya![/i]
