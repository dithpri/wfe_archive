Kaho&amp;#699;olawe has always been sparsely populated due to its lack of fresh water. During World War II, he island was used as a training ground and bombing range by the Armed Forces of the United States.

The Hawaii State Legislature established the Kahoolawe Island Reserve to restore and to oversee the island and its surrounding waters. Today Kahoolawe can be used only for native Hawaiian cultural, spiritual, and subsistence purposes.[/color] &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
