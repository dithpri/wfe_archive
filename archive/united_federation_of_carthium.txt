After WWIII, a large group of survivors moved to a new planet, this one, and started mining a powerful material called Carthium with Kyberon tools from home.  They eventually made cities out of Kyberon.  This proved to be fine at first, but other nations found out how to destroy Kyberon.  We need you to join the fight.  First ones in will have good positions.  Note: The leader of Denimion will not always be here, so don&#39;t have a bunch of messages on the board.  Polls will be placed, but not often.
