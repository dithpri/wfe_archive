Our friends may be here...It was that thought that led us to Castle Oblivion, where cards rule all.

A mysterious man gave Sora a card, and using it took us to Traverse Town&#151;of all places!

It turned out the town was just a figment of our own remembrances, the first world of many that lie in Sora&#39;s heart.

And so our journey through these worlds begins.
