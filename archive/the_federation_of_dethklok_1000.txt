[b][color=darkblue]Welcome to the Federation of Dethklok 1000![/color][/b]

Hello! We&amp;#39;ve moved out, we can now be found at [region=One Big Island] (most of us, at least). We spent two years here and we loved it.
This region is now primarily used as a museum, where you can look at ancient Dethkloktopian graffiti, study Yulisian football results, and rifle through Dictationapore&amp;#39;s rubbish bins. 

Founded: 13th October 2013, Abandoned: approximately 2015, it may take a while
