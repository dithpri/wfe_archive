Yulis blew up the world!

The winner of the WA Delegate Election was [nation]Great Dubem[/nation].
You can start endorsing him now. (just don&amp;#39;t un endorse me until Dubem&amp;#39;s got enough otherwise messy stuff will happen)
Technically Dethkloktopia must approve him first, but he&amp;#39;s not here, so if he doesn&amp;#39;t log on before 12pm (midday) EST on the 18th January, Yulis gains the power to approve the new Delegate (which I do, I can&amp;#39;t see how I should be allowed not to)
&amp;quot;Constitution 3.3: The Head of TEC shall be the highest power in The Federation except for the Founder, who must approve the WA Delegate.&amp;quot; (quoted [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Dethklok_1000/topic/9560384/1/]here[/url])
