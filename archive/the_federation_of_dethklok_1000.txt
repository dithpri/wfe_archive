We&amp;#39;re back, we were visited by some pesky foreigners who accidentally spilled bleach everywhere. Don&amp;#39;t worry, I have the old WFE somewhere, but until then, there&amp;#39;s a bit of space to work with.

[b]Election:[/b]
Three candidates, [nation]Fioreto[/nation], [nation]Dictationapore[/nation] and [nation]Glorious Dubem[/nation], will go head to head in a debate and then an election will happen.
To vote in the election you must be a citizen, there is a [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Dethklok_1000/topic/10064992/1/#new]list of citizens[/url] and a [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Dethklok_1000/topic/10059779/2/#new]citizenship application thread[/url] on our forum. Citizenship sign-ups can now be done by telegram or by posting on the RMB. Once the election actually starts, you can vote on the RMB by simply stating, &amp;quot;I, [nation], vote for [Dethkloktopia] as WA Delegate.&amp;quot;
