[b]Welcome home to [region]The Australian Commonwealth[/region] of NationStates[/b]
I am, you are, we are Australian. Founded in 2016 for the Fair Dinkum.[hr][*]We are a Commonwealth of Nations under the Crown.
[*]Our members are honest, hard working, and fun-loving.
[*]We have a Monarch and an independent Governor-General.
[*]Powers are prescribed directly by the Monarch.
[*]The Governor-General is appointed every 90 days.
[*]Our Parliament/Government is elected every 28 days.
[*]The Senate has less powers than the House of Reps.
[*]We conduct our stately business on a different site.
[*]Come here if you are peaceful, kind, and tolerant.[hr][b]Thanks to the Founder for making this region possible.[/b]
Our faith rests always, with the Monarchy and each other.
