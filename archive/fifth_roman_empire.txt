[color=red]Great Caesar State: [nation]Eternal Constantinople[/nation]

The Roman Empire lasted from 27 BC to 476 AD, the Byzantine Empire from 285 to 1453 AD, the Ottoman Empire from 1299 to 1923 AD, and the greater dominion of The Hellenic Greek Empire from 1832 to 2015 AD. These are the Four Roman Empires, each succeeding the one before it. Now, the final and eternal Fifth Roman Empire has risen. The tyrannical union of the Fourth Roman Empire was short lived, it&amp;#39;s oppressive ways and failed leadership leading to its collapse. Now the remnants of the old union must once again unite under the flag of a liberal and free Roman Empire! We will invade, prosper and liberate! Let us conquer the world and create an intergalactic empire of glory![/color]
