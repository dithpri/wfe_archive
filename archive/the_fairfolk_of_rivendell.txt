We are the remnants of Lord Elrond&amp;#39;s army that stayed behind from the Undying Lands to lead the world into a new age. We are the supreme; the immortal. Only the best and greatest can join. We do not support betrayal or backstabbing of any sorts; only the elite are allowed. We support each other and discuss our standing on any given point, but majority rules.

Our leaders are as follows:
Supreme Overlord- [nation]North Turzakistan[/nation]
Ambassador- [nation]Blaze666[/nation]
Treasurer-[nation]Gomezaniaopolis[/nation]
Minister of Defense- [nation]Neonized Nation[/nation]
