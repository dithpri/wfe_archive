Welcome to Free Palestine, a region dedicated to the anti-colonial struggle of our Palestinian comrades, sisters and brothers facing Israeli apartheid (in Israel-proper) and both apartheid and occupation (in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip).

&#147;[i]Remember the solidarity shown to Palestine here and everywhere ... and remember also that [it] is a cause to which many people have committed themselves, difficulties and terrible obstacles notwithstanding. Why? Because it is a just cause, a noble ideal, a moral quest for equality and human rights.[/i]&#148; [b]~Edward Said[/b]
