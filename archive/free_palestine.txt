Welcome to Free Palestine, a region dedicated to the struggle against Zionism and Israeli apartheid.

&amp;#39;[i]Remember the solidarity shown to Palestine here and everywhere ... and remember also that there is a cause to which many people have committed themselves, difficulties and terrible obstacles notwithstanding. Why? Because it is a just cause, a noble ideal, a moral quest for equality and human rights[/i]&amp;#39;
