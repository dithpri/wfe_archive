[color=#ee7600][b]Rules[/b][/color]
[color=orange]We don&#39;t have many rules in place in our region except that you should try to not go overboard. Also, inactivity on the region (for 10 days) means kick so only join if you&#39;re truly into it. Your nation does not have to be German to join this region as it would be pretty uninteresting. This region is simply based in German.[/color]

[color=blue][b]Region Details:[/b][/color]
[color=#003366]The Deutscher Bund (German Confederation) mostly focuses around, obviously, the Germans. In the region, we do roleplay, discuss history, and more, all on the discord. If you&#39;d like to see the regional map, it is also on the discord.[/color]
