The Holy Land of Memes is a region that is focused on good memage. It was founded on October 2, 2015, with the intent of bringing good memes to Nationstates. Most of us are not active on the weekends, so anything that you need help with will be answered during the weekday.

Please endorse our delegate, Sneeder Deeder.
