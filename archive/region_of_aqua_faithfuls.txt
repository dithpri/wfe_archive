Aqua&#146;s Faithfuls can get things done. And because you can get things done, even if it doesn&#39;t go well, it&#39;s not your fault! It&#39;s society&#39;s fault that things don&#39;t work out!

You can run away from unpleasant things! That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve lost! Because, as they say, &quot;Sometimes running away is winning&quot;!

The answer you come to after being in doubt is usually something you&#39;ll regret, no matter what you choose! If you&#39;re going to regret it anyways, do whatever&#39;s easiest for you in the moment!

Do not fear growing old! Not even God knows whether or not you will be happy in the future, so you should, at least, be happy now!
