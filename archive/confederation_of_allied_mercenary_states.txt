The Confederation of Allied Mercenary States (ConAMS) is an international organization dedicated to providing a home and culture friendly to those who fight the wars of others. Each country is free to make their own decisions when it comes to war however in order to obtain official support from the free companies, contractors, or mercenaries of other member nations the conflict must be approved by me or another executive. Though you may choose your own economic system, weapons and equipment not currently in use by your forces will be considered a collective good shared between all member states.
