Welcome aboard [color=navy][b]The Hispaniola[/b][/color]!

We are a pirate ship, sailing across the waters of NationStates, plundering port after port, ship after ship. [b]Join us pirates (raiders) as we take over NationStates![/b] Here on [color=navy][b]The Hispaniola[/b][/color], we hold &quot;crewman of the week&quot; elections, and of course, we raid. [b]Our most loyal crew members will be promoted. We kindly ask that you change your nation&#39;s flag to one of these historical pirate flags: [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Roger#Historical_designs]Pirate Flags[/url] based on your promotion.[/b]
