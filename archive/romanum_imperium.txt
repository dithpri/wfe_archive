[Hr][hr][Color=scarlet][b]The&nbsp;Roman Empire was the post-Republican&nbsp;period of&nbsp;ancient Rome. As a&nbsp;polity&nbsp;it included large territorial holdings around the&nbsp;Mediterranean Sea&nbsp;in&nbsp;Europe,&nbsp;Northern Africa, and&nbsp;Western Asia&nbsp;ruled by&nbsp;emperors. From the&nbsp;accession of Caesar Augustus&nbsp;to the&nbsp;military anarchy of the 3rd century, it was a&nbsp;principate&nbsp;with&nbsp;Italy&nbsp;as&nbsp;metropole&nbsp;of the&nbsp;provinces&nbsp;and the city of&nbsp;Rome&nbsp;as sole capital (27 BC&nbsp;&#150; AD 286).[/b][/color][hr][hr]
