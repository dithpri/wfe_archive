Here, we stand. The insolent few. Those who would see the wheel of destiny unhinged and tumbling from its hub and all the cosmos plunged into oblivion, if it meant, but for a moment, that our will was truly our own.

If you would see the world unmade, the celestial order upset and overthrown, to seize a future uncertain, then stand here, with eyes wide-open, facing the winds of change and savour their biting chill.
