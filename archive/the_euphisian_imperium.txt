[U]Welcome to the Euphisian Imperium.[/u]
We are the twisted, infernal beings that inhabit your nightmares. We are the purifiers of this world, the harbingers of darkness. We caste a shadow upon the land. We darken the skies with smoke from your burning cities, and soak the ground in the blood of your children. Our banner will rise up above the ruins of your nation, and your people will kneel before the Kzar.
