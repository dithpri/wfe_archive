[B][U]Welcome to the Euphisian Imperium.[/u][/b]
We are the Imperium, the most feared conquerors of all time. We lay waste to entire Empires, we are the harbingers of darkness. We ravage the land, blacken the sky with the smoke of your burning cities, and enslave your people. Our banner will rise over every corner of this world.
