The Land of The Farquhars was founded when the Rouge Nations of New San Marino gathered other oppressed lands in the surrounding regoins and created a pact. It states that all lands undeserving of the harsh dictatorship of The Wuench would team together and fight for independence. Although the nations did not form one large body after revolution, they created a strong regional alliance named after its creator, Farquhar. The nation now presides freely without the looming oppression of The Wuench and are free to govern their country&amp;#39;s body as they choose.
