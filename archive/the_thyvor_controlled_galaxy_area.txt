[b][color=gray]Welcome to the official page of the [/color][color=lime]Thyvor Controlled Galaxy Area[/color]![/b]
Here you can find useful links, favourites of the nation, and refined Region Cencus reports, all displayed in a neat and useful fashion for the nations of the Thyvor System&amp;#39;s region! We naturally encourage you to endorse our founders, the [color=green]Supreme Council of [/color][nation=short+noflag]Thyvor[/nation], however it is of course optional, and being a very left-wing region, with socialist founders, we encourage you to show respect and equality towards everybody inside the Region, and outside of the Region. So be nice in NationStates, and most importantly, have fun! It&amp;#39;s important that you enjoy the experience in Thyvor so that you stay active!
