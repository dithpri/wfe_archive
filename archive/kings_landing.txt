[b]King&#39;s Landing[/b] is the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, located in the crownlands on the east coast of Westeros. It is situated along the kingsroad at the mouth of the Blackwater Rush and overlooks Blackwater Bay. King&#39;s Landing is the site of the Iron Throne and the Red Keep, which is the seat of the king.

The main city is surrounded by a wall, manned by the City Watch of King&#39;s Landing, also known as the gold cloaks. King&#39;s Landing is the most populous city in Westeros, but unsightly and dirty compared to other cities.  The stench of the city&#39;s waste can be smelled far beyond its walls. --[color=663333]King&#39;s Landing/A Wiki of Ice and Fire[/color][hr]
