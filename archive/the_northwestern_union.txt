The Northwestern Union focuses on freedom and democracy throughout its nations. We do not invade nations, but will work to build up a strong military to destroy those who attempt to invade other nations within the Entente. This is an independently founded Coalition meaning that the nations who join initially will have large amounts of say on internal issues. The Entente believes in strong civil rights and political freedom. The geography of the northwestern region is rocky, cool, rainy, woodland. This region is a shield for the defense of freedom, and fights against tyranny and imperialism.
