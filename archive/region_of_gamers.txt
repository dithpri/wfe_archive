We are the Region of Gamers, we are an expansive kickstarter region, feel free to join our group to rival other regions. You are free to have any government, as long as you abide by Nationstates etiquette, as well as endorsing limits

Endorse Campestris, and consult to our officers for any inquiries

The only rule is that all nation names must be a Latin word. You can rename the nation to a Latin word of your choosing

And you must make your own flag, no real ones!
