 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying:2  &#147;The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the seat of Moses.3  Therefore, all the things they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say but they do not practice what they say.a4  They bind up heavy loads and put them on the shoulders of men,b but they themselves are not willing to budge them with their finger.c5  Neither be called leaders, for your Leader is one, the Christ.j11  But the greatest one among you must be your minister.k12  Whoever exalts himself will be humbled,l and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.m
