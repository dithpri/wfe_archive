The UNFA is a collection of sovereign states across Gemini Terrarium ( officially known as Alternate Strangereal ). Comprised of six nations across the world, the UNFA&#39;s objectives are about ensuring Military, Economic, Scientific and Human Development across the world, if not the entire multiverse in nationstates.

Bear in mind of everything happened in the UNFA and your nations as well. Good luck leaders.
