An army runs on its stomach, national culture and identity often transcends political reality by way of its food or gastronomic heritage and conquests. Even a vanishing kingdom may colonize more of the world without a great navy or army. 

Gastronomy is dedicated to celebrating conquest by good food. Join in the celebration and conquer with the persuasion of your hunger satiating abilities.
