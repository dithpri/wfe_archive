[color=pink][b]This region has been overrun by cute rats![/b][/color]
[color=grey]Well, it wasn&#39;t a forceful one, we just marched up to them and they handed control to us. Those ruling humans in [nation]Riceplace Founder[/nation] are kind of nice. Also, the wires on their ISS tasted nice, but they said we shouldn&#39;t eat them. So we didn&#39;t.
Also, we&#39;ve been in this region since 1974, so it&#39;s not an invasion. Just one gentle push and they let us have the time of our lives![/color]
