Welcome to Riceplace, the place we serve you rice, then tax it as much as we &quot;see fit&quot; while you are eating. 
To order, go to [nation]Riceplace Counter[/nation] and select from our selection of whatever we feel like cooking at this hour! (Don&#39;t telegram, it won&#39;t answer) 
There might be card fragments due to the rice being cooked in the same facility as a card farm. We recommend eating it anyway.

For any card-related issues, telegram [nation]Qawe[/nation].
