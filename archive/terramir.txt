Welcome to Terramir. Enjoy your stay!

Terramir is a celestial world located in the far reaches of the NS universe. We&#39;re a modern, closed-world region with a myriad of various cultures, societies, and political entities. One of the things that make us unique is the fact that in this world, European and East Asian societies came in tandem to create a Christian/Confucian-dominated paradigm.
