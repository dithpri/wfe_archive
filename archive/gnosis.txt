If those who lead you say to you: &#145;Look, the Kingdom is in the sky!&#146;
then the birds of the sky will precede you.
If they say to you: &#145;It is in the sea,&#146; then the fishes will precede you.
Rather, the Kingdom is inside of you, and outside of you.
When you come to know yourselves, then you will be known,
and you will realize that you are the children of the living Father.
But if you do not come to know yourselves, then you exist in poverty, and you are poverty.

There is nothing hidden that will not become revealed.
There is nothing covered that will remain undisclosed.

I will choose you, one from a thousand and two from ten thousand,
and they will stand as a single One.
