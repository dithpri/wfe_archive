This is the New Jedi Council. Anybody can join, and take part in the Star Wars themed roleplaying. Upon joining, a new member is granted the title of Jedi Padawan. Then, after 2 weeks, they are granted the position of Jedi Knight. Finally, after 6 months, they become a Jedi Master, and are admitted to the Jedi Council, where we discuss important issues within our order. If you have any questions, ask the Jedi Master who is the leader of the Council at the present time.
