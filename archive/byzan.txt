[b]The Free Region of Byzan[/b]

Byzan is a small region focused upon allowing its individual nations to operate as they see fit. Individual nations are encouraged to support maximum freedom for their people, but the region has a minimalist regional government to allow for maximum sovereignty among individual nations states.

This small region believes in individual sovereignty and is always looking for more members. Interested in joining? Send us a message and we will tell you more.
