The Isle de Skenpor is a chain of islands that is populated only by small tribes scattered throughout the islands. The Kingdom of Por is the only modern nation in the island chain, which is slowly taking over the island chain.

The Skenpor tribes are masters of guerrilla warfare, which has kept most invaders at bay. The Diistak of Por are not deterred by this because they too are natives the Isle de Skenpor.
