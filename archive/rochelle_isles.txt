A cluster of relatively small islands located beneath the Great Skysea of Plystaw.

I like the idea Boria-Augen went with when s/he still lived in Corden Valley, changing currency to a regional one. So why don&amp;#39;t we change ours into the Rochelle Silver or maybe something better sounding if we have any suggestions?

Boria&amp;#39;s friend Koluk will be creating the region Great Skysea of Plystaw and we&amp;#39;ll have an embassy with her/him soon.
