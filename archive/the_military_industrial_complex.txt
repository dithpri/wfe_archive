Welcome to the Nations and Federative Unions of the Military Industrial Complex. The name of the region does not escape the controversy that is attached to its regional name designation. We seek to introduce political, economic, and social changes of vast proportions across the whole of the Nation-States community. We stand by the principles of integrity, transparency, austerity, sincerity, and devotion to selfless duty. Contrary to what many believe, the employment of military force is utilized as a measure of deterrence, defense, and humanitarian intervention. We seek to introduce a system that empowers the potential of humanity through international law in an effort to truly create a humanly expressive new order for mankind.
