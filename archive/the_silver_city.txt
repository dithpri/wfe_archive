&quot;Often called the Silver City or the Eternal City this is what most people come to think of as Heaven. It is a vast metropolis of mortal souls and angels. It&#39;s an ideal city with broad avenues and no traffic. Like the earthly Jerusalem once was the Silver City is walled surrounded by blocks of semi-precious stones. No one expects them to keep out infernal forces they are symbolic walls and will dissipate when the forces of Hell are finally defeated.&quot;
