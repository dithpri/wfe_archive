Welcome to [region]United Multiverse[/region]. This region is an experiment in an anarchy. There is no government, no control over who becomes the World Assembly, and to the maximum extent possible, no rules.

[b]The one exception is that this region is not to be used in any way that would be advantageous to raiders.[/b] This is why I unfortunately cannot grant the delegate executive authority.

Our RMB is open to all residents of embassy regions, and we will accept all embassies within reason

This region is maintained by six puppets of [nation]Flying Eagles[/nation], a proud member of [region]10000 Islands[/region].
