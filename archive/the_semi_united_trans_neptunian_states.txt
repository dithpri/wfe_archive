To who it may concern, This message comes from the founder of these humble states, [nation]Felstode[/nation]. After the majority of our citizens left to Antarctica due to the crash from Mars we needed to find a new home. Dictators rose and fell as we toiled away in the fields, but then, calling to us like once happening to us long ago, we yearned to venture to the stars. Using starter capital from a now dead empire we got to the Kuiper belt, only to be followed by long forgotten enemies. War broke out and soon subsided, the now war ravened asteroid belt has united (At least sort of) into states.
