I am Hari Seldon.

[hr][color=red]From now on, the path you must take is inevitable. You will be faced with a series of crises, as you are now faced with the first, and in each case your freedom of action will become similarly circumscribed so that you will be forced along one, and only one, path. It is that path which our psychology has worked out  and for a reason.

Galactic civilization has stagnated and declined, though only a few ever realized that. But now, at last, the Periphery is breaking away. This marks the Fall of the Galactic Empire.

But whatever devious course your future history may take, impress it always upon your descendants that the path has been marked out, and that at its end is new and greater Empire![/color]
