I am Hari Seldon.

I can&#39;t see you, you know, so I can&#39;t greet you properly. I don&#39;t even know how many of you there are, so all this must be conducted informally. If any of you are standing, please sit down; and if you care to smoke, I wouldn&#39;t mind. Why should I? I&#39;m not really here.

The neighboring Regions, in manpower and resources are still overwhelmingly powerful as compared to yourselves. Outside them lies the vast tangled jungle of barbarism that extends around the entire breadth of the Galaxy. Within that rim there is still what is left of the Galactic Empire &#150; and that, weakened and decaying though it is, is still incomparably mighty.

You see, then, that you are faced by hard necessity, and that action is forced on you.
