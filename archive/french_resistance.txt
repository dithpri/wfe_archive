[color=blue][i]The French Resistance is a resistance movement that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy r&eacute;gime during World War II. R&eacute;sistance cells were small groups of armed men and women, who in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines. The men and women of the R&eacute;sistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society, including &eacute;migr&eacute;s; conservative Roman Catholics, including priests; and citizens from the ranks of liberals, anarchists, and communists.[/i][/color]
