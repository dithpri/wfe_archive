[b]City 17 is a place of inactivity, where nothing tends to flourish. We have such great sights like the jungles of [nation]Hircum Populus[/nation], the slave factories of [nation]Steger Corp[/nation], and the man-made islands of [nation]Isles of Geb[/nation]! Visiting us is not recommended. Join us, and flourish in nothingness![/b]
