This region is located somewhere in the Midwest of North America. We&#39;re cool and swag. TCOLV is here, and if that isn&#39;t enticing then we don&#39;t want you anyway. Just kidding, PLEASE join us. Have you ever tried to make the midwest interesting? If you haven&#39;t, then you don&#39;t understand what an impossible task this is. Current average snowfall, 68 inches a year. Every Thursday we worship the great orange bouncing ball. If you&#39;re into anything else, we really don&#39;t care. Likes: 4-day school week. Dislikes: Skutt, Blair, Roncalli, Gretna... pretty much everyone.
