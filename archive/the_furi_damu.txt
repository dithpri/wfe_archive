Following the downfall of The Black Raiders, Fearless Leader, Supreme Overlord of The Heavy Metal Dominion of Fukafia has announced the re-founding of The Furi Damu, the once powerful coalition of nations which Fukafia founded and led through the dark period of time between 2007 and 2010.

The Furi Damu was founded with the following goals in mind:

Economic, military, and ultimately world domination. Towards that end, Fearless Leader has revived The Furi Damu.

The Furi Damu is currently desolate of partnership nations.
