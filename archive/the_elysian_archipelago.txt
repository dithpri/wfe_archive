The Elysian Archipelago is a very large island chain. The central-most island, Elysium, is roughly 400,000 square kilometers in size, and is situated on a threshold of several different climate types. Elysium is surrounded by over 200 different islands larger than 1 square kilometer.

While not initially very populous, the island chain has since become more prominent, thanks to a surge in immigration and the creation of states from refugee populations, among other issues.
