Cold, windy, and bleak, The Steppes of Gehenna are nonetheless home to a surprisingly diverse landscape and a sprawling, prosperous nation nestled in a remote mountain valley.  Rolling grasslands rustle gently in the constant breeze, broken by towering evergreen forests and eventually giving way to craggy mountains and upland plateaus.  Wildlife abounds, as the nation of Blargensteintwo has a vested interest in preserving its natural resources; salmon and steelhead teem in the rivers while vast herds of cervids roam the lands, hunted by great cats and packs of large, fearless wolves.
