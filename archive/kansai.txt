Welcome. Kansai is a place for everyone. Anyone is allowed to stay under one circumstance: the only times violence and harshness are allowed is during roleplays and heated debates. Other than that, keep a positive attitude and just enjoy each other&#39;s company. We&#39;re all friends here! (Also please limit religious preferences to private telegrams. thank you.)
