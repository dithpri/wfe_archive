The Sky Isles; mesmerizing, inspiring, and utterly beautiful. Due to gravitational anomalies in a post-apocalyptic earth, mountains free themselves from the chains of terra firma and form islands in the sky. Havens for life, animals and humans alike have migrated to these floating islands to make their homes above the volcanic landscape below. City states form from the wreckages of former empires, where defending aerial space has become as important as any nation-building task. Join us and place your city-nation in the halls of empires!
