[B][color=magenta]I don&amp;#39;t know about you
But I&amp;#39;m feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don&amp;#39;t know about me
But I&amp;#39;ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we&amp;#39;re
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh[/color]
