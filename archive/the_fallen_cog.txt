To all tinkerers, mechanics, and scientist, Come to The Fallen Cog. To all machinists and industrialists, come to The Fallen Cog. Bring us your metal, your industry, and your intellect. For we may be fallen but we shall build our way to glory. Diligence, patience, ambition. Let these words guide your path. For we shall not stutter, we shall not halt, we shall not break. We are the future and the future whirs and clicks into place like clockwork.
