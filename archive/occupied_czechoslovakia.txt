[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Transferred control: 18.03.23[/I]

This region was originally a territory of [region]The Nazi Reich[/region]. It was refounded, reformed, changed and was put under the control of [nation]Klorgia1[/nation]. We continue to stand against fascism in all its forms. 

[hr]Leading members of Vlajka, the Sudeten German Party, the Czech Workers&#39; Party, the Slovak People&#39;s Party, the Slovak National Party, and the Nazi-Slovak Republic and similar organizations have been detained and await charges. Miroslav Sl&aacute;dek has been detained for calls to violence, but the future of his movement, and all which seek to deride, dwindle and destroy the rights of any for immoral &#39;gains&#39; now rests to us. Let the work which has been done not be left to rot.
