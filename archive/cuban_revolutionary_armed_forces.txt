[b][color=#45395b]HAPPY RAIDERCON 2024!!![/color]

To celebrate this truly momentous occasion, [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=notanam]Nota[/url] decided to take everyone on a trivia raid. It sorta went off the rails, but everyone had a good time, so what does it matter.

Also they&#39;d like to congradulate Robin for making it into Tsinghua university after their impressive run on the Gaokao section of the trivia. Congrats Robin!
