This region has little time left. Winter is coming. 

We&#39;re no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking of
You wouldn&#39;t get this from any other guy
I just want to tell you how I&#39;m feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
