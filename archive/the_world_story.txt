[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] noticed that the world had been affected by a huge [i][color=red]disaster[/color][/i] for the last day or so! They weren&#39;t [i]quite[/i] sure what was wrong, but the regions of the world seemed [color=blue]frozen in place[/color] - nations moved in and out of the regions, but they were very slow to respond to these changes. It was as if the world [color=grey]stopped moving[/color] for a couple of hours. However, as it turned out, they had nothing to worry about, as the world went back to normal just in time for the Hawks to terrorize a great deal of innocent regions and their native inhabitants.
