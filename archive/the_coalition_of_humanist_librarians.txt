This coalition is founded on the principle of intelligent yet polite debate. We encourage free thinking and feel the only evil in the world is willful ignorance. Within the borders of this region the only pressures upon you will be your own moral code, though this will need to stand up to the debate of your peers. We do not seek to rule or gain power, only to experience the delightful variance that comes through a diverse population. So please, come and discuss your views.
