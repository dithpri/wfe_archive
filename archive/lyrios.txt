Welcome to [color=purple][b]Lyrios[/b][/color]! We are a [b][color=#FF0000]Worldbuilding[/color][/b] and [b][color=gold]Roleplaying region[/color][/b]. Lyrios is a region built on the ideas or Realistic Roleplay and Worldbuilding. We plan on growing an open, nice, and healthy community. Feel free to join and apply for a spot on the map and the ability to participate in roleplay and worldbuilding!

All our worldbuilding and roleplay is to be done on the [color=green][b]Nationstates website[/b][/color], with the exception of our offsite chat being on discord, so please feel free to check out other people&#39;s factbooks, they have all the lore you need to know about our wonderful world!
