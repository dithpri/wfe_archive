The Distrbutist Homeschool League (DHL) was founded by a massive series of Home-school Co-ops to ensure a cooperative large enough to allow effective isolation. Not interested in production or expansion, these pacifist but defensive home-schoolers were searching for an example of a successful Distributist paradise, and decided to make one themselves.

This League of Nations excludes any modernists, &quot;liberals,&quot; or public-schoolers.

DHL does not condone offensive military measures or globalisation.
