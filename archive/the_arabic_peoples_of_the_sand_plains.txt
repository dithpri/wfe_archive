[color=red]The sand plains was discovered in 6900BCE by a young egg, while the Arabic Peoples of the Sand Plains was founded later in 4200BC by the Yolks of Eggotopolis. This new region was then invaded and burnt to the ground by a rivaling region of David&#39;s Wang. Soon after a sandstorm, Shedinja surviving with its edgy safety goggles, buried its inhabitants, the Arabic Peoples of the Sand Plains was rediscovered in 69BCE when a traveler named Ash Ketchum, who had taken the elixir of youthfulness when he was ten, uncovered the lost city of Egg. The region was then populated by neighbouring countries between 69BCE and 420CE. The original nations were New Eggistan, The People&#39;s Republic of George Goulmy and Kinky Land[/color]. Mr Wood is the current ruler.
