Pyandonea is a small little region where we favor a tight-knit community over a structured government. Whether you&amp;#39;re drifting aimlessly or just need somewhere to crash, we&amp;#39;re here for you. If you decide to stay, you can become an active part of our community by posting on the RMB and helping to make Pyandonea a vibrant place. Furthermore, you can claim a spot on our nifty regional map, located [url=http://imgur.com/Y0hODKV]here.[/url]

For the security of our region, endorse Delegate [nation=short]Bodobol[/nation].[/b]
