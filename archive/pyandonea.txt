In Pyandonea, we favor a tight-knit, close community rather than a structured government system. The voices of all are equal here, and none are turned away or shunned. Whether you need a land to make your home, or a simple place to crash until you find a more permanent settlement, Pyandonea&amp;#39;s doors stand open, awaiting all who wish to enter.
