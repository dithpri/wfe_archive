[b]Welcome to Pyandonea!

[color=#B50706]Vos Iacobites per nomine or&aacute;culis![/color][hr][/b]

In Pyandonea, we favor a tight-knit, close community rather than a structured government system. The voices of all are equal here, and none are turned away or shunned. Whether you need a land to make your home, or a simple place to crash until you find a more permanent settlement, Pyandonea&amp;#39;s doors stand open, awaiting all who wish to enter.

[b][color=#4B0082]Please endorse King [nation=short]Fezkovia[/nation] and Governor [nation=short]Bodobol[/nation] for the security of our region![/b][/color][hr]
