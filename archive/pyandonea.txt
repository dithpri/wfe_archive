[b]Welcome to Pyandonea!

[color=#B50706]Wolof![/color][hr]

[color=darkgreen]We&amp;#39;re back! After a long bout of inactivity, we are getting back into action. 

In Pyandonea, we favor a tight-knit, close community rather than a structured government system. The voices of all are equal here, and none are turned away or shunned. Whether you need a land to make your home, or a simple place to crash until you find a more permanent settlement, Pyandonea&amp;#39;s doors stand open, awaiting all who wish to enter.

If you have any suggestions for an RP, message it to Fezkovia, he&amp;#39;d love to hear about it.[/color]
