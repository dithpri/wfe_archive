[color=#B50706]News Alert: Zombie Virus infecting thousands in large regions; Pyandonea safe so far.[/color][hr]

[color=darkgreen]In Pyandonea, we favor a tight-knit, close community rather than a structured government system. The voices of all are equal here, and none are turned away or shunned. Whether you need a land to make your home, or a simple place to crash until you find a more permanent settlement, Pyandonea&amp;#39;s doors stand open, awaiting all who wish to enter.[/color]

[color=#4B0082]Please endorse Governor [nation=short]Port Merforian[/nation] for the security of our region![/b][/color][hr]
