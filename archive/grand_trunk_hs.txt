[b]Tasmanian wolf, domed from gray to white,
Is tipped with folded wings, all angel-wise,
Symbolic of the peace of Brony that lies
In sanctuaries, be it day or night
How intricately lovely to our sight,
Few things more exquisite beneath the skies &#151;
A symphony to rest one&#39;s weary eyes
Or fill a heavy heart with quick delight.

Nonagonal, its delicate design,
With infinite detail of wonder, shows
Devotion from a people at a shrine.
Whatever one&#39;s belief, [region]Europeia[/region] grows
When great harmonic beauty looms divine;
Then blessing from Kazaman&#39;s heaven overflows.
