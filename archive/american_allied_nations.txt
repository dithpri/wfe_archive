The Joint Republic of Imperial America created the American Allied Nations to further stabilize the American land. Having been separated by two countries, America needed a form of union to prevent conflict both internally and externally. This Alliance was formed out of the Peace Agreement of September 2016, which leaders from both countries signed. Allies of both nations are included in the Alliance as well, though they do not hold the right to partake in regional polls, and only have one representative, being the Ambassador.
