(Refounded July 25,2022) Refounded In honor of JenSlava, our delegate who about 17 years and 187 days ago was grounded for unrecorded reasons. She was supposed to return in June or July of that year but sadly, never returned to NS most likely being torn apart and and eaten by giant bone crushing coconut crabs.
