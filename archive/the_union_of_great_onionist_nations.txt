We are the last great stronghold against Capitalism and Imperialism and the Glourious Union of Onionists. Members are urged to be Socialist and to join the WA and doing so will give you a better rank. 

We are a Semi-Democratic Union and have elections every two months or three positions, but the founder is always supreme and the lower positions are assigned by the founder, (Of The Glorious Soviet Onion).

Capitalist nations are not permitted to run in the elections and extreme Capitalist nations (Capitalist Paridise, Capalizt, Corparate Police State, Right-Wing Paridise, Compulsory Consumerist State) are not permitted to vote.

Sovetsky Luk Navsegda!
