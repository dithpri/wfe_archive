We are the last great stronghold against Capitalism and Imperialism and the Glourious Union of Onionists. Members are urged to be Socialist and to join the WA and doing so will give you a better rank.

History - The Union Of Great Onionist Nations was founded in 1920 by escaped political rivals expelled by King Emson of the Kingdom of Swiz. King Emson was a tyrant and a dirty capitalist and quashed all Onionist and Communist/Socialist groups and labelled them as dangerous &quot;Gangs&quot;.
