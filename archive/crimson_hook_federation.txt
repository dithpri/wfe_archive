The Crimson Hook Federation is a region and allegiance located near the infamous Crimson Hook Mountain, made up of Nations seeking to appease the ancient beings located in Crimson Hook Mountain, no matter the cost. We accept nations of (almost) all ideologies and backgrounds, with only one linking thread connecting us together: We fear the old gods and their return, and will not hesitate to be on their side when THE time comes.

World Assembly member nations are encouraged to endorse our delegate, [nation]The Newest of Virginia[/nation].

We do not accept Fascist/Far-Right nations, and if we somehow let one into our region, please alert us so we can kick them.
