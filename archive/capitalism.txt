This is the region named after the economic system most of the world is using to commit suicide with.

Within a capitalist system there is no democracy. Democracy means that the central institutions of society 
are under popular control. Capitalism precludes democracy, by definition; capitalism is a system in which 
the central institutions of society are under corporate control. 

Plenty folks think capitalism is cool...until they wake up one day with its fangs in their throat.
