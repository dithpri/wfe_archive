Under capitalism democracy is impossible, by definition. Capitalism mandates that the central institutions of society be under the control of immoral oligarchs. 
Until the major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities, it&amp;#39;s pointless to talk about democracy.

Under capitalism, the &amp;quot;free market&amp;quot; system is mandatory for the general population. The poor and working families with needy children are sternly lectured on the virtue of hard work and self-reliance, but the rules are different for the wealthy investor class. For them, the corporate welfare state must flourish.
