[b]Capitalism is a disease that plagues humanity and produces misery, sickness, inequality, poverty, injustice and death. 
Socialism is the vaccine that stops capitalism from infecting and killing us, our communities, and the Earth.
Tragically, the people have been taught since childhood to fear the cure.[hr][hr] [i]&quot;There is no reason to accept doctrines crafted to sustain power and privilege, 
or to believe that  we are constrained by mysterious and unknown social laws. These 
are simply decisions made within institutions that are subject to human will and must 
face the test of legitimacy. And if they do not &amp;#8232;meet the test, they can be replaced by 
other institutions that are more free and more just, as has &amp;#8232;happened often in the past.&quot;
