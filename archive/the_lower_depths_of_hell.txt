This was the name given to a region of land that happens to be on a vast island surrounded by dozens of active volcanoes. Although the outer rim of the island looks inhospitable, the inner island has fertile soil allowing for crops to not only thrive, but carry properties that makes local consumers resistant to heat and fire.
