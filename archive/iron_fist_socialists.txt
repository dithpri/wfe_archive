[color=#800000]Welcome to the Union of Iron Fist Socialists.[/color]
Citizens are ruled with an iron fist by the socialist government, which grants its people the freedom to do whatever they like...
so long as it doesn&#39;t involve getting richer than anybody else or challenging the government.[hr]&quot;We have no compassion and we ask no compassion from you. When our turn comes, we shall not make excuses for the terror.&quot; - Karl Marx, Suppression of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung
