[b]A large, abandoned building in the Middle of Nowhere. One [i][u]t[/u][/i]hat feels so alive, yet s[i][u]o[/u][/i] dead.[/b]
[b]Most who enter, will ne[u][i]v[/i][/u]er get to tell the tales of what th[i][u]i[/u][/i]s place once was. Yo[u][i]u[/i][/u]ng and old, not one person 
re[i][u]m[/u][/i]embers the building&#39;s existence. Those who get to tell its story, [u][i]a[/i][/u]re never seen agai[u][i]n[/i][/u].

Only those who ha[u][i]d[/i][/u] resided here, know the building&#39;s former glory once was, and [i]Always Will Be.[/i][/b]
