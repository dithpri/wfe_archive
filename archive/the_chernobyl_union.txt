Condemn this Libertatem.

When revolutionary forces swept [region]UCR[/region] and turned the region into one of education the capitalist rats of the region fled here. Later with the betrayal of the UCR founder the capitalist roadsters returned to the region and shut it down. 

This region has now been occupied by [region]North Korea[/region] and The [region]Korean Peoples Army[/region] in memory of what the region could have been had it never been waylaid by the forces of reaction. Also as a testament to the inevitable betrayal of libertarian &amp;quot;socialists&amp;quot; to the socialist cause.
