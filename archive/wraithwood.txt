[b]Welcome to [color=darkgreen]Wraithwood[/color][/b]

A far and distant continent, Wraithwood is named for the dark forests that are home to a multitude of myths, legends, and folklore. Wraithwood is almost a world unto itself and home to a mosaic of people and cultures, from civilized metropolises to sparse wastes, kings to communists, and democracies to dictatorships. Where does your nation stand?

Wraithwood is currently populated by puppets for the sake of creating a basic canon to lay a regional foundation. Send [nation]Ventalia[/nation] a telegram with any inquiries.
