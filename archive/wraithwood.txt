A far and distant continent, Wraithwood is named for its dark forests that are home to a multitude of myths, legend, and folklore. Wraithwood is almost a world unto itself and home to a mosaic of people and cultures, from civilized metropolises to sparse wastes, kings to communists, and democracies to dictatorships. Where does your nation stand?

Wraithwood is currently a populated by puppets for the sake of creating a basic canon to lay a regional foundation. Other players may join by simply sending [nation]Ventalia[/nation] a telegram.
