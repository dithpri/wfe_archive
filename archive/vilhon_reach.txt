The Vilhon Reach was a region named after a body of water called the Vilhon Reach, a part of the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Through its many port cities, the Vilhon Reach was established as an essential trade center between the cities of the southern bodies of water, the Lake of Steam, the Shining Sea, and the many kingdoms and city-states around the inner sea of the continent, the Sea of Fallen Stars.

After the Spellplague the great body of water known as the Vilhon Reach was no more and had splintered into several small lakes.
