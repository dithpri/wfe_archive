They started as 3 Adored generals/ Leaders. They were the best at what they did. Veterans United AKA &amp;quot; Turnursha&amp;quot; was a great holy empire. He kept the regions safe from any attacks that fell on to his regions and his nation. While defending the region a red light flew out of the sky and landed on him. It was a person. The Star Eater AKA &amp;quot;Greater Wei&amp;quot; fell out of the sky after eating too many stars and falling a sleep. Even though no one knew why he eats stars or how we both survived the crash, he was still a great addition to the region. keeping an eye out for any attackers that felt brave. the last one is an idiot.
