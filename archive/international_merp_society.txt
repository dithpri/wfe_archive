Merps are creatures created by like-minded friends who (apparently had nothing better to do) wanted to find a way to express their creativity. Merps come in many varieties, including the standard one, Meep, which appears in the flag. IMS stands for International Merp Society, although probably not yet international, but these friends hope to bring these merps to their full potential one day.
