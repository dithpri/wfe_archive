[b]Release the world from tyranny!
[/b]Deep in Central America lies Theramia, a country with strange environment. An unexplained genetic mutation resides in the grass, trees, and other plants that make them grow pitch black(and dark purple) this has resulted in the area being nicknamed the infamous &quot;Black Savannah.&quot;After seceding from the mainland, Western Theram is among the several small nations that have organized in this region, adopting the name as a region of anarchy and freedom.
[b]Welcome to the allied communes of the Black Savannah, home of revolutionary thought.
I encourage you to endorse [nation]Western Theram[/nation] and your fellow comrades in the region[/b]
