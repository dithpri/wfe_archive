The Red Iron Pact is a militant socialist-communist bloc where state-controlled mega-corporations, lifelong military service, and merit-based socialism drive society. Free speech is allowed but regulated, religion is private, and industrial supremacy is the ultimate goal. The Pact enforces strict labor policies, total surveillance, and collective defense to resist capitalist influence and secure dominance in the Toldian Steppe. Efficiency, loyalty, and strength define its future.
