The New Atlantic is a growing group of countries who want to work together to achieve further social equality and further economic progression. We want to ensure that every single soul in this union is treated fairly and equally and that they are free from oppression. This is why any countries that have low political freedoms and low civil rights will be rejected.

We proudly put forward ideologies of [b]social progressivism[/b] and [b]internationalism[/b] (whilst still respecting member countries&#39; right to national identity) to ensure development is consistently at its finest.

- Alana Escuella, President of Vandaysia and President of The New Atlantic
