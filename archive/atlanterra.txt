In the year 20XX, a volcanic eruption caused a large mass of land to spring up in the Atlantic Ocean between South America and Africa. After many years of being uninhabitable, foliage and wildlife were discovered on the land, and people came to the lands. Now the land is plentiful with beautiful beaches, tropical rainforests, and excellent weather.
