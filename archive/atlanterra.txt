In the year 20XX, a land mass was discovered to exist in the Atlantic Ocean between South America and Africa. When scientists from Brazil, England, the U.S., and Guyana went to explore the island, they found that there were already natives on the island who had supposedly been there for centuries. They also found that there were plants and animals on the island, some of which were thought to be extinct. Now the landmass of Atlanterra is a great place to find natural resources like water, oil, trees, and precious metals. Come to Atlanterra to see the beauty of the lands yourself!
