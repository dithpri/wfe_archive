Welcome to Boon Lay! We are a casual and relaxed region perfect for chatting and discussing world news, but also have a modern-tech RP and regional government. If you are new to NS, a returning player, or simply someone who wants to try out an uncrowded region, then this place is for you!

While we are Singapore-themed, we aren&#39;t necessarily a Singaporean region. Nations of all kinds are allowed, though of course spammers and alt-rights are prohibited. And no smoking!
