Split off from [region]Latin Oceania[/region] following a raid by [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. Segregated, but not defeated, Better Latin Oceania upholds the same values as before chaos engulfed it. 

Strict border control means that no region with any allied or friendly relation with known raiders is permitted into [region]Better Latin Oceania[/region].
