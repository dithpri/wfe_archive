[b][i]Seven Pillars of The Radiant[/b][/i]
If my neighbor is starving, I am impoverished.
Keep the land forever green, the oceans forever blue.
Welcome the unknown with love, teach them our ways.
Do not gamble with your possessions, stay on the path.
Help those in need, it is a sin to help those that will not help themselves. 
Forgiveness shall be accepted, use it to find truth and take away your sins. 
Accept the Radiant and you shall be guided to a better tomorrow
