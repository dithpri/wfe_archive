Welcome to the Caribbean Region!

Lush forests, white sand people, beautiful tan people, and the tropical spirit are alive and well in the Caribbean Region.

We welcome any and all communists, socialists, fascist, and/or dictators who want their very own island paradise.

We are friendly, opportunistic, and not always the most rational. If you&amp;#39;re looking for fun, oppressive, and friendly gameplay look no further. Pull up a seat, grab a cigar, sip some rum, and enjoy ruling your little piece of paradise.
