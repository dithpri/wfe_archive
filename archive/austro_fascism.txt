[color=red]Austro-fascism (German: Austrofaschismus) was the authoritarian rule installed in Austria with the May Constitution of 1934. It was based on a ruling party, the Fatherland Front (Vaterl&auml;ndische Front) and the Heimwehr (Home Guard) paramilitary militia. Leaders were Engelbert Dollfuss and, after Dollfuss&#39;s assassination, Kurt Schuschnigg, who were previously politicians of the Christian Social Party, which was quickly integrated into the new movement.[/color]
