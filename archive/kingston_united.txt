We are a region united with the doctrine of diplomacy towards all and deference towards none. We believe in inclusion and the right to denounce what we see as tyranny on the international stage. We believe in a world where justice will be served by the meek, the humble, and the righteous. We will call out those who commit acts of cruelty upon their citizens. We strive to be the world&#39;s next global police force, and we believe in inclusion of all those wishing to join us in our rally for justice and supreme moral kindness to all. Furthermore, we believe that an affront towards the earth and the environment is tantamount to a violation of basic principles of justice, and we strive to be the most environmentally activist region on earth.
