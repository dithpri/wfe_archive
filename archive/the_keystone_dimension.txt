An eternity has passed...
   Fleeting dreams fade into the distance...
   Another place, another time.
   Come across another reality,
   Time, which has been divided,
   will be unified again now.

We alone do not have the power
   to heal the world&amp;#39;s woes,
   or to solve all its mysteries.
   deciding our own FATE is our new freedom.
