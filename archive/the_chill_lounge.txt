While the Region is starting up, the offices detailed in our [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=ayllandia/detail=factbook/id=1058615]constitution[/url] will not be working as detailed. Once the region reaches a certain level, the rules will go to what is written. 

Before that:

[list][*] Offices will not all be occupied, due to a lower amount of citizens.

[*] Senatorial and Judge Offices will be given away without election. First come, first served. 

[*] The Presidential election will take place the day of the official opening of the region.

[*] Requirements for Offices will we waived until the elections of the third presidential term.

Have fun in our region!
