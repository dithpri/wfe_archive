The regional currency is the [color=#cc5200][i]Tyrusian credit[/i][/color], it is optional to members, but officer holders [b]MUST[/b] use it or resign. 

Spamming the message board with anything that is aimed to provoke other members or certain ethnic groups, will result in a warning, and all violating posts will be suppressed.

Kicking or banning anyone from the region without very good reason or permission will result in a loss of office, either permanently or temporarily. 

2 warnings = office removed
3 warnings = kicked
4 warnings = banned


Leave a message on the message board stating what you want your office to be called.
