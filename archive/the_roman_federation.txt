The Roman Federation is a Region of empire based nations, determined to provide a complete, interactive RP. Such RP&#39;s consist of a map in which the RP will be based off of. NO CHEATING IS ALLOWED. Any sudden changes in your country, like weapons and territory, will not be tolerated unless ruled true by the Supreme Commander. The Region provides a democratic system, with multiple leadership roles. If you wish to join the Federation but have no password, then send a letter to the Commander, explaining your current experiences with other regions and why you would join this region.

- Hail Rome!
