Leyawiin is a Cyrodiilic city in the extreme southeast of the province, by the mouth of the Niben River where it opens into Topal Bay. Located on the small strip of land between the provinces of Elsweyr and Black Marsh, the recently ceded Trans-Niben, it has a sizable population that includes many Khajiit and Argonians. Marius Caro is the Count of Leyawiin. Leyawiin used to be a primarily Khajiit city that was part of Elsweyr, but was later annexed into Cyrodiil due to an agreement between the Mane and the Empire. The Renrijra Krin, a group of bandits and freedom fighters, prime objective is to reclaim Leyawiin and other parts of Cyrodiil that they believe rightfully belong to Elsweyr.
