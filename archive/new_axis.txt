Axis grew out of the diplomatic efforts of Germany, Italy and Japan. The first step was the treaty signed by Germany and Italy in October 1936. Benito Mussolini declared on 1 November that all other European countries would from then on rotate on the Rome&#150;Berlin axis, thus creating the term &quot;Axis&quot;. The almost simultaneous second step was the signing in November 1936 of the Anti-Comintern Pact, an anti-communist treaty between Germany and Japan. Italy joined the Pact in 1937. The &quot;Rome&#150;Berlin Axis&quot; became a military alliance in 1939 under the so-called &quot;Pact of Steel&quot;, with the Tripartite Pact of 1940 leading to the integration of the military aims of Germany, Italy and Japan.
