The Joggerlands is a hellish landscape filled with twisted, mutated flora and fauna, and covered in an endless, sickeningly-green sky, the result of centuries of pollution. Most cities are built deep underground, where the air is still clean (usually cleaned by filtration systems), and the terrain isn&#39;t polluted. The region is commonly infested by fecesmen.

Lower regions of the Joggerlands are usually at risk from [i]Miasma[/i], an incredibly toxic gas, the fruit of hundreds of years of pollution. It is corrosive, carcinogenic, and a neurotoxin all at the same time. Initial exposure to [i]Miasma[/i] usually leads to intense agony as the skin is melted off, and may lead to intense septic shock. Survivors may face long-term effects such as Munchausen.
