Discovered about 102 years ago, the archipelago consists of several islands, scattered in a vast region of the Northern Atlantic. The fertile and beautiful islands were first cartographed by Austrian winemaker Leopold Babenberg, who founded the first settlement: Stock-City with the famous Pub &amp;quot;The Black Eagle&amp;quot;.

In the meantime several young and thriving nations have been founded on the archipelago. They are united by a strong wish for order, conservative values, good food and alcoholic beverages.
