Open to all, this region can be called home by anybody that is willing to hold up to our standards. We accept anybody who will follow our constitution (see below) and will make an attempt to be active on the message board. We understand if you are busy and don&#146;t have much time for it, but if you wanted to be unnoticed, you should have joined a bigger region. Have fun in [region]The Siberian Outback[/region]!
