Open to all, this region can be called home by anybody that is willing to hold up to our standards. We try to stay fairly open minded, but there are some lines that don&#146;t get crossed here. For example: don&#146;t ban clothing. We have had issues with that. Don&#146;t be extremely liberal. Most of us here are conservatives, and we don&#146;t hold with that liberal bull****. And also, just try not to be overly sensitive. We will joke around and make fun of people, and most of it isn&#146;t really serious. Just live with it. Thank you for reading this, because if you didn&#146;t, you might get in trouble.
