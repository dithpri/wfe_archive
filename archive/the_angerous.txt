We are angerous now, you throwing rock at me. Hit eye and it no hurt me. We stand strong we stand tall, we won&#39;t back down, we will gather like the storms of shadow, take our enemies by  hand, lead them to our sides. we will not tolerate fascism. Racism. Nor sexist country. Religion will not be forced if tolerated at all.
