An island off the coast of eastern seaboard of Russia that provides amazing views of the setting sun - under the gloom of a dark and evil government, hell bent on global thermonuclear domination. This island has been known to take over large-scaled corporations through its hacking department, create beasts of war in its genetic engineering department, and manufacture ground and air war machines that the world has never seen before. This is only the cover of dark and dangerous activities this country delves into. They are the biggest threat known to man, so much so, that no human has ever laid eyes on the gleaming tropical paradise of the land and come back to tell the tale.
