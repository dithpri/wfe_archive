[color=green]Welcome To Walden Pond, Your Friendly Neighborhood Residence for those wishing to live a life of peace and quiet away from the nightmare that has become known as civilization.[/color]

[color=blue]&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. &quot; - Henry David Thoreau[/color]
