Welcome Newcomers, in TGRDI we love a good fair election, and we also love lots and lots of government. Here you can talk with others, play games, or just hang out and talk about random stuff. We also love fandom so bring all those Doctor Who, Star Trek, Pokemon, Sherlock, and Harry Potter references that no one understands.

P.S. This region was formally known as The Greater Republican Democrat Islands, which will cease to exist very soon further information so that one does not become confused I will post a dispatch on that region&#39;s World FactBook Entry.

&quot;Be free with us and remember, don&#39;t trust news stations, you can&#39;t afford olive oil, tell Barbra about me, BYEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
