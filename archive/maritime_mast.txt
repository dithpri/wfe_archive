An expansive archipelago with many inhabited islands and some undiscovered nations.  Those nations that have been discovered all vary in culture (or lack thereof) and their ways of life can be placed everywhere on a spectrum. There is freedom in some and oppression in others but it doesn&#39;t matter because their ability to unite under the MAST flag is strong. This truly is a glorious region that will last and prosper forever.
