Maritime MAST is a large world filled with a unique array of cultures and nations that have different types of Government. While there is several differences between these nations, they are all united under the Maritime MAST flag. We welcome all MAST members, both past and present, to this group and we welcome all who want to participate in our region. 

[b]Glory to Maritime MAST! May our lands and seas shine bright![/b]
[I]Or may acid rain pour over your wastelands[/I]
[b]May your people live happy free lives[/b]
[I]Or shall the government live in luxury while the people are stripped of every right[/I]
[b]May your culture be known through the lands[/b]
[I]Or your conquests be feared by the masses[/I] 
[u]You choose, you rule.[/u]

Welcome to MAST.
