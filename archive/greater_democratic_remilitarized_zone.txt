The Greater Democratic Remilitarized Zone is a collection of muddy pastures, snowy mountains, and dreary outcroppings of civilization, host to a diverse population of unexploded ordinance. 

The GDRZ is home to a glut of bureaucracies, autocracies, and various other cronyism-plagued nations. Since its conception as a spiteful ceasefire provision towards the end of a long forgotten border dispute, many a disgraced general and exiled President For Life has made a new name for themselves at the Department of So-and-So Affairs in the People&#146;s Republic of Something-Or-Other within the GDRZ&#146;s apprehensively defined borders.

All in all, the GDRZ is a land overlooked by the rest of the world, and disliked by its inhabitants. Good fishing, though.
