A collection of muddy pastures, snowy mountains, and dreary outcroppings of civilization, host to a diverse population of unexploded mines and assorted ordinance. 

At the center of the GDRZ sits The Republic of the Democratic Federation of Disdania, the smoggiest country east of the Zlowi&amp;#263;e river. 

All in all, the GDRZ is a land overlooked by the rest of the world, and disliked by its inhabitants. Good fishing, though.
