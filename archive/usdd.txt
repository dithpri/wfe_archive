United Socialist Democracies and Dictatorships--of the Proletariat, of course.

We are an amalgamation of socialists ranging from anarchists to Marxist-Leninist-Maoists to tepid democratic socialists. Naturally, we view revisionism in a negative light. 

We are enemies of fascism and reactionaries everywhere. 

If you&#39;re interested in joining the international Proletarian Revolution, send our diplomacy officer a telegram with some info about your interest in socialism (e.g. your school of thought, any influential socialist works you&#39;ve read).

Our anthem is &quot;The Internationale.&quot;

Workers of the World, Unite!
