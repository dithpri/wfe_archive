[B]*Dormant. Work in progress until needed.*[/B]
The plan is to have a two-staged region: one half with RP for non-spacegoing nations, and the other half for more advanced (RP wise) nations. A nation may be permitted to transfer to the more advanced half of RP by going through a &amp;quot;first contact&amp;quot;.
I have some potentially big-ish plans for this some time in the near or far future. 
Any questions please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to telegram me.
[B]Interested or want to help? [/B]Please telegram me and I can see about getting you in to the region.
