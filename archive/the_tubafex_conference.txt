The Tubafex Conference is an exclusive summit of influential persons who wish to share their knowledge and cooperate in our conquest to improve our nations moral and cultural standards. Our ideology is to leave the more barbaric nations for what they are, yet show the world our excellence. All nations who endorse our standards are welcome to join us at our meetings in the House of Sovereignty in the Fatumnia capital of Tubafex. The conference is led by both the fate-chosen leader and the people-chosen leader.
