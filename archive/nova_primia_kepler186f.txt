The High Lords of Antiosiom decided to launch a space expedition with all of Antiosioms countries 
to explore Kepler186F and discovered that there were inhabited peoples already there. The High Lords were the first to go there and Colonize these colonies begin building their weapons(Swords etc). due to the fact that they only dropped their citizens off to fend for themselves and treat Kepler186F as a new earth and start from the beginning just as the primitive natives have been living for centuries.
