The High Council of Transcendence is an international powerhouse. The laws of our land are few, but they will be enforced, with no exceptions. The tenet of free trade is the region&amp;#39;s highest law. Anyone who disobeys will be kicked out. This region will be of one of peace within itself. But when the opportunity comes, we will rise up and claim the world for our own. On the topic of transcendence, transcendence is another aim for our region. In our differences is an attempt to find transcendence. This journey of faction will be long, longer than our lives, but through this ideal, there will be change and there will be achievements.
