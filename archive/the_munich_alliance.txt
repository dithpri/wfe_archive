[b]The Munich Alliance[/b]

Welcome to the Munich Alliance, where Europe has changed--for better or for worse.  Whether your nation is returning to old values or forging itself on top of new ones, this is the place for you.

Signed in January of 2016, founders of the Munich Alliance signed the M&uuml;ller Accord, which brought the powers together into a political and military pact.  By becoming a part of the M&uuml;ller Accord, each country is obliged to protect and uphold the traditional values laid down by each member state.
