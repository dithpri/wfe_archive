 Yarabi - from the Taino word for &#147;little place&#148; - is an isolated plain atop a plateau in the Karaya mountain range.
The population of the region is ethnically and linguistically diverse, and consists primarily of disconnected communities which coordinate through larger bodies that manage trade, welfare, and defense.
Large cities have, however, formed at the edges of the lake which sits at the plateau&#146;s centre, and which is fed by rivers beginning in the hills. These rivers serve as a mode of transport between settlements and connect outlying communities with greater population centres.
