Welcome to Scandiworld!
See the river streets of the Della-Catenan city of Ilera, the famed Steel Lady of Versaillia, and the Heinkelsberg Arch of Folschland, all in Evronisia. Not your style? Take a trip across the Atlian Ocean and see the twins of the &quot;new world&quot; - North and South Aloverica, boasting the Statue of Sovereignty in the Incorporated States, the ancient Cinotek ruins of Mexidor, or the famous Ontareux Tower in Alorica. And if you&#39;re still not satisfied, well, go explore! There&#39;s plenty to see (and plenty of secrets to uncover). What&#39;re you waiting for?
