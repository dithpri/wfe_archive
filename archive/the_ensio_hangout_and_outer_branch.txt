That&#39;s the rules. One more thing, if you puppet in a election, you will be banned, if you report someone for being banned, we will tell the moderators why. You get three strikes. If you break any of the rules, its a strike, three strikes is a ban from this place for a month. If the behavior continues, you will be banned for good.[/spoiler]
