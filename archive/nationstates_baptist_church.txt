Hello brothern and sisters in Christ! Are you ready to praise the Lord? Well every Sunday in our [url=https://nsbaptistchurch.freeforums.net/]forum[/url] we will have a church service. I am not an official pastor but believe in Christ and want to share his message. Help us bring more people in the right direction which is the word. &quot;Salvation can&#39;t be obtained from you or me but from the Lamb, Jesus Christ.&quot;
