&quot;[i][b]Together[/b] we stand, some shaken, some bruised, but never afraid. We knew the blood that covered the ground was ours, yet we march onwards, like [b]Soldiers[/b] of war. Bullets hit us, and we rose from the dirt from which restrained us so. What some carry in large numbers, we carry in each our souls, a mighty few, one could say. Always returning, far from over, and fresh out of mercy. [b]Challenged[/b] by [b]omnipotent powers,[/b] we stand together still, bruised and bloodied, armed and ready. A [b]mighty[/b] few indeed.[/i]&quot; - [nation]Shyster[/nation] &amp; [region]SFFP[/region]
