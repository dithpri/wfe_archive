Cromule is a growing region that hosts all Cromulian countries, but it is also open to any foreign countries at this point of time. We stick to these rules as a region, and all those who dare breach them shall meet the consequences. 
[b]1. All residents, no matter their powers, must remain loyal to Cromule. All forms of criticism against the region or those controlling it are therefore uncromulian. 
    2. All residents, no matter their powers, must mind their own business. If they feel suspicous or doubtful towards a happening in the region, they are not tolerated to inspect no further than a quick thought. All forms of inspections against the region or those controlling it are therefore uncromulian, unless under agreemen of current ruler. [/b]
