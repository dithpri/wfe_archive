Cromule is a reincarnation of its former self, which was destroyed after the downfall of its regional-ruling society, the C.S.S. (Cromulian Strategism Society). It was reestablished, ironically by the C.S.S. led by ex-leaders Galix Ferenor and Falun Rereogats, who led the region under a corrupt hand until the society was vanquished again by the embassy region, [region]The imperial union of Horowhenua college[/region]. All that remains of the C.S.S. is a civil war in [nation]The Cannibalistic Society Of TROUTVILLE[/nation] between a Pro-C.S.S. league and an Anti-C.S.S. League.
Nowadays it is led by Doblerfast with an integral hand.
