[color=orange]Welcome[/color] to the [color=green]Imperial Union of Allied States[/color]

A region that I hope becomes a social, fun place for nations to debate, roleplay, chill out and most of all have a good time. So why not join this new region and help in its development from helping build political parties in the Imperial Senate, shaping regional policy or simply telling us how the weather is where you are. So go on join us you know you want to.

Should you have any questions please do ask away. [color=red]Roleplay maps and  ideas currently in development, more on this soon.[/color]
[color=blue]Imperial Senate positions are up for election soon for those that wish to become more involved in regional governance. Please post nomination in RMB, or contact party leader if a member of a party.[/color]
