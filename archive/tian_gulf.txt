The Tian Gulf is a fictional land, set in a late 1800s time period, that was made for nations that want role play semi-realistic political scenarios. From dimplomacy to all out war. 

RP rules:

*A nation must give a realistic description about ones nation; GDP, pop., government type., climate, ethic groups. Meaning your nation must have technology set in this world&#39;s time period. No lasers, no nukes. 

*A nation must have the ability to write efficiently.

*A nation be able to negotiate with one another.

*A nation must be prepared for imperialism, for if a nation gets taken over, that nation gets kicked out of the region.
