[b]The Cedar Road
The lifeblood of the Northern Settlements[/b]
[hr]
The Cedar Road is set in the Northeastern part of NA, where a plague has decimated the continent. Walking corpses with enraging bloodlust aimlessly roam the countryside. A small group of settlers founded the Cedar Road as a means to locate other survivors, and connect them to one large trade route. Many depend on the Road, despite the dangers that lurk beyond. Bandits often raid traveling caravans, not to mention the wildlife that frequent its grounds. Should you find yourself along the path, it will be up to you, and you alone to make it through.
