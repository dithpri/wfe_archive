The Brotherhood of Steel was forged during the dark age of atomic war on October 23rd, 2077. Our righteous leader Elder Roger Maxson led our descendants from Mariposa to the safety of Lost hills and from the fires of the great war, we rose to strength. Our great scribes keep the knowledge that destroyed humanity away from those who would dare destroy the world for the second time and those who would abuse it. They made the codex, our law, the word of our Elders.
