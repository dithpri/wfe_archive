The Confederacy of Socialist Democracies is a confederation of leftist states. Nations that are left-leaning and relatively politically free can join. We declared independence from the USSD in October of 2017. We are a developing region of the world, and we are proud to announce that we have reached an annual GDP of over 1 trillion Memes. Any country within this region (other than the founder) that becomes somewhat dictatorial is subject to nuclear apocalypse... um... I mean &quot;a friendly warning&quot;.
