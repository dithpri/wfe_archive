The Union of the Space Vikings and the Fourth Reich has been fruitful for both nations, and the two have grown side by side since the beginning of time. They have fought and won countless wars. The region in which they have colonized, as the title ensures, are great Plateaus, rising to the heavens past the clouds in their vast glory. Each nation on a plateau of their own, connected with grand bridges constructed by the greatest engineers in time. The plateaus are as colossal as continents, surrounded by walls thicker than the Earth&amp;#39;s crust. Awe-inspiring waterfalls trickle off the cliffs of the plateaus, trickling through the dense clouds. Little rain falls during the year, yet the fields remain lush.
