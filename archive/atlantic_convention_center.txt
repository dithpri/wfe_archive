The [b]Atlantic Convention Center[/b] (&quot;ACC&quot; or &quot;A.C.C.&quot; for short) is a new collection of totally extant states in the western Atlantic.

Hoping to align with UK- or US- themed regions(while not digging into the diplomacy too much), but this region is open to embassies.

Enjoy your stay!

Wait...
it&#39;s WIP
