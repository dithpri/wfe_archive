Born over the Northern Hemisphere&#39;s winter break of 2024-25, the [b]Atlantic Convention Center[/b] (&quot;ACC&quot; or &quot;A.C.C.&quot; for short) is a new collection of totally extant states in the western Atlantic.

Roleplay and joking about are both encouraged because they both contribute to the lore.
Please endorse the WA Delegate when we have one.

Enjoy your stay!
