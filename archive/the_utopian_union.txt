&quot;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...&quot; - Emma Lazarus, &#39;The New Colossus&#39;

Here in the Utopian Union we turn no nation away. Whether your people live their lives in an lawless anarchic society, under the oppressive rule of a corrupt dictatorship, or in the constant mundanity of an inoffensive centrist democracy, we welcome all with arms open wide. We believe that all of these nations can overcome their differences and work together to make the world a true Utopia. After all, variety is the spice of life, is it not?
