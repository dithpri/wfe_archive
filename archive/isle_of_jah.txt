The Isle of Jah is a union of nations that have common goals in existing and being free from political scrutiny.  Joining is an option.  We have intents to exist, and be a coalition of people, because humans like to gather in groups.  If you want to gather with us, by all means, do so.  It would be only a plus if you are in the World Assembly and can assist our influence in this fledgling region.
