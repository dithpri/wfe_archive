The region-between-regions that encompasses much of the planet, the Levanora Vastness exists as the meeting point of the major regions of the world. Where those of the Badlands contend with the Gothic Lords and the Dienstadi. A region of vast oceans and terrible landmasses alike, the Vastness tempts and taunts in equal measure.

The Levanora Vastness is an ongoing project developed by [nation]Holy Marsh[/nation] and [nation]Tiami[/nation] to help better foster growth and communication between willing participant RPing regions. Much of Levanora&#39;s worldbuilding will be conducted via Discord for ease of communication.
