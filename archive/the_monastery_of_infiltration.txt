[i][color=blue]Welcome, one and all![/color][/i]
We attack raiding regions with spies and assassins. If you want training on assassination and spying, telegram [nation=short]Avroc[/nation], and he&#39;ll mentor you on the ways of stealth and elimination, as we call it.
[i]we also are constructing several strike teams for standard attack. Contact [nation=short]avroc[/nation] for more info.
Scholarships in assassination and spying are available for defenders who don&#39;t want to leave their region but are interested in A/S.[/i]
