The continent Nordeia was once home to the Great Nordeic Empire, that held sway over these lands for centuries. Yet in the 18th century, civil wars caused the empire&#39;s unity to fracture, and eventually led to the dissolution of this once great state.

In its place rose new nations, like phoenixes from the ashes, to lead the continent of Nordeia into a new, modern age. Today, the most influential states of Nordeia call itself its protectors, and safeguard the region&#39;s prosperity from outside influences.
