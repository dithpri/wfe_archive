The snow is stained red after a long civil war. Colonies are scattered, man turned upon his neighbor, and future generations dying in the arms of their parents. After much war and death, things in the isles have calmed down, cities have been built and families reunited. 
We are the citizens of the Isles of snow and stone. Winter is a snow storm, spring and summer are light flurries. Our men and women are strong and loyal, and the beasts here are the same.
