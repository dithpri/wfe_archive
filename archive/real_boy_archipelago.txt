[b][color=#B0171F] Tonight, [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=valle_de_arena]The Sekhmet Legion[/url] along with their friends in [region]the black hawks[/region], and [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] went out to have a night on the town! They had a jolly good time vandalizing buildings and causing a right row. The police were nowhere to be seen, and miscreates had a merry old time!
