We laid the foundation of the very ground you stand on with our own blood.....and the blood of our enemies. We are a naturally peaceful nation, yet if you threaten our way of life, we will retaliate 10 fold. Join us, let us be your beacon in the night, and your shade in the ever burning sun. We are the father of nations, yet we accept any and everyone.
