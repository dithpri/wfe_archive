The regional year is 2006. Pax Transpolia is a medium-sized Pan-Slavic region! So far most people here are Slavic. Even nations that would suggest they exist elsewhere in the world are ruled by Slavic people, however, if/when we open our borders anybody can join. There are a few non-slavs in this region and they are more than welcome!

Pax Transpolia is a free and diverse region 

&quot;A tight-knight community of like-minded people&quot; - Transapol
