Pax Transpolia is undergoing hibernation.

The regional year is 2093. Pax Transpolia is a medium-sized Pan-Slavic region! So far most people here are Slavic. Even nations that would suggest they exist elsewhere in the world are ruled by Slavic people, however anybody can join. There are a few non-slavs in this region and they are more than welcome!
