History: After the Greater Empire of Kylicterstein collapsed in 1959, two nations formed; Zookurbia and Owenvirgo. These 2 nations had several conflicts following the years after their creation. After a brief governmental reform in Owenvirgo, Zookurbia and Owenvirgo formed the treaty of Kylicterstein (1968), officially forming The Areas of Kylicterstein. As per terms of the treaty, anyone who wants to declare themself a nation in the area of the ex-nation of Greater Kylicterstein will be accepted by the two nations.
