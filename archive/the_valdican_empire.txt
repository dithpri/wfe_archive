The Valdican Empire is a collective of nation states.  Upon joining the newly formed Empire, your nation will be protected from laws of other world governing bodies.  The Empire is headed by the Principality of Valdica, under the leadership of H.S.H Prince Phillip I.  

If accepted into the Empire, your citizens will be guaranteed freedoms, which can never be rescinded. Though, H.S.H does have two exclusive executive powers; a tie breaking vote and a veto.
