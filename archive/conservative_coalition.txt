Welcome to the [b][color=#4585bf]Conservative Coalition[/color][/b] (the [b][color=#4585bf]CC[/color][/b])!

This region is for the like-minded to assemble and discuss our movement in these fast moving times. We are a conservative region, and we welcome all forms of capitalists, libertarians, social conservatives, fiscal conservatives. In general we believe in personal freedoms &amp; responsibilities, free markets, limited government, and democracy. We are anti-Socialist, anti-Fascist, anti-Communist, and anti-Nazi.
