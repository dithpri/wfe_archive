The New Euro Delegation is a mysterious, battered, forgotten wasteland and the last remaining remnants of the old world. As all other regions move on and attempt to create a brand new world, the citizens of the New Euro Delegation want to completely emulate that of the old one, albeit more successful and under control (complete control). Be cautious of your surroundings and have a good stay.
