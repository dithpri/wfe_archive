[b]The Liberal Republic[/b]

[hr]

Liberalism may have been founded on the ideas of liberty and equality, but is unable to ever fully bring those ideas to fruition. Capitalist &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; markets and top-down &amp;quot;representative&amp;quot; democracy serve only to oppress the people and give the illusion of freedom.
