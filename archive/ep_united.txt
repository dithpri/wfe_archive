Hello. I hope you all enjoy this new Fact-book.
I am SRS, the leader of this region. I&amp;#39;m a cool guy.

We got raided, but we survived cause of our strength. 

Here is some news for this week!

1) SlideSurveyor has been re-founded again and might join us!
2)I&amp;#39;ve updated the fact-book, and i am trying to make it into a message board.
3)We&amp;#39;re trying to expand, but with out last incident i fear that we can only accept people we all vote on.

Thank you for reading! Enjoy your day and Hail EP UNITED!
