&amp;#9874;&amp;#65039; The Marxheim Treaty (Hjalti&#39;s Bund)
Ideology: Syncretic Norse Pagan Socialism (Marxism + Norse Cosmology).

Nature: A highly militarized, isolationist regional bloc, founded in 1968 as the Norse-Pagan equivalent of the Warsaw Pact.

Structure: Governed by the Althing of Guardians. Commands a unified military (Einherjar High Command) dedicated to the defense of its member states (e.g., Svart&aacute;lfaheimr).

Economy: Centrally planned Yggdrasil Economy, emphasizing collective effort (Hamingja). The Treaty remains politically rigid under the Heimdall Doctrine, surviving through controlled Gjallarhorn Reforms.
