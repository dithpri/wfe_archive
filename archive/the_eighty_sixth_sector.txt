The unofficial sector of the Republic where the Eighty-Six reside. The sector houses many internment camps where the Eighty-Six are forced into labor and experimented upon, as well as bases from which the Processors operate from. Additionally, the area is a no-man&#39;s land outside the Republic&#39;s defensive perimeter of minefields and artillery. The minefields contain both anti-tank mines to guard against Legion, and anti-personnel mines to keep the Eighty-Six outside.
