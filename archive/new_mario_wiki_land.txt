A new region for Mario Wiki members? Why not?

New Mario Wiki Land was founded by [nation]Iron Confederation[/nation] to escape fallout from the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=iron_confederation/detail=factbook/id=62411]November 2012 Robby Roylance Blimp Crisis[/url], but is currently in use by a few other nations who got bored of the locale of Mario Wiki Land. Or the leadership. Or something like that.

Currently managed by Dr. Javelin/[nation]Iron Confederation[/nation] and Toad85/[nation]New Matawan[/nation].

Make sure to ask the administrators for the region password.
