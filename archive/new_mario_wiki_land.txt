A new region for Mario Wiki members? Why not?

Currently managed by Dr. Javelin/[nation]Iron Confederation[/nation]. Hopefully, we&amp;#39;ll be able to elect another person to run the region as WA Delegate.

Make sure to ask the administrators (currently, only Iron Confederation) for the password.
