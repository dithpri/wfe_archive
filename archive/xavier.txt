2193. 150 years since the Great War. 25 years since the war between [nation]Calvinationary[/nation] and [nation]Vorm[/nation]. Mankind continues to rebuild. The world may still be warped, but it has begun to heal.

However, it stands on the brink of war. [nation]Fostervold[/nation], after years of internal conflict, land loss, economic downturn, and international disrace, has built up its industrial, military, &amp;amp; economic strength to unprecedented heights under the leadership of the right wing Roche Party. They are poised to regain their lands, stature, and might, by any means necessary.

Agression has set the stage. Unrest and injustice have set the scene. War is coming. And war, war never changes.
