2193. 150 years since the Great War. 25 years since the war between [nation]Calvinationary[/nation] and [nation]Vorm[/nation]. Mankind continues to rebuild. The world may still be warped, but it has begun to heal.

And yet war has come again. [nation]Fostervold[/nation] has declared war upon its neighbors in order to reestablish itself as a regional powerhouse after their severe losses across the years due to internal strife. A rapid blitzkrieg has swept outwards, claiming lands with swift and effective warfare. Vorm, Ustea, Calvinationary, Danazkatan, and other nations have all been hit.

War rages on. Peace was but a fragile memory. For war, war never changes.
