The Great War is over. One hundred years ago, the Old World had gone up in the flames of nuclear war, zombie outbreaks, plagues, natural disasters, and more. This is the New World. A landscape of deserts, wastelands, untouched havens of forests and rivers, and more. Tribes, raiders, zombies, mutants, and the like populate the region.

This is a community of the young nations after the War; a fledgling community of new countries of varying peoples, ideologies, and histories. Peoples here are survivors; strong, free, and ruthless in establishing their ideals and vision of new societies.
