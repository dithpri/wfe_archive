More than a hundred years ago, the Old World had gone up in the flames of nuclear war, zombie outbreaks, plagues, natural disasters, and more, leaving a landscape of deserts, mountains, and some untouched havens in its wake; a true Wasteland of supermutants, ghouls, zombies, mutated creatures, and more.

Man arose from the rubble, establishing settlements and forming tribes. Some chose peaceful isolation and independence. Others chose to become raiders, sackers, and savages. And some chose to band together for a brighter future. This is the community of these fledgling societies, working to protect their peoples, establishing and securing their respective holdings, and working for a brighter future.
