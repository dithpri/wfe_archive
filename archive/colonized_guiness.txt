[region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to fly out into the World one dark night. However, in several places they visited there were what seemed like rockets being fired at them that exploded into bright colours, much too bright for avian eyes to handle. As such we turned to a friendly Assassin to help us fly around with ease, with the help of those shadowy cloaks we were able to leave our mark across your region in our feathers as a parting gift from us to you!
