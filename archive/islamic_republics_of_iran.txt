[color=navy][b]This region has an interesting history. [/b][/color]

Starting as a short-lived region of &quot;Iranians&quot;, it was destroyed by [region]Osiris[/region] and held as a tribute to former [nation]Detective Figs[/nation]. In Fall 2016 it was refounded by [nation]Funkadelia[/nation], but &quot;claimed&quot; by [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_order_of_the_grey_wardens]The Grey Wardens[/url] as a favor. Osiris was [i]pissed[/i]. Funkadelia then succumbed to the blight and took the region for himself. However, on 10/13/17, carelessness allowed for the CTE of the Founder Nation. While he noticed it two minutes before it was due to CTE the next minor, and revived his nation, he failed to move in.

And so, now for real, this region is owned by [b][region]The Order of the Grey Wardens[/region][/b], and serves as a reminder to darkspawn that there is a force to fear.

[b]Hail the Wardens! Hail the Order! Hail the Maker![/b]
