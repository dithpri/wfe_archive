From WFE Archives - February 2012

The Gemini Region is created for those players who request admission as a two-person team. This requirement is (of course) paired with one other. Nations coming together into the region must have been created less than 30 days prior to request to join the Region.

All nations entering Gemini must register on our http://geminikingdom.forumotion.com forums , or you will not be approved as a member of our Region.
