Confederacy of Independent States

The Confederation exists primarily as a body for member nations to freely share resources and knowledge in order to advance all humanity to greater heights.  The free trade of ideas, technology and resources will be essential in achieving this goal.

All nations may govern their own sovereign states according to their laws and customs.  Our only requirements are that States agree to free and open trade of ideas and resources with other member nations, and that no member nation will act aggressively to another member nation.
