We are a group of cooperating States that wish to better ourselves and develop ourselves through cooperation and peace, we are a new faction however we wish to be a known and influential region soon enough.

When we created our nations, we found ourselves in a world that did not wish to help us, but we found ourselves and learned that through Brotherhood and Unity we can make our lands free and beautiful.

We are a diverse Confederacy with many ideologies and ideas that we display within our Bicameral Assembly, made up of the International Parliament and the Cabinet.
