[b]Once controlled by the hypocritical [color=red]Red Menace[/color], [region]The Marxist Union[/region] has been liberated by the Imperial Legions of [nation]British Fascist Empire[/nation] under His Imperial Majesty Emperor George VII. This invasion was not unprovoked, for too long our ideals and people have been unfairly attacked and persecuted in NationStates and it is time we went back on the offensive.
