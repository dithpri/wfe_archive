&quot;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.&quot; 

&quot;Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains.&quot;

Long Live the Father of Communism, Karl Marx
