Edyn is the name of our most beautiful world with its beautiful floating islands to its very diverse and mythical life that comes in all shapes and sizes from the mighty Dragon to the majestic Unicorn. If one thing is to be said is that Edyn is beautiful but rather dangerous and especially now that the races of the world stand apart with territorial disputes between the Humans and Dwarves to the issue with the harsh treatment of Orcs at the hand of Elf&#146;s who knows what the future might hold.
