Like a phoenix, The Caribbean Community has risen from the ashes and has escaped the grasp of raider&amp;#39;s hands. Magnifico Tropico founded this region in hopes of creating a small, peaceful community. Eventually, order started to break loose and Magnifico Tropico ceased to exist! Before anything could be done, [region]The Black Riders[/region] invaded the region and seized power. Then, [region]AtlanticImperium[/region] invaded, citing imperial expansion as their cause. Eventually, the entire region collapsed. Now, the region has been restored and liberated by [region]Holy Rome[/region], and has been given freedom from outside invaders.

The region will be completely restored once recruitment had finished and the region is self-sustaining.
