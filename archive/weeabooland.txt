Welcome to the great [b][color=purple]Region of Weeabooland[/color]![/b] We hope you enjoy your stay![hr]
[i][b][color=purple]Weeabooland[/color][/b][/i] was founded on August 25th, 2017 by [nation=carbombya]. Shortly after her foundation, [color=purple][b]Weeabooland[/b][/color] began to experience an influx of immigrants on levels that authorities were not able to control, forcing her to [i][b]close her borders[/b][/i]. Later, a corruption scandal ensued resulting in a massive [b][i]purge of nations[/i][/b]. The region never truly recovered, and her founder, [nation=noflag]Carbombya[/nation], went missing. Time passed, and [nation=noflag]Carbombya[/nation] returned, only to find [b][color=purple]Weeabooland[/color][/b] in ruins. As a result, [b][color=purple]Weeabooland[/color][/b] has decided to [i][b]open her borders to the world[/b][/i] in the hopes of re-population. We call on all to help rebuild [color=purple][b][i]Weeabooland&#39;s[/i][/b][/color] future!
