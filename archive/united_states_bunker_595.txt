Somewhere in the remote parts of what used to be United States of America is a bunker built by the United States Department of Defence.When the nukes fell there was little warning. Because of this some bunkers sealed automatically before anyone could react, sealing in whoever happened to be to be in the bunkers at the time and in some cases, some bunkers sealed without anyone in them. This is that story.
