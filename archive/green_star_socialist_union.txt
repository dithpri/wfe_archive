[color=#00BFFF]And now a poem for your reading pleasure.

&quot;Red, fluttering like a butterfly&#39;s wing,
A workers&#39; banner unfurls gloriously before me,

It is not the idea that I love so desperately,
It&#39;s the great spill of men in blue shirts,
Seething like the ocean over these empty streets.[/color]
