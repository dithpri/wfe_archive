The continent of Tyrant is situated at an almost isolated place surrounded by an extremely vast deep ocean. The climate on the mainland ranges from the polar frost to the tropical heat, although most of the surface belongs to the mild or subtropical belt. 

The inhabitants ancestors are believed to have come to the area in the prehistorical ages led by an obscure being often referred to as Tyrant. Tyrant currently works as a long-term supreme representative of the region. 

Every citizen of the Tyrant Continent and Islands is free to change her or his nationality. Asetreia, Boia, Boya, Jolani, Norike, Noryke, Techne and Tyrant Manor seem to be the most promising nowadays.
