We are a small penisula specializing in the creation of pretentious, broken, student video games. Our main exports are Microsoft employees, lowly Nintendo game testers, and drop-outs. We have a very high immigration rate but this is ok as most nation leave within one year of joining the reigion. The population is overwhelmingly male, leading to a very low birth rate. On the other hand, we have made great strides in the development of robotic &amp;quot;companions&amp;quot;. If you love stress, hate sleep, and don&amp;#39;t mind being so busy you don&amp;#39;t realize how lonely you&amp;#39;ve become, come join us over at The DigiPeninsula today!
