Cole, walk with a *****, I give you my pain
So much on my mind, I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can&#39;t get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
Cause I still don&#39;t see hope, lookin&#39; for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowin&#39; it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin&#39; ******, over a decade they been knowin&#39; me
