The [b]North Sea[/b] is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. It connects to the ocean through the [region]English Channel[/region] in the south and the [region]Norwegian Sea[/region] in the north. It is more than 600 miles long and 360 miles wide, with an area of around 220,000 square miles.

The North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major fishery. The sea is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries and more recently has developed into a rich source of energy resources including fossil fuels, wind, and early efforts in wave power. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
