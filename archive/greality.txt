This region is a vast, wide open space nestled up against the beautiful Amadean Mountains. The sun shines one minute and then the weather changes in a flash. However, it keeps life interesting. There is a large bovine population as well as a healthy number of college students of the drunk variety. Ask anyone in this region what life is all about? Greality, where if the wind blows in the right direction, you&amp;#39;ll know its us.
