&#149;[nation=short]SCUT_Peacekeeper[/nation] is not one of us. It is run by [nation=short]Sovietzkia[/nation] in an attempt to defame our organization. If you see this nation, report it immediately, as any actions it takes are against our Commonwealth.
&#149;[nation=short]The Lamparian Empire[/nation] is traitor. He claims to be involved with a group called The Red Fleet. Lampar&#39;s puppets are to be regarded just as hostile. He himself is a puppet for an unknown region. If you are seen/suspected of aiding The Red Fleet, the proper course of action shall be taken on our behalf.
