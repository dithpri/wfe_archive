Following the collapse of the Third International founded by V. I. Lenin and the Fourth International that was created by Leon Trotsky following the perceived betrayal of communist principles by the Third International, there was a power vacuum in the global communist movement. Rejecting the concepts of authoritarianism and violent revolution that were embraced by the organizations that preceded it, the so called Fifth International was founded as a voluntary union of like minded socialist republics. The Fifth International was also strongly influenced by anarchism and secularism.
