First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out&#151;
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out&#151; 
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out&#151; 
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me&#151;and there was no one left to speak for me.
