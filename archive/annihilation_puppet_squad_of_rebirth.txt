[b]This region is used as a puppet storage for [region]The Empire of The Iron Chariots[/region]

You may think of us as &amp;quot;Tag raiders who claim to be Defenders&amp;quot; but we are simply Imperialist, taking regions and then protecting them from others.
Nations outside of our own are free to place puppets here as either a launch point or to die off, as long as they don&amp;#39;t cause a problem.[/b]
