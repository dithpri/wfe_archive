In the Physical Realm, the Cosmere is a star cluster of about 50 to 100 stars. The Physical Realm is composed of fundamental particles known as axi and follows ordinary laws of physics, except when the other Realms are involved. Currently, there are ten known planetary systems in the Cosmere, which contain a total of twelve notable planets. The Cosmere is also home to other celestial objects, including several dwarf planets, gas giants, and constellations. At least one person has tried to leave the physical bounds of the Cosmere, with unknown results.
