Bulagolic is the region of leading emerging economies, arising out of the inclusion of Ruritana into the Bulagolic region in 1592. As of 1698, the region&amp;#39;s 5 members are The Holy Empire of Hey2121, The Federation of Svenidad, Vatigaro, Aniatea and Ugalina. With the possible exception of Ugalina, the Bulagolic members are all developing or newly industrialised countries, but they are distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies and significant influence on global affairs. As of 1698, the 5 Bulagolic countries represent almost 79 billion people, with a combined nominal GDP of GBU&#128;79.2 trillion, and an estimated GBU&#128;83 trillion in combined foreign reserves. Presently, Hey2121 holds the chair of the Bulagolic region.
