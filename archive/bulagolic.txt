Bulagolic is the region of leading emerging economies, arising out of the inclusion of Ruritana into the Bulagolic region in 1592. As of 1698, the region&amp;#39;s 27 members are Rhodavya, Vatigaro, Aniatea, Ugalina and others. With the possible exception of Aniatea, the Bulagolic members are all developing or newly industrialised countries, but they are distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies and significant influence on global affairs. As of 1698, the five Bulagolic countries represent almost 5 billion people, with a combined nominal GDP of GBU&#128;79.2 trillion, and an estimated GBU&#128;83 trillion in combined foreign reserves. Presently, Hey2121 holds the chair of the Bulagolic region.
