The Conservative United Nation (TCUN) is a region devoted to creating an alliance of nations who share common values and ideas of the right wing. Now nations of the left wing are welcome but you may not agree with what of cause is for. We push for more global independence (kinda ironic), energy independence, peace through strength, fighting terrorism abroad, and economic innovation. We appose the NationStates Region because they believe in defeating their enemies with kindness instead of peace through strength. Members of TCUN, together we can achieve greatness.
