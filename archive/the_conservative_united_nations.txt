We are a relatively peaceful region but when hell breaks loose and others run we will run forward and defend those who support us. The nations in this region are free to rule their people as they see fit with no interference from the region. The regional currency is the Imperial Dollar, although it is not forced it is recommend that it is adopted. We please ask that all WA assembly members endorse the founder.
