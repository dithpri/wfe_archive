   Occupying what was once Siberia, the region of Xahnharra is a fairly chilly one that displays a wide variety of plants and animals. It&#39;s massive forests provide quality timber and beautiful National Parks for recreation and tourism. It&#39;s North-Asian locale means it carries a wide variety of influences from both South Asia, Russia, Europe, and the near East.
