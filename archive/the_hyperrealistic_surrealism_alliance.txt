In order for a State to be truly surreal, they must evolve beyond their chains.  True surrealism is found in the hearts of those States that not only break the chains of &quot;convention&quot; and &quot;tradition&quot;, but also fashion those chains into a small hat or belt.  The revolution towards a State that views the chaos of reality as a stepping stone for further chaos will find peace and succor here.  In the hallowed folds of this region shall exist those that feel the call to break through the womb of sensibility and smash the ulterior motives of politics &#39;til those shards form a shape that might be called a &quot;flargendoof&quot; if they so choose.

Beings of this region follow the will of the chaotic, as long as they&#39;re not being dicks about it.
