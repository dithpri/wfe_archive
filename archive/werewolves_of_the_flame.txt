[color=red]We will rise to the supreme levels. Like a flame in a dry grassland we will rise to burn any to oppose us. But all flames have have to come to ashes. Those very ashes are not to be feared for they humble us. It dissolves our doubts, fears, and grief so we may scorch a path to our destiny again and again. We will rally all that come because no task can be done perfectly alone. Let us fear not our imminent death but failure to help those in need!![/color]
