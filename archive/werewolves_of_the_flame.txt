       Greetings to all. Diversity is welcomed here and is what will make us strong as a community. No matter what your beliefs are or what region that you come from, you will be accepted here. All I ask is that you leave your hostilities at the door when you come in and no trolling. Also from this day forward, there is no military operations here.
