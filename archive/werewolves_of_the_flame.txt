Greetings brothers, I&amp;#39;m back. Got some personal stuff out of the way and now ready to get serious with NS. I want to start a region of influence. But not here, I want to start a new region, a region of mergers and individual nations coming together. Those interested just telegram me. Still open on names if you have ideas, the govt and etc can be decided once we set up shop with a name and committents to move there. Like to start up with a nation count of 75 to 100 members, right now I have been talking to 1 region which has about 20 members.
