This is the final resting place of my old nation, The Utopia of [Nation]Conopia[/nation].
Rest in peace Conopia.

Stats:
Before the Uglifacu (demons) destroyed Conopia, we had an increasing population of 3.021 billion Conopians.
Our national animal was the Tui, (Named after my favorite author, Tui. T. Sutherland.), our currency was called the Consa (still exists as the main currency in [region]RPS[/region] today), we rejected religion, and we underwent duo-leadership before the destruction.

Now, all that remains is ruins of our former self, you can still find our files in the capital, Oulnoa. Just be careful, before our downfall, we got really into genetic engineering... and some things may have survived...

This region is proudly owned by [region]RPS[/region].
