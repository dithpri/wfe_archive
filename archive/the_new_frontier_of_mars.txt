Pioneers, led by Novus Finnibus&#39; elite Exodus Troop, established a military and research base on the surface of Mars, which soon blossomed into a grand city, which became the new capital. The city is encased in a massive glass dome, protected by an automated plasma force field to protect against attacks, meteorites, and any other causes of damage. Soon more domes sprouted up, sustaining nearly every climate, and were soon offered, free of charge, to any other nations willing to join the new Martian frontier, in a mutual trade and defense pact.
