A region of great deserts, inhabited by nomadic peoples as unique as the starts in the famously clear night skies. The Shifting Sands, called Paherazani Gholb in the Paherazi language, is a peaceful place, but the desert nomads will not shy away from a fight if they are attacked. The flag of Paherazani Gholb, called the Azkhana Paherazana in Paherazi, depicts the snow-capped Ghorun Mountains, which according to legend, are the home of the spirits that the Paherazi people hold sacred.
