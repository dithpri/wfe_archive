Is dictatorship, despostism or totalatarianism your regime? Is [i]1984[/i] by George Orwell your instruction manual? Do you wield power like an inane megalomaniac? Well, here&amp;#39;s the region for you. Come along to the [i]Roscaekewianic[/i] Region or there is a possibility of sudden coup d&amp;#39;etat in yours. Simple but effective strategy. Some of our nations are friendly and congenial, but with more (cough cough) [i]convincing[/i], we might be able to convince them otherwise. At least have a trial. An extended trial. Why don&amp;#39;t you have a look at the factbook for The Dictatorship of Roscaekewa to see what we&amp;#39;re like? No, we don&amp;#39;t encourage homogeniety (only in our peoples, of course), we&amp;#39;d like a variety: of total dictatorships.
