Elementia is the only known land mass on the flat world of Hemixaethria (Hem-e-zay-th-ree-a).

Following a devastating war between the residents of this super-continent, much of the land is open for the claiming. From beyond the Rim Seas, many cultures have emerged to take these lands for themselves, however, many of the current residents, while scattered, are highly opposed to the presence of outsiders in their lands and may even resort to hostility if they encroach too close to their borders!

Hemixaethria is a RP driven region.
