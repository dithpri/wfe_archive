This is a place where Democracies and Monarchies can take the fight to communism together!!!
 
The Legion of Mankind is a Prussian doctrine country run by a Kaiser. (Hail!!!)

The Dragons of Power run by Seto Kaiba and Turtle Town run by Blue Oak are very powerful democracies.

And Kumari is a Monarchy like the legion.

Also we are generally peaceful towards other regions unless they threaten one of our allies.

Our most important allies are Simul and the Micro Union, but the Micro Union as been known to cause problems with us.
