This is a place where Democracies and Monarchies can take the fight to communism together!!!
 
The Legion of Mankind is a Prussian doctrine country run by a Kaiser. R.I.P

The Dragons of Power run by Seto Kaiba and Turtle Town run by Blue Oak are very powerful democracies.

And Kumari is a Monarchy like the legion.

Also we are generally peaceful towards other regions unless they threaten one of our allies.
