This is a place where Democracies and Monarchies can take the fight to communism together!!!
 
The Legion of Mankind is a Prussian doctrine country run by a Kaiser. (Hail!!!)

The Dragons of Power run by Seto Kaiba and his dragon Comet-X, with Turtle Town run by Blue Oak are very powerful democracies.

And Kumari Kandum is a powerful monarchy and loves Wyverns.

Also we are generally peaceful towards other regions unless they threaten us one of our allies.

Our closest ally is [region]Simul[/region], but everyone else is very important. :)

DEATH TO COMMUNISM!!!
