This is a place where Democracies and Monarchies can take the fight to Communism together!!!
 
The Legion of Mankind is a Prussian doctrine country run by a F&uuml;hrer (Hail!!!)

The Dragons of Power run by Seto Kaiba and his dragon Comet-X *Roar!*, with Turtle Town are very powerful democracies.

And Kumari Kandum is a powerful monarchy ruled by Emperor Yassine Kabbal and has [REDACTED] spies.

Also we are generally peaceful towards other regions unless they threaten us one of our allies.

Our closest ally is [region]Simul[/region], but everyone else is good!
Any communist in our region will be banjected on sight and never to be returned again
We are at war with [region]Antifa[/region] and their supporters 
[b]WE SUPPORT THE CONFEDERACY OF INDEPENDENT REGIONS[/b]
