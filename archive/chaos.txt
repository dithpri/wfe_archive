A hell blasted desolate where all is warped: time, space and the very forces of nature itself. We worship  The Ruinous Powers in all their dark glory. We wage war on the civilized, soft bellied nations to ensure the final victory of the Dark Gods. One day Chaos will be triumphant and engulf the world, becoming a true Realm of Chaos.
