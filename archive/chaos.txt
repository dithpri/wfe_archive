[region]The Black Hawks[/region] want you to watch anime with us during our first ever Anime Fest. 
It should be obvious to anyone that TBH members tend to be anime fans (like look at our gp thread, we had a debate over whether our anime girl mascot should have wing arms or not. [strike]wing arms are bad, fight me[/strike]. So yeah, join us in our discord (link in the info post) and join us in the-anime-pit during July 16-August 9 and we&#39;ll watch anime.
