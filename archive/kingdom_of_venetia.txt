[color=#BC1414][b]Welcome to the Kingdom of Venetia[/b]
[i]Benvenuti nel Regno di Venezia[/i][/color][hr][hr][color=gray]Founded on December 12, 2018, the [b][region]Kingdom of Venetia[/region][/b] (KOV) is a client state of the [region]Kingdom of Rome[/region] (KOR) used primarily for puppet storage, although all nations are welcome here. While primarily a puppet storage region, Venetia is still a functioning constitutional monarchy reigned over by a (largely ceremonial) King, currently [b]His Majesty [nation]New Paumanok[/nation], King of the Venetians[/b], with most power being vested in the regional Prime Minister. Please refer to the dispatches and links below for more information about the KOV, and consider joining the KOR if you&#39;re interested in more activity.[/color][hr][hr][b][color=#BC1414]Join the KOR&#39;s [url=https://discord.gg/ghtR369]Discord server[/url]![/b][/color]
