[color=397a9c][u][B]Welcome to our temporary region![/B][/u][/color] Our home region is: [b][region]St Abbaddon[/region][/b]

[i][b][color=Darkturquoise]St Abbaddon is the name of the island formed when the King of Atlantis lifted his civilization above water, causing a war that erased what remained of Atlantean culture. Left uninhabited, many peoples have migrated to the large magical island.[/color][/i][/b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=531136] {More?}[/url]

[color=red][B]ATTN: St Abbaddon has been raided!  We are unclear of the invaders intentions, but are assuming the worst.[/B][/color] 
We are organizing our resistance here, and mainly on [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/St_Abbaddon/index/]St Abbaddon&#39;s forum[/url]. TG/TM [nation=short]Topid[/nation] for contact.


We are happily accepting in-game embassy offers to this temporary region as a sign of support for St Abbaddon! :) We are also accepting on-forum embassy offers to any region or org supporting our right to control [region]St Abbaddon[/region].
