[color=397a9c][u][B]Thank you everyone for what you have done over the last 12 hours. All of NationStates came together spur of the moment to try to save us when we missed the update. It would have worked too, with over 162 endorsements in 12 hours this game really came together to do what it could for us (as it has over and over).[/color][/b][/u]

The update did not go as we expected. (Boo.)
The piling did not go as I expected. (Yay.)
And so now the question is what to expect next? 

I have a lot of thinking to do over this holiday weekend and will decide how I am going to move forward from this.  St Abbaddon is a very special region, and I hope to see it better off some day!
