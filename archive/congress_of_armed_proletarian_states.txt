The Congress of Armed Proletarian States (CAPS) was a project to create a permanent legislative and executive body, comprised of one hundred seats, to be filled proportionally, according to population, by democratically elected, wholly representative, recallable delegates from socialist aligned regions. Its purpose was to become an inter-regional organization working for the completion of the world revolution, or socialist transformation of NationStates.
