The United Federation of Earth and Mars technically is located across the whole world, however, due to the nature of this game, I am forced to say this region is superpositioned across the world, encompassing the whole world but at the same time not. If you join you will be a regional federation, having robust autonomy from the central government. I strongly recommend a democratic government with strong freedoms. Over and out. (Static, then fade out)
