[color=red][b][u]WELCOME SAMURAI TO THE SIX SAMURAI![/u][/b][/color]
[b]This region is inspired from &amp;quot;The Six Samurai&amp;quot;; a group of mighty warriors from the popular card game Yu-Gi-Oh! We as a region follow the traditions of the Samurai and aim to uphold our honour as nations through the completion of raids. We are of course a casual raider region who seek to destroy those who are weaker but also a fun role-playing community. Have fun budding Samurais![/b]
