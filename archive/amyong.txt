Amyong comes from old Ban and means &quot;Fertile Land&quot;. Although this jungle infested continent may be fertile, its people do not generally get the pleasures of its fruits.

The continent of Amyong is one that is plagued with civil war. After the collapse of the bloated Bawa Empire in 1956, the nation was thrown into complete chaos with its now independent states vying for the right of self-determination long abandoned by the Bawa Empire and its dynasties before it. Home to tigers and crocodiles and tropical rainforests, Amyong is also home to constant bloodbath as the many different ethnic groups struggle for their place in the world, with outside powers often watching, coveting its mineral resources.
