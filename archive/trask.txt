Trask was an estuary moon located in the same star system as the gas giant Kol Iben in the Arkanis sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin took a job to transport a passenger and her spawn to her husband, who had settled on Trask as it was the only world hospitable to their species.
