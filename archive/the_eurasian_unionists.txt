Welcome, all to [color=red]THE EURASIAN UNIONISTS[/color] . Our region is full of kind helpful players who enjoy to have a chat. If you would like to join the RP region, in which the year is currently 1800 and great conflicts are brewing, join [region]The Eurasian Unionists rp region[/region]. If you like to RP and chat, simply join this region and talk on the other region (as both regions have embassies together). Other than that, have fun!
