[color=purple][b]This is the rules for RMB posts in the newly merged RP involving St Abbaddon and The FNR.[/b]
RMB Rules (Will update this as we go)[/color]

1. Don&#39;t be a(an) [strike]asshole[/strike] toxic player and don&#39;t have any OOC arguments in the RMB. If you really need to argue with others use telegrams or other Private Message Systems like Discord. (Might need to update and explain this one better)

2. Put OOC: for any non-rp posts if you really need to post something like that on the RMB after we get started.

NOTE: STiLL WORK IN PROGRESS
