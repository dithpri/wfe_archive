[b]Welcome to Noordija[/b]
The lands of Noordija are renowned for their vast mountain ranges, sprawling forests, and hilly landscape. The region is made up of 4 great landmasses, surrounded by numerous smaller islands. A large portion of the North-West is currently occupied by the Kingdom of Wallenbergia, which keeps a watchful eye over the surrounding lands. Noordija is open to a wide spectrum of political orientations, and does not itself represent any one philosophy. Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, Uralic, Celtic, and other Northern peoples are particularly welcomed, though Noordija is open to all.
