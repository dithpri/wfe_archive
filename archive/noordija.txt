[b]Welcome to Noordija[/b]
The lands of Noordija are renowned for their vast mountain ranges, many large forests, and hilly landscape. The region is made up of 4 large landmasses, surrounded by numerous smaller islands. A large portion of the North-West is currently occupied by the Kingdom of Wallenbergia, which keeps a watchful eye over the lands of Noordija. Noordija is open to a wide spectrum of political orientations, and does not itself represent any one philosophy. Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, Finno-Ugric, and Celtic nations are particularly welcomed, though others are open to come as well.
