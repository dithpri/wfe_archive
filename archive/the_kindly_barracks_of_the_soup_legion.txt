The barracks here stand as the haven and the resting place for the Soup Legion. The center of our operation, where all Soup systems flow to. But what are our operations, you may ask? Well, we deal in cards. Our soldiers brave the unknown in search of these cards, these weapons against the armies of darkness. But we do not keep them to ourselves. None of us are warriors in our own right. And so instead we give them to those warriors, those brave people, on the front lines of this fight. The legendary heroes lauded by many. The card collectors. And there are many who wish to collect, many who wish to fight back. Tell us your story(send [nation]Pluvie[/nation] a TG), and perhaps you may receive your own weapon to fight back against the darkness!!
