The Western Antarctic region is surrounded by beautiful mountains which act as a natural barrier, separating the region from the rest of the world. Local Mount Erebus warms the region with volcanically heated hot springs that run through the valley the region is located in, making agriculture possible. The region is socially progressive and filled with diverse and interesting countries.
