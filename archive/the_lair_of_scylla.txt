This is our only way home.

You&#39;re quiet today.

Not much to say.

Captain, I have a secret I can no longer keep.

I opened the wind bag while you were asleep.


I&#39;m so sorry.


Forgive me.


Full speed ahead!
Full speed ahead!
Full speed a-heaaad!
Full speed ahead!

Eurylochus, light up six torches.

Captain, something approaches...

[i]Hello.[/i]


ROW FOR YOUR LIVES!

[i]Drown in your sorrows and fears!
Choke on your blood and your tears!
Bleed &#39;til you&#39;ve run out of years!
We both know what it takes to survive.

Give up your honor and faith!
Live out your life as a wraith!
Die in the blood where you bathe!
We both know what it takes to survive.

We are the same you and[/i]
[i]I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I[/i]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
