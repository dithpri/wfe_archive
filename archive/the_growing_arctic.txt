The Growing Arctic is made up of Nations which share a similar interest, Money and Power. We are not Raiders and we are not looking to start Wars with other Regions. We simply wish to Profit and gain a Strong Military Presence throughout the World. This region is not accepting of Nations who are founded or based off Religion, Raiding, or Discrimination.

The Growing Arctic will continue to Grow and will continue to Prosper along with the Nations that live within it.

Those who wish to join and Profit with the rest will be accepted kindly as long as the rules are followed.

We will help each other if needed and we will always be ready to take the fight to the Enemy.


Signing off, Director Natal
