	Where the giver of treasure?
	Where are the seats at the feast?
	Where are the revels in the hall?
	Alas for the bright cup!
	Alas for the mailed warrior!
	Alas for the splendor of the prince!
	How that time has passed away,
	dark under the cover of night,
	as if it had never been.[/i]

       [b]Here we honor the memories of the ancestors and their deeds, long live the Nordic warriors of old.[/b]
