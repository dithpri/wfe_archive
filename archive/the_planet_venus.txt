Venus is the brightest object in the sky except for the Sun and the Moon. It is the second planet from Sun.Venus&#39; orbit is the most nearly circular of that of any planet, with an eccentricity of less than 1%. Venus&#39; rotation is somewhat unusual in that it is both very slow (243 Earth days per Venus day, slightly longer than Venus&#39; year) and retrograde. Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth (95% of Earth&#39;s diameter, 80% of Earth&#39;s mass). Venus has thick layers of clouds composed mostly of carbon dioxide. These clouds completely obscure our view surface and produce a run-away greenhouse effect that makes Venus&#39; surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
