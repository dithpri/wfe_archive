[b]Pentos[/b] is a large port city, more populous than Astapor on Slaver&#39;s Bay. Located closest of all the Free Cities to King&#39;s Landing in Westeros, Pentos is one of the westernmost of the Free Cities. The city lies on the Bay of Pentos off the narrow sea, with the Flatlands and Velvet Hills to the east.

Like the Braavosi, and Lysene, Pentoshi are great lovers of song, and generous with those who please them. Some of their men dye, oil, and fork their beards. Pentos has a much higher population than Astapor. Bastard Valyrian is spoken in Pentos. &#151;[url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pentos][color=990000]A Wiki of Ice and Fire[/url][/color].[hr]
