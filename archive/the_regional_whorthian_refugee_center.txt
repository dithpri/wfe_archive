The Regional Whorthian Refugee Center (RWRC) is a place for refugees from smaller nations ceased of a region to join. Membership is optional, not mandatory. In the RWRC, all nations are protected with a password that will be sent in a telegram once their nation has been background checked by the authorities/Security Officers. This is only put in place to avoid raids or unwanted spamming, etc. The RWRC welcomes nations of any size or type into the region.
