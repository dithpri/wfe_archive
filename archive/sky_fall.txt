We must learn to set a goal or target in front of our eyes to gaze upon. It is only when we aim at something that we have any chance of hitting it. Vision is the power that sustains. Whatever we keep in front of our eyes is what will determine our outcome. Unpractical people burden their minds with useless and unverifiable theories, and court failure by entertaining speculations which, by their very nature, cannot be applied in practice. Those people will withhold the sky from its rain and storm because they are scared of the outcome.
