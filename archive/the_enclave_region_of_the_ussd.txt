Founded on the 6th of March, 2017, we have declared independence from the USSD after the discovery of an enclave. This region is NOT a secessionist movement of the USSD. Instead, we look upon them of their achievements. If you are a leftist, feel free to enter. Endorse our WA delegate [nation]The Dictatorship of Nate[/nation]!! We are prospering in this nation and we hope we revive more support. Fascist nations are forbidden from entering. Capitalist and Imperialist nations are allowed, but are forbidden from holding WA and government positions. If you are one of them, you will be closely watched and you are more likable to be banned for a mistake. 

Glory to the USSD, Hoora!!!
