A land tucked between two bosoms of mountain ranges, the Land of 10,000 Beers is a place where clouds of grain, yeast, and hops get together for a wicked threesome. The sexual secretions falling into pits and crevices, it ferments into lagers and ales for all to freely consume. And yet, the great prosperity has led many outsiders to be weary of the free wheeling citizens of the 10,000 Beers region. But those free wheeling citizens could care less what others think as long as natural beauty of poured beer continues to whet the lobes of relaxation and also the occasional kerfuffle.
