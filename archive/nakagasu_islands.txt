Nakagasu had been owned by the Kazuki for many years before the succession conflict. When the war turned against the Kazuki, Daimyo Hideki Kazuki planned to move his base of operations to the distant and difficult to attack island of Hotojima which had been prepared for many years to be used as a military base. During a decisive battle, Daimyo Kazuki&amp;#39;s army was defeated before it could reach the ships for their lord&amp;#39;s exodus. With the death of Hideki Kazuki, the conflict for succession was over and no military action was taken against Hotojima. The remaining soldiers left their former posts and integrated into Hotojima&amp;#39;s population.
