Disturbia is a recently discovered land mass. It seems to have appeared from no where, only adding to the land&amp;#39;s strange properties. This region is impossible to see through satellite imaging, therefore many nations doubt its existence. However, many colonies have already settled in Disturbia, some claiming status as sovereign nations. This region is rich in very rare resources, including dragon scales, fairy dust, zombies, ghostly essence, unicorn blood, and much more. Disturbia is classified as a very dangerous region, with only the truly brave and powerful nations are able to survive. Enter at your own risk.
