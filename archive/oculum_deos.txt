Due to its mass of at least 3.6 times the mass of Earth, HD 85512 b is classified as a super-Earth and is one of the smallest exo-planets discovered to be on the edge of the habitable zone.

The Planet is temperate, boasting an average temperature of about 24.6 degrees Celsius. It has a much shorter year then that of earth, roughly 54 days in total, due to it&amp;#39;s proximity to it&amp;#39;s much cooler sun.
