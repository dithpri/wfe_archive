Open to all!
The WA Delegate has some authority (it prevents raids). Endorse whoever is delegate. I&#39;ll accept all embassies. Post whatever (except brain rot). We support everyone. I&#39;ll request embassies rapidly, don&#39;t be surprised if I request dozens at once. I have a bet to get over 1000 embassies within a year. Sorry if I send multiple requests to your region. I don&#39;t plan these. In The New Region Rules, and Embassy Policy, you&#39;ll see why.
Embassies that aren&#39;t closing: 563
Under construction: 32
