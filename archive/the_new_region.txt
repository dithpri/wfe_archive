Open to all! The WA Delegate has some authority (it prevents raids.) Endorse Past Beans. I&#39;ll accept all embassies. Post whatever. If you see changes, that&#39;s because it&#39;s a new region, I&#39;m trying to work out stuff and make this region good. We support everyone. I&#39;ll request embassies rapidly, don&#39;t be surprised if I request dozens at once. I have a bet to get over 1000 embassies within a year. Send a request if you want a free embassy!
Embassies that aren&#39;t closing: 537
