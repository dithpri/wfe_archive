Open to anyone! The WA Delegate has no authority (prevents raids.) Endorse Sanana. I&#39;ll accept all embassies. Post whatever. If you see changes, like in this, that&#39;s because it&#39;s a new region, I&#39;m trying to work out stuff and make this region known for hospitality. Here&#39;s stuff about me. We support everyone. I&#39;ll request embassies in rapid succession, don&#39;t be surprised if I request dozens at once. I said that because I don&#39;t want to be flagged for potential bot behavior. I have a bet with friends to build over 1000 embassies within a year, or request one with every region. Just an FYI, the embassy list is in no order whatsoever.
Embassies that aren&#39;t closing: 227
Under construction: 124
