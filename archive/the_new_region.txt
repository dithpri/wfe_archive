Open to anyone! The only rules are the rules for NationStates. The WA Delegate has barely any authority for the region (to prevent raids.) Endorse anyone. I&#39;ll accept embassies with anyone. The region was made by 8 friends who like NationStates, that&#39;s why we&#39;re active at the same time. If you&#39;re from another region you can post whatever.
