Open to anyone! The only rules are the rules for NationStates. The WA Delegate has barely any authority for the region (to prevent raids.) Endorse Sanana. I&#39;ll accept embassies with anyone. The region was made by 8 friends who like NationStates, that&#39;s why we&#39;re active at the same time. If you&#39;re from another region you can post whatever. If you see changes in the region, like the words in this factbook, that&#39;s because it&#39;s a new region, we&#39;re trying to work out stuff and make this region good and known for hospitality. Here&#39;s stuff about my nation. We support everyone no matter what you do.
