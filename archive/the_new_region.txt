Open to all!
The WA Delegate has some authority (it prevents raids). Endorse whoever is delegate. I&#39;ll accept all embassies in regions that aren&#146;t fascist. I&#39;ll request embassies rapidly, don&#39;t be surprised if I request dozens at once. I have a bet to get over 1000 embassies within a year. Sorry if I send multiple requests. I don&#39;t plan these.
