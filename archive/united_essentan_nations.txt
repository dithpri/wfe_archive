If you are in this region, I don&#146;t know why because I never asked you to join. Maybe I should start speaking Essentan. Ic, yio&#146;ra ctall hara ir yra joct raydeng thec frim iotceda thec ragein. If you want to know what any of that means, ask either The United Essentan nations, Essentei, or North Essentei. But I welcome all even though you are probably not Essentan and you are capitalist (probably, dosen&#146;t mean so).
