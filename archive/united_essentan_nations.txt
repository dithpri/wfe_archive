[u]Welcome to the [region]United Essentan nations[/region]![/u]
[hr]If you are in this region, I don&#146;t know why because I never asked you to join. Maybe I should start speaking Essentan. Ic, yio&#146;ra ctall hara ir yra joct raydeng thec frim iotceda thec ragein. If you want to know what any of that means, ask either [nation]The United Essentan Nations[/nation], [nation]Essentei[/nation], or [nation]North Essentei[/nation]. But I welcome all even though you are probably not Essentan and you are capitalist (probably, dosen&#146;t mean so).
