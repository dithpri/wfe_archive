Drifter Region is a small region rooted in the values of freedom and civil rights, and we welcome all nations. In our region, your voice will always be heard. Whoever you are, if you come with ideas, our leader and our community will always be there to listen. We let all of our citizens vote on our laws and even on ideas for laws. Hopefully you can be a part of that and tell us what you think.
