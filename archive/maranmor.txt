Hello, Everyone! We have two rules, and they&amp;#39;re pretty basic and easy to follow! 1. No prejudice, and everyone gets a common respect, no matter their religion, race, etc. 2. If you wish to argue with or complain about someone, please do not take it up on the regional board. 
If you wish to declare war on someone, this is permitted on the RMB. [u]God modding is [b]not[/b] permitted.[/u]
