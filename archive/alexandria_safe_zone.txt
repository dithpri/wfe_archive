You see, whatever you do, no matter what, you don&#146;t mess with the new world order and the new world order is this: give me your supplies, or I will kill you. You work for me now. You have supplies, you give it to me, That&#146;s your job. Now I know that is a mighty big, nasty pill to swallow, but swallow it you most certainly will. You thought you were safe. I get it. But, the word is out. You are not safe. Not even close. In fact you are pegged, more pegged if you don&#146;t do what I want and what I want is half your supplies. And if that is too much, you can make, fight or steal more and it will even out sooner or later.
