&quot;Sun keeps rising. Days keep passing. World keeps spinning. Time. It just keeps moving forward. Weeks, months, even years go by while you try to make sense of it all. Try to find where you belong. Try to look ahead to a better future. But the truth is. The path ahead has only grown darker. It&#39;s harder to see. You can feel. So lost. So alone. So desperate for something, anything that might show you the way. But even now, after all this time, surrounded by darkness there are still flashes of light. Tiny beacons that shine out, calling to us. It&#39;s not enough to light the way ahead, but it&#39;s enough to keep going. Keep trying. Keep fighting. Keep dreaming. I haven&#39;t given up, and I never will.&quot;
