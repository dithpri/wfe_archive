Many moons ago, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] raided a different region in search of [color=brown]potatoes[/color]. They didn&#146;t find any [color=brown]potatoes[/color], but they watched in horror as the natives fled here with all of the glorious [color=brown]potatoes[/color]. Ever since, they&#146;ve been planning to take the [color=brown]potatoes[/color]. 

Thank you to [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], [region]Osiris[/region], [region]Sparkalia[/region], [region]Kantrias[/region], [region]Lair of the Dragon[/region], and [region]Purple Pony Club[/region] for helping pile!

Please endorse the WA Delegate [nation]Calon Givi[/nation] and all Regional Officers! Otherwise you will be relieved of your potatoes and face removal from the region. Thank you for your willingness to cooperate during this time of transition.
