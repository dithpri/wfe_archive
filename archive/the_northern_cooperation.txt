Founded on April 10th 2017, the Northern cooperation was made by the Allied States of Thereticus to band together some of the weaker nations of the world... Upon election a chancellor is decided on who will lead the group, surrounded by his/her appointed advisors. Trade, Diplomacy, and War are just some of the many things we offer as well as full lore under the works and IG and IRL rp for each Nation and the region/cooperation. Though this is made up of mostly new and weaker Nations, we still welcome a full variety of members and experience, no matter the political views or the political battles or debate, we hope we can provide a strong and helping Region...
