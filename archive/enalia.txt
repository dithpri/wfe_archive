Men O&#39; &#39;Thania, march to glory,
Victory is hov&#39;ring o&#39;er ye,
Bright-eyed freedom stands before ye,
Hear ye not her call?
At your sloth she seems to wonder;
Rend the sluggish bonds asunder,
Let the war-cry&#39;s deaf&#39;ning thunder
Every foe appall.
Echoes loudly waking,
Hill and valley shaking;
&#39;Till the sound spreads wide around,
The Oni courage breaking;
Your foes on every side assailing,
Forward press with heart unfailing,
&#39;Till invaders learn with quailing,
&#39;Nalia ne&#39;er can yield!
