In the days that followed liberation, North Valhaven was occupied by the Black Riders once more, only to be taken back by the proud members of North Valhaven once again.

Liberated from the grasp of the Black Riders, the proud region of North Valhaven stands.

The temporary constitution of North Valhaven can be found here:
