[color=purple]There is no regional government at this time due to the lack of a Regional Constitution.  However, if you have ideas for the constitution, you can post them on the Regional Message Board.  The government should have 3 branches: executive, legislative, judicial.  Again, everyone&amp;#39;s ideas are welcomed![/color]
