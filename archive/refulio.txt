Welcome to Refulio!
Here, you can join many roleplays or start your own. But if you are planning to not stay for long in Refulio, you should not get involved in to many roleplays. For example, if you just stumbled across Refulio, and you have plans to join or create another region, and you are in lots of roles, you could leave and create chaos over who will take your roles. 
Well, enough of the &quot;What-ifs&quot;, I only want everyone to have a good time.
Feel free to explore, introduce yourself in the comments below, and who knows. . .
you could get yourself a role!
