Hello and welcome to the Region of the oppressed. I assume you are from Summit Middle School. This is a very open region with acceptance of all kinds of ideas. Feel free to suggest ideas in polling; all will be considered. 

Okay, I have a few things to add as well.
1. We have noticed that there are people that have several countries (more than two) with an extraordinary amount of power. We won&#39;t do anything about it right now, but, be warned, there will be polls in the near future to decide what, if anything, should be done. 
2. Several executives have noticed that there is a disproportionate amount of officers for the amount of people that we have in this group. Again, this will be the subject of polling in the near future.
