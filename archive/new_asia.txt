Asia is the Earth&amp;#39;s largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres. Though it covers only 8.7% of the Earth&amp;#39;s total surface area, it comprises 30% of earth&amp;#39;s land area, and has historically been home to the bulk of the planet&amp;#39;s human population. Asia is notable for not only overall large size and population, but unusually dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.
