[color=#C00000]Formerly the Frontier region of the NSLeft, Solidarity was invaded on October 1st, 2023 by an anti-Raider coalition following provocations from pro-Raider region The Communist Bloc. The invasion and occupation, known as Operation Red October, remains the largest anti-Raider operation in history with 208 peak endorsements. The Communist Bloc has since left the NSLeft. 

Negotiations are underway to de-occupy and return Solidarity into the hands of the NSLeft, as per the May 29th, 2025 [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=568230][b]MGC-TLA Joint Statement[/b][/url].
