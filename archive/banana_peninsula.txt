Why it is named the Banana Peninsula is shrouded in myth and legend, with the most popular telling of a man traversing the globe in search of the legendary piece of land shaped like a banana. He fails in his forty year quest to locate this land of joy and wonder so gives up, finds a relatively uninhabited piece of land and names it Banana Peninsular.[/color]
