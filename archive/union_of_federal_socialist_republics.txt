The Union of Federal Socialist Republics is an organization of nations that adhere to a federal organization of government with socialist ideals. That is, they have an aggregation of governments ranging from localities, to states, and finally to a single national level of government. All member nations adopt socialism as a guiding principle to how they regulate their economies. Some may choose state ownership of all industries, while others may choose to leave ownership and management of industry to the private sector while regulating them accordingly.

All member nations must keep their civil rights and political freedoms ratings at or above &quot;average.&quot;
