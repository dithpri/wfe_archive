A continent of wealth and opportunity, claimed by the Otiran Freehold centuries ago. Its resources have been exploited and its lands settled for the glories of the Freehold. Protectorates and smaller fiefdoms dot its territory, and politically its future remains uncertain.

Any and all are welcome to visit or settle, as long as they know the eyes of the Freehold may be upon them.
