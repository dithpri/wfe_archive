The Mictlan System lies approximately five hundred light years coreward of the Sol System, beyond the Scorpius-Centaurus Association and close to the Rho Ophiuchi Nebula, giving the region luminous night skies compared to other systems within the proximity of Sol. Settled shortly after the Proclamation of Ruti-Asar by the Great Civilization of [nation]The Ctan[/nation], the system consists of five principle natural planets, though all are extensively geo-formed and innumerable lesser objects both artificial and natural. 

The five principal planets around the star are:
