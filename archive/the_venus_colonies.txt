[color=green]Hey there, traveler! Glad you took an interest in us![/color][color=gray][b] Our founder made [region]The Mars Space Colony[/region],[/b][/color] [color=blue]We&#39;ve grown a lot there since. Well, many of us have been exploring the system and hoping to reach out further. [/color][color=red]So, our founder made the 8 other regions so that they can interact with one another. You could be on every colony or just one or two. It is [/color][color=gray][b]your[/b][/color][color=red] call.[/color][color=orange] And with Embassies allowing talking to one another, it would be kind of like an actual communications call between everyone. We look forward to seeing your ideas and again, welcome![/color]
