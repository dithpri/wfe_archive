In a time of great uncertainty and global unrest, multiple fledgling nations threatened by foreign aggression and fragile economic infrastructure joined together in glorious unison under the leadership of The New Order Hierarchy. The NOH, a regional power as well as the only standing nation in a long defunct regional alliance swore that in exchange for commodities and imports, would provide protection and leadership. This renewed coalition has built itself upon the pillars of global unison and security as well as the promise of a better tomorrow, using force if necessary to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives. This diverse and mutualistic coalition of nations will continue to strive for the promise of a future united under one banner.
