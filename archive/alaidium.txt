 Alaidium is a young nation, which hopes to grow and become strong.  I believe that everyone in the region should have equal rights, even the new nations!  I will currently be looking for people to fill the WA delegate position and other positions.

Our flag meanings
- The blue circles with the lines connecting them represent the unity between the nations
- The curvy lines represent our freedom
- The Black circle with the white circle in it represent even when the darkness  seems overwhelming, there&amp;#39;s always a little bit of light to shine through the darkness.
