The International Democrat Union is a centre-right international alliance of conservative, Christian democratic and liberal-conservative political parties. Headquartered in Oslo, Norway, the IDU comprises 54 full members. It is chaired by John Howard, former Prime Minister of Australia. The IDU has some overlap of member parties with the Centrist Democrat International, but the CDI is more centrist and communitarian than the IDU.  It also has an affiliated youth wing in the International Young Democrat Union and an affiliated women&amp;#39;s wing in the International Women&amp;#39;s Democrat Union.
