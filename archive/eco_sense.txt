Eco Sense is also one of the least polluted regions in the World Assembly. Citizens can expect to live an average of 14 years longer than elsewhere.
Nations collaborate to plant native plants, grow organic and local food, and innovate new sustainable technologies. Nations are required to be low carbon and to incorporate at least two renewable energy technologies.
