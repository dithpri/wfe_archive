[b]Welcome to the New Union of Oppressive States![/b]
We may be small, but we are active often and events often take place in our region!
Regional rules can be found in the Dispatch log, if you&#39;re new!
Weekly Addresses are also sent out to give official statements and also update how the Union&#39;s states are being run!
Regular elections are held for the different roles within our region, so why not join, and see how you do?
