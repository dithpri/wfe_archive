The Novo Pact Territories is a powerful geopolitical region governed by a rigid but efficient bloc of nations, united under the watchful leadership of the Empire of Anturtle. Spanning a mixture of industrial megacities, borderland exclusion zones, and resource-rich protectorates, the NPT has redefined the notion of modern stability: centralized, calculated, and deeply hierarchical&#151;yet effective.

Although often criticized abroad for its controlled civic freedoms, militarized zones, and state-mandated loyalty systems, the NPT remains a shining example of post-collapse efficiency. Its infrastructure is unmatched, dissent is minimal, and order is absolute.
