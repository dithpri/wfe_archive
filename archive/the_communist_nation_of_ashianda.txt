The Dictatorship of Ashianda is a fledgling, orderly nation, remarkable for its compulsory military service and state-planned economy. The hard-nosed, cynical, devout population of 5 million Ashiandans are ruled without fear or favor by a psychotic dictator, who outlaws just about everything and refers to the populace as &quot;my little playthings.&quot;

The large, well-organized government juggles the competing demands of Spirituality, Defense, and Law &amp; Order. The average income tax rate is 47.5%, but much higher for the wealthy.
