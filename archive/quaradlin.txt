Welcome to Quaradlin! A strong and safe  continent, Quaradlin is a region that is intolerant of any discrimination, and therefore is usually seen as a compassionate safe haven. Quaradlin celebrates its international Quaradlin Day on January 29. An alliance with Erathis is currently in place, as well as Althea. Please endorse who you feel should be the WA Delegate. Thanks!
