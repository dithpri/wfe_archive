Bimini is a tiny land of simple pleasures.

Ernest Hemingway lived on the small island chain in the Bahamas from 1935-1937 and famously drank vodka martinis, extra dry with olives, inside the Compleat Angler Hotel, which burned down in 2006.

&quot;Swim, eat, drink, work, read, talk, read, fish, fish, swim, drink, sleep.&quot; That&#39;s Bimini, summed up by a character in Hemingway&#39;s novel &quot;Islands in the Stream.&quot;
