The Ark is a floating megastructure featured in Brink. It was originally constructed in the 2010s as an experiment in sustainable technologies. In the decades that followed, natural disasters turned the Ark into humanity&amp;#39;s only shelter from calamity. By the 2040s, the Ark&amp;#39;s resources were mostly depleted; disagreements over resource rationing led to a civil war between the Resistance, a group of oppressed lower-class workers, and the Security, the Ark&amp;#39;s police force. The Ark is located off the coast of Seattle. It&amp;#39;s current population is 10,000 persons. It is 100% eco-friendly. Ark Security consists of about 2,500 officers.
