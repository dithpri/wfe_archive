This country began as a dictatorship, a sham. This is no longer the case, our members are no longer mentally disturbed, nor are we drug addicts. Our democracy is flourishing with votes on a daily basis. But we still lack something, you. When you join this region you will not be ignored nor disregarded, you will rise in power, eventually joining a party so you can make a difference here. We also have a constitution, that dictates our code of behaviour and how this government works, this can be located under this post.
