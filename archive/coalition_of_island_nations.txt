Welcome to the Coalition of Island Nations (CIN)

This region is designed specifically, but not limited to, island and/or archipelago nation-states. The intention being we, as island nations, can form alliances and support each other in developing sustainable economies, preserving our natural resources, combating natural hazards, as well as other issues we may face. 

This region is open to all political, economical, racial, and religious beliefs. Our alliance is based off of the physical feature we all share: being an island(s), and our ultimate goal is to support each other economically, environmentally, etc.

I am still organizing and setting up this region. Feel free to join, but please be patient.
