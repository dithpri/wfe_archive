Half Earth is a planet of two halves: The normal half, and the Grey Desert.
The Grey Desert is a harsh place of regolith sand dunes, with edges at perfect 45 degree angles, a naturally formed place that is anything but natural. Most of the Grey Desert&amp;#39;s area is unknown, as satellites overhead see nothing but static when they look down upon it.
The other Half of the world is currently the Nation of The Governed, and formerly the place of the Five Nations. This half of the world is about half land and half open water.
Interestingly, it seems the slow receding of the Grey Desert has been and continues to reveal the rest of the world from the cloak of the Grey Desert.
