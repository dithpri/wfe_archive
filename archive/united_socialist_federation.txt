The United Socialist Federation (USF) is a political and economic union of Socialist member states that are Gathered Together to Promote Free Flow of Technology, Culture, Trade and Unified Law Code. An internal single market has been established through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one.USF policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development.
