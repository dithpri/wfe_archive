The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel as it forms a series of alternating ridge-lines and valleys oriented in opposition to any road running east-west. The Appalachians are home to the Buffalo Bills football team, a once-dominant team now looking to rebuild. The Buffalo Protectorate, centered in Buffalo, NY, is the acting government of the region. It is a powerful military force and strongly supports Freedom, Isolationism, and Commerce. This region is prone to devastating blizzards.
