The American Dominion is a federation of nations in North America that work in harmony together to project power across the globe and secure their futures. The American Dominion arose shortly after the Revolutionary Experiment of 1967, during which the corrupt and oppressive government of the United States of America was overthrown by Senator Davis Lockheart and the Children of American Dominion.
