Non-mandatory government exercise.

No political views espoused here are endorsed by Mr. Lowe, and should be taken as satire. 

This is a place to learn about politics and the ramifications of decisions made by politicians. 

Nations can be ejected form this region by Mr. Lowe [b]at any time, for any reason[/b]

Please keep this civil and fun, or I will have to have this website blocked.
