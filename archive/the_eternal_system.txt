Welcome to [region]The Eternal System[/region], a region full of RP experiences and just to chill out and have a good time.
We will have a map made shortly of available spaces for RP purposes, for the meantime... just have fun.
[nation]Umayyad Hispania[/nation]&#39;s puppet states are here for RP purposes, and serve no real functions other than that.
List of UH&#39;s Puppets: [nation]Nahr al-Fida[/nation],[nation]Al-Flurida[/nation], [nation]Iisbania al-Jadida[/nation], [nation]Byru[/nation], [nation]Granatah al-Jadida[/nation], [nation]Al-Barasil[/nation], [nation]Juzur al-Antil[/nation], [nation]Al-Angula[/nation], [nation]Muzambiq[/nation], and [nation]Sharikat al-Hind al-Sharqia[/nation].
Puppet states are allowed a home here, just as long as they are used as colonies or puppet states in RP.
