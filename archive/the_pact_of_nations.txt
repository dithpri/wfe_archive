You thought it was a normal factboook entry, but it was us, [region]The Black Hawks[/region]! 
The weather has been getting colder recently in the northern hemisphere, so we decided to conduct a surprise inspection with Lily to ensure that no regions are using dangerous materials such as lava for heating! We fixed some safety hazards in this region and moved on. Let&#39;s stay warm and safe together!
