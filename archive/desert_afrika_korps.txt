The Desert Afrika Korps (DAK) was the North Africa arm of the Wehrmacht during WWII. This region was created in memory of the only part of the Wehrmacht that was not full of war-crimes, and one of the only German General who was a professional, not a Nazi fanatic.

DISCLAIMER: This region is not committed to Fascism, National Socialism, or any other radical hate-associated ideology. DAK is simply a casual, easy-going region.
