The League of Nations Sovereign is the intergovernmental body formed to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security: by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war; by the prescription of open, just and honourable relations between nations; by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments; and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organised peoples with one another.
