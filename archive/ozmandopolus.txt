Ozmandopolus was foundered when the Flying Spaghetti Monster was made to duel the smartest wizard mage in the tribe of Ozmandianz&#39;s his name was Ozmandiaz, after hours of fight the FSM had honorably dieded to Ozmandiazs mana. Once dead the FSMs spiritual form granted Ozmandiaz with a wish which Ozmandiaz replied &quot;All the land as far as the eye can see&quot;, the wish was granted and the newly owned land was named after Ozmandiaz, Ozmandopolus. Ozmandopolus has grown greatly and can grow better with more nations by hand.
