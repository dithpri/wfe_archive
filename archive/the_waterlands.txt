A free region in the Eternal Ocean, where every nation lives in harmony with its neighbors... we hope!

Nations in The Waterlands are highly encouraged to join the World Assembly, and are free to vote as they wish.

A Delegate may be elected among the members at any time and may vote as per his/her personal wishes. The Founder shall not take action on anyone for how they cast their votes in the WA.

Anyone not supporting the views of the Delegate or any other WA member may chose to un-endorse him/her.

[b]The Founder shall only take action if any member undermines the sovereignty of another member and takes drastic action (expulsion/ban) irrationally.[/b]
