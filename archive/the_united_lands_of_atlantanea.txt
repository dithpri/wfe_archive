The United Lands is a region focusing on economic prosperity and civil rights.  We believe in capitalism above all.  It may not be the most fair system but creates the most powerful economies.  We are very accepting of any all ideas as long as they are not forced upon our nations.  We strongly believe in one&amp;#39;s right to choose and make up their own mind.
