[color=green]Welcome to the Alliance of the Matterhorn

The Alliance of the Matterhorn is a alliance formed when the two founding fathers Babail and Adorocco made a treaty at the base of the Matterhorn. Without boring you with a lot of backstory Babail fought with Adorocco and Adorocco won. Since then we have expanded and united with other nations in hopes of ridding evil from the world. We welcome all nations regardless of political and cultural beliefs, except for Nazis. Nazis are not welcome in the Matterhorn.
