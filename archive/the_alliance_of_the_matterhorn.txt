We are region located in the European Alps. We believe in freedom of government. We don&#39;t judge on your type of government unless you are anarchic or tyrannical, or if your nation is in anyway connected to Nazism. We believe in freedom of choice. Our countries have the freedom to choose what they do. If your civil rights end up dropping to the red level, then you will be warned. If it becomes non-existent then you will be ejected. You want to keep your civil rights up above the red level so that your economy stays strong. The leaders are the Founding Fathers of Adorocco and Babail (who is now gone). We hope you join and help everyone&#39;s nation become a stronger place!

Sincerely, The Allied States of Adorocco
