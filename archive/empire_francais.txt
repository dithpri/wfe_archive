[b]Born in the flames of the Napoleonic Wars, the French Empire is the domain of all French people and is the flame of civilization! It shall stand forever as the most glorious and powerful nation throughout the European continent, none shall stand against it - and none shall break the French Empire&#39;s and its people&#39;s established continuous hegemony over Europe.

Valeur et Discipline.

Vive la France!
Vive la Patrie!
Vive l&#39;Empereur![/b]
