We are the Technocratic Nations , a group of nations who focus on scientific thought and conduct the affairs of government through a scientific standpoint with our morals coming from weather something is justified and fair. And if it was fair to the person or entity.

                    -We are the Technocratic Nations- 

We stand strong in a world of ignorance and hatred , working together for the benefit of humanity,
Not through mob rule nor dictatorship. But by the consideration of ideas and thoughts with a hand of fairness and reason. We will work together and fight anyone who attempts to oppress us. We shall now and forever for the benefit of science and the human experience.
