The Grand Red Isles of the Eastern Pacific are a small, but stable Region, home to a pair of Sister-Nations that are tightly-knit. It is the goal of The Grand Red Isles of the Eastern Pacific to promote health, prosperity and fortune among its collective people, as well as &amp;quot;Freedom through Knowledge.&amp;quot; Knowledge is strength, knowledge is power, knowledge is freedom. It is enforced.
     Others are welcome to join, however, the right to ban nations can be used at any time with no explanation.
     We also request that all nations adopt our Regional Currency, the &amp;quot;Grand Red Isle Pound.&amp;quot;
Although it has radically different ideals than the region of Grey Earth Highlands, it shares an oceanic boarder with them, and maintains an Embassy there.
