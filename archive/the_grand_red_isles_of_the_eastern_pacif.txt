The Grand Red Isles of the Eastern Pacific is a small, but stable region, originally home to a pair of Sister-Nations that are tightly-knit. It is the goal of our region to give as much support to nations as they give to us.
     We also request that all nations adopt our Regional Currency, the &amp;quot;Grand Red Isle Pound.&amp;quot;
We welcome all new members into our midst without discrimination.
