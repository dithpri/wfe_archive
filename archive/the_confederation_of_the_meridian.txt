Founded by the Commonwealth of Corazon De Mare in 2014, The Confederation of the Meridian seeks to establish and promote goodwill and relations between nations. Situated in the Tropical equator, the nations of the Confederation are surrounded by vast natural resources and untapped wealth. With easy and open access to the world&amp;#39;s oceans, The Confederation has the necessary base for economic expansion. Respect and tolerance for all, and justice for the wronged, these are the foundations of the Confederation.
