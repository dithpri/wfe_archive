Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up! 10Beat your plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say, &amp;quot;I am a mighty man.&amp;quot; 11Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, And gather yourselves there. Bring down, O LORD, Your mighty ones.&amp;quot;-Joel 3
