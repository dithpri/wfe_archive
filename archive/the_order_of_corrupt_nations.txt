Corrupt nations join together in a land where being corrupt is not only encouraged but compulsory. In order to be a nation in &amp;quot;The Order of Corrupt Nations&amp;quot;, the applying nation must conform to the following rules:

1. A corrupt government, doesn&amp;#39;t matter the type.
2. Currency must be the &amp;quot;josef&amp;quot;. This is for easier trade between nations.
3. National religion must be Protestant Christianity, if applicable. 

Nations may feel free to raid regions and claim them in the name of The Order of Corrupt Nations.
