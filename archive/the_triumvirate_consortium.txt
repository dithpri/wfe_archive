A collection of three main nations (Isographia, Scathatch, and Nettlethornia), The Triumvirate Consortium prides welfare, education, and freedom above all else.

The Triumvirate Consortium&amp;#39;s respective national leaders frequently meet to discuss the good of their populace and the furthering of mankind at large. Despite the outwardly extreme appearance of their some national rulings, these leaders have their peoples&amp;#39; best interests in mind at all times.

The Triumvirate Consortium&amp;#39;s regional motto: &amp;#39;Where&amp;#39;s the harm?&amp;#39;
