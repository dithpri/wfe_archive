The NS Think Tank was designed to spread knowledge across regions who wouldn&#39;t normally discuss with each other. In the future, symposiums and debates will be held to discuss regionomics and NS Political Theory.

If you want your NS political theory/regionomic journal, paper, or thesis posted in the dispatches please do send it into the officers for peer review so then we can post it alongside others!
