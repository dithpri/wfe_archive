The UPNC was an interesting place. Some pretty fun RP, even when the [i]post-nuclear[/i] aspect was really not that relevant, considering the presence of space fleets and the colonization of other planets. [region]Independent Post Nuclear Union[/region] was it successor region, formed by a coup of ROs from the UPNC. 

Seizing this name for the sake of securing history. Should you have any nostalgia-related business with the UPNC, toss a telegram at either [nation]BlackLight Covenant[/nation] or [nation]The Armada of Refuge[/nation]; preferably the former of the two, but I&#39;ll notice on the latter sooner or later as well.
