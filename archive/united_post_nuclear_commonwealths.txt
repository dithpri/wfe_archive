[b][color=blue]Welcome to The United Post-Nuclear Commonwealths![/color][/b] This region is set in the not-so ruined ruins of a horrific global nuclear war which initially killed 30% of Earth&#39;s population and dissolved most governments. Consequently, a large portion of the remaining population was killed by radiation, mutated animals, the Canadians, a giant Panic, and maladies related to such. Now, 200 or so years later, there&#39;s a global population of around 5,267,530,389. Happy Scavenging! (Also please note; [u]this is [b]NOT[/b] the Fallout universe.[/u])
