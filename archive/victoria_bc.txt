Victoria, capital of British Columbia, sits on the craggy southern end of Vancouver Island. With abundant parkland, it&#146;s known for outdoor activities. The city&#39;s British colonial past shows in its Victorian architecture, including stately Craigdarroch Castle mansion. Butchart Gardens, with 55 acres of vivid floral displays, plus statuary, water features and a carousel, is one of many formal gardens in the city.
