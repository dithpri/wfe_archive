Our region is small but expansive. We look forward to new residents and new political views. Everyones voice matters in this region. When it comes to our regional decisions we do take topics seriously and encourage debate. If you wish entry into our region simply contact the founder or delegate to be examined,if we like your politics the password will be yours. Our only real policies are mutual respect towards our fellow regional nations and we delete our post board messages after there no longer relevant(no real reason,just an unintentional tradition that was made)
