The mighty Imperial Oyster Union has taken over the entire local group of galaxies-except for the 1% of stars that have not been explored. That is where we hide. Our home-world, Kelgre was destroyed by the IOU. We had well over twelve billion people get killed within a few days. Now, the IOU occupies our planet like crazy, and we have to sneak off every now and then.  We can thank Nhioleutvaumn for donating spaceships that have stealth drives. We will never beat them, but we could possibly do damage. 

Oh, yes. Later, I will post a link to the scifi blog that I have. It is still a major work-in-progress. It supports the IOU, telling their side of the story.
