It is named after the sacrifice made by thousands of unpaid interns for the sake of building the grand palaces of the many nations in the region. Also faxing. Every May, the citizens of the nations of Internia gather in remembrance of Franklin Blunt, who faxed so much that he died.

The nations of Internia represent a diverse range of political and economic systems, ranging from liberal democracies to oppressive totalitarian regimes. While this frequently creates tension, conflicts are generally resolved by uniting around the common cause of celebrating unpaid interns.
