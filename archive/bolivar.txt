[nation]Terran Bolivar[/nation] is a country bordering both [nation]Terran Columbia[/nation] in the east and [region]Sargon[/region] in the south. It is a nation inhabited by small-sized races, predominantly the Perros, with limited self-defense capabilities while possessing rich Originium deposits, but its abundant natural resources result in the fracturing of the nation into three warring factions.

Currently, [region]Bolivar[/region] is partitioned into two de facto independent states ruled by their respective factions: a monarchy in the west and an oligarchy in the east, and the third faction consists of liberated zones freed by local guerrillas but under the rule of an authoritarian junta.
