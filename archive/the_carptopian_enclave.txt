The Carptopian Enclave is a stunning region located on a remote island surrounded by the Swirling Sea, in some ways is sounds like paradise. You can smell the fresh air and nobody here would cause trouble, so its kinda the placewhere you can get away from your troubles and make new friends. Everyone here is treated as an equal and all we ask in return is that you give this region your full respect.
