[b]THE CIVIL WAR IS OVER. The loyalty of the people of the southern states - regardless of race, creed or color - is to the United States of America, not any hooded society of bigots whose purpose cannot stand the light of day.[/b] So if Klansmen hear my voice today, let it be both an appeal and a warning to [b]get out of the Ku Klux Klan now[/b] and return to a decent society before it is too late.

[u]ALL OF THESE LAWS WILL BE HONORED IN THIS REGION[/u]

So I call on all [u]true[/u] southerners - who come in all colors and are neither ignorant nor bigoted - to JOIN OUR REGION! [b]Let&amp;#39;s build a Great Society together![/b]
