This region was occupied by the [region]National Socialist Party[/region]. It was then captured by [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=antifascist_allstars][b][color=red]Anti[/color][color=black]fascist[/color] [color=red]All[/color][color=black]stars[/color][/b][/url], but later fell to [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region].
