Gutella is located in the upper-left corner on any map of the Klamis Universe&#39;s Girth-2, one of the two hospitable planets in the whole entire Klamis Universe. While there are many more universes in this vast multiverse, each with its own number of hospitable landscapes and terrains, Gutella is located here.
