Qothyae is the geographical term used to designate a region located in the northern hemisphere that stretches over ten million kilometres, sharing borders with other continents and limited by water bodies on coastal areas. Most areas of the region share a similar temperate climate and a bountiful amount of natural resources yet to be explored by the many nations that occupy Qothyae.

Qothyae is considered &#39;home&#39; by several cultures and their respective nations, of great struggles of the workers against monarchies. The threat of a global war is always on the horizon but the almost perfect balance of powers and continuous development has led into an era of faux peace and diplomacy under the Qothyae Federation.
