Welcome to MonarchistEurope! This region has been created to see how Europe might appear if every European country had a monarch as head of state. The royals, and events that affect them, of this region are often inspired by reality, but a great deal of imagination as well, which hopefully fuse together well in this region. The development of this region has been well planned, so much so that all member states have already been assigned, so if you have not been invited you will not be able to join the region. However, should you wish to make any comments or ask any questions, please feel free to contact any of our member states.
