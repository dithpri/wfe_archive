Aecheros is an Isolated, Large, and Resourced filled continent roughly 26,000 square kilometers and contains many different biomes and climates. Formerly a hotspot for colonies and dominions now burned away in revolution and liberty. Full of Anti-Authoritarian and Anti-Monarchist nations, many radical ideologies that believe the people should rule, one way or another, have risen from the ashes of empires to make this place their new home.
