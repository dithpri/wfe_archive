The Lost Isles is a pseudonym given to a small region in a remote part of the globe. The region was once a powerful center of commerce and military might in the world but the old empires that used to to rule it have long since collapsed. At the moment there is very little global political presence in The Lost Isles however the open lands and lack of a ruling power have left the region ripe for the founding of new nations.
