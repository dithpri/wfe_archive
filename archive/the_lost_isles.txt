After being invaded, and loosing all of its history and culture being destroyed (3 times), The Lost Islands was forced to rebuild from the ground up, with regional reforms and reinstatement of leadership.
the Lost Islands rebounded, kicking out the invaders, and setting up a new Council of Regional Affairs, a conglomerate of like-minded states, to protect themselves from any more would-be invaders.
the region has a culture of pride and militarism.
