[b][color=#CB2727]This Region is rebuilding after a long war that had taken millions of lives. [/b] [/color]

[b]Welcome to the Torn Earth, land of destruction; but survival.[/b]
Here, nothing really happens. This is simply a region for refuge, a place to lie down.
Although warmongering countries attempt to hurt us, we stand as strong as we can, and we plan to help you as well if you decide to hammer your stakes in to our lands!
For a complete and absolute retreat from society, visit [region]Underneath The Torn Banner[/region] for refuge via secret meetings with your officials.

[u]Features of our region:[/u]
[i]-Quietness
-Small community
-Large level of freedom
-(Hopefully) falling off the charts[/i]
