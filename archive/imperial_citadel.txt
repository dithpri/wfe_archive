Located on a rather pleasant looking landmass -with a history of rather nasty insurrections and lopping off of peoples heads at rather inopportune times- The Imperial Citadel has a bicameral Parliament of Nations and, a Council for the Most Royal heads of State. All of whom gather together and get absolutely plastered at least once a year.
