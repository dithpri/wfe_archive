Eternia was the original home planet of the ancient people known to modern Etherians as the &quot;First Ones.&quot; It is also revealed to be the birthplace of Adora, and its name is used repeatedly as a password to access technologies left behind on Etheria by the First Ones. Original She-ra was Mara, then Adora that moved to Etheria, while He-man/Adam remained.
