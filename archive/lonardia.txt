A land of eternal winter. Legend has it that until the two fabled heroes return, evil will reign over Lonardia. This evil takes form as a witch who oppresses and takes all dignity away from Lonardian nations. The first of the heroes, Mussolini, is a wise and mighty wizard who can control storm and ice. The second hero, Billy Will, is a young yet powerful warlock who takes his power from the nine hells. Alas, these heroes have not been seen since the fall of the beloved king, Ruff.
