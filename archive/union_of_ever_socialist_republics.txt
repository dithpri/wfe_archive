This used to be a thriving region before the founder lost his password. This meant that many of the officers left and they weren&#39;t removed from admin. Some of them banned random nations before they left. Due to this the founder abandoned this region and took his alts to another region. During this time, our colony got invaded. This region has a bright history of defending against raiders, rigged democratic votes and communism. I won&#39;t be surprised if someone invades this region or this region stops existing.
