[b]Welcome to the Global Alliance[/b]

The Global Alliance is an alliance of nations, working in cooperation for the general betterment of each state, and of the region as a whole. As we are a new region, the first several nations to join will be able to take on leadership roles in the region, if they wish, or they are welcome to sit back and watch.

The GA provides a safe, respectful, non-aggressive environment where everyone has the right to free speech and a voice in regional affairs. We value alliances over armies, treaties over terror, and ideals over intimidation.
