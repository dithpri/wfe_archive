Welcome back!

We here at the Isles of the Dragon have been working hard to make this year another great NationStates year. Philip has set up a voting page for international issues to be solved, and Casey has set up a chat page for you to roleplay your countries in. Both are located in the Google Drive. Any questions about these can be sent to Philip or me (Brady).
Happy Governing!
