The Ghosts are an elite group of Snipers, Spies, Assassins, Mercenaries, Soldiers, Rogues, Mafia, Marauders, and Raiders that have banded together to create a Safe haven for those who don&#146;t have a place among common society. Though the people who reside here have dangerous jobs, They look out for one another and never leave a man (or woman) behind. The Safe haven collects and sells intel for trading cards and can be paid trading cards to raid other regions. All intel is sent to [The Sabotuer] via telegram and the person who gives the intel, If important enough, will be paid in trading cards. There is role play involved and raiding is allowed. Come Black Market members, come one and all!
