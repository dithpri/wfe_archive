Positivity runs through the veins of almost every South-Western Isles. Where some see problems, they see opportunity. The country was founded on the idea that anyone can achieve anything they set their mind to, so it is no surprise that most South-Western Isles  seem entirely void of self-doubt or negativity. For expats, this means a friendly, welcoming population ready to help new arrivals settle in. Most towns have a strong sense of community and don&#146;t be surprised to find neighbours offering help and strangers saying hi in the street. They may even give you a hand with your removals to South-West Isles!
