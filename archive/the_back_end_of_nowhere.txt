The Back End of Nowhere was founded when, after a peaceful and routine exchange of political power in The East Pacific, mapmakers in [nation]Veiledwheels[/nation] found themselves hopelessly confused (a problem which had plagued the nation since it&amp;#39;s inception, despite it&amp;#39;s consisting of a chain of islands). Frustrated and over budget, the cartographers made an executive decision to throw out their records and simply start over from scratch. This decision somehow bled to parliamentary channels, eventually resulting in the Nation emancipating itself from it&amp;#39;s former home, with little fanfare and absolutely no notice from the Global population at large.
