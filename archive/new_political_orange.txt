[color=orange]Welcome to the true NPO; where freedom is abundant and the sharpies are [b]girthy![/b][/color]
[hr]We provide asylum to those whom are political refugees sailing from the tyrannous [color=blue][u]New Pacific Order[/u][/color], which is the [b]illegitimate[/b] government of [region]the Pacific[/region].
[hr]One day, the [u]false[/u] government of [region]the Pacific[/region] will be [b]removed[/b] and the [b][region]New Political Orange[/region][/b] shall be the true [color=orange][b]NPO[/b][/color]!

[hr]

We will attempt to send [i]the Pacific[/i] an embassy request in order to establish a line of communication and [b]to prevent the war between the NPOs[/b], as I only wish for their illegitimate government to step down and for mine to be instated. Very noble goals, indubitably.
