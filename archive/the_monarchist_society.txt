The Monarchist Society is a region made up of the remaining imperial or monarchist powers of the world. The Monarchist Society&#146;s main goals are to one, preserve the existing monarchist powers and two, spread the monarchist ideology to other regions. All members of this region will by joining agree to spread monarchism and not stray from the monarchist ideology. I wish to state that you are allowed to join The Monarchist Society if you are not monarchist, however you must make an honest effort to become monarchist as soon as possible.
