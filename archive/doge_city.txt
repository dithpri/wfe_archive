Hi! I am the only complete english speaker of the founders, Marty McDoge. I also speak doge language, ofc. Anyway, welcome to Doge City, or, if you prefer to call it by its original name, New York City. Doge City has many things you can do, like:
Eat nuggs
Lick while driving (as long as u dont hurt anyone)
AND MORE!
With no strict laws! (unless u make it to where we have to make strict rules) And, first ten people here will become officers.
Have a good day!
