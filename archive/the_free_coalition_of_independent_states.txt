The Free Coalition of Independent States (FCIS) is a formal union between states meant to encourage peace between nations regardless of individual political, social and economic policy. FCIS is bound together by the desire to create a world community based on the importance of conflict and compromise in a diplomatic setting. Our aim, is to achieve complete toleration and understanding even when the dichotomy between states seems too great to accommodate.
