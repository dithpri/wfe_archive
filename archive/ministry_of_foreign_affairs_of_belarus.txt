Our foreign policy
Independent since 1991, Belarus chose to build a balanced and multi-directed foreign policy that would see close relations with Russia, Europe and the rest of the world. Co-operation with nations and international organisations below is vital to encourage our sustainable development and support our lucrative export potential. Belarus will not choose between closer relationships with EU or Russia. Our foreign policy seeks to harmonize these relationships as they complement each other and benefit our development and security.Dialogue, equal partnership and non-discrimination are at the heart of our foreign policy.
