[b]The UCR[/b] is the official puppet storage region and jump point for the [b][color=#FE0000]Red Liberation League[/color][/b]. We are a band of socialists, communists, anarchists and others of the left committed to the defense and liberation of peaceful communities throughout NationStates. The League is not based in any region. Its members are natives of regions from all over NationStates who stand in solidarity with their comrades, insisting on the right of all peaceful people to self-determination.
