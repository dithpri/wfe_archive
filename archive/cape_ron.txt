Briefly Taken by [region]The Black Hawks[/region], the nation of Rhamrun has successfully reclaimed his seat on the throne of Cape Ron. 

[nation]Amtierusen[/nation] attempts to cement himself in the Cape Roni History Books, but like a piece of wood during low tide... he drifted away.

I hope y&#146;all had fun with your exercise... but it won&#146;t happen again.


Thanks for Coming!


[region]Cape Ron[/region] is a Novus Lucidum Outpost.
