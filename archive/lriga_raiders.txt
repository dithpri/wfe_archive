The Lriga Raiders are a close knit group of misfits and outcasts. Their main purpose is to increase their ranks until they can invade and pillage other, weaker regions. Also, they are known far and wide for their skills as bakers and their breads often adorn the tables of the wealthiest nobles in the land. Oftentimes they will use these delicious loaves as a ploy to gain admittance to these residences and then proceed to pilfer everything that isn&#39;t nailed down.
