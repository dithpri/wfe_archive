Welcome to Omlis! Omlis is a low fantasy world with influence from past, modern, and some post-modern technology. Omlis draws heavily from predominately Eastern and Oceanic real life influences, but any nation is free to join. 

Omlis is a human dominated world, though the humans are mostly descended from elves who survived the Great Misfortune nearly 15,000 years ago. Elven culture and language is still influential on Omlis, but they are all but extinct by the time humans were created.
