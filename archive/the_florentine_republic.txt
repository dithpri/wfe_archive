The year is 1478, and the great Italian Renaissance is in full swing, with the mighty and prosperous Florentine Republic at the center of it all! [i]La popolo[/i] go about their daily business, wealthy merchants reap bountiful profits, [i]la Chiesa cattolica[/i] holds all of Europa in its sway, and [i]la Signoria[/i] participate in a contest of politics and intrigue to ascend up the political ladder and influence [i]la Gonfaloniere[/i] himself!

Enjoy your stay in [i]Firenze[/i], but it would behoove you to remember...[i]those who make themselves sheep will be eaten by the wolf.[/i]
