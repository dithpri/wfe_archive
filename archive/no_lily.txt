We are a movement launched by The Great Universe. If you live here I recommend going to [region]The Great Universe[/region] once the password is lifted. 

Regional RMB Topic: How did you find out about [region]NO LILY[/region]?

Regional Orders: Recruit! We need more nations to help fight [region]Lily[/region]! Also, make a puppet and free [region]Ducatalot[/region] by joining the WA! 

Remember, you will all be moving to [region]The Great Universe[/region] in 3 days. In other words we are moving on April 24th Eastern Time. Note: since we currently have a poll I need to know if we should have a password. I say no. And yes, the idea sucks &amp;#128542;. NO INAPPROPRIATE WORDS! Otherwise it&#39;s suppression. If you violate it a second time, ejection.

Current: CALM, FOR NOW.

Official Ideology/Religion: Anti-Lilyism
