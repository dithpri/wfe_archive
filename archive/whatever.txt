[b]Welcome to Whatever![/b]

We are a region who are proud to not involve ourselves with pointless debates about religion or politics or whatever other silly little beliefs people have and want to force upon everyone else.

[b][u]There are only three real laws in Whatever:[/u][/b]

[b][color=red]1: All the stuff in the previous paragraph - This is pretty obvious, you just read it.[/color][/b]
[b]2: Refill the coffee jug if you drink the last of it, nobody likes the guy who leaves it empty.[/b]
[b][color=red]3: Any usage of the terms &amp;#39;left-wing&amp;#39; &amp;#39;right-wing&amp;#39; etc. Are strictly prohibited. I realise this is basically the same as rule one but I cannot stress this enough.[/color][/b]

If you feel like you can handle these three rules and whatever else I decide to make up on a whim, you are absolutely welcome to join.
