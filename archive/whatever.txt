[b]Welcome to Whatever![/b]

We are a region who are proud to not involve ourselves with pointless debates about religion or politics or whatever other silly little beliefs people have and want to force upon everyone else.

There are only two rules to Whatever:

1: Refill the coffee jug if you finish it.
2:All that stuff I wrote in the first paragraph.

If you feel like you can handle these two rules and whatever else I decide to make up on a whim, you are absolutely welcome to join.
