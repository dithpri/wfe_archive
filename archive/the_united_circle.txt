[b]Welcome to the United Circle![/b]
Here in the UC, we don&amp;#39;t care what you have done prior to joining this brave new region. If you were a bloodthirsty raider, rebel communist, fascist, libertarian, conservative or whatever, you are still free to apply here.

[b]What are the rules?[/b]
we do require you to endorse [nation]zedikistan[/nation] as our meme delegate. The United Circle is bounded together under a common purpose for dank memes and community. Also, don&amp;#39;t be a moron.

Other than that, enjoy your stay in your brand new home. You&amp;#39;re here forever. :^)
