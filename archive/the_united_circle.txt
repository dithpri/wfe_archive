[b]Welcome to the United Circle![/b]
Here in the UC, we don&amp;#39;t care what you have done prior to joining this brave new region. You should be aware that this region doesn&amp;#39;t really engage in political role-playing, and almost all of these nations belong to people within a group off-site, so you may not understand some injokes or really even have a discussion in here unless you were apart of it to begin with!

[b]What are the rules?[/b]
we only require you to endorse our delegate.
