After our great lord and master Hyrkush Dragal descended onto this mortal plane, the skies burned and the land cracked open, split by waves of fire and water. The Earth shook and mankind was cast down from its towers of arrogance and greed, returned to its rightful place at Hyurkush Dragal&amp;#39;s feet. 
Give unto him your mind and your blood!
Rejoice, for your pitiful, pained existence upon this world will soon be at an end!
Insanity and Death await us all!
Hyurkush Dragal!
