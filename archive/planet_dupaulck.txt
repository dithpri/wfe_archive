DuPaulck is a map spanning a massive fictitious Type 1 Civilization planet with many Earth-like continents open for taking. Current day, to reasonably advanced technology levels, and with realistic to satirical RP between players. Not to be taken too seriously- let&#39;s have fun, both diplomatically and explosively!

Trade with neighboring nations, or sign deals for trade far across the seas for rare resource opportunities. Influence your way to the top in the global sphere, or Pillage your enemies beneath the bottom of the planet&#39;s crust.
