Crownlands or crown lands (Kronl&auml;nder) (1849&#150;1918): This is the name of&nbsp;all the individual parts of the Austrian Empire (1849&#150;1867), and then of Austria-Hungary from 1867 on.

Habsburg Monarchy&nbsp;(German:&nbsp;Habsburgermonarchie), or&nbsp;Danubian Monarchy&nbsp;(German:&nbsp;Donaumonarchie), or&nbsp;Habsburg Empire&nbsp;is a modern&nbsp;umbrella term&nbsp;coined by historians to denote the numerous lands and kingdoms of the&nbsp;Habsburg dynasty, especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 to 1806 (with the exception of 1742 to 1745), a member of the House of Habsburg was also&nbsp;Holy Roman Emperor, the&nbsp;Holy Roman Empire&nbsp;itself (over which the emperor exercised only very limited authority) is not considered to have been part of what is now called the Habsburg Monarchy.
