 [b]Welcome to Imperial Great Britain![/b]

Imperial Great Britain is a protectorate of The [b][region]New British Empire[/region][/b]

It is our goal to establish an independent native population, our protectorate only serving to prevent this region from falling into the hands of those who would only use it as a hollow trophy region.

Those who wish to join Imperial Great Britain and join us in this endeavor are more than welcome to. Upon the establishment of a stable native population and a capable government the region will be left to this renewed population.
