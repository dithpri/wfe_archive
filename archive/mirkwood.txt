Welcome to Mirkwood.

[i]The entrance to the forest is like a sort of arch leading in to a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together. The pathway is narrow and winds in and out among the tree trunks. The quiet was so deep that your feet seem to thump along while all the trees leaned over and listened. [/i]
