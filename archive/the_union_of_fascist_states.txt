[color=red]The Union of Fascist States has been invaded by [region]The Glorious Peoples Red Army[/region]! Our flag now hangs high above their cities as freedom now belongs to the peoples here! Too long has fascist power spread like cancer! Too far has fascist reach gone unchecked! Now is the time of revolution my fellow Proletariat! Glory to the hammer! Glory to the sickle! Glory to the motherland![/color]
