Founded in 1776, shortly before the American Revolution, the Bavarian Illuminati were a secret society with a revolutionary ideology, and a centralized structure. According to Nico Zambuto, they subverted the Masonic lodges of Europe, and were one of the key driving forces behind the French Revolution. New members were gradually initiated into the group&#39;s radical ideas, which, according to Zambuto, were a mix of anarchist and authoritarian in essence.
