The League of Liberal Nations is a vibrant growing community for those who are sick of all the politics of the larger regions. Here, people can thrive and live in a League of supportive and protective nations that are bound by out liberalness. We are built and founded on a Social-Capitalist Society where the needs of the many outweigh the few. Welcome Home!
