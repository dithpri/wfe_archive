We are the region for the regionless, the mothers for the motherless, the beaten finally able to stand strong. With the days of many no longer with us, we have commenced the celebration of a new age with understanding in the pits where we wish our souls to be. We stay strong under our fatherless region and we contain mercy within our walls. This is Dux Milan. Welcome home.
