[b]WELCOME TO DUX MILAN![/b]

This region will be accepting new members until scheduled Board of Selectmen elections on January 15.

[i]The Selectmen will serve as Dux Milan&amp;#39;s executive authority and will legislate the region&amp;#39;s domestic and foreign policies. Those leaders will also be responsible with moderating the region&amp;#39;s first [b]REGIONAL MEETING[/b], which may amend or approve a [b]Constitution[/b] that will be submitted by your founder.[/i]

We are also holding a landgrab for our regional map and first-comers will get first choice with map placement.
