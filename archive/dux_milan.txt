If anybody is interested....please check out [b]The Region of Dux Milan[/b] and our new regional website. We will be accepting new members until scheduled elections on January 15, when the region is scheduled to choose three nations to serve on the region&amp;#39;s Board of Selectmen. 

We are also holding a landgrab for our regional map and first-comers will get first choice with map placement.
