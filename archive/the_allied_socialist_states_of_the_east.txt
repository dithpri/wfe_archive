[b][u]The Allied Socialist States of the East[/u][/b] or simply put, [b]T.A.S.S.E[/b], is an alliance where like minded socialist nations band together against those that oppose our way of life. [b]T.A.S.S.E[/b] in itself is not an aggressive alliance and will not actively seek out violence against other nations. 

[b]T.A.S.S.E[/b] was formed to solely provide a safe haven for other socialist states.  Ideally, [b]T.A.S.S.E[/b] members are to be respectful of the opinions of different nations, be they as contradicting to our own. As such, [b]T.A.S.S.E[/b] asks the outside community to respect their own ideals and opinions. 

[b]T.A.S.S.E[/b] strives for unity and freedom like all nations. Let the world be a glorious place for all.
