*** ALERT TO ALL NATIONS WITHIN REGIONAL BORDERS ***
This is it. We have the necessary 15 members to vote on administration positions. A new pole will be made soon with a list of all the possible positions. Vote on what position you would like to hold. We will have four admins, including myself and my right hand, which will be re-elected after all new positions are voted on. No alternative accounts may vote, if they are found to be voting, all accounts connected will be kicked from the region for a max of one month. This a zero-tolerance policy. Good luck to all, and I look forward to working with the new administration.
