It&#39;s election season here in Crodown, and all of you are welcome to join in on the fun. Elections will be kicked off by the election for Director of Regional Affairs (Finished; Tristlock won), then followed up closely by a two-way election between The Dictatorship of Whipitoutistan and The Order of Guns N Freedom for the Director of Foreign Affairs (Ongoing election), which will then be followed up by a hot and sweaty three-way election ;) between Whodapie, Firelock, and LordHarambe for Director of Entertainment, and election season will finally end with a closing ceremony. I wish you all luck, and please, get out there and vote!
