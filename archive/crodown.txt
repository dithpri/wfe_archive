The administration of Crodown challenges you, nations new and old to our borders, to get out there and recruit as many nations as you can. The nations with the most recruitments at the end of the month may win something special. Any nation recruited by another nation should lodge a message on the message board detailing who recruited them and at what time. Please, if you have an alt, do not say that your main account recruited you to Crodown, as that would be cheating. We want NEW nations, not the same ones with different names. Please note that alts are still welcome, just not counted as new nations, per say.
