Congratulations election winners!

Election season is over! We will hold a new election in about 1-2 months. As for you new nations coming into Crodown, we welcome you to our region. If you have any suggestions on what we should do or any regional activities you&#39;d like to see, feel free to message any of the current admins, Aegris, Tristlock, Whipitoutistan, and Firelock.
