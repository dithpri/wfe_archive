This region fell to the mighty and thunderous march of [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region]&amp;#39;s Imperial Army! General Bob Moran led the forces to secure a new record for the Army, to greet his appointment as new CIGS; with General Josh Sebastian helping in the charge. Only time will tell until the a new one is made!

Long Live the Emperor! Long Live the LKE![/b]
