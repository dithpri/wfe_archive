Vracks is a devout and decentralized holy empire built on centuries of religious doctrine and military conquests. Though a single emperor rules nominally, true power is decentralized among hundreds of semi-autonomous territories, each led by its own duke, count, or prince. The central binding force of the empire is its official state religion, which provides a common purpose and an extensive hierarchy of clergy that influences all aspects of life.
