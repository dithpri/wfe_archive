Vracks, an indomitable empire of the mid-20th century, defied the limitations of its era by fusing devastating blitzkrieg tactics with cutting-edge, proto-jet technology and nuclear fission research. Its forces, a terrifying mix of disciplined infantry and mobile mechanized divisions, swept across continents with a chilling efficiency that left traditional powers reeling. While other nations relied on sheer industrial might, Vracks&#39; strength lay in its semi-modernized infrastructure and ruthless, centralized command, a system powerful enough to threaten a new global order.
