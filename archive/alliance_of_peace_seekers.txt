The region&#39;s primary objective is to settle peace throughout the global scale. We go out to other regions to end conflicts such as regional warfare or foreign invasions through peaceful diplomatic solutions. The Alliance of Peace Seekers distribute treaties and alliances as well. Join our humble nation to bring up our goal to the World Assembly.
