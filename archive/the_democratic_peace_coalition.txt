[hr][color=red][I]This region&amp;#39;s goal is to unite the larger leftist regions of NS so that we can take the first steps toward bringing peace and equality between people who otherwise are caught in conflict with each other. We will accomplish this by making the DPC the core of everything leftist, this will be the place where peace treaties are discussed and signed. This will be the place where leaders will meet to share regional issues that will be discussed and solved through civilized discussion and action if necessary. Most importantly this will be the place where we begin to have a real voice, that will be heard, by the community.[/I][/color]
