During the period when tigers smoked, there were 2 islands, Tharokai and Avath. The most ancient of their countries were Third Sconia, [nation]Chandichi[/nation], and [nation]Ardasia[/nation]. The others were [nation]Shinnai[/nation], Soukoshi (now [nation]Chulyong[/nation]), New Chian (now [nation]Patthangao[/nation]), [nation]Vestang[/nation], and Dynasty Nonseong.
One day, New Chian declared war on Shinnai. Dark times began, people were starving. The war also caused the collapse of the Dynasty Nonseong in 2 territories, South Horikiana and North Horikiana.
The region Three Kingdoms United was formed, peaceful times have come.. But is it forever?
