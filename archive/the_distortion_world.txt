A quiet place, possibly due to radiation. A quiet void under the multiverse which has a doorway somewhere in the Caucasus; it opens it&#39;s doors for those who wish a quiet but easy existence. 

Rules:

1. Don&#39;t be a racist/homophobic/fascist nation.
2. Don&#39;t post on the message board. I made this region specifically so it wouldn&#39;t be spammed with the red icon 24/7. It&#39;s a peaceful place for a reason.
3. You must be a World Assembly member, and you must endorse me (otherwise I will kick you from the region; this is basically my only request to enter). 
4. That&#39;s about it. Message me if you need something.
