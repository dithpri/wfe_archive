New Lacia.

[color=999999]Rest in peace, Captain [/color][url=www.nationstates.net/nation=czesfjord][color=gold]Czesfjord[/color][/url][color=999999]. All Lacia will miss you. It&#39;s my deepest regret that things had to end this way. You deserved so much more than I or the rest of Astellaria could have ever offered you. I just wish I saw that before you left us. We&#39;ll miss you so.

God rest your soul.[/color]
Lacia is in mourning of our fallen brother until 1st of May. I ask that we refrain from RMB discourse until then.
