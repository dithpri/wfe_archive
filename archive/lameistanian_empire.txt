A large empire ruled by Lameistania
however Lameistania only has full jurisdiction in Lameistania and the only power we have in the rest of our empire is military power and financial aid. Lameistania is not the only nation that can have a military...however any non-Lameistanian made military is classified as militia. We hope you will join us. We have lots of land and resources. Note when threatened the whole region must defend as one. The regional flag has a picture of the Lameistanian Insignia on the region&amp;#39;s landmass. Puppetry is allowed here because more nations means a bigger region.
