War Rules

To declare war on another country, you need to post your declaration in the chat, call your allies and warn your enemies.

1. Prepare the event. Set a time, have a referee to make sure decisions to get out of hand and invite your allies and enemies
2. Create your map. I recommend Inkarnate, its a good website for creating maps. (I can make war maps for anyone who asks)-Jentrad-(Lucas)
3. Choose your rules. Decide beforehand if nukes are allowed, how many units people get etc
4. Decide surrender terms. Its better to choose these beforehand to stop fights.
