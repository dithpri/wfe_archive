The District is home to Nations that focus on War-Time preparedness.

The Countries within The District may be called upon at any time to support each other.

Upon entering The District, World Assembly Members are required to endorse the Founder, [nation=War District], in order to comply with The Districts standards of voting within the Security Council.

Pending Nations will be screened for issues involving War Crimes and Overall Preparedness for War.

Nobody is guaranteed a protected status within The District, and Nations may be ejected from The Nation at any time.
