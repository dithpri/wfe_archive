The region of Remnant has been liberated by the forces of the NLRAF and their brave allies, so the region may be returned to its rightful owners, the NLR.

The true owners of this land, The Allied States of The Conservative Peoples, The Holy Empire of Waifuopolis, The Democratic States of JanTrani, The Democratic States of Veritry, and the true leader, The Empire of Waifustakistan shall once again lead, free from the tyranny of DEN.

Let it be know that any attacks made by DEN onto the lands held by the NLR shall be met with force.




-Marshal Of NLRAF
