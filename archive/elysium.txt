[color=green][b]Welcome to Elysium[/b]
[i]A quiet and peaceful region[/i][/color][hr][hr][color=limegreen][b]Elysium[/b] is a conception of the afterlife that developed over time and was maintained by certain Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults. Initially separate from the realm of Hades, admission was reserved for mortals related to the gods and other heroes. Later, it expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic, where they would remain after death, to live a blessed and happy life, and indulging in whatever employment they had enjoyed in life.[/color][hr][hr] [color=green][b]Pax Aeterna! | &amp;#913;&amp;#953;&amp;#974;&amp;#957;&amp;#953;&amp;#945; &amp;#949;&amp;#953;&amp;#961;&amp;#942;&amp;#957;&amp;#951;![/b][/color]
