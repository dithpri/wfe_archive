The Basque Union was founded on February 3, 2016 by the People&#39;s Republic of the Basque People. It aims to unite the nations with Basque populations under one banner The founding nation is very civil rights-conscious, but does not have much freedom. It&#39;s a cool trade-off that makes the Basque Union full of the most interesting nations in the website. Just remember, only you can decide how Basque your country is.
