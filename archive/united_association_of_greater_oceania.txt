Welcome to the United Association of Greater Oceania. Feel free to join if you want.

We allow free speech here because democracy and republic is best.

However, there are things that aren&#146;t allowed.

1. No impersonating or making rebels of other people besides you without that nation&#146;s permission. 

2. No liars/telling fake news. We want the truth.

3. Kalot Xi has to approve any bans, unless Fort June decides the matter should be voted on.

4. Polls every week!

5. Have fun!
