Unitrik, a green planet with ever-changing unions and a lust for war. Their years are four-hundred days, their days are seventy hours, their hours are forty-five minutes, and their minutes, well their minutes last just over one-hundred seconds. In these strange and dangerous war-times, three unions stand.
The privately led, secretive, and powerful Galaxatico-Ronneux union, the United Kingdoms of Crilititrix, intelligent but physically weak are most of these people, and the Kaantalos, neutral but ready for battle whenever the time calls.This is the Galaxatico-Ronneux Union. Be wary.
