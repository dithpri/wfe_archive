Welcome to Capitalists! 

Capitalists is a region founded to give those people who are libertarian, conservative, moderate, or anyone who opposes socialism and insane government spending and regulation!

&amp;quot;[i]The historical debate is over. The answer is free-market capitalism.[/i]&amp;quot; - Thomas Friedman
&amp;quot;[i]Capitalism has its weaknesses. But it is capitalism that ended the stranglehold of the hereditary aristocracies, raised the standard of living for most of the world and enabled the emancipation of women.[/i]&amp;quot; - Camille Paglia

I haven&amp;#39;t decided for sure if I want to run with this region or not. For now I&amp;#39;m reserving the name in case! Stop by and let me know if you are interested.
