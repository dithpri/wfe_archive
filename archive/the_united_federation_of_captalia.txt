HELLO THERE! WHY ARE YOU TALKING SO QUIETLY? 

WELCOME TO THE FEDERATION OF CAPTALIA. WE ARE A BAND OF PEOPLE WHO GATHERED ON LIVEJOURNAL IN CHRISTMAS OF 2010 TO CELEBRATE THE GLORIOUS BLOOTHBATH THAT BEGAN OUR CIVILIZATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION, CHECK OUT THE HEART OF THE ALLIANCE: THE PRINCIPALITY OF CAPTALIA.

WE&amp;#39;RE A PRETTY SILLY, RELAXED BUNCH. ALL OF US ARE IN THE LIVEJOURNAL COMMUNITY CAPTALIA. WE ENJOY PICTURE SPAMS, RANDOM THINGS, HETALIA, SEVERAL OTHER FANDOMS, AND SPEAKING LOUDLY.
