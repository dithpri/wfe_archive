Originally communist (and presumably silly), this region was occupied by the [region]Union of Fascists[/region]. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b].

Its remaining occupants are being evacuated and its resources salvaged. Fascists, if you want the land back, you will have to wait until around early March, by which time the innocent people of Tropico will be safe.

Fellow antifascists, please see the RMB for an important message.
