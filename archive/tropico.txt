Originally communist (and presumably silly), this region was occupied by the [region]Union of Fascists[/region]. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b].

Most of its remaining occupants have been evacuated. Full withdrawal was planned for December 27th, but what the heck, it&amp;#39;s the Christmas season. Tropico will live on for at least a while longer :)
