Welcome to The Nuclear Wastes. This is a collection of nations all around the world situated in Highly Radioactive zones, or nations that own a crap ton of nukes. As long as your nation has seen some radiation, either through nuclear Testing, a Nuclear War, or just outright Sunlight, it can join. 

Also, Don&#39;t forget to have your daily dose of Strontium-90.
