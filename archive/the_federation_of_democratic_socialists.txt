The Free Association of Democratic Socialist Republics of Tectevia, also known as the Democratic Republics of Tectevia believes that the interests of Tectevia cannot be upheld by the existing Leftist powers. It also believes the same of the North Pacific. As such, it has founded the International Socialist Alliance, a safe haven for the far left that rejects the Marxist-Leninist dictatorships normally associated with Leftism and the social democrats typically associated with Socialism. The FDS seeks to spread Leftism and ensure prosperity of Leftists.
