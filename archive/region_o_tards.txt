&amp;quot;I am William Wallace. And I see a whole army of my countrymen,
here in defiance of tyranny! You have come to fight as free men. And
free man you are! What will you do without freedom? Will you fight?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Two thousand against ten?&amp;quot; - the veteran shouted. &amp;quot;No! We will
run - and live!&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot; Wallace shouted back. &amp;quot;Fight and you may die. Run and you
will live at least awhile. And dying in your bed many years from now,
would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for
one chance, just one chance, to come back here as young men and tell
our enemies that they may take our lives but they will never take
our freedom!&amp;quot;
