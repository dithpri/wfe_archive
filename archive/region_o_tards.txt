It&amp;#39;s the eye of the tiger
It&amp;#39;s the thrill of the fight
Risin&amp;#39; up to the challenge
Of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he&amp;#39;s watching us all with the
Eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin&amp;#39; tough, stayin&amp;#39; hungry
They stack the odds
Still we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive
