[region]Sargon[/region], formally known as the [nation]Sargon Empire[/nation], is a Terran country bordering [nation]Terran Minos[/nation], [nation]Siesta[/nation], [nation]Terran Columbia[/nation], and [nation]Terran Bolivar[/nation] that encompasses the southernmost desert of the continent.

It is an imperial monarchy ruled by the famous Shahanshah who shares his power with regional Padishahs and Lords Ameer. Although the balances between these regional governments are checked though annual tributes or skirmishes, it results in fracture of the country as the ruling Shahs remain powerless in handling tribal conflicts.
