&amp;quot;You know that guy you see going into the convenience store when you stop off at that little town on the way to grandma&amp;#39;s house? A sort of shifty looking fella who buys a pack of smokes, a couple of lotto scratchers and a tall boy at ten in the morning? The kind of guy you wait for to come out before you and your family go in? Well, that guy is me. My name is Earl. And if you took the time to really get to know me, find out what kind of person I truly am instead of just stereotyping me because of the way I look, well, you&amp;#39;d be wasting your time, because I&amp;#39;m exactly who you think I am. Hell, I&amp;#39;ll pretty much steal anything that isn&amp;#39;t nailed down.&amp;quot;
