Rules
1 One account per person, no alts
2 Nations that join after a WA delegate election has started, or on the day it started, are not allowed to vote during that election. This is for the purposes of someone winning a vote for WA delegate because they got a bunch of friends to create nations so they could win without winning the popular vote of people that actually care about the region.
3 NO DEFAULT FLAG
4 Be active in the RMB
5 No asking people to endorse you unless you are the WA delegate
6 isn&#39;t really a rule, but a WA delegate election will be held once a month
7 Send a telegram to [nation]Corrupt Dictator Doges[/nation] if you want to ask for powers. Specify what powers you want and what the title would be.
