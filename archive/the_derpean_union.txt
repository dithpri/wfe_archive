We are The Derpean Union. We&amp;#39;ve suffered many losses due to a large scale alien invasion, many of our allies and members were wiped off the map. Luckily, Swaggain and Brandenburg fought together and fought off the collective Alien invasion. The Derpean Union has been severely damaged, many of it&amp;#39;s landscapes having been erased, but through these ashes the rest shall rise, Sir Swaggy and Sir McGoohan will rise in this time of despair and both shall prepeare for World Domination, beacuse...The Derp never Falls.
