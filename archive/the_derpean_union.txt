The Derpean Union has been reborn. IT WILL RISE ONCE AGAIN. THEY ARE BACK, YOU SEE. DYLANUS NYANUS, LULUBELLE III (Lord of Gayz), HEINRICH MCGOOHAN, &quot;Ryan Nayr&quot;...? AND AUGUSTUS PONTUS TRONNICARUS.


The Derpean Union is a glorious region with large variety. Advanced science, large armies, colossal failures, and, in some areas, big mountains of (possibly living) toxic substance.
What a great place to be.
The Derpean Union, however, will eventually rule the world. THEY WILL BECOME THE BEST OF THE BEST.
But first, they&#39;ve gotta solve some issues within their nations about privatizing a postal service.
Damn.
