We are The Derpean Union. We are 11 powerful nations, and together, we can do anything. We have overcome problems in the past; we will overcome them in the future. So many threats have passed through our region, and so many remain. Despite all of these hard tasks we have been put through, we have survived. A powerful nation brings poweful men. Thanks to Dylanus Obama Nyanus, Sir Sad, Sir Lulubelle III, Sir Swaggy and Lord D-Dawg, I can say it&amp;#39;s been a hell of a ride, and it&amp;#39;s going to continue.
