This region is made up of protectorates and select territorial allies for [i]The Princess of Demonos[/i], Vera Fallenangel: sovereign of The Principality of [nation=noflag]Demonos[/nation]. It also serves as a signature for all of Lady Vera&#39;s proclamations, dispatches, and telegrams. 

Lady Vera is a staunch opponent against any regime that oppresses its people. She is an ally in the fight for equality. However, her rule is not democratic because she is an absolute monarch. As one who knows great power, she strives to be the &quot;philosopher king&quot; the ancients once surmised could rule benevolently and give the maximum happiness and comfort to the maximum amount of people.
