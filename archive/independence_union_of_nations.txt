The Independence Union of Nations is a region for independence. If you want more information, contact [nation]Democratic States of Andora[/nation] in the [region]International Arctic Union[/region]. When we get 10 nations, I will start a regional government. As for now, we&amp;#39;re going to have to get some more nations. I may even start Role Plays on the Regional Message Board, like Inter-Regional Wars, Economic Depressions, and Terrorist Attacks.
