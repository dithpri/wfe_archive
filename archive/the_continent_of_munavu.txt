President Quinn Fox Williams had all citizens including woman and children to be sacrificed in the name of the Precursors and herself. The sacrifices were brought from the small neighboring nation of Ventonia. All where painfully and personally executed by President Williams. The 15 year old President has already brought the rest of Sagerism&amp;#39;s neighboring nations to their knees!
