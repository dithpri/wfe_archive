War! The harsh jungles of Munavu are being flooded with Sagerist troops and Jaranian troops. The Munavu War is starting and recruitment numbers are up. Many young men destined to go to college will now have to put that on hold and fight in a war to defend their country from attacks from the new nations that Jarania is supporting. Bases and bunkers are being setup everywhere while generals on all sides are coming up with tactical plans. This war could bring Munavu&amp;#39;s wildlife and beautiful landscapes down to ruins. Will this war tear Munavu apart from the inside?
