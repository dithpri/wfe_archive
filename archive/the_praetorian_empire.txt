&amp;quot;I was sitting in the gloomin&amp;#39;, and a man passed the window. He was the lamplighter. He pushed his pole into the lamp and lighted it. Then he went to another and another. Now, I couldn&amp;#39;t see him, but I knew where he was by the lights as they broke out down the street; until he had left a beautiful avenue of lights. Ye&amp;#39;re all lamplighters. They&amp;#39;ll know where you&amp;#39;ve been by the lights you have lit.&amp;quot; - Sir Harry Lauder 

They were the lamplighters; a symbol of THE LAST KINGDOM LOSERS !!
