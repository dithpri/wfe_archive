Also known as the New Republic, it is the galactic, democratic government formed from the ashes of conflict during the waning years of the Galactic Civil War, absorbing the political and military leadership of the Rebel Alliance after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. The New Republic followed in the footsteps of the Galactic Republic, commonly known as the &quot;Old Republic&quot;, restoring the Galactic Senate and fighting the shattered forces of the Galactic Empire.
