The United Islands of Isolationist Hermits was founded when an unfortunate set of natural phenomenon forced the formerly dispersed landmasses into close proximity. A combination of strange currents, winds and magnetic attractions brought together islands of entirely different geography, climates, and people who had thought they had finally escaped the need to deal with the rest of the world around them. This forced meeting has set a new interactive structure in place whereby the peoples of this newly created region must work together in order to maintain their distances and differences.
