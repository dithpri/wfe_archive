The Indian Government decided to stretch a little to find out its former allies &amp; older regions, intending to keep them intact for India&#39;s future. If anyone has objections, contact [nation]Akhand Bharatam[/nation] or [nation]Indusse[/nation]. The region was liberated from the Black Hawks until over time it got lost in time. When raising objections - give evidence of your legitimate residency in this region. Foul play &amp; mendacious stories shall bear consequences &amp;#128521;
