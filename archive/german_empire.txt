This region maintains its independence from tyranny only by the personal sacrifices of [color=green]Von Moss[/color] and [color=3060C0]Deleted Nation[/color]. This region was once the personal retreat of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and this region will be kept alive by reigning Kaiser Wilhelm III von [b][i]Germany[/i][/b] for austerity&amp;#39;s sake.

December 02 is &amp;quot;Imperial Day.&amp;quot; Every year we remember this sacred day; the anniversary of removing past blights from the Empire and the ascension of Kaiser Wilhelm III.
