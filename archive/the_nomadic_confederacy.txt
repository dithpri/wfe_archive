The Nomadic Confederacy is a heavily decentralized union of nomadic peoples, designed to provide nations with a community without being heavily influenced by others. The region is isolationist, anarchist, and peaceful. All who desire a place to stay are welcome, even civilizations. Any decisions that need to be made will be decided by a majority vote, no matter how important.
