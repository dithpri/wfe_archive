Welcome to the [b]Union of Nationalists[/b] ([b]UoN[/b]), an international Union to achieve National ideals.

1. We hail any NationState that knows its Nation is of vital importance, and the State a tireless pursuer of its interests.
2. We look down on all varieties of insidious communism and creeping globalization&#151;fighting their many forms.
3. We accept a wide range of nationalist ideologies; from anarchists to democrats to fascists.
