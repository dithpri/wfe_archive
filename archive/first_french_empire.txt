The First French Empire (French: Empire Fran&ccedil;ais), also known as the Greater French Empire or Napoleonic Empire, was the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte of France and the dominant power in much of continental Europe at the beginning of the 19th century.

On 18 May 1804, Napoleon was granted the title Emperor of the French (L&#39;Empereur des Fran&ccedil;ais) by the French S&eacute;nat and was crowned on 2 December 1804, ending the period of the French Consulate and of the French First Republic. The French Empire won early military victories in the War of the Third Coalition against Austria, Prussia, Russia, Portugal, and allied nations, notably at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 and, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, at the Battle of Friedland in 1807.
