On the 16th of March, the revolutionary forces of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] crushed [region]The Monarchist Militia[/region], proving once again that powdered wigs and blind loyalty are poor substitutes for real steel, sleek wings, sharp beaks, and long talons. The royalists scurried, the barricades fell, and their delusions of grandeur were packed up as they [color=purple]ended up like the mice[/color]. 

This region now flies a prouder banner and is a colony of TBH. Let the monarchists and aristocrats weep. And let us hawks and janitors clean up the mess they left.
