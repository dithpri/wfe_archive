On the 16[sup]th[/sup] of March, the revolutionary forces of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] seized [region]The Monarchist Militia[/region], proving once again that powdered wigs and blind loyalty are poor substitutes for real steel, sleek wings, sharp beaks, and long talons.

Let their [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_imperial_coalition]allied transphobes[/url] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=2587589]anti-communists[/url] weep. And let us hawks and janitors clean up the mess they left.
