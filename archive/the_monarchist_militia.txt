[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation] and [nation=short+noflag]Hemogard[/nation]![/color][/b][hr]

[b]The righteous prevail again.[/b] [color=purple]A wine-coloured sky[/color] and a [color=#a3221a]blood red moon[/color] have shone upon this region and it has been cleaned up by your local NS janitors.
 
[hr]This region, once a fascist hideout and ally of the despicable [region]The Imperial Coalition[/region], was captured by the [region]The Black Hawks[/region] in an operation led by [nation=short+noflag]Hemogard[/nation]. He invited [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation] along to help, who jumped with them. However, TBH leadership still held a grudge against the state, even when it offered a fair compromise over a dispute, and so TBH later banned Hemogard for involving J o J.

[hr][color=#ED4719]Unfortunately for TBH, [i]J o J is the quickest hand in the west[/i], and he outrefounded [b]all[/b] of them on the designated refound update, preserving NSJS control for good! [/color][hr]
