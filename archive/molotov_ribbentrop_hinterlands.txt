A land of stark ideological polarization that has somehow, by some mistake of cosmic balance, become a force of power across the world, forming into a mighty coalition of unlikely allies that have occupied the snug, rolling Hinterlands that border the Sunset Sea, West of Cyrodiil and North of FYROM.
