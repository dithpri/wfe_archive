The old courthouse has been re-purposed as a venue for punk, hip-hop and other anti-authoritarian musical stylings, as well as other kinds of performances. In the foyer a display has been set up, to preserve the memory of the hilarity that once took place in this building. The documentation of the old Gestapo court proceedings, and the schism in the Nazi movement are available for perusal. May the fascists fracture themselves out of existence!

Not to be confused with the imitation [region=The International Gestapo Courts], this region is a real liberation by real antifascists.
