[B]Communists: there you go again. It seems like &amp;quot;leftist solidarity&amp;quot; is very much a myth these days, seeing as how they sat by while [region]The Republics of Cuba and the Caribbean[/region] died a slow, painful, drawn-out death. They did nothing when they were raided originally, and did nothing when their founder, a former ally of theirs, ceased to exist. And they didn&amp;#39;t even try, either out of ignorance or laziness, to save it from us. It just shows how quick the statist left can turn on their own.

Anyway, good job to the participants in the 8-day operation, which was commanded by myself:
Sergeant of the Active Corps [nation=short]The Neo-Confederate States of America[/nation]
Corporal [nation=short]Right-Winged Nation[/nation][/B]
