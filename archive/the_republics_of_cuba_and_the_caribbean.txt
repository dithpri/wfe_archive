[b][color=teal]Description: Situated largely on the Caribbean Plate, the region comprises more than 700 islands, islets, reefs, and cays. Warm, moist tradewinds blow consistently from the east creating rainforest/semidesert divisions on mountainous islands.

Fauna: The waters of the Caribbean Sea host large, migratory schools of fish, turtles, and coral reef formations. Parrots play in the palms. Caymans and bright colored frogs slosh in the marshes. Geckos, crabs and scorpions crawl across the sand.[/color][/b]
