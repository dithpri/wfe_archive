Extraria, a fantastic region full of varying nations, that have very differing opinions. It&amp;#39;s quite chaotic, really, but things tend to work themselves out.

Okay, well, they don&amp;#39;t tend to, it just happens... sometimes.

Kinda.

Rarely.

Just sayin&amp;#39;, don&amp;#39;t be surprised if a couple little explosions pop up.

Administrator of Extraria is Emperor Zanir VII of [nation]Zanir[/nation].

Pimp Daddyland of Extraria is [nation]Sublland[/nation].

ANNOUNCEMENT: Extraria&amp;#39;s borders will be closed in accordance with the impending apocalypse, as to reduce the chance of infection. Rulers are advised to prepare to devote their military forces to stop this undead invasion, or to look into the possibilities of a cure.
