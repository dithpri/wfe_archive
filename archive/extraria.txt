Extraria, a fantastic region full of varying nations, that have very differing opinions. It&amp;#39;s quite chaotic, really, but things tend to work themselves out.

Okay, well, they don&amp;#39;t tend to, it just happens... sometimes.

Kinda.

Rarely.

Just sayin&amp;#39;, don&amp;#39;t be surprised if a couple little explosions pop up.

Administrator of Extraria is Emperor Zanir VII of [nation]Zanir[/nation].
