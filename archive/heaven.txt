The Gates of Heaven have once again been thrown open.&nbsp; Come, join us in the white light.

This is the final resting place for all good souls, regardless of race, creed, religion or lack thereof.&nbsp; Heaven shall make no law respecting the establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&nbsp; All are welcome, Atheists and Anglicians, Hindus and Hippos.

Also, be excellent to each other for smiting has not been ruled out.

Also also hello.
