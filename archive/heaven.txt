The Gates of Heaven have once again been thrown open.  Come, join us in the white light.

This is the final resting place for all good souls, regardless of race, creed, religion or lack thereof.  Heaven shall make no law respecting the establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  All are welcome, Atheists and Anglicians, Hindus and Hippos.

Also, be excellent to each other for smiting has not been ruled out.

Also also hello.
