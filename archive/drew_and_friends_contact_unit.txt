[color=red][b]ATTENTION, HACKER:[/b][/color]
So, you&amp;#39;ll read this at one point or another. When you do, know that you are in the wrong. We did nothing to you, you hacked the region. Trust me, you will never, [i]never[/i] be welcome here.

So stay in the Rejected Realms, and don&amp;#39;t come back. If you do, then know this:
I will stop at [i]nothing[/i] to keep you out.

This is the guy with the banlist.

Checkmate.
