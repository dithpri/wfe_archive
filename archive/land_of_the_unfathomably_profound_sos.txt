The Land of the Unfathomably Profound Sos was created by The Great Jorj himself and is home to only a select few nations worthy of the Path of Jorjian Governance. Several thousand years ago, The Great Jorj created this land for The Nine Original Jorjites after they won the Everlasting Battle for Kooz against the Filthy Koozonians. Since the creation of the Land of the Unfathomably Profound Sos, the descendants of The Nine Original Jorjites have been living here and multiplying.
The Great Jorj has zero tolerance for nations unworthy of the Path of Jorjian Governance. Any nation that is not worthy of the Path of Jorjian Governance is not fit to exist in the Land of the Unfathomably Profound Sos.
