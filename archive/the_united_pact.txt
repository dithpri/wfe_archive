The United Pact is a pact of nations, focused on security and happiness for not only you, young leader, but your people too. However, there is more to the pact than all this professional stuff. 
Have a fun chat with me or some members, and even read up on some pinned factbooks!
There is more being made for the pact on occasion every day, so hop in and have some fun!

And make sure to grab some Continental Cookies!
