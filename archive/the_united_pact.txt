The United Pact is a pact of nations, founded on May 28th 2022 and refounded on September 25th 2022, focused on security and happiness not only for you, young leader, but your people too. But there is more to the pact than just the professional stuff. Have a fun chat with me or some members, and even read up on our beliefs in politics too! There is more being made for the pact every day, so hop in and make sure to have fun!


And make sure to grab a continental cookie!
