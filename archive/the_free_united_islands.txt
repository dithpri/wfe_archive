The FUI is currently inhabited by the follow nations:
[nation]Liber Terra Island[/nation], [nation]Amare Sexus Somniabunt[/nation], [nation]Apri Island[/nation], [nation]Capita Island[/nation], [nation]Ashclepia[/nation], [nation]Moana Island[/nation], and [nation]Navaja Island[/nation].

The goals of this regional community are civil libertarianism, political democracy, compassionate economics, non-interventionist foreign policy, and preservation of the islands&#39; natural beauties. These are, however, only broad goals for the region; the FUI strongly believes in national sovereignty and thus chooses to enforce only the respect of basic human rights, equality, and freedom in the region.
