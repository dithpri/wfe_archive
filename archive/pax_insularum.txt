A collection of thousands of Islands, seperated from other continents by massive seas. The Islands, ranging from tiny to huge, are home to various nations of different people, cultures and values. However, all nations share one of their biggest value: Equality. The Nations here all value the Equality of their citizens in all aspects. With this, all nations here are generally pacifist, as trade is freely flowing between the nations, and military conflict has been absent for millennia.
