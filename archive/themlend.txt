Themlend is a large archipelago located exactly 498,491 and a half km from another landmass (except for the giant phantom squid of gems, but there have been no confirmed sightings). It contains approximately 1,221 islands, ranging from 23 square centimeters in size, to 289,116 square kilometers.  Most of the environment is of a mountainous nature, but there are several notable exceptions, for example, the Great Blue Jungle of Ju&amp;#39;Noff, the Desert of Whispers, and the Devirakk volcanos. Of it&amp;#39;s 1,221 islands, only 352 are known to be inhabited. Notable wildlife includes whistling boars, Thor&amp;#39;s bears (which generate up to 500 volts when angered) the Giant Snail, and Yeeth (shark/bison/wolf hybrid).
