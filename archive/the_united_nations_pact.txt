[b][color=purple]Message From Founder And WA Deligate,[/color][/b] [nation]The Flamingo Clan[/nation]

Hello! I would like to say a few things that are on the agenda. [color=teal]These are very important,[/color] so stay with me please.

[color=orange][b]First[/b], we need to adress the fact that we have a low member count, so we need to bring in more people. We also need people specifically for the invitation of old and new region members. Contact me via telegram.[/color]

[color=red][b]Second[/b], we have almost no world influence, so we need people who will influence the world.[/color]

[color=yellow]And [b]finally[/b], we need to [b][i]CHANGE THE WORLD[/i][/b]![/color]

Founder, WA Deligate, and [nation]The Flamingo Clan[/nation] President, Issac Florence.
