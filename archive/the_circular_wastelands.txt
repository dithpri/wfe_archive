&quot;Six times hath the circle grown,
Six times hath it yet to grow.
Many empires built and fallen,
Ashes fallen down below.

&#145;Twas from this sunken plain of doom,
A new foundation freshly made.
The fallen peoples of years long past
Shall once again pervade.

Throughout this barren, sullen Earth
We drift along throughout all time.
To a newly erected shrine of dawn
This poem is meant to rhyme.&quot;
