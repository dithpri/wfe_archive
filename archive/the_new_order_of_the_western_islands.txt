[b] [i] The New Order of The Western Islands  [/i] [/b]

The New Order of The Western Islands was founded as a region to escape from the corruption of the original Western Islands. Some of the natives of The Western Islands joined. 

The founder of the region, Cykatrotzka, has permanent executive authority. However there will be elections to choose the President and the cabinet of the President. The reason behind giving the founder permanent executive authority is to make sure the region can be saved in case of corruption, as we faced in our last region. This region is starting off small, but we will most likely start to allow new nations to join after a certain amount of time.
