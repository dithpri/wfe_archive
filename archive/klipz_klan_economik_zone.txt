[b]Today birds of many feathers featured in the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy&#39;s ships today, from owls, to penguins, to dragon-tigers. We sailed hard in choppy weathers, and you know what? By the end of our venture we had some idea of what we were doing, and pulled some friends out of the water on our last target. If you&#39;d like to fly high like birds, sail the seas, or just hang out with your mates, we&#39;d love to have you.
