The Mardela Alliance is an accord of cooperation among a series of like-minded nations. The participating nations agree to free trade and a defensive pact between all member nations. The region has determined that it will stay out of the World Assembly. This policy of isolationism allows member nations to make their own decisions rather than allow foreign nations to dictate their actions.
