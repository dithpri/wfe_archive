Mainland is a region of NationStates that excepts all newly created countries to be able to join. We would kindly appreciate ONLY Socialists, Republics, and Democracies. If you become Communist you will receive a telegram stating that you have 20 days to once again become a Socialist, a Republic, or a Democracy.

If you do not comply with the 20 day warning YOUR COUNTRY WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THIS REGION!!!

Otherwise these are the rules! If we decide to create any new rules we will send a telegram stating the new rule.
