Sour Patch Kids taste good in barbecue sauce.

The taste of a sourpatch kid dipped in barbecue sauce is just super good. The tangy taste of the barbecue mixes really well with the bitter and sweetness of the sour patch. This can work well with other gummy, but sour patch kids are the best.

Edit: Wow im either an actual monster or pregnant, either one isnt great, ill post a video of me eating it since people think its a joke
