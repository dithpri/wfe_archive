Asking for a friend

Is there a sexuality for people who&#146;re only attracted to 2d anime girls with fat tiddies? Ever since I&#146;ve been a young lad, I&#146;ve been revolted by the sight of real-life women, but Japanese cartoon characters have really done the trick for me. Every Friday night since 2009 I&#146;ve dressed up in traditional Japanese clothing and swung around a sword for hours, honing my katana skills - preparing for the day that I move to Japan and become Hokage. Am I alone? If not, what&#146;s it officially called? I thought &#147;hentaisexual&#148; might work but that sounds kinda retarded to me the more I think about it.
