I&#39;m sorry to inform you all, but I have some terrible news regarding the Annoying Orange.

As we know, he was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer last year, which was most likely caused by his years of inhalant abuse. However, his treatment seemed to be going well.

After his trip to Shanghai last week, he tested positive for COVID-19. This destroyed all treatment progress he had made. At 2:35 A.M. last night, Annoying Orange passed away surrounded by loved ones. His dying words were reported to be &quot;nya nya nya&quot;.
