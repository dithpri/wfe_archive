Felix Alfarth was one of 16 Nazis who died in the infamous Beer Hall Putsch. Although the coup attempt failed miserably, Hitler used his subsequent publicity to his advantage. Right-wing influence in the government allowed him to serve just 9 months of his 5-year jail sentence. During this time, he wrote [i]Mein Kampf[/i].
