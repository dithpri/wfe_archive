Welcome, fellow brothers and sisters, to the Nightosphere. Here, we all follow our leader, Hudson Abadeer. We have all the bananas you could ever want ( just wash your mouth out after you eat them). We must all worship the Mighty Conch, which has lead our people to freedom and got us through the toughest of times, even if it involved doing nothing. So come join the Nightosphere, where you can boat over people&amp;#39;s heads( catchy commercial ending song).
