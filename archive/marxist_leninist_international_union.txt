The Marxist-Leninist International Union is an association of nation states that adhere to Orthodox Marxist, Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, or Maoist theory. This region is run by a central communist vanguard and all decisions that affect the region must be submitted to a democratic vote of the elected members of the MLIU Communist party. This region rejects all forms of revisionism, ultra-leftism (including such positions as euro- and council communism) and (Post)Anarchism as counter-revolutionary tendencies. Message the executive director for the password and submit a deceleration of adherence to any form of Orthodox Marxism or derivative of Marxist-Leninism.
