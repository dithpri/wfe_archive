The Marxist-Leninist International Union is an association of nation states that adhere to Orthodox Marxist, Marxist-Leninist, Stalinist, or Maoist theory. This region is run by a central communist vanguard and all decisions that affect the region must be submitted to a democratic vote of the elected members of the MLIU Communist party. This region, while primarily Leninist in orientation, is a Pan-Leftist Union and so welcomes all anti-capitalists to participate in the region.
