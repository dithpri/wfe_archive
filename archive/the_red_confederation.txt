[Color=Maroon][b]Welcome to The Red Federation - Free from the World Assembly - A Union of Dictators[/b][/color]
[hr/][b][i]As stated above we do not endorse interaction with the World Assembly, nor do we wish to have a WA Delegate. Previous affiliation with the World Assembly will be put against you. We also do not approve of democratic nations within the region. Any nations showing democratic characteristics will be ejected from the Union and the Region, or The Citadel Defence will no longer cater for a democratic nation&amp;#39;s needs.[/i][/b]
[i]It would be a great courtesy for any nations wishing to join The Red Confederation to withdraw themselves from the World Assembly.[/i]
