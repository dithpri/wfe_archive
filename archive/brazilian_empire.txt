[i][b][color=orange]&quot;Welcome to the Brazilian Empire! Founded under the principles of civil liberties and equality under law, the Empire of Brazil is a constitutional, parliamentary monarchy co-ruled by the Prime Minister and the Emperor. We are tiny now, but we are recruiting. A constitutional convention will be called when the region reaches 10 members.&quot;
