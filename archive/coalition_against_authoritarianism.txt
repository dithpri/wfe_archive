[i][color=navy][B]The Coalition Against Authoritarianism[/B][/color], a Coalition against the proliferation and continuation of Authoritarianism, was created so that regions and their causes may be amalgamated in their political crusades against the ideology so that they may be more effective. As such, we the regions propose that all regions against Authoritarianism put aside their differences and join together in order to construct a lucrative relationship, based on an affinity in interests, to create the Coalition Against Authoritarianism. Regardless of one region&#39;s political orientation, any region with a rejection of Authoritarianism will be embraced and welcomed with open arms into the Coalition.[/i]
