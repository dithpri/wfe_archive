[color=#653F9E]This jump point has been harmonized by [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region]&#39;s [/color][color=#F216F2][i]Secret Pony Division[/i][/color][color=#653F9E] in honor of the many  fluffy wolves bullied by the defender meanies.

While the North Pacific Army may have relocated its forces here, they didn&#39;t properly maintain this region and thus it becomes a monument to [B]PONIES[/B] for like 12 hours until it&#39;s detagged. Through both victory and failure, may we never forget what we fight over. 

[b]Remember Pax Ordexxj.
Remember the Islamic Republics of Iran.
Remember [region]Friendship is Malice[/region].[/b]

And may the fortresses defenders deploy from keep having their founders CTE cuz this was fun.
