You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I&#39;ll rise.

...

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I&#39;ll rise.

--From &#147;Still I Rise&#148; by Maya Angelou
