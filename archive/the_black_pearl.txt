[b]Welcome aboard, my lad![/b]
Come, set sail with us. Scrub ye decks and listen to yar Captain (WA Delegate)!

[i]Yar not convinced yet?[/i]
Ye be poor, but setting sail as an outlaw with ye pirates with the possibility of riches under ye danger of ye &amp;#127468;&amp;#127463; Empire&#39;s gallows is risky but worthy.
[i]Yar convinced yet, lad?[/i]
Ye &amp;#127468;&amp;#127463; Empire calls we pirates outlaws, and ye Empire threatens our necks and heads, but we pirates be far richer than ye Empire&#39;s sailors!

[hr][b]OK, seriously, we need a Captain. The WA Delegate will become the Captain.[/b]
