[b]Welcome aboard me ship, lad![/b]

Ye want riches? Well ye will get riches!

We pirates be nobles of the high seas! Defenders of virtue on the waters! Role Models for the ambitious!

With ye billowing sails and ye mighty cannons, we ask ye &amp;#127468;&amp;#127463; Empire&#39;s sailors for ye [strike]treasure[/strike] [color=red]booty[/color] and leave without a fight. But if ye &amp;#127468;&amp;#127463; Empire&#39;s crew chooses to fight, and we pirates be cruel, asking ye &amp;#127468;&amp;#127463; crew to mutiny and join us, and we pirates&#39; bigger crew leave no officers or commanders alive.

So, my lad, come sail with us! Though ye &amp;#127468;&amp;#127463; Empire calls we pirates outlaws and forever threatens our necks and heads, we pirates be far richer than any of ye &amp;#127468;&amp;#127463; Empire&#39;s sailors.

Yar convinced, lad?
