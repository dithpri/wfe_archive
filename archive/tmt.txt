Welcome to TMT, the more serious version of DTMT. Here we keep all the serious RP versus the DTMT, which is just for gaffs and guffaws. 

The only rule shown here is the [i]Anti-Meme Country Act of 2129[/i]. We will ban all nations that appear to be a meme. The rest of the rules can be found on the Doc, which can be found vis the link below. Also...

ALL CONFLICT STAYS ON EARTH. No extraterrestrial Combat or colonizing. We don&#146;t care if they existed before this rule was instated. It makes it to complicated. Also, apocalyptic type weapons are banned.
