Pacific is beside Pacific is atop Pacific is below Pacific: there must be a Pacific at the Pacific&#39;s heart.
[color=red]The Middle Pacific[/color] -- the Middle of the Pacific -- is so.
Our spirit and our identity has not snapped under time&#39;s gale and, with our efforts, shall remain firm.

Join us and be a subject and an executor of our mission to give our nations prosperity in freedom!
