Pacific beside Pacific atop Pacific below Pacific; there must be a Pacific at the Pacific&#39;s heart.
[color=red]The Middle Pacific[/color] -- the Middle of the Pacific -- fills this niche.
Our spirit and our identity have remained unfaltering and, with our efforts, shall continue to.

Join us; be a subject and an executor of our mission to give our nations a free prosperity.
