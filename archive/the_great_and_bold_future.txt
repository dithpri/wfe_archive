Welcome traveller! You have just witnessed the miracle of time travelling. This region was first discovered in 2076 and unfortunately was dissolved in 2254. We have hoverboards, flying cars and portals back to the 2020s. We hope you have a nice stay. And if you want to, you can fly to another planet in our new interstellar space network. The next flight is due in 127 seconds and is headed for andromeda mains. Oh and by the way, this year is 2149.
