We are as LGBT friendly as we are Conservative. We welcome those who lean to the right with most things, while still hovering toward the middle on others. We do believe in the firm support of our Police, at every level. We enjoy our freedom, and intend to preserve it at all costs. Our constituents enjoy the ability to open carry firearms, which help to ensure the preservation of a safe quality of life. We are deeply rooted in history as well as the arts. Music is a major part of our culture. Our region is dominated by Catholics and Episcopalians. This region welcomes anyone with a French/Parisian flare to them! Feel free to become part of a sturdy region and an alliance that is airtight.
