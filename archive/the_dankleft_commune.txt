Welcome to the DankLeft Commune: A region for leftists of all stripes. Seize the memes of production and redistribute them to the working class!

Created and supported by members of the [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/DankLeft]r/DankLeft[/url] community, though membership isn&#39;t necessary.

[b]Notice: To protect the Commune from raiding, all nations are encouraged to
join the World Assembly and endorse each of our regional officers:[/b]([nation=noflag]Alcala-Cordel[/nation], [nation=noflag]Derivellia[/nation], [nation=noflag]Lennonia[/nation], [nation=noflag]Guaylandia[/nation], [nation=noflag]Saore[/nation], [nation=noflag]Zmaia[/nation], [nation=noflag]Volykos[/nation], and [nation=noflag]Zhongshanville[/nation]);
Endorsement cap is 5 for non-officers; there is no endorsement cap for officers.

We are always looking for more officers - if you would like to become an officer, please message an existing officer.
Credit to [nation=noflag]Guaylandia[/nation] for the regional flag!
