The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], USSR for short, is a group of nations on the discworld &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;. Each nation owns an equal area, with the surface divided into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones.

The nation&amp;#39;s leaders form a syndicate to ensure their mutual survival despite their differences. Fairly constant peace allows residents to live practically unhindered, but the occasional dispute is not unknown. The regional delegate has authority over such issues.

[color=bc0000]Recently, Markovat declared war on the USSR, and though they withdrew the threat, the construction had begun on D.I.S.C.O.R.D., the Dynamic Interlocking Structure Conducive to Overruling Regional Defilement, as a way to counter raids.[/color]
