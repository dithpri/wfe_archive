The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], USSR for short, is a group of nations on the discworld &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;. Each nation owns an equal area, with the surface divided into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones.

The nation&amp;#39;s leaders form a syndicate to ensure their mutual survival despite their differences. Fairly constant peace allows residents to live practically unhindered, but the current zombie threat provides a new challenge to the region. [b]The regional delegate advises you to keep your own nations secure, and not to foster your own problems onto the others, but the founder urges you to help the USSR research a cure.[/b]
