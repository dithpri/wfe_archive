The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], USSR for short, is a group of nations on the discworld &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;. Each nation owns an equal area, with the surface divided into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones.

The nation&amp;#39;s leaders form a syndicate to ensure their mutual survival despite their differences. Fairly constant peace allows residents to live practically unhindered, but the current zombie threat provides a new challenge to the region. [b]The regional delegate has yet to give a recommendation on the issue, but the founder urges you to research on a cure.[/b]

[color=bc0000]D.I.S.C.O.R.D. has been temporarily closed to quarantine the zombie threat.[/color]
