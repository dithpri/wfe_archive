The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], (est. January 2012) are the nations of the discworld &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;. Each owns an number of zones, areas of the disc defined by dividing it into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones. No member is made to govern their nation to any expectation. The leaders form a syndicate for mutual survival, and tenuous peace lets nations live unhindered, but the prior zombie apocalypses have proved twice over that the region can stand together.[hr][b]Species:[/b] Human, Equestrian, Time Lord.[hr]TG [nation=short]Ashturia[/nation] for info and entry,
