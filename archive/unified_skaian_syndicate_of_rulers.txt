The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], (U.S.S.R.) is a group of nations on the discworld &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;. Each nation owns an equal area, with the surface divided into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones. No member of the syndicate is made to govern their nation according to any expectation.

The nation&amp;#39;s leaders form a syndicate to ensure their mutual survival despite their differences. Fairly constant peace allows residents to live practically unhindered, but surviving the recent zombie threat proved that the region could pull together in times of need.
