The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], or USSR for short, is a group of nations in the disk shaped realm &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;, divided into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones. For the most part, peace has allowed residents within to live practically unhindered, but the occasional dispute is not unheard of.

The leaders of the nations form a syndicate that meets regularly, as they must ensure the survival of their countries despite the differences between them. The regional delegate holds authority over internal disputes.

Recently, several regions became belligerents in an occupation lead by [nation]Juggernautilus Armed Forces[/nation] which ended (ostensibly) in failure.
