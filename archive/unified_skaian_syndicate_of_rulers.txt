The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], USSR for short, is a group of nations on the discworld &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;. Each nation has an equal area of land, with the surface divided into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones.

The leaders of each nation form a syndicate that ensures their mutual survival despite their differences. Fairly constant peace allows residents within to live practically unhindered, but the occasional dispute is not unknown. The regional delegate has authority over such issues.
