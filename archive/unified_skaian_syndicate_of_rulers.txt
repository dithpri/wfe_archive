The [b]Unified Skaian Syndicate of Rulers[/b], (U.S.S.R.) is a group of nations on the discworld &amp;quot;S.K.A.I.A.N.&amp;quot;. Each nation owns an equal area, with the surface divided into 8 sectors with 3 radial zones. No member of the syndicate is made to govern their nation according to any expectation.

The nation&amp;#39;s leaders form a syndicate to ensure their mutual survival. Near constant peace allows nations to live unhindered, and ending the recent zombie threat proved that the region could cooperate times of need.
