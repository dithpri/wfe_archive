Catstantinople isn&#39;t just another region.....it&#39;s home. With a definite environmentally-friendly and cat-loving tilt, an animal lover would feel right at ease in Catstantinople, but that doesn&#39;t mean that everybody else is barred access as a result. Its small size offers you plenty of opportunities to connect with your neighbors on a one-on-one basis, become one of the officers, and exercise more influence than in a larger and more populous region. All are welcome, and together, let&#39;s make it our goal to make Catstantinople one of the greatest regions in the entire world of NationStates.
