The Corporate Separatists is a capitalistic and conservative alliance of corporations and nations. Business, government, religion, military,   and order are main virtues. The Corporate Separatists has many trade routes and business partners. Insurrection and rebellion funding are available. It endorses wars because they make great profits. But wars THEY fight in are &quot;distasteful.&quot; Communism and socialism are unheard of and are opposed off. Trade is happily accepted. Please no not be discouraged by our laws and rules, after all, &quot;Its just good business.&quot;
