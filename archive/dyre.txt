The Dyre Survival Guide

OVERVIEW:

Dyre is a barren land ravaged by nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare. The nations that consist of Dyre are allied under the Parasite Pact. Things to look out for are radioactive hotspots, diseased individuals, mutated wildlife, bandits, supernatural phenomenon, and worbids.  Most districts in the nations keep themselves locked tightly behind large metal to protect the inhabitants. All of which we will go into detail about.

ALLIANCE:

The nations that lay in Dyre are formed together under the Parasite Pact (PP). Under this alliance no nation may attack one another until the threat of the monitories that roam outside district walls are vanquished.
