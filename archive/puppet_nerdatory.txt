Welcome to the Home For Puppets Without a Home (HFPWaH), though commonly called Puppet Purgatory [sup](because they never leave)[/sup]! Feel free to stick your [strike]undesired[/strike] loved [sup]but maybe unused[/sup] puppets here! We will care for them forever! Because that&#39;s how long they&#39;ll be here, won&#39;t they? They&#39;ll never leave again... stuck in a home... forever...
