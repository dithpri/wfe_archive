The Territory of Indiana was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from July 4, 1800, until November 7, 1816, when the remaining southern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the state of Indiana. 

However, the breakup of the United States in the mid-21st century resulted in the dissolution of the majority of existing state governments as well, Indiana&amp;#39;s among them. The moniker was eventually brought back into use by the post-collapse &amp;#39;Republic of the Singing Winds&amp;#39; to refer to the area once known as Indiana.
