[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to gather together with the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]EPSA[/url] to experiment with... experimental technology

First up was the experimental [color=blue]super raidmobile 5000[/color]!
[i]Slaps Mobile[/i]
[color=red]This bad mobile can fit so many raiders in it[/color]

Second up was the [color=green]Lie Detector 8000[/color]
It&#39;s capable of detecting lies a quick hour after the lie is told!

[color=red]Your region was used as a testing ground for this experiment![/color]
