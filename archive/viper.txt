[i][b][color=red]VIPER[/color][/b][/i] is a home for any [u]v[/u]ery [u]i[/u]nteresting [u]p[/u]eople [u]e[/u]arning [u]r[/u]eputations who despise the General Assembly, Security Council, Defendertrash and/or World Assemblists and International Federalists of all stripes.  Defense (har) of those aforementioned will be tolerated only if actual reasons can be given as to why the &amp;#39;authority&amp;#39; of mindless mobs should override a leader&amp;#39;s freedom to run their nation as they wish, a supposedly fundamental premise of the entire world of NS from the beginning.

Meanwhile, a note to [b][region]The Black Riders[/region][/b]: We&amp;#39;ve actually worked together in the past, so I&amp;#39;ve found the previous assaults to be humorous.
