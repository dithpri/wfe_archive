The Cortexist International, or the &quot;Cortintern&quot;, is an entity which is an economic, military and political alliance. All of its members have adopted the Cortexist Mark, a currency which is a symbol of the world Cortexist revolution. We are anti-fascists and anti-capitalists, and generally left wing. We seek to protect nations who wish to remain neutral on the global stage and be the vanguard of the Cortexist World Revolution. The headquarters of the Cortexist International is located in Cortexgrad, Neocortexia. This alliance is also very internationalist/globalist. It is a successor to the Cortexist Economic Commission.
