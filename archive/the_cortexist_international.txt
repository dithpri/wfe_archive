The Cortexist International, or the &quot;Cortintern&quot;, is an entity which is an economic, military and political alliance. All of its members have adopted the Cortexist Mark, a currency which is a symbol of the world Cortexist revolution. We are anti-fascists and anti-capitalists, and generally left wing. We seek to protect nations who wish to remain neutral on the global stage and be the vanguard of the Cortexist World Revolution. The headquarters of the Cortexist International is located in Cortexgrad, Neocortexia- the beating heart of the revolution. This alliance also supports revolutions across the globe in order to quell the capitalist tide which sweeps over the world. It is a predecessor to the Cortexist Economic Commisssion.
