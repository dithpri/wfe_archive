Aglary, a region where the only thing that matters is the self. Hungry invaders, self-righteous moral seekers, and the like are not welcome. The only power is Helgein, and Helgein alone. Helgein invites other nations who seek to get away from the world and it&#39;s issues to come to Aglary. Helgein will protect those who come to us. Helgein will lead those who come to us into a brighter future, away from those who would drag Aglary and her children into darkness.
