[region]Rastanarnia[/region] was the old region from which the founders of [region]The High County[/region] came.  Fleeing from a raid, most of the peoples of Rastanarnia settled in [region]The High County[/region].  The old land still remains, choking under the brutal repression of the Babylonian invaders.  [region]Rasta Narnia[/region] was founded on an island off the coast of [region]The High County[/region] in remembrance of the mother that was taken from the gentle Rastanarnians.

We will never forget.
