Primarily focused on RPing, OIS was formed by [nation=short]Skako[/nation] as an offshoot of the [b]Imperial League of Nations[/b] after it&amp;#39;s demise, TOIS was a promising region which witnessed a spurt of activity , albeit for a small period. After most of it&amp;#39;s members moved on to [b]The Coalition of Sovereign States[/b], the founder himself migrated &amp;amp; TOIS started stagnating and died.
Our government is democratic and is led by a Director-General.

It is now refounded to restore it&amp;#39;s lost glory and keep it&amp;#39;s promise.[hr]
