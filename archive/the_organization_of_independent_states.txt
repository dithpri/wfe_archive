[color=red]THE OIS HAS [i][b]NOT[/b][/i] RELOCATED TO THE COALITION OF SOVEREIGN STATES[/color]

Your Faithful DG, [nation=short]La Libera[/nation], along with [nation=short]momotsuu[/nation], and [nation=short]Cantor Republic[/nation] have moved to the CSS, but this does not mean that the CSS is the successor region of the OIS. The OIS is still alive, though inactive, still alive. Anyway, you are free to stay here for as long as you&amp;#39;d like!
