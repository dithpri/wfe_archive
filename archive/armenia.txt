[color=navy]Armenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. The Kingdom of Armenia was established in the 6th century BC, after the fall of Urartu; it became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its religion. For this reason, Armenia is often called &quot;the first Christian nation.&quot; Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991.[/color][hr]
