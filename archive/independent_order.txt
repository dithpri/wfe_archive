Unfortunately someone has shut down the forum and locked out the other administrators. As it stands we have people working on different aspects of this issue. 

Our main aim is to get the forum back up and running ASAP. We are setting a rough deadline for the end of this weekend. We are putting plans in place if we are unable to get the forum back, but more information will be provided when it is appropriate to do so. 

We will be posting an FAQ soon to cover the questions you have.
