Intermarium (Polish: Mi&amp;#281;dzymorze, Polish pronunciation: [m&amp;#690;&amp;#603;nd&amp;#865;z&amp;#616;&amp;#712;m&amp;#596;&amp;#656;&amp;#603;]) was a geopolitical project conceived by politicians in successor states of the former Polish&#150;Lithuanian Commonwealth in several iterations, some of which anticipated the inclusion as well of other, neighboring states. The proposed multinational polity would have extended across territories lying between the Baltic, Black and Adriatic Seas, hence the Latinate name Intermarium, meaning &quot;Between-Seas&quot;.
