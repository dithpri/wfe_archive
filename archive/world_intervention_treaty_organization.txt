Welcome to WITO! The World Intervention Treaty Organization.
&#147;Intervention is the only path towards world peace&#148;

Founded on September 18th of 2023


Our goal is to achieve the security of our nations through intervention and military cooperation to provide for the common defense.

We use DEFCON. These range from 1-5, with 5 being the least militarily alert, and 1 being the most. Most of the time we will always be at DEFCON 4 or 5.


Current DEFCON: 5
