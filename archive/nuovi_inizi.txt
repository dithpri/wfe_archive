This region is founded to incorporate the ideals of democracy, consistent detailed roleplay, and foremost providing its members with an enjoyable experience. The current idea for RP is to have the nations of this world have been founded years after a great famine which ruined the old nations and caused mass conflict. If you have any ideas just TG one of the officers and your ideas will be considered and, if approved by one of the officers, put to a regional vote.

(Also for any of you from the UNPC who are viewing this you can have everything you had in the UNPC here as long as you join here before the lands you used to have are claimed.)
