Our great region is made of nations that have been subject to tyranny and prejudice. On September 20th, these nations banded together and created a region based on the ideas of democracy and peace. This new region was named Vox Omnes, meaning Voice of Everybody. This was chosen as a reminder to listen to every man&amp;#39;s ideas. In Vox Omnes, the trinity celebrated is made of Peace, Justice, and Brotherhood. Every September 20th, the nations of Vox Omnes celebrate these ideals and the region that brings them together.
