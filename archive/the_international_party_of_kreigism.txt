The International Party of Kreigism, or well known as TIPOK is a International Party for all nations that want to believe in further glorification and the belief of the ideologies of Kreigism. This is the dedication to the glorification of will. We as the party, govern it&#39;s politics and daily life through a strong power-base. This is indeed a single party to the Greater Austratt Empire, but any nation can be a puppet state that wants to believe in the ideologies of Kreigism as well.
