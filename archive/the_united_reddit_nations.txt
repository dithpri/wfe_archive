[b]Now, Now, I&amp;#39;m sure that, having lost control of your region, you&amp;#39;ll want to curse and scream and moan and complain. But I&amp;#39;m going to have to insist that everyone watches their languages and manners. And Washes their hands regularly. And Brushes and flosses. There&amp;#39;s nothing uncool about healthy teeth.

The lovely folks at the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy have taken the region, with the help of their friends from [region]Kantrias[/region] and [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region].

So, everyone behave, and we&amp;#39;ll all be gone soon enough.
