The Northern Boreal Islands are a set of over 50 islands located in the northwest and northeast. The taiga here is relatively untouched. Originally settled by The Advocates and The Flame, this region is home to many settlements in the nation. The small settlements here are relatively rustic and their inhabitants like to live in peace, avoiding conflict at all costs. 

This region is supported by a strong yet humble direct democratic government who support the citizens of all nations in a respectful and prosperous manner. 

The regions main exports are timber, fish, game and medicinals. Underground minerals consist of copper, iron and a strangely large deposit of platinum.
