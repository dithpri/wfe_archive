The Lighthouse strives to be a beacon of intellect and all sorts of discussion, and is unbiased in its beliefs. Scholars should feel welcome to visit and discuss varying subjects, and here there are no foolish questions. All that is asked is that you conduct yourself respectfully towards others so that the Lighthouses walls shall never crack and its light shall guide all in the grand sea that in NationStates.
