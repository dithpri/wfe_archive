We fight the oppression of the common man. Anyone and everyone has a right to be free and spread his or her word without discrimination. We will take back the land which rightfully belonged to our forefathers and rightfully belongs to us. There will be no more families left in ruins, no more children weeping in the dark. We are not a resistance, we are the opposition.
