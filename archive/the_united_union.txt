Welcome to The United Union. Our goal is to provide a safe haven for all nations that wish to have an active region to participate in. At this stage, our disenchanted diplomats are still building the framework for the region, but if you&amp;#39;re interested in the region and want to take place in it&amp;#39;s founding, PM [nation]Nordic States and Territories[/nation] to see what you can do.

We have 5 government ministries that handle various parts of the region;the ministries of Domestic Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Immigration, Roleplay, and Warfare. Currently appointment to a ministry is invite only, but that will change to elections when we have a sizable population.
