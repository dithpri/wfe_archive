The philosophy behind the United Union is to accept and cater to all sorts of players, from raider to roleplayer, and to create a community that will represent the wants of players as a whole under one flag. We are but a young region yet, so if you&amp;#39;re the regionbuilder sort, you&amp;#39;ve found a place to work yoir magic if you wish. TG [nation]Nordic States and Territories[/nation] for info.

Current Events:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Region building is underway and will take some time.
