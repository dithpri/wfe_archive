[color=red]On a large, isolated island in the middle of a churning sea, surrounded by harsh mountains inhabited by the native savages, the Empire of Evil exists only to suppress the citizens&amp;#39; rights as much as possible. Terrorism and cannibalism are legal. No one cares at all. The only region that the evil, dictator leaders are concerned about is their own.
We are evil. That&amp;#39;s all there is to it.
[b]Join us now and help make the world as evil as possible.[/b]

If you want to join our cause, just click &amp;quot;Move {nation} to The Empire of Evil&amp;quot; button. You don&amp;#39;t need to ask. We will accept all.
Founded by [nation]Mikhail Krukov[/nation]

Note: We don&amp;#39;t get involved in the WA [b]at all[/b].

Just remember... If you do what you&amp;#39;re told, you won&amp;#39;t end up dead.
