[b][i]Region Delegates MAY NOT CHANGE anything in this box that is in bold.[/i]

[box][b]Welcome to the CBHS Conservative Team! This region is strictly to be used as base-of-operations for the Conservative team. The point of this game is for enemies to infiltrate each others&amp;#39; regions and then somehow get one of their own elected Regional Delegate who may then change the flag from red to blue or the other way around AND write in bold and underlined: CONQUERED.

One last note: Before the wars begin, both regions need to elect a starter delegate.[/b][/box]
