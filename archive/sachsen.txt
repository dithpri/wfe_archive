The region of Sachsen was born in 1840 in a Ken Russell film just outside St Petersburg. His father (Leo McKern), a free-lance bishop, was married to Verna Plachenka (Julie Christie) but secretly deeply in love with Margo Farenka (Shirley Abicair) and the strangely flatulent Madame Ranevsky (Norris McWhirter). Soon, however, the family (Eldridge Cleaver, Moira Lister and Stan the Bat) moved to the neighboring industrial village of Omsk (Eddie Waring) where they soon found themselves, sadly, quite unable to cope (Monty Python). 

Sachsen has been settled by Scots. All ethnic Germans have been deported and are forbidden from returning and German culture and language are officially outlawed.
