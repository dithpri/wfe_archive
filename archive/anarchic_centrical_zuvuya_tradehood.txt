The ACZT lives by the quota that, &#39;where freedom layeth, so doeth profit, prophets, and the will and love&#39; of the establisher of these freedoms - in short, we are establishing a mode of life to survive  - in practice - when and where magic and science, religion and technology - become one...Any nanowizards, biotechgods or sorcerer-technicians, or just a stumbler upon our sacred cross - this is your spot to enjoy eternity!
