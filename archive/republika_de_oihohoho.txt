[b]WE MIGRATED HERE DUE TO INVASION OF OUR OLD HOME!!!!!1!!!![/b]
Welcome to Oihohoho, the hidden ohio-like island in [region]Coyphus[/region]!
Here there is a lot of Coryphius (not Coyphus) plants native to DJIDJJregiona, which is [nation]JCH[/nation]&#146;s region.
Ethensia failed to invade us twice (HAHAHAHAHAHA), but they won with the help of Korea SCR and others. (oh..)
We have a lot of crazy creatures, such as giant crazy killer rabbits that some guys in cars tried to fight.. and walking teeth. We don&#39;t know where they came from.
Finally, it is illegal to drop certain stuff (e.g pet cages) in Oihohoho. IF YOU DO THIS, WE WILL MAKE YOU LIVE IN A PINEAPPLE UNDER THE SEA!!!!
More rules can be found in the pinned dispatch below, named &#147;The Law of Oihohoho&#148;[hr][url=https://youtu.be/Em_dL4NejSA][color=black]National Anthem[/color][/url]
