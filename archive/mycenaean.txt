This large region stretches across multiple megameters, from Polar in the North, past the equator, all the way through to Cold in the South. The region sits close to the edge of a tectonic plate; the South-Eastern part of the land has several mountain ranges and some prominent canyons and valleys. Mycenaean has a few active volcanoes, and earthquakes are very frequent. The winds in this region are usually calm, with large storms and extreme weather being infrequent. The seas surrounding Mycenaean are often calm. Mycenaean is home to a large variety of creatures and plants, and a large amount of those are found only in this region.
