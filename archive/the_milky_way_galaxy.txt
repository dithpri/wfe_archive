[colour=teal]New map and shared history for the MWG are coming soon. I&#39;d like to note that this is purely optional and you need not partake in this project, it is only an optional set of resources to foster RPing and community.[/colour]

[hr]
Ere nations great and societies bold,
In noble spirals did stars take hold.
With brilliance and grace did matter form,
To be molded, shaped, and through conflict torn.

Ever expanding, ever reaching,
From star to star, it&#39;s residents seeking
To live, to love, to dominate;
Tis&#39; all that makes the Galaxy great.

[colour=blue]This is a region composed of Future Tech Roleplayers.  Invader/Defender gameplayers are not welcome here and will be purged with righteous indignation.  Thus speaketh the Dragon of the Void.[/colour]
