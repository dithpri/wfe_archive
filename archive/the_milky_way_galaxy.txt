Ere nations great and societies bold,
In noble spirals did stars take hold.
With brilliance and grace did matter form,
To be molded, shaped, and through conflict torn.

Ever expanding, ever reaching,
From star to star, it&#39;s residents seeking
To live, to love, to dominate;
Tis&#39; all that makes the Galaxy great.
