[colour=purple]The Dragon stirs within his den. His eye, so long shuttered, now looks upon the galaxy with hunger. Changes are coming.[/colour]

Ere nations great and societies bold,
In noble spirals did stars take hold.
With brilliance and grace did matter form,
To be molded, shaped, and through conflict torn.

Ever expanding, ever reaching,
From star to star, it&#39;s residents seeking
To live, to love, to dominate;
Tis&#39; all that makes the Galaxy great.
