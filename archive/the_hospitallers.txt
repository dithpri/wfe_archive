The Hospitallers were founded in around 1023 by Blessed Gerard Thom to provide care for poor, sick or injured pilgrims in the Holy Land. After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade, the Order became an independent religious and military order, and it was given the duty of caring and defending the Holy Land.
