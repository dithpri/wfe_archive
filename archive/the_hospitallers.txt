The Knights Hospitaller arose as a group of individuals associated with a hospital in a district of Jerusalem, founded around 1023 by Blessed Gerard Thom to provide care for poor, sick or injured pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the Western Christian conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 during the First Crusade, the organization became a religious and military order under its own charter, and it was charged with the care and defence of the Holy Land.
