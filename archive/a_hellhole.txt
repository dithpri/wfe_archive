This was a region I&#39;d seen a while ago after I saw them link [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1490961]one my the dispatches I made a while ago that got a lot of upvotes[/url].

There were some initial ties between this region and other regions I was close to in the older days.

Later, this region was refounded by a &quot;Queen of Roses&quot;, aka Ionaris/Rosartemis.

On Christmas Eve 2024, this user acted in complicity with a serious offense offsite, starting a blacklist campaign against her. 3 days, a region she contributed greatly in creating, [region]Eruditio[/region], ousted and banned her forever, appeal possible after a year.

Most of her holding puppets CTEd on January 28th, and with them the regions. This region was one of them.

Any previous holders can request the return of this region via VKCC.
