This was a region I&#39;d seen a while ago after I saw them link [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1490961]one my the dispatches I made a while ago that got a lot of upvotes[/url].

There were some initial ties between this region and other regions I was close to in the older days.

Later, this region was refounded by a &quot;Queen of Roses&quot;, aka Rosartemis.

On Christmas Eve 2024, a blacklist campaign started on her due to things I&#39;m not getting into here. (During this, further revelations happened!) She went from cosmo to outcast in about 3 days.

Most of her holding puppets CTEd on January 28th, and with them the regions. This region was one of them.

Any previous holders can request the return of this region via VKCC. I don&#39;t intend for it to no longer see the light of day again.
