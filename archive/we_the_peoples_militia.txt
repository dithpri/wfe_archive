We may not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, Hell, some may hate us, but we are proud of our views and beliefs and will unapologetically stand up for them. We do not hate, but we may not be accepting as some may hope. We, the people, will stand for our beliefs against anyone who dares challenge us! 
We may not all agree on our beliefs, but any religion, any race, you&#39;re one of us. Friendly debates are encouraged in the Message board, consider other&#39;s points and ideas.
