[b][i]Welcome to [color=green]Shamrock Fields[/color], heroes![/b][/i]

This emerald meadow is the first region you must travel through on your adventures with [nation=short]Amber the Far Seeker[/nation]. As this place is along the path to Houndsmouth, [nation=short]River the Howling Arrow[/nation] is also currently passing through here, on her way to sell useful items she&#39;s gathered during her hunts. These items could potentially be useful to [i]you[/i] instead, heroes!

Whichever Clan scores the most points here will prove their powers of persuasion and convince River to gift some of her items to them. For passing this test of charisma, the region will be theirs as well!
