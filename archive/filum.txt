An omniverse where worlds branching out like threads and entangle with each other. Universes collide--causing endless frictions, opening the boundaries between them.

Some see it as a calamity, some others see it as opportunity. Conquer or defend. 

Traverse alone or join a faction. Please the gods, make epic fables for their entertainment or go against them--and believe in the higher being beyond.
