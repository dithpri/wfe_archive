Welcome to the Alliances, we are an imperialistic region that seizes control of other regions that we feel oppress the people and nations within them. We make them our protectorates and liberate them; They are then under our flag in liberty and peace. We do not raid in the sheer name of imperialism but we can say that the oppressors make us stronger in the sense that we morally have the right to take them as our own.
