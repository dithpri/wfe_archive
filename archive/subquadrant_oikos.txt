Subquadrant Oikos is an area of space comprising hundreds of thousands of solar systems within a span of 1,000 light-years. The subquadrant is home to several civilisations, sentient and intelligent technological lifeforms, and interstellar polities, and many planetary systems with life-supporting features are connected by the precursor network of wormholes. In the interstellar politics and diplomacy of the region, it is often agreed that the major powers of the subquadrant are the Kwarlam Union, the Stellar Federation, the Coalition, and the Human Empire; other lesser powers include the Republic of Lanara, the Jenhan Star Empire, the Federated Hlemok, and the Independents.
