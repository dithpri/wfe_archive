Niflheim is one of the Nine Worlds and is a location in Norse mythology which overlaps with the notions of Niflhel and Hel.

Niflheim was primarily a realm of primordial ice and cold, with nine frozen rivers. Two classes of legendary beings were often labeled by scholars as the inhabitants of Niflheim &#151; the Hr&iacute;mthursar, widely known as the Frost Giants (or Rime-Giants) of Norse legend; and the Niflungar (&amp;quot;children of the mist&amp;quot;), a race of treasure-hoarding spirits better remembered as the Nibelungs.
