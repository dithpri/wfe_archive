[color=#58ACFA][u][b]The primordial realm of ice, containing the kingdom of the dead[/b][/u][/color]
[hr]
Niflheim is one of the nine worlds of Yggdrasil, it is a place of eternal frozen winter. In it, one of the world-tree&#39;s roots can be found, next to it lies the well known as Hvergelmir, as well as the dragon N&iacute;&eth;h&ouml;ggr which gnaws on the root. Within the realm, across the frozen river Gj&amp;#491;ll, is the kingdom of the dead, Helheim, ruled by Hel from her hall of &Eacute;lj&uacute;&eth;nir. Here reside the dead who died from disease and old age, the ones who never had the chance to perish in battle. They live out a shadowy version of their former lives, guarded by the blood-stained wolf Garmr
