[nation][/nation]Welcome to The Sith Eclipse

We are an ancient order of Force-wielders devoted to the dark side, the Sith practice hate, deception, and greed. Notable for their red-bladed lightsabers, black dress, and use of their aggressive feelings, the Sith look to amass power at all costs. Darth Sidious, along with his apprentice Darth Vader, achieved the Sith goal of galactic conquest after a millennia of plotting.

We have Sith Documents under the founders Nation showcasing the ideals, history and overview of the Sith .
