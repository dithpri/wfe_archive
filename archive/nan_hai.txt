Nan Hai (&amp;#21335;&amp;#28023;), also known as South China Sea. The Yizhoushu, which was a chronicle of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046&#150;771 BCE), gives the first Chinese name for the South China Sea as Nanfang Hai (Chinese: &amp;#21335;&amp;#26041;&amp;#28023;; pinyin: N&aacute;nf&amp;#257;ng H&amp;#462;i; lit. &#39;Southern Sea&#39;), claiming that barbarians from that sea gave tributes of hawksbill sea turtles to the Zhou rulers. Nan Hai, the South Sea, was one of the Four Seas of Chinese literature. There are three other seas, one for each of the four cardinal directions. It is administered by the People&#146;s Republic of China.
