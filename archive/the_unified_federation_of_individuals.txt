We are United for All.

The nations that comprise of UFI differ all across the spectrum of politics, but we all have a belief in natural all-ruling eventual pacifist region.

Join us if you believe you could be good for the UFI cause.

We hold elections every month for the positions of Supreme Commander and Supreme Vice-Commander. Supreme Commander then selects his cabinet and Vice-Commander either confirms or denies his picks.

Elections are held on the 1st of the Month at 3:45pm EST.
