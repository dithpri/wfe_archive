A Region based on Aldous Huxley&amp;#39;s novel, Brave New World, featuring a united world government devoted to the eternal ideas of Community, Identity, and Stability. All nations for the development of an universal, technology-based, transhuman society are highly encouraged to join.


&amp;quot;What man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Everyone belongs to everyone else.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Ending is better than mending. The more stitches, the less riches.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;You all remember, I suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of Our Ford&amp;#39;s: History is bunk.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;A gramme is better than a damn.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;When the individual feels, the community reels.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t allow science to undo its own good work.&amp;quot;
