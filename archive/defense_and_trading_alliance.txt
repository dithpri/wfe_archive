The Defense and Trading Alliance (DTA), is an alliance, which focuses on the development and defense of its members. The members of this alliance all have different political and economic systems, but still try to assert their common interests in the world. 
Rules:
1. All members undertake to provide military support in the event of an attack on a DTA member country. Should a member country attack another member militarily, the attacking country will be sanctioned economically. 
2. In peacetime, joint military exercises are held twice a year (January 23 to February 22 and August 23 to September 22). These take place on land, in the air and at sea. 
3. The Alliance&#39;s headquarters are in Pholathukmpolthu, the capital of Ngombwana.
