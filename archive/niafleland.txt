A land full of the most brave and savage animal in the world: Pink fluffy unicorns. Niafleland has all of the natural resources discovered in the universe.

People in Niafleland lives happy and fluffy, except those who lives sad and rusty. In the center of Niafleland exist a terrain disputed by the 4 cardinal realms, a land where grows the most beautiful and valued tree: the coffemaker machine. But this war doesn&amp;#39;t matter to the people of the realms because the traditional drink is tea and toxic rainbow water.

Long life to the happy people of Niafleland, and short life to the sad people of Niafleland!
