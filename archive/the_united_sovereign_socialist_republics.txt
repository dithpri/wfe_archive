In response to the actions of the corrupted leadership of the former United Sovereign Socialist Republics. To those who were ejected by those degenerates who call themselves &amp;#39;leaders&amp;#39; of the disgraced United Sovereign Socialist Republics founded by the &amp;#39;Socialist federative republic of sornia&amp;#39;: those degenerates are tyrants masquerading as socialists and communists, who have recently imposed martial law. 

For all socialist and communist nations; you are welcome here, in [b]THE[/b] United Sovereign Socialist Republics, where every nation is considered equal. 

A socialist-communist region run by the people, for the people. 

Anti-capitalist, anti-materialist, anti-greed.

No religion.
No advertising.
No private enterprise.
No government tyranny.
