This region is established in response to the actions of the corrupted leadership of the former United Sovereign Socialist Republics. To those who were ejected by those degenerates who call themselves &amp;#39;leaders&amp;#39; of the United Sovereign Socialist Republics founded by the &amp;#39;Socialist federative republic of sornia&amp;#39;: those degenerates are tyrants masquerading as socialists and communists, who have recently imposed martial law. 

[b]THE[/b] United Sovereign Socialist Republics, where every nation is considered equal, unlike in the former region. 

A socialist-communist region run by the people, for the people. 

Anti-capitalist, anti-materialist, anti-greed.

No religion.
No advertising.
No private enterprise.
No government tyranny.
