Welcome to the UNE, or United Nations of Europe. We act like the UN, and also, we do have many administrators. We have 2 embassies, and we would love you to stay in this region for as long as possible. Our regional delegate is The Republic of Swedhen (pronounced Sweden) and we have 29 (!?) nations I believe. This region is not here to get endorsements. We are here to enjoy the game. It&amp;#39;s unbelievable how far we&amp;#39;ve come. I would like to thank all of the nations and the WA for this beautiful region.

Thanks,
Swedhen
