Welcome to the UNE, or United Nations of Europe. We act like the UN, and also, we do have many administrators. We have 2 embassies, and we would love you to stay in this region for as log as possible. Our regional delegate is The Republic of Swedhen (pronounced Sweden) and we have 24 nations I believe. This region is not here to get endorsements. We are here to enjoy the game.

Thanks,
Swedhen
