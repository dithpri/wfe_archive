Teabagistan is a region that celebrates theocracy, plutocracy, and corporatism. As the founder is quite lazy, there are no off site forums or anything. Any nation is free to join, and all member nations are free to conform to Tea Party, corporatist, Christian dominionist, and ultra nationalistic right wing ideology. There will be occasional purges of all nations who are insufficiently right wing to pass a purity test.
