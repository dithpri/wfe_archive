That said, there was this dude, [b]Vlad &amp;quot;The Bad&amp;quot; Tepes[/b], who reigned as the Heavyweight Champion of Transylvania. He was quite dominant in his MMA bouts, until he faced [b]Abraham &amp;quot;The Hellboy&amp;quot; Helsing[/b], who bested him and took his championship belt. After his Vampyr divison got overrun by &amp;quot;sparkly teenage crybabies,&amp;quot; Vlad retired from MMA and took to rap.

His latest Rap song is the regional song of Transilvania:

[i] Yo! Tis&amp;#39; I; Vlad!
Me Bad! Me yo dad! Me rad!
You fight me lad? You mad?
Ain&amp;#39;t gonna lie; gonna make you cry!
Gonna suck yo veins dry!
Flyin&amp;#39; in da nite sky, eating yo mamma&amp;#39;s pie,
Make me stop? Ooh, lets c u try![/i]
