Apparently, Transylvania ( [region]Transilvania[/region] ) in Romania was the home of Count Dracula, a work of fiction.

That said, there was this dude, [b]Vlad The Bad Tepes[/b], who reigned as the Heavyweight Champion of Transylvania. He was quite dominant in his MMA bouts, until he faced [b]Abraham The Hellboy Helsing[/b], who bested him and took his championship belt. After his Vampyr divison got overrun by sparkly teenage crybabies, Vlad retired from MMA and took to rap.

His latest Rap song is the regional song of Transilvania:

[i] Yo! Tis I; Vlad!
Me Bad! Me yo dad! Me rad!
You fight me lad? You mad?
Ain&amp;#39;t gonna lie; gonna make you cry!
Gonna suck yo veins dry!
Flyin in da nite sky, eating yo mamma&amp;#39;s pie,
Make me stop? Ooh, lets c u try![/i]
