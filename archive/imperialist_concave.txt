These countries came out of these ashes to rise up with the anthem of All Star. [i]&#147;Somebody once told me, the Imperialist Concave would roll me, I&#146;m not the strongest region in the land&#148;[/i]. Even though the crusade against the normies within the region was a success, there was still a whole world of normies to defeat, and so the small band of nations set out to conquer them all. It was a difficult task and therefore only the brightest nations were picked. The ones that knew the symbol were chosen. [b]I ii ii L[/b][i][/i]
