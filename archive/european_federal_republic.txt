This region has been liberated by vigilantes who hold no allegiance to any raider organisations. We are united only by a hatred of raiding and the desire to see all regions live in peace and freedom without the threat of bullies coming in and destroying their rich and unique history, just for some internet glory. This region has been returned to its original founder and inhabitants and no longer clanks under the chains of Slavery and Lily. 

We maintain that [b][u][color=red]Lily is a Terrorist Organisation[/color][/u][/b], and will not hesitate to take any action we can to keep NationStates free!

Success to Operation Underlord! Long Live the Forces of [b][color=red]Anti-Lily Aktion![/color][/b]
