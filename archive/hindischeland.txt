[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region], looking for an earth bending teacher, travelled to the great city of [color=tan]Omashu[/color]. Upon arrival, they find it captured by [color=red]The Fire Nation![/color] Worried for their dear friend [color=purple]Bumi,[/color] the hawks spread out across [color=green]The Earth Nation,[/color] hanging up missing posters for the king. If you would like to master your earth bending too, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
