A long time ago, Scoodles arrived to Earth from the far away planet, Scoodle Star. Then, when one of the colonies, Scoos4Peace, tried to join the Copper Confederation, they were forcibly [b]kicked out[/b]. (No hard feelings, of course.) So Scoos4Peace founded their own, [i]exclusive[/i] region.

Here at the Scoodle Earth Colonies we strive to make a region founded with hope in the future of Scoodlekind and the remembrance of our home planet, Scoodle Star.
