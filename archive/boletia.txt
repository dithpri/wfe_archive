This is the colonized planet that belongs to Boletusterra, the nation that feared a nuclear war in the planet Agloth (the Fortis Federation). We are the start to the future of the mushroom race. This planet is an inhospitable wasteland, it is nothing but ice for miles and miles.most colonies will just live in fallout shelters till we can terraform I suppose
