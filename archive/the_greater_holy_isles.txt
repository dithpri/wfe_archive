&#149; The Greater Holy Isles is holding the first day of it&#39;s first ever Fall Games Festival (Civ V, Overwatch, AoE2HD, &amp; more!) on November 4! Take a peak at our [url=]Steam Group[/url] for more information!
&#149; Our good friends in [region]The Mystical Council[/region] are looking for new members to [strike]pad their stats[/strike] get involved in regional politics. If you&#39;re looking for an active, more in-depth look at participating in a region and proposing and passing legislation, pop a puppet over there and dive in head first!
