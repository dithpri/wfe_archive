This is Warden [nation]Pyrohy[/nation]&#39;s fledgling UCR. In his absence, he&#39;s kindly donated his old home to the forever box, never again to be touched by raiders.

[nation]New Pyrosky[/nation] has returned to stir the pot once more. I swear, we&#39;re not the same person.

[hr][b][i]Blessed are the righteous, the lights in the shadow.
In their blood the Maker&#39;s will is written.
