[b][color=#FF0000]I am pleased to be able to welcome you to our great Kingdom. I hope you have chosen to be a part of our Kingdom because of our mutual passion for friendship, peace, and tranquility. Your passions help us all to come together as one and the energy we create as one allows us to achieve our individual as well as group goals. I hope that these will prove to be memorable and fulfilling times for you. That is of course not the only thing that is important here. You will also have a chance to meet lots of new people and make new friends along the way.[/color][/b]
