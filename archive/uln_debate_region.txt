Welcome to the ULN Debate Region! Here we only have 1 rule. (For now)
1. Be respectful.
You can debate anything you want here. There is a list of some things for you to debate below if you have no idea what you should debate. Other than that make sure to have fun!

The existence and/or nature of god
What is the best government type
The nature of free will
