Dear Friends of UKO College,

I am saddened to announce the suspension of activity UKO college. In order to make it a reality, I need a lot more planning, and we need to figure out how the staff will work out. I also need to open this establishment when I KNOW I will constantly be on Nation States. Right now, there is so much going on with the transition from high school to university, so I have not been active on this website frequently. When the time is right, I will re-open the college. I would hate to start something and disappear leaving the region to chaos. Thank you for all of your hard work and I appreci
