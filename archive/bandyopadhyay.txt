Bandyopadhyay is a region founded by the Pravarasena Empire, or Holy Empire of Bhattacharya. This is a region made to start a new, democratic, region. The whole reason I made this was to make a democratic, multi-party region, an eventually to become a frontier for new countries to be founded here. Of course, however, it all starts off as a microregion. But if lots of new members join, then we could become bigger and bigger. All we need is a WA Delegate, at least that I know of. If any of those guys out there who have been here longer than me, please tell me the other stuff that I need to know for this to become a frontier. Also, just a reminder, I don&#39;t care about all of that stuff because I already know how to make it a frontier.
