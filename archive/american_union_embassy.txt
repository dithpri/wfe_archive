To retain embassy status with the AU, all foreign embassy regions must allow posting privileges to &amp;quot;[i]all residents of embassy regions[/i]&amp;quot;. This allows ambassadors from this AU Embassy the right to post on your region&amp;#39;s RMB. If posters are unruly, they can be selectively banned from posting.
