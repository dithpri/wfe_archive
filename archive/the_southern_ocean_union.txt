[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to contemplate the meaning of life.

What is life? Is it found in ideology? If so, why are [color=yellow]pineapples[/color] so cool? So many questions, and so few answers. 

We thought about it long and hard, walked on roads and rivers, through the clouds and into space, before realising that some things are just meant to be. 

We walked into your region searching for life instead, if you would like to contemplate such things with us, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
