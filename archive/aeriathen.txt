Aeriathen was born from the shattering of the First Sky, which infused the land with raw aether and created the first dragons. These dragons evolved into many forms and ruled the region from the floating Great Aerie, sustained by powerful aether-crystals.

When mortals arrived seeking those crystals, the Dragon Wars erupted and nearly destroyed the realm. Peace came only after the Elder Dragons established the Pact of the Shattered Sky, leading to the rise of two mortal&#150;dragon nations: MoltenVale and Dracoisle. Now coexistence defines Aeriathen, though fading aether-crystals threaten the stability of the sky once more.
