The Khsardom of Zovina is an semi-absolutist, imperialist monarchy. 
It contains within it&#39;s borders three peoples,

The Zovinans, the dominant tribe, who is the most settled of the three.
The Kraujiks, a semi nomadic tribe who have been entrusted with the governance of the steppes.
The Dakhmari, who rarely settle in one place for long, and attempt to evade the authority of the crown.

The Khsardom of Zovina was founded and is ruled by the House of Zovak, and the current Khsar, Arzhos Zovak reigns from the city of Grozov in the mountains of Khaldra.
No fascists, no right wingers, no real monarchists.
