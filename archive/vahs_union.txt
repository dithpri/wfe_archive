This region is a casual region base around Verona Area High School. You don&#39;t have to be a student at VAHS, but the point of this region is to be a place for VAHS students who play nation states. We do have competition (Axolotlum and Ridge of Badgers), but that doesn&#39;t matter. Join our region.
