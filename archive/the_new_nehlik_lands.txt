Founded by [nation]Noistiv[/nation] on 28 March 2022. 
This region is made up of alts from [region]Discornesia[/region]. The Discornesians wanted to create alts to follow alternative paths, or be opposite of their main, or just to be as crazy as possible, like me. 

The only way to join the region is to have the pass given to you by Discornesians after serious discussions (it&#39;d be unlikely that we&#39;d reject, since who wants to not have a new member?). You can have multiple alts but remember to follow the NationStates rule that [b]Only one nation of yours can be in the WA[/b] (we don&#39;t have a WA Delegate due to the same reason). 

Remember to type &quot;May Glory Reign Over Noistiv and the Lovely Nehlik&quot; in the board once every week....
