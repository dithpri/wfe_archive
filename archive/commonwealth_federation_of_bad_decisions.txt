Anyone is welcome, regardless of belief, nation choice, or actions. Commonwealth Federation of Odd Choices has rules however.

1. Nothing excessively inappropriate, otherwise pretty much anything goes(use your brain. You know what I mean)
2. Get political if you want. That seems to be the point of this game...
4. Run this region any way you want. This entire site is a game after all.
5. Rule #3 doesn&#146;t exist.
6. Have fun. Failure to comply with this rule will result in the offender being shot in both knees and shipped off to Siberia.
7. Mess around in the wrong way too much and you will be removed.

If someone becomes the delegate or whatever, ask for executive power and you might get it. 

Have fun, make good choices, and don&#146;t be stupid.
