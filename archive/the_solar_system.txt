[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their [region]Osiris[/region] friends were lazing around. Nobody wanted to do something, but they had work to do

Lazily, slowly and with even more laziness, they walked into your region, took a cookie from your cookie jar, and rolled away.

If you would like to laze with us, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
