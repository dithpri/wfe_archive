The Alliance of Equal Opportunity has been founded on the basis that every nation, no matter how small, can have a voice equal to the leaders of the region. Everyone has their own opinions, and they should all be allowed to have a chance to express their views.

Our Founder is [nation]Prodigyland[/nation]
Our current Regional Delegate is [nation]Zakonia[/nation]

It is preferred that you join the World Assembly, as you then will be able to vote on issues affecting NationStates as a whole.
