The Land of Viridiana, newly discovered beyond the western seas, is a haven of natural beauty and resources. Towering Viridian Pines, rich rivers, fertile valleys, and veins of gold and copper promise endless opportunities. Herds of Aurean Elk and swift Wystrel Gazelles roam its plains, while rare Opal Lynxes and vibrant Scarlet Starlings inhabit its forests and skies. With crystal lakes, cascading waterfalls, and snow-capped peaks, Viridiana is a land of wonder and untamed potential.
