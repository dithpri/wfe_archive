Arkhos is a region where laws and rules matter not. It is designed for lazy rulers who do not like to appear at every regional meeting between lousy heads of state, but sit back and enjoy the benefits of being in a powerful region. However, even though there are no rules in Arkhos, it is only natural for members of the region to band together against any foreign attacks or invasion.

There are no rules, so just sit back and relax!
