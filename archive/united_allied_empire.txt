The future is here, the United Allied Empire is a region birthed acknowledging where its members had their past. We owe our greatest and worst times to the iterations of &quot;Allied&quot; regions. 

The region was consecrated by House Vanderbilt in an effort to prevent the continual breakdown of previous iterations. Not abandoning the principles of liberty and democracy, this region&#39;s monarchy is here to prevent the seizures that broke so many regions before it. A monarchy like few others, protecting democratic institutions, this is a royalty composed of those we know and trust, a family, the Vanderbilt Family. 

This is the future, this is the United Allied Empire. We hope to see all of you.
