A unique area with mostly calm waves and crystal clear cold water, made up mostly of islands.

There are 8 large islands that are hilly with thin coasts that surround the islands. The islands were once inhabited by only nature and animals but since then humans have discovered them and own them.

The 8 main islands are large enough to consider themselves mini continents, due to their large land spaces, many nations can fit into one allowing this region to be inhabited by more.
