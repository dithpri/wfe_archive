The Desert Island Nations of Genetics was founded on a group of Islands largely isolated from the rest of the world. The land masses were virtually useless as they were simply large sandbars with no resources. However they did allow for floating cities which thrived off of the rich underwater resources nearby. The islolationist islands also allowed for genetic research with little to no outside interference.
