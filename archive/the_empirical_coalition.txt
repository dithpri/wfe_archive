This alliance of empires known as the Empirical Coalition wishes to bring the major empires of the world into cooperation in order to form a more just, peaceful, powerful, and stable society on the world known as NationStates. Although Ikonos is technically the founding member, it should not be seen as the senior power. All empires collaborate under a purely democratic, UN-like policy where all decisions will not be made by the founder, but by the voting conglomerate of empires in its sphere of influence.
