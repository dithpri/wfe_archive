The region of Lagrange was founded through a joint effort of multiple countries who recognized the importance of collaboration and unity in promoting innovation and progress. The region was named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, a mathematician and physicist known for his contributions to celestial mechanics and the study of orbits. 

Lagrange points are areas of equilibrium for objects under the influence of two massive orbiting bodies.

The core Lagrange bodies of the region are &quot;Progress&quot; and &quot;Actualization&quot;.
