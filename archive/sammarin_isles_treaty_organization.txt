The Sammarin Isles Treaty Organization (SITO) is a military and political cooperative between the states comprising the Sammarin islands chain in the South Pacific, including other nations with mutual security interests. It provides a unique link, enabling consultation and cooperation in the fields of defence and security, and to coordinate multinational crisis-management operations amongst members. SITO is committed to the principle that an attack against one or several of its members is considered as an attack against all.
