A region specifically for nations that do want to be in an area that subjects them to regional laws, restrictions or specific achievements. While LFAL allows regions of all types, participation in the WA, and voting for a WA representative, the ONLY FIVE REGIONAL LAWS in LFAL cannot be changed, added to, or amended. Any region member attempting to do so may be removed and permanently banned from the region.
