Welcome to [region]Liberal Council[/region]! LCU is a group of countries that love freedom and democracy. 

A region for liberal democracies committed to open, fair, compassionate society where all people enjoy equal protection of civil rights and political freedoms.

LCU is a new, member-led region, founded on the basis of sensible, pragmatic politics, where freedom of opinion and open debate is encouraged. An antidote to the groupthink and ideological politics of regions occupying the far left and far right.
