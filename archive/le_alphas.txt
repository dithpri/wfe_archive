[b]Welcome to Le Alphas, borne from the unity of immoral and wicked and superseded by an eternal desolation. Ones this place thrived in its honorless glories. We have taken back what should not have been made. And now, only the faint memories remain. Enter, but know that this path of mourning is to be taken alone.[/b]

[i]&quot;And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.&quot;

- Leviticus 24:16[/i]
