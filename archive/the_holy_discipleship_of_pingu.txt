After the creation of Pingunoot, Pingu departed to the heavens. Other nations abandoned the unholy ways of democracy, and started to give oppression to their citizens. But not all countries converted to the correct way. They tried to protest, something so blasphemous that Pingu descended from the heavens once more to put a stop to their evil ways. Out of the ocean, a golden land rose from the depths. He moved many nations there, and the dictators began to follow his every word. They became his disciples, and they ensured that no man shall ever live with the soulless freedoms and pagan civil rights the libs and dems used to psychologically hurt others.
