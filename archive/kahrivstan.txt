This is a modern-tech region and all the nations in it are currently owned by one player. My name is Forest and, unless stated otherwise, I do not agree with any of the beliefs or policies of any nation or faction I own. If you want to contact me, I check the [nation]Forest Republic[/nation] most often though I will respond to telegrams sent to any nation. Feel free to vote in my polls or post on my board!

This region and all of the nations are still a work in progress, but an incomplete regional guide can be found [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=kahrivstan/detail=factbook/id=1533223]here[/url]. I like trying to portray a range of ideologies and morals that includes villainous characters, but if there is any issue with any of my nations or how I portray any aspect of them please let me know.
