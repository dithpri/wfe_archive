The U.A.D. is a region devoted to economic prowess and military strength. We take a very high priority in making sure that all of the nations in our region have a way to either be elected or appointed to positions of power. All nations will be given an equal opportunity to gain influence and power and will all be able to propose and vote for legislation that is beneficial to them. For more information regarding the government, regulations, voting system, and rights within the region, read the U.A.D. dispatch.
