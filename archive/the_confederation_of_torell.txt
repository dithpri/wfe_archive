Home of the Federation of Hartoell, The Confederation of Torell is a Region that was once controlled by a old nation known as Torell, thus the reason this region is named Torell. The reason Torell fell is that a group of revolutionary&#39;s took out the government, leading many of the provinces to leave, shortly after, many had collapsed as they were not ready for it and political partys, gangs, etc, started to take power. After years of fighting the province of Har was united under a nation called Hartoell. and soon after, A shaky Confederation formed, to help the region re-enter the world stage, with Hartoell as its founder.
