[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

Pussycat [nation]MagentaFairy[/nation] was trying to eat the Mice [nation]Krimson Vulika[/nation] and [nation]Valfor[/nation], when the Eagle [nation]SPQR[/nation] swooped down and ate one. The Dog [nation]Christopher Bishop[/nation] came and ate the other.
