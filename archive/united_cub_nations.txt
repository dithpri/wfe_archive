 [b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region].

With speed and precision, no region is safe for the imperialist juggernaut. All shall tremble in fear at the sight of wings and talons!

Alas, this was but a training mission, and our timing was beneath our usual standard. Yet, we stand unopposed! Where are the fendas?

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor! Glory to the King![/b]
