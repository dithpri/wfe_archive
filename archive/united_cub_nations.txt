The United Cub Nations were formed by the Kingdom of Cubnistria in order to provide a place for nations run by members of the babyfur/littlefur community, and supporters of the babyfur/littlefur community to live and prosper in peace.

Depending on what the community wants, I&amp;#39;ll try my best as founder to deliver. If that means killing my Foreign Aid budget sending chocolate to everyone? Fine. :P

Have fun, ladies and gents!
