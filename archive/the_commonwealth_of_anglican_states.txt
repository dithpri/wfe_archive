[region]The Commonwealth of Anglican States[/region] is a region open to all who wish to join, and while we may never be a particularly large region, with God&amp;#39;s help, we will become an important one. 

After realising that Anglicanism is not properly represented (if at all) on Nationstates, [nation]St Sulien[/nation] has founded this region to give us a voice. Please use this opportunity to join this new region and help to make it grow.
