The Union of Democratic Prekala Federations (UDP) is a structurally sound, yet compromised, democratic socialist group known best for maintaining a sense of democracy and a general irreverence towards Capitalism and religion.
Formed by Setala, and later invaded by foreign powers, the government of Setala is currently investing much of it&amp;#39;s resources to stockpile weapons that could potentially be of use in the later years that a military action may be required.
Should a nation attempt to join the UDP, please send a telegram to [nation=short]Setala[/nation].
