Founded by the Prekala government of Setala in order to construct and enforce a large economic, military, and social unit, it was decided by their leaders to draft an alliance treaty known as the Union of Democratic Prekala Federations, or UDP for short.
Governments who align themselves with UDP are enriched with the standard of life that the average Prekala is given, in exchange for an economic, military, or social advantage that can help make the UDP a better place.
To join, a nation must be trust heavily by the Prekala head of state, Setala, and may require similar ideals.
