I refounded this region called &quot;United Socialist States Of America&quot; when I saw that all its nations had ceased to exist. I&#39;m not a socialist myself, I&#39;m a capitalist. And in the true spirit of capitalism, I&#39;m willing to offer this beautifully named region to the highest bidder! Are you a true communist who wants to put a hammer and sickle over the USSA? Then make me an offer! Or are you a true capitalist who wants to raise a Gadsden flag and use this region to rant about how awful communism is? Then make me an offer! I don&#39;t care what your ideology is, if you want to rule the USSA, [b]make me an offer![/b]
Cash money is good, of course, but I&#39;ll also accept some WA endorsements in my other region, perhaps?
Anyway, make me an offer!
Thanks.
