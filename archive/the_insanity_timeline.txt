Welcome to the insanity timeline! Where you can roleplay being literally everything! From space ghosts to an eldritch cult to a huge space empire!
There are no rules other than you must compromise in roleplaying to create more chaos and awesome battles!

Note: raiders suck, and will be b-slapped out of here since they probly will hinder our epic chaotic Roleplaying.
