Ulvenwald is a coastal region home to the thick Lambholt forest, also known as the &quot;Misty Wood&quot; which isolates Ulvenwald from neighboring regions. Dwellers interested in trade are attracted by a number of small-to-medium port towns, most situated at the mouth of a river that leads further inland.

Locations:
-Lambholt Forest: (see above)
-Devil&#39;s Breach: a fissure that has opened in the earth. Far from the towns.
-Geier Reach: The mountain range that dominates Ulvenwald, the Geier Reach, defines it utterly.
