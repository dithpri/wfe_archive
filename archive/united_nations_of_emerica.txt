The United Nations of Emerica (UNE) is a region composed entirely of democratic nations seeking to further diplomacy through peaceful politics. If you are a friendly nation that revels in debating policies and opposes violence unless absolutely necessary, please do join the UNE and become a member of a rapidly growing region set on taking the world, and the World Assembly, by storm.
