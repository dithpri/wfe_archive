An island chain of swampy marshes and barren wastelands in the middle of the pacific. Known as the dump of the sea because all of the worlds rubbish and waste end up here from the ocean currents drastically changing the island landscape from a paradise to a nightmare in a matter of decades. Venomous reptiles and parasitic plague flies congregate all throught the marshes making it inhospitable to all but the natives, who have mastered and enslaved the flora and fauna of the marshes for their own nefarious deeds.
