The planet Aquui is a roughly Earth-sized planet, consisting of several principalities united in a few nations.

Chief among these is the Centrus Empire. It comprises the principalities of the Central Throne, the Norther, the Baltas, the Cloudlands, and the Tailands, and the semi-autonomous protectorates of the Krystal Kingdom and Glaiceia. It is a peaceful empire that has not seen conflict until very recently, with the rise of the Church of Storia. Besides these, there also exist the [i]Imperium Gryphonia[/i], a mercenary kingdom to the east, across the Celestial Sea, as well as the Zebrican Tribes, a scattering of disunited tribes to the west, connected to the Centrus continent by a stretch of land.
