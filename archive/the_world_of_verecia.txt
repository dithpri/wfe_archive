Verecia is sort of a nasty planet, rather unexplored by its civilians, and devoid of much plant life -- rather rocky and mountainous, with a lot of water and very little land. Its prime gods are Eloth and Yurchi, the god of the sun and purity, and the goddess of life and death respectively. Naduin-Cil, the god of nature and love, peeks in every now and then, but most other supernatural beings are either dead or aspects of the big three.
