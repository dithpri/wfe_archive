Vexuvios; The terrifyingly powerful region housing the power-hungry, control-freakish nation of Grisliya. A region truly unlike every other. Wielding devastating power and in possession of a populace with an increadibly high IQ, even though they are all sheep waiting to fall prey to the wolves in congress. 

Interestingly enough, the region is quite ahead in time, unlike most other regions swinging around with sticks and stones now a&amp;#39;days.

For the time being, the Region is lead by the ferocious three-man dictatorship-court of Grisliya, but given the nations unstability given entering a new age in their given religious calendar, the future of the region and it&amp;#39;s leader may be known by the prophets only.
