Ishelvete, one of the most Northern regions of NationStates, is known for being covered by snow and ice almost all year long. However, due to a weird natural phenomenon known as the Gust of Summer Stream some regions have a much warmer and temperate climate, while others have extreme weather-changes instead. Vestlandet, for example, rarely has a median temperature of less than -5, while the Northland&amp;#39;s summers fluctuate wildly in time, space and temperature.
