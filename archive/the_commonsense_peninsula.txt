Dear residents of our great region,

After the region of [region]DEN[/region] made a feeble attempt to invade and gain administrative control over our region, your humble leader, [nation]Lobsterburg[/nation], successfully regained control of our region by employing all diplomatic tools available to him.

Forever praise [nation]Lobsterburg[/nation].
