Zoticus Utopia is a democratic peaceful region known for its Opulence (Wealth), religion, and militaristic expansion. We fell that people should have there own rights earn their own money up to a reasonable extent instead of going directly to the leader. Living under a dictatorship is misery. Freedom is key. Our regional flag is in the right hand corner. The pitch fork and the reef around it represents victory over oppressment. The diamond around it symbolizes protection and freedom due to democracy. The diamond stands for strength and bravery Finally blue stands for justice, and white stands for purity and elucidation.
