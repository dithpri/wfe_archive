The Confederation of Nations to bring all the nations of the world together to keep the peace and to prosper together.
Established: 4/29/2018 

Borders will be handled by the Confederation and voted in a poll if a border dispute comes it&#39;s way. But, if needed the two nations may go to war but, the war will not lead for monstrosities to accrue. Any nation is welcomed here under the protection of the Confederation of Nations. Embassies will be constructed to promote peace, alliances, negotiations of matters.
