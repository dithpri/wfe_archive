[b][color=darkgreen][i]We had the songs that we sang along to
You had the moves to make me dance with you
I always saw you reaching and catching stars
Did you follow your follow your fire
We had the thing that everyone wanted
Hung on your sleeve, you wore your heart on it
Did you get out I&#39;m wondering where you are?
Did you follow your follow your fire[/i][/color][/b]
