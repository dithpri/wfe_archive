The Sol Alliance is a region used by &#39;Aurora&#39; Community members to gather on NationStates. We may begin welcoming non-Aurora affiliated nations into the region, this will probably be voted on. Until then, please do not share the password (Aurora) with anyone else besides Aurorans and close-friends that are interested in joining, I invite you to invite your friends as well.
