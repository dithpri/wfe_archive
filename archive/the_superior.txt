[i]This region has a story behind it. In our lore, the continent of R&#39;kassia being the 8th contenient of the coast of Indonesia and the same longitudinal line of Panama is our home. It was peaceful with one single alliance making up all the nation being [region]Raazorol[/region], until everything changed. The nation of [nation]Kappa Klub Kappa[/nation] led multiple nations to break away from [region]Raazorol[/region] due to tensions between them and [nation]Hatful[/nation]. 
Later [nation]Kappa Klub Kappa[/nation] founded The Superior. The other nations left behind formed a new regime being The [region]Besties[/region]/[region]The Losers[/region]. Though [region]Raazorol[/region] still remains as the Continental Alliance in case of international issues.  [/I]
