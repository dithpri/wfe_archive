[color=red][b]Welcome to the [region]ULSR[/region] (U.L.S.R; [u][i]Union of Leftist Socialist Republics[/i][/u])[/color][/b]!

[i]&quot;[color=red]The Proletariat has nothing to lose but his chains. We have a world to win. WORKERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE![/color]&quot;[/i]
-[i]Karl Marx, &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;[/i]

[b]The [color=red]ULSR[/color] is a traditionally [color=red]Marxist-Leninist[/color] region which believes in the spread of [color=red]Communism[/color] on NationStates and the defeat of the Fascism. This leftist region is welcome to all comrades of ours; Marxists-Leninists, Hoxhaists, Maoists, etc. Stay and help us build a strong-hold here![/b]

[i]Please let me know if you have any ideas or if you have anything that you want changed, and I&#39;ll see what I can do. Thank You![/i]

[b][color=blue]NEWS:[/b] I have returned. A new central leadership will be decided upon soon, and the region further organized.[/color]
