The Hizashi Alliance is an alliance that has stayed strong for almost a month. 

Though we had dark times after a founding member left.  After going through 3 WA Delegates in two days, we established control after kicking the corrupt Punajabi then graciously letting him back in.

We now have a controled goverment, thanks to the establishment of the counsel. 

We have established embassies with The Gekko Alliance and the Isles Draknorath Allience.
