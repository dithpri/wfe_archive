BEC is run by its founder, the grand move buster of [nation]Limopalise[/nation]. [nation]Greater Woodsonia[/nation] (a group of semi-independent monarchies in personal union) is here too. The subsidiary countries of the BEC include the maniacal war-mongerers of Barretonia and Iyandel, a country ruled by a king who loves his ravens, loves his laws, and loves his complaining. There were originally various other protectorates until several mysteriously localised apocalypses occurred.

Please, enjoy, take a load off, and enjoy the BEC&amp;#39;s natural beauty*.

*Natural beauty does not apply to Iyandel. Even Barretonia&amp;#39;s is better than it, I mean, come on.
