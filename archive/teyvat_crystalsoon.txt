Welcome to Teyvat Crystalsoon!

We are a very welcoming nation, and although we are new, we do have some rules, but you can look at that all at the bottom....

The main reason we exist is for making allies! You can talk to people here to find people you trust and would like to join hands with in an alliance!

Please be nice!

Rules:

No bad language (Swearing) Or innapropriate comments.

That&#39;s really the only rule as of now, but the rulebook is subject to change!

Once again, thanks for joining.

Sincerely,
Teyvat Crystalsoon Founder,
Queen of Rebekahland
