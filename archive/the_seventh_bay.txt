We are [region]The Seventh Bay[/region], a region set out to start a small alliance to gain world power. We believe in a right leaning, freedom based union where oppression is not allowed. The region is located around a small bay colonized by all regions who join around, starting with the founder [nation]The First Republic of the Seventh Bay[/nation] and the current WA Delegate [nation]The League of Brasses[/nation]. So join us if you want, you&amp;#39;ll be glad you did!

[color=11cc22]The position of WA delegate is elected by your endorsements, so choose wisely.[/color]
