We will not ban you based on names.
=================================================================================== Jermaine Cole&#39;s album released on December 7th, 2014, &quot;2014 Forest Hillls Drive&quot;, went double platinum with NO FEATURES. However, he still has yet to in a grammy. Many think this is because of his race. But the fact of the truth is that he is trash. (Hopefully won&#39;t get banned for saying J. Cole is trash)
