Ladies and Gentlemen of Peninsula Point. We have an urgent humanitarian crisis on our hands. As you may have heard, The Embassy, the very center of Nationstates, has been invaded. It is our duty as nations of Peninsula Point to take a stand and liberate/protect our ally. The Black Hawks is a great threat. Don&#39;t be surprised if they come for us next. We are a region at war. It pains me so, but we must do what is right. If you do not wish to stand against this fiend, I will not make you. You may enlist in the poll below if you wish. That is all.
