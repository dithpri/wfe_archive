General Gustav Zenlav founded MandalMotors several hundred years before the Battle of Yavin. The company created numerous starships including the Pursuer-class enforcement ship, one of which would come into the ownership of the famed bounty hunter Boba Fett and eventually be known as Slave II. They also manufactured the StarViper-class attack platform, one of which would become Prince Xizor&#39;s Virago.
