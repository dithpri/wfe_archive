This is what you get for hugging the sentient bread.
you made a really [i]crumby[/i] decision.
Do you [i]knead[/i] to be shown who is in charge again?
al[i]dough[/i], we did hit you pretty good.
we can spare a [i]slice[/i] of kindness this time and not kill yah on the spot.
then again, we do [i]loaf[/i] the taste of human meat...
no. we wait. until next time.
love,
the bread cult
