Based on a name of a guild in world of warcraft and a nation named after it, The &amp;quot;Infinite Death Alliance&amp;quot; is a nation home for those that like a region that does not actively engage in war unless threatened and promises to preserve as many freedoms as possible. We were founded By a Nation that wanted the ability to have a wider range of people to play with but also determined to uphold freedoms that sometimes must be bought in blood and &amp;quot;Infinite Death.&amp;quot; We encourage rights of nations to defend themselves but discourage active warfare for any other purpose.
