We are the Grand Conglomerate of Nations, a group dedicated to world peace, ending hunger around the globe, promoting the global economies, and on occasion, pillaging our way through several continents. We will defend all members of the GCN, both diplomatically and militarily, but we will avoid war if at all possible.
