We are allied Christian nations. We are democratic nations. We believe in a strong and stable government rooted in Jesus. Our primary goal goes beyond the game of nations states, to reach those who do not know Jesus. The Alliance of Christian Democracies has an (obviously) democratic government that seeks to serve the people.
