[color=#630330]The law school of Berytus (also known as the law school of Beirut) was [i]the[/i] center for the study of Roman law in classical antiquity, located in Berytus (modern-day Beirut, Lebanon). It flourished under the patronage of the Roman (and later, Byzantine) emperors, until its destruction due to a massive earthquake in 551 AD. It never recovered.[/color]
