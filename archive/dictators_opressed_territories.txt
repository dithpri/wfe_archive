[b]The Great Region Of [region]Dictators Opressed Territories[/region][/b] 

Welcome to the sacred lands of rich history! A land once ruled by the supreme Nation of Holy North Warvania, the hunger for power was what ultimately led that Nation to its demise. The founding father, Holy North Warvania was strategically overthrown by an overseen Nation, the United Nations Of The Parliament. With the region now under the full control of a new dictatorship we will rise to the top and surpass any threat in our path.
