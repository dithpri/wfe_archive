[color=#045FB4]This region at the current moment in time has no specific theme or motive.[/color]


[color=#2E64FE][b][u]Why this region exists:[/b][/u][/color]

[color=#045FB4]The region was made as a hub between several friends, a fast link between our nations and a protective barrier. It enables us to have a more direct influence on our immediate landscape and operate certain features which are not available in very large regions with many nations.[/color]
