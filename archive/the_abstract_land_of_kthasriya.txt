The Abstract Land of Kthasriya is a Region of undiscovered islands in the northern Pacific. It consists of many nations full of intelligent, philosophical, or downright insane citizens. Kthasriya was founded by the nation of Chapolia Zranzia which discovered the region using tidal data and radar. If a nation needs an intellectual sanctuary or a place to relinquish all reason, this is a good place to go. It is also rather isolated from the stupidities of major states. 

The region is generally democratic and free, but any nation is welcome. Religion s generally not accepted in argument or government and atheism is widespread, but it is not persecuted in any way. Humor is also highly valued.
