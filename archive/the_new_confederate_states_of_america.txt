The rebirth of the glorious nation that once existed in the south-eastern portion of the United States, we represent God, Freedom and Tax-Free Sweet Tea. We are very flexible about economic and social policies, and as long as your people are free, you are welcome. We are a small region, but we are close and friendly.
