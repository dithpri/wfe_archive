&quot;[i]Grammatik Macht Frei[/i]&quot; or &quot;Grammar Makes You Free&quot; is a true quote of all intellectuals, like us.

Destroy all nations who have horrible English.

Destroy all nations who use horrible foreign language.

Grammatical corrections are [b]highly[/b] suggested in the RMB whenever someone has made an error in their English.

Only in this school (region) are you allowed to practice the art of grammar correcting. Do not do it in embassy regions.

This is the KGB, nobody has more authority than words (aka us)...
