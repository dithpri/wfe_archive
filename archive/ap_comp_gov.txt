AP Comparative Government is a region where students struggle through a complex syllabus covering political systems, institutions, public policy, and comparative politics. Governed by &quot;The Syllabus,&quot; it&#39;s an area where late-night cramming, caffeine, and panic-driven study sessions are the norm. The economy thrives on energy drinks, and the education system is designed to prepare students for the existential crisis that hits during the final exam. With a strained relationship with AP US Government, the region&#39;s foreign relations are tenuous, and its military is made up of flashcards and highlighters.
