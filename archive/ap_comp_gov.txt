A loose conglomerate of nations dedicated to unification in our individuality.  We are all unique in the same way.  Our motto &#147;Anarchist of the world unite!&#148; has recently replaced &#147;Procrastinators Unite! Tomorrow, or maybe some other day&#148;, we actually just got around to changing it, we&#146;ve been meaning to do it for weeks.
