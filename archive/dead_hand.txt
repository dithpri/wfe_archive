[b]Dead Hand[/b] (Russian: &amp;#1057;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1084;&amp;#1072; &laquo;&amp;#1055;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1084;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1088;&raquo;, Systema &quot;Perimetr&quot;, lit. &quot;Perimeter&quot; System), also known as [b]Perimeter[/b], is a Cold War-era automatic nuclear weapons-control system used by the Soviet Union.

An example of fail-deadly and mutual assured destruction deterrence, it can automatically trigger the launch of the Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) by sending a pre-entered highest-authority order to command posts and individual silos if a nuclear strike is detected even with the commanding elements fully destroyed.

The purpose of the Dead Hand system, was to maintain a second-strike capability, by ensuring that the destruction of the Soviet leadership would not have prevented the Soviet military from releasing its weapons.
