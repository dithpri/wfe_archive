The United Coalition of Nations is an anti-fascist coalition region formed for the purpose of fighting the global tides of fascism wherever they may be. While we may use explicitly communist, socialist, or anarchist imagery and talking points we allow a fairly diverse range of ideologies and economic systems to join our region so long as their nation is not a fascist one. More details on the qualifications needed for joining our region are listed below. (WIP)
