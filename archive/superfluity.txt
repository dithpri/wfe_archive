Rain in Autumn is the best, followed by monsoon season rain water. Autumn rain water is clear and cool, monsoon season rain water is clear and sweet. Spring time water is superior to winter water, because the weather is mild and the rain is sweet. The water from a summer thunderstorm is quite harmful, probably because of the thunder storm caused by evil dragon turmoil. Snow is the essence of crops, hence harvesting snow to brew tea is great, however you must avoid new snow, as it may have the odor of the earth; slightly aged snow is much better. Collect celestial water with cloth, however do not collect under the eaves, rather collect in the center of courtyard.
