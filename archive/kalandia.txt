[b]Is a Democracy really that different from a Dictatorship?[/b]
Dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty. - Plato
The only difference is that in a democracy the masses choose to be ruled by dictators; while in a dictatorship the masses don&amp;#39;t choose to be ruled by dictators.
