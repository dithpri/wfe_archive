Is a Democracy really that different from a Dictatorship? 
Democrats use entertainment to blind the masses, and fast food to feed them.
Dictators use propaganda to blind the masses, and government coupons to feed them.
Bread and Circuses; Ignorance vs Brainwashing
The only difference is that in a Democracy the masses choose to be ruled by dictators; while in a Dictatorship the masses don&amp;#39;t choose to be ruled by dictators.
