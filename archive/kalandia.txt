Is a Democracy really that different from a Dictatorship? 
Democrats use entertainment to blind the masses, and fast food to feed them.
Dictators use propaganda to blind the masses, and government coupons to feed them.
Bread and Circuses
The only difference is that in a Democracy the masses choose to be ruled by dictators; while in a Dictatorship the masses don&amp;#39;t choose to be ruled by dictators.
