Hello, and welcome to The Siren Snarkipelago!

This region is for everyone, and exists just to have fun within the game. The only thing we ask is that you do not post any racist or demeaning content anywhere. Other than that, everything is game. We don&#146;t currently have a WA delegate, but if you join the WA, we can get a poll on that and have one soon. Please pay attention to polls, as they have the role play and are used for research, and those aren&#146;t very useful if no one pays attention.

Anyway, have fun, and thank you for joining [region]The Siren Snarkipelago[/region]!
