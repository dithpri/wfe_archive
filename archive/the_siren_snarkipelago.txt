Hello, and welcome to The Siren Snarkipelago!

This region is for everyone, and exists just to have fun within the game. The only thing we ask is that you do not post any racist or demeaning content anywhere. Other than that, everything is game. We sincerely ask that you endorse the World Assembly Delegate, [nation]Anarchistic SA[/nation]. To do this, you should see a button at the bottom of the nation&#146;s page, reading, [b]Endorse (nation)[/b]. If you don&#146;t see this button, you need to join the World Assembly (WA). To join the WA, you simply need to supply your email to the WA, and BAM!, you have a confirmation email sent to you. Overall, this should be a fairly painless process. 

Anyway, have fun, and thank you for joining [region]The Siren Snarkipelago[/region]!
