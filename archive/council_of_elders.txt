The Council of Elders is the legislature and chief authority on all St Abbaddon affairs. They hold the chief decision making powers on most issues.

There will be seven members of the Council of Elders. The six Elders are elected to three month month terms, two elected at the beginning of each month. The Delegate will have a permanent voting seat on the Council. More can be learned about the elections in the pinned dispatches here.
