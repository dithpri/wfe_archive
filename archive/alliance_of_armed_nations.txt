[u][b]WELCOME TO THE ALLIANCE OF ARMED NATIONS[/B][/u]
[i]We&#39;re back.[/i] The AOAN has returned from its 254 days of inactivity. We were a once mighty region, but we need your help to come back and make our mark on the world yet again. We fought against fascism, and freed the oppressed. If you want to join this noble cause, telegram [nation]Bougheyia[/nation] for more information.
