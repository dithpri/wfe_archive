Hello!

Welcome to [region]Disjunct Nations of Bulthland[/region], a place of varying opinions and the ability to live the life you want to live without having to worry about adhering to any specific political or economic doctrine. We serve less as a regional government or unified group and more as a place for individual and disjunct nations to interact with one another. We accept all political and economic doctrine.

While there is very little in terms of actual rules, I would ask that you join the World Assembly and endorse [nation]West Slavistan[/nation], our regional coup guy.
