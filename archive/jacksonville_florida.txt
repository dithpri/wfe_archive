[b][u]Welcome to Jacksonville Florida, [i]m e m e b o y s.[/i][/u][/b]
This region is a world into its own, for WHS kiddos and the like who wanna play.
And, important note, we don&#39;t do any WA or inter-regional stuff, this is sorta like our own private world.

[b]MAP STUFF[/b]
JF is based around Asia, so that&#39;s where all of our countries are. [i]Know that when naming them.[/i]
The map contains info on where all of the countries and their borders are, their capitals (when we have them), war fronts (if that ever happens), etc.
You can find the google drive link to map on the Message Board since it&#39;s regularly updated.

[b]COUNTRY STUFF[/b]
