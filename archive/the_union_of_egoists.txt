All things are nothing to me. Are they to you too?

They say of God, [i]names name thee not[/i]; do you say the same for you?

Do you not look upon yourself as a tool of the idea or a vessel of God, recognize no calling, doesn&#39;t fancy that you exist for the further development of mankind and that you must contribute your mite to it, but live yourself out, careless of how well or ill humanity may fare thereby?

Welcome!
