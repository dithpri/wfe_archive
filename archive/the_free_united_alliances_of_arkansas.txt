The TFUAA is a group of nations operating out of the remains of Greater Arkansas.
Founded by Cruztophsis, these nations are united by a sense of allegiance to each other out of necessity to survive the beautiful, yet deadly wastelands of Greater Arkansas after the fall of Trumplandia. Bootle controls the 11th wasteland, and mediates deals with the local raider tribes, New Gleidor is located in the frigid and desolate Krakum mountains, Korduna controls the methane rich death marshes, and Cruztophsis operates out of the Cruztopia mesa and basin, it and bootle use their considerable military might to protect the other nations.
