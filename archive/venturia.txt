Hi everyone, Venturia is the Venturian region. I&#146;ve put the map as our flag for now.

There aren&#146;t any restrictive rules in this region preventing you from doing your own thing except from no saying  &#147;Monday&#148; when it&#146;s Tuesday and vice versa, no using this emoji: &amp;#128186; in any of your Factbook entries and no two countries in Venturia can share the same national animal unless it is a bee.

Happy Scouting! Or unhappy scouting, really. You do you.
