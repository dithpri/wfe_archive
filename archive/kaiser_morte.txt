I&#39;ve been gone. I left to reassess the direction I see this country going in, I wanted things different in the beginning, I wanted things fair. I&#39;ve decided to take Ode Duddis home. Our lands of Kaiser Leaga were burned and destroyed by our enemies. But I&#39;ve found new land in the ashes of our past. A home for my people. This land is Kaiser Morte.
