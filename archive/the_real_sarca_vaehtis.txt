Founded on the principle of self determination, Sarca Vaehtis is an alliance of countries, states and groups who believe a nation should be free from outside control and influence. A nation should be able to determine it&amp;#39;s own fate, it&amp;#39;s own laws and it&amp;#39;s own principles, not be dictated by others who may feel differently.
