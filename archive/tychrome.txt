[b]Tychrome[/b] is an old region.

I made it in 2012 when I first joined this site under the alias [nation]Tyhcoon[/nation]. Over the next couple years it would grow to 345 nations and house a nerdy RP community with terrible writing skills. It was pretty cool.

Like most UCRs it eventually disbanded after being hacked and most of us moved on. I think, at least. A few can still be found in [region]Icarus[/region], [region]Axiom Supercluster[/region], and the Pacifics. I myself don&#39;t come on here much and do my creative stuff offsite. 

This little thing can stay here though, so long as I remember to log in. 

Thanks for the times. And sorry for wasting yours, if you happened to stumble in here randomly.
