[b]Welcome to the utopia of [color=darkred]Tychrome[/color]! 

Our RMB is regularly active, and we regularly have elections for government positions! We also have a tight-knit community, which keeps us aside from those massive, impersonal regions. Tychrome is an RP community as well, so if you like RPing, you&amp;#39;ve come to the right place!
