[color=blue]Top 5 Regions in the World![/color] Likely one of the most oppressive! Sister region of [region]The Seventh Bay[/region]

Motto: &amp;quot;What do we want? Oppression! When do we want it? Whenever is fine, I guess!&amp;quot;

We, here in the League, are always promoting what the common man would consider awful government types (dictatorships/police states/consumerists), but that&amp;#39;s why we are extraordinary! We love all people, so we allow regular or even &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; governments, but it is not promoted, like dictatorships. We are constantly striving to expand to world power in a healthy way.
