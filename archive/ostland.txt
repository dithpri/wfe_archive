Hello my friend!

Welcome to ostland!

Everyone who knows Russian or Ukrainian lives in this region. Of course, we are not against foreigners, and this is even great for the development of our region. We welcome everyone from empires to free anarchist territories. As soon as enough nations gather, we will launch RP and other entertainments.

Why Ostland? Well, it&#146;s more likely that Russians and Ukrainians live in the east, and the great leader and creator of the region loves German language
