Everyone is welcome in this region, as long as you follow our rules. Any issues you have with other nations will be discussed [b]ONCE[/b], and the Council shall decide whether the issue(s) are worth our time. If so, we will put the decision to a vote within our region to decide if we should deal with it or not. If yes, we will act in the manner we see fit. If no, the issue will not be brought to regional attention again. However, you may seek out supporters and try to resolve your issues with their support, but you and any support you have must take full responsibility for your actions. We will take a majority vote on any WA Resolutions. A ban may be repealed, but the repeal vote is limited to the Council alone.
