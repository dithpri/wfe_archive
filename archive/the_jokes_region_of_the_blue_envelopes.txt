We are The Grand Region of the Blue Envelopes. This region is built upon the faults of the stars which came before us. If you are looking for Alaska, then this is the place for you. Please be advised that this is not a region for paper towns. We can and will defend ourselves from outside attacks. If you live in our simply Grand region, then you are known as a Katherine. We hope to soon have an abundance of Katherines. We hope you will come join us in our possitivly nerdfightastic region!
