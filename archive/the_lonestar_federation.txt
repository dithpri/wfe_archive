The Lonestar Federation stands for personal rights, free markets, fiscal responsibility and global presence.  And scotch, lots of good scotch.

Libertarians, free-thinkers, traditional conservative Republicans, neo-Conservative Republicans, and in fact anyone with an economically conservative perspective is welcome.  There is no snobbery here, and we look for energetic individuals to get in on the ground floor, and help build a better region with ambitious plans.  And we can drink scotch and talk about it in the forum.

At the moment, it&amp;#39;s just me here, and it may be that way a while.  This is all an experiment right now, so let&amp;#39;s kick back and see how it takes off!
