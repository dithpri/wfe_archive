I have founded The Lonestar Federation for anyone who wants to join in the fight against tyranny.  I call it [b]&amp;quot;The War Against Tyranny.&amp;quot;[/b]

Fed up with authoritarianism?  Leaders who consolidate and centralize power?  Communists, fascists and assorted dictatorial regimes the concentrate power in the hands of a few?  If so, The Lonestar Federation is your place.  We have ambitious plans and are growing, and anyone with an economically conservative perspective is welcome.
