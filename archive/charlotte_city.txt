[i][color=blue]Welcome To Charlotte NC! You&#146;ve Stepped into the Queen&#146;s City![/color][/i]

[color=orange]Charlotte is the Largest City in North Carolina,[/color]

[color=lightblue]Beneath the sky of Carolina blue,
Where dreams run fast and skies stay true,
There stands a city bold, refined&#151;
A Southern gem, with modern mind.

Her crown of glass and steel shines bright,
With towers gleaming through the night,
Yet roots run deep in red clay soil,
Where rebels marched and farmers toil.

The Queen City, proud and tall,
With racing hearts and Panthers&#39; call,
Uptown pulses, sleek and wide,
Where history and hustle coincide.
