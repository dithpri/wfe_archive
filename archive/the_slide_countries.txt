On 18/03/18,
We added together seperated countires&#39; Civil Rights, Economy and Political Freedoms to find a total rating out of 300. We then found the percentage to divine a &quot;total rating&quot; for the countries. The results are:
[nation] Aussandries [/nation] 79.07
[nation] Orennica [/nation]  77.61
[nation] Desertlandz [/nation] 76.67
[nation] oskopolis [/nation] 72.79
[nation] Casterall [/nation] 69.95
[nation] Iyzlandz [/nation] 67.74
[nation] pilgerwood [/nation] 67.67
[nation] nnoland [/nation] 61.06
[nation] aussandrose [/nation] 60.89
[nation] the isle of tinland [/nation] 60.40
[nation] DCBA [/nation] 46.47
[nation] outlanders [/nation] 40.44
[nation] eel harbour [/nation] 35.58
These results may have changed since then, but Aussandries doesn&#39;t want to change it because Orennica is now better than it.
