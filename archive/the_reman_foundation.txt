Founded by [nation]Sargon Reman[/nation] (Defender and proud citizen of the 10000 Islands) in 2018, The Reman Foundation was created with the purpose of encouraging more use of the Security Council and primarily to research and write resolutions for overlooked and forgotten nations and regions.
We do Commendations and Condemnations for nations/regions of merit and we also do Repeals and Liberations.
We believe in using the SC for goodwill, peace and the use of force.
