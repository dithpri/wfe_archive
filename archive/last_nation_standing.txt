[spoiler=under construction][b]Welcome to Last Nation Standing[/b] - a contest by [region]Europeia[/region]&#39;s Ministry of Culture!

[u]How to play[/u]
Create a puppet nation and place it in this region. Telegram [nation]Comfed[/nation] with its name from your nation in [region]Europeia[/region]. Every day, a random world census stat (excluding ones not changed by issues like WA endorsements, influence, population) will be selected and the bottom nation in the region will be ejected.
[i]~May the stats be ever in your favour![/i]
