                                      ~THE RULES~
-Do not post anything derogatory in the comments (Racism, sexism, etc.)
-Do not spam in the comments
-If you are WA Delegate, do not abuse your powers.
-Only vote once (Do not make several nations just to get your way)
-Challenges within the region are fine, as long as you do not begin to brag or show off.
-Clippy has the final say in the punishment of anyone who violates these rules.
Since these rules may not cover everything, if there is another issue, I will create a new rule for that issue. If you want to propose/repeal a new rule, please mention it in the comments and get 1 supporter, then the people will vote on it.

Have fun, and remember to bring your sacrifices for Clippy!
