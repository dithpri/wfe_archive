~THE RULES~
-Do not post anything derogatory in the comments (Racism, sexism, etc.)
-Do not spam in the comments
-If you are WA Delegate, do not abuse your powers. Ask the founder before changing anything.
-Only vote once (Do not vote with multiple nations)
-Challenges within the region are allowed
-Clippy has the final say in the punishment of anyone who violates these rules.
-If you ignore other region&amp;#39;s rules, you will be punished as if you are in that region. 
If there is another issue, I will create a new rule for that issue. If you want to propose/repeal a new rule, please mention it in the comments and get 1 supporter, then the people will vote on it.
