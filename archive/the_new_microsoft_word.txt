[b][color=#000034]The Rules[/b]
-If you become WA, do not abuse your powers. Ask Clippy to change anything. Also, WA Delegates will not have power until I deem them worthy.
-Do not spam, use personal names or post anything derogatory in the comments.
-Annoying Clippy has the final say in anything and everything. Also the first say. Every say.
Clippy will create any rules for anything else. [/color]
