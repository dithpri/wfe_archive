[color=purple][b]Remember when [region]I got nukes back off[/region] Citizens raided the region [region]Justice[/region], Removing the elected WA Delegate [nation]Holly United[/nation]. It was the worst decision for this region. We were nearly condemned. I am here to establish I got nukes back off with [/color][color=red]ORDER[/color].[/b]

[i]This region is dead, we mean no harm. And we are very sorry for our previous offense against the [region]Justice[/region] if any attempt to raid any other region from members of this region happens they will be banned from this region. I will not endorse raiding for anyone in this region or anywhere else, if you participate in a raid you will be banned.[/i]
