Esquan!!!!!!
Narrator: There are a gajillions of stories of mischief and fun
But to keep things simple, let&#39;s just start with one.
About a mom and two kids and a house and a hat
That, oddly enough, was worn by a cat.
But soon enough we will get to all that.
In the valley that stretches from this hill to that lawn,
A region is nestled. That region is Esquan.
