Comprised of 26 nations, full of diverse cultures and peoples that make up the entire continent of Astridia, here to virtually everything from beautiful locations to areas ravaged by endless wars, political conflicts afflict some regions, forcing many into exile and finding a new life in other countries. Countries that, depending on the situation, help, or even send these people back, leaving them to their own devices. However, even with all these problems, the constituent nations try their best to maintain peace in the region, even if this is an almost impossible mission.
