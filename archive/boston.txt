[color=green]Got discord? Cool, we do too. Here is your invite![/color] YnHF7bX

[region]Boston[/region] home of the [b]Red Sox[/b], [b]Celtics[/b], [b]Bruins[/b] and nearby, the [u]Patriots![/u] You might recognize those sports teams as the best in the country over the last two decades!

With 85 Colleges and Universities nearby, Boston is a center of culture, scientific thought, and pre-marital relationships that result in regret. In addition, while Boston pays more than most Metro area&#39;s in the country, real estate is also insanely expensive as a result!

Come join the Revolution!
