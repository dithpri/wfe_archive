this region is used for a game I am playtesting for a mixture of combining nation-states with the board game diplomacy.  if you are looking at this you should already have access to a copy of the game&#39;s rules.  You will be able to see the daily news here every mourning, and you will need to email the account connerwademandm&amp;#64;gmail.com with your moves for that day or anything you wish to show up in the news the next day by 8:00 pm CST if you want them to go into effect.  just in case you lose your copy of the rules another can also be found here inside the region.
