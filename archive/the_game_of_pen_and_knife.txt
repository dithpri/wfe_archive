this region is used for a game I am playtesting for a mixture of combining nation-states with the board game diplomacy.  if you are looking at this you should already have access to a copy of the game&#39;s rules.  You will be able to see the daily news here every mourning, and you will need to email the account connerwademandm&amp;#64;gmail.com with your moves for that day or anything you wish to show up in the news the next day by 8:00 pm CST if you want them to go into effect.  just in case you lose your copy of the rules another can also be requested from the email listed above or by sending a telegram to Most Certainly not a Dictatorship.
