[b]As [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were mourning the loss of their beloved Penny, they suddenly experienced a collective flash of brilliance! Penny is a metal robot, so they should be able to use metal detectors to search for Penny! They found many old instruments and old gadgets, but alas, Penny is still nowhere to be found...

Any penny sightings should be promptly reported to [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]this hotline[/url].
