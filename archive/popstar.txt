[color=#DC143C]Despite it&#39;s coloration from space, [region]Popstar[/region]&#39;s atmosphere is remarkably Earth-like from the surface with blue oceans and land masses similar to Earth&#39;s, as well as a wide range of climates supporting a bountiful array of life. It is possible that something in the planet&#39;s exosphere reflects - or gives off - a yellow light to make it appear the way it does from space. [/color]
