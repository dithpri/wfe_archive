want to remove yourself from international politics and follow an agenda of producing bio-technological horrors which should not exist, and use them to war against your enemies? or simply find that the WA does not appeal and that you would prefer some peace and quiet? Telegram me and I&amp;#39;ll see if I can let you in. 

Here in the Skarab region we follow a few codes:
-avoid the WA, they don&amp;#39;t do anything and would attempt severely restrict our biological technology
-avoid security council (same reasons)
-don&amp;#39;t kill each other

All I can think of currently, more codes may be added later.
