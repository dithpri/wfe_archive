[color=gold][b][i]MISSION STATEMENT: This is a region where everyone deserves to feel comfortable and safe. We love character roleplay, diplomacy, trade, and major issues. There will be wars, however, if you are simply here to &quot;see and conquer&quot; or vassalize and conquer, then you better move on to your next choice.[/i][/b][/color]
