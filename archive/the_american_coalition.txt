The American Coalition is a collection of states that provides protection to all members, and allows all members to help in making it a  better, and more safe coalition. We don&#39;t care if you are communist, capitalist, or somewhere in the middle, you and your opinions are always welcome around here. We accept all nations including democracies, monarchies, and even elective monarchies. We also have elections, where nations vote to decide who will have different roles next.
