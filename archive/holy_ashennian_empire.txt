Ashennia traces its cultural origins back to the attempted invasion of the Angalio Isles by Julius Caesar in 55 BC. Caesar was met with strong resistance from the local Celtic tribes, who elected a &quot;super-leader,&quot; the Angaloan King Xter vi Sin , who became the founder of the imperial family. The election of the king and the repulsion of the Romans is the starting date of &quot;Ascension Throne Ashennia,&quot; the universal dating system in the region.
