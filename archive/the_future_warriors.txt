We are a nation built on fighting for our recognition. We want a spot in the United Nations. We want to be known by other countries. We don&#39;t want to be that country on the map that you have only noticed because it was next to a popular one. We want to have a mark in history.Joining this nation means you are the most noble, powerful, and greatest warriors in this army. I put great trust in you.
