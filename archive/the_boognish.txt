All tolerant* nations are welcome in The Boognish. Though a nation&amp;#39;s laws may not match 100% on all the political issues surrounding these topics, but all residents of The Boognish must agree to: equal rights for all creeds/races/sexes/sexual orientation/nationality/native language. Socialists, Capitalists, Libertarians, and pretty much everyone else can agree with each other enough to work together to construct a better future. These ideals form the foundation of The Boognish.
*Sorry, but Fascist nations, racists, homophobes, sexists, and bigoted members of all kinds will be booted from The Boognish.
