Aincrad is an iron-and-stone made floating castle that has about ten thousand kilometers floor base diameter and consists of a hundred floors stacking straight upwards, meaning that each floor&amp;#39;s diameter is a bit smaller than the previous one. On each floor, there are a couple of large cities along with countless small scale towns and villages, forests, plains, and even lakes. Only one stairway links each floor to another
