This region is intended to be a place for nations to express their political ideas and opinions, and the actions of the region&#39;s delegate (and what not) will be determined by the will of the majority (and perhaps a mini-council at some point, but I&#39;m getting ahead of myself). Come to The Pickle Area, and help us create and mantain a government!
