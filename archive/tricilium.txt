A large island set in the middle of the ocean with no close neighbors, Tricilium is circled by a massive ring of barrier reefs and cliffs, preventing all ships from entering it&#39;s coastal waters except for one entrance. The island itself is temperate in climate with forests, mountains, fields, beaches and cities.
