This is the land of all Nations in Exile of the Old World. Having been cast from the shores of Middle Earth and other realms of Arda these souls; Man, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit and Orc; have made their new homes and kingdoms in this virgin land west of Lindon. 
Valinor is forever lost to those Eldar among us, even upon this most westen shore. The lands of heritage for Men are in ruin, the Shire of the peaceful Hobbits has withered into ash. The stone halls of the Dwarves have been sacked by the last of the dragons. Even the Orc have been forced from their haunts. 
Now in this new world each must make alliances and make war with their neighbors for what resources are available.
