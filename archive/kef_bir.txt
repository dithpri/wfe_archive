In 4 ABY, a successful attack by the Rebel Alliance on the Death Star II resulted in its destruction. The remaining wreckage, including what was left of the superlaser dish and the Emperor&#39;s Throne Room, fell into Kef Bir&#39;s orbit and crashed into the seas. The explosion of the reactor lead to abnormal physics and several massive pieces of debris were launched into hyperspace.

In 35 ABY, Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Chewbacca arrived on Kef Bir following directions found on Ochi&#39;s blade and translated by C-3PO, to secure a Wayfinder to Exegol belonging to Darth Sidious aboard the wreckage of Death Star II.[/b][/color]
