This region was refounded by a neo-Nazi, who dedicated it to the passengers and crew of [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Wilhelm_Gustloff][i]MV Wilhelm Gustloff[/i][/url], a German ship sunk by the Soviets in January 1945 while evacuating German civilians from Poland. 9,400 people died, making it the single biggest loss of life for a single ship in history. Later the region came under the control of [region]Nationalsozialistische Volksstaaten[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b].

The memorial will remain, but it will no longer be used to promote the vilest of ideologies.
