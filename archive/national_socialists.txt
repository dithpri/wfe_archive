[b]Wilhelm Gustloff[/b] was a Swiss National Socialist, cowardly assassinated by a Jew in 1936.  

The beautiful [b][color=red]Strength through Joy [/color][/b]cruise ship&nbsp;[b]MV Wilhelm Gustloff[/b] was named after him and was launched in the late 1930s.  In January 1945 this ship was torpedoed by the Soviet war criminals with the loss of over [b]9,000[/b] refugees&#146; lives - the worst maritime disaster in human history, dwarfing that of the Titanic.  

The people who drowned were mostly women and children and old men, fleeing the Soviet beast.

This region will stand as a [b]monument against Soviet brutality[/b] for all time.
