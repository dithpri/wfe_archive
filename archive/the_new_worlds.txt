The region features diverse cultures, kingdoms, and empires, with the earth taking a different shape.

The industrial and social revolutions ramp up, and the world becomes a playground for your imagination. [b]The New Worlds[/b] invites adventurers to seize their opportunities in this fearless new world, where creativity is the only limit.
