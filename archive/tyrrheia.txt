A large subcontinent, Tyrrheia hosts one of the most diverse and awe inspiring geographies on the planet.
The Tyrrheian civilisations have grown from early Scandinavian and (supposedly) Roman settlers isolated from their mother cultures by a great sea storm blamed on the gods themselves.
Religion in Tyrrheia is a mixture of the Roman, Scandinavian and Baltic polytheisms, with a tiny minority of immigrant families practicing monotheistic beliefs.
Tyrrheia is inhabited by two nations; occupying most of the landmass and islands, the Most Serene Republic of Tyrrheia, and occupying some of the surrounding islands- the Rogue Pirate nation of the Tyrrheian Pirates.
