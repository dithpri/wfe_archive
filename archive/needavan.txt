Hello, and [b]WELCOME[/b] to the wonderful region of Needavan! The name comes from the two languages of the first two nations, Feces land and Ostentum, using the Feces land root word &quot;Nid&quot; (pronounced &quot;need&quot;) meaning &quot;amazing, wonderful, epic&quot; and the Ostentum root word &quot;aven&quot; meaning &quot;region&quot;. So, &quot;Needavan&quot; means &quot;epic region&quot;!(and totally not the English words &quot;need a van&quot;.) So come and join [color=red]the epic region![/color]
