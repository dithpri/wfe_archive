I dream of a land which those who seek as a diplomatic &quot;heaven.&quot; I dream of a place which will be a joint alliance, which we see each other not as politicians, but as friends. I dream of a place that will not judge one for their race, gender, species. This Place is New Haven. &quot;We stand together, Never alone!&quot;
