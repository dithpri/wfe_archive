We are looking for nations that will be active, are WA members, and will endorse actively. You must endorse the vice-delegate and the WA delegate.
You may have 1-2 puppet nations. 
Every January 1st, May 1st, and September 1st, an election will take place to elect new officers. Puppet nations can vote, and voting is not mandatory.
Voting shall be conducted through an official poll conducted by a joint effort between the Founder, Delegate, Vice-Delegate, and the Research Officer.
We defend against raiders, but raiding by members is not discouraged, and may even be sponsored.
