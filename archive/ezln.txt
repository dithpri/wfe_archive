The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), is a revolutionary leftist political and militant group based in Chiapas, the southernmost state of Mexico.

Since 1994 the group has been in a declared war &quot;against the Mexican state&quot;, and against military, paramilitary and corporate incursions into Chiapas. This war has been primarily defensive. In recent years, it has focused on a strategy of civil resistance.  &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
