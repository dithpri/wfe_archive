The Wake is a world between worlds. Strange and impossible creatures roam the vast landscapes. Evolution is rapid and organisms change drastically over just a few generations. The Wake is almost entirely untouched by human influence. The many continents are covered in vast forests, sprawling plains, scorching deserts, all uninhabited. The intrepid explorers and colonists who come here have the chance to start new lives, free from the oppression of their homelands. It is a new beginning.
