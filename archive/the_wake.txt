The Wake is a world between worlds. Strange and impossible creatures roam the vast landscapes. Evolution is rapid and organisms change drastically over just a few generations. Time runs faster here; one solar day on Earth is equivalent to one lunar month in the Wake, and every time solar noon on Earth coincides with the zenith of the full moon in the Wake, a portal opens on the surface of each world&#39;s moon connecting the two. The Wake is almost entirely untouched by human influence. The landscapes are covered in vast forests, sprawling plains, scorching deserts, all uninhabited. It is a new beginning.
