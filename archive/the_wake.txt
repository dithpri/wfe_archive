The Wake is a world between worlds. Strange and impossible creatures roam the vast landscapes. Evolution is rapid and creatures can change over just a few generations. Time runs faster here; one solar day on Earth is equivalent to one lunar month in the Wake, and every time solar noon on Earth coincides with the zenith of the full moon in the Wake, a portal opens connecting the two realms. The Wake is almost entirely untouched by human influence. The landscapes are covered in vast forests, sprawling plains, scorching deserts, all uninhabited.
