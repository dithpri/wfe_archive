Miles of forest give way to jagged mountains as you approach the legendary sea of grass. Once through the narrow, icy passes you see nothing but a swaying expanse of green and sky from one horizon to the next. Welcome to the sea of grass, try not to lose your way.

[b]The Entrance[/b]

At the entrance of the mountain
The short leaves of needles
Softly patter down.
Trees say
Nothing but
Look carefully.
They are prepared
To eat me up
At any moment &#150; but still
From the bright place above
The short leaves of needle
Patter down.
