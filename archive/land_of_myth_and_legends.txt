As you continue on your journey, you come across a magnificent golden door marked with what appears to be an ancient language. You attempt to open the door,but it will not give,and remains sealed,but fortunately the Keeper of the Gate emerges from a nearby shadow.

&amp;quot;Beware all who enter, all that is dark and evil lie behind that door, But if you must go beyond it,you need to answer this riddle. 
[i]I am, I&amp;#39;m not. I visit young and old,
Some I make timid and some I make bold,
Unwise is the one who pokes fun at me.
Beware, for I am a shadow of thee.[/i]

Speak the riddle&amp;#39;s answer aloud and the door shall open.&amp;quot;
