Geimuvile was founded on August 13th, 2023 by Exnile, a corrupt dictatorship known for it&#39;s extensive authoritarianism, after the newly-found region was discovered while planning for potential war. 
Despite its founding nation, Geimuvile is open to pretty much any nation that Exnile gets along with - the only thing they care about, of course, is for their region to thrive through power.
