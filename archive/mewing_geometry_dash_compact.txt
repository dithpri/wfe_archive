In Astoria&#39;s grand domain,
Where waters swirl and pipes remain,
Toilets stand with porcelain pride,
In every home, they do reside.

Skibidi bop, bop, bop, bop,
Flush away, never stop!
In Astoria&#39;s humble nest,
Toilets serve us at their best!

From morning&#39;s light till evening&#39;s grace,
Toilets stand in every place,
They never falter, they never tire,
To cleanse away all filth and mire.

Skibidi bop, bop, bop, bop,
Flush away, never stop!
In Astoria&#39;s humble nest,
Toilets serve us at their best!

Oh porcelain throne, so clean and bright,
In Astoria&#39;s morn and night,
We thank you for your faithful role,
In keeping our bowels under control.

Skibidi bop, bop, bop, bop,
Flush away, never stop!
In Astoria&#39;s humble nest,
Toilets serve us at their best!
