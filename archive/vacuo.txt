Vacuo is one of the four Kingdoms of Remnant, located on the western end of the continent of Sanus, to the west of Vale.

Like the rest of the Kingdoms, Vacuo is nominally governed by a council representing its people and their interests. However, the formal government&#39;s influence is marginal. The Huntsman Academy of Vacuo, Shade, is the only true source of law and order in the Kingdom.
