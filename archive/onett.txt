We will be better than other regions.  Multi language post are strongly encouraged, but make sure others know what you are saying even if that means that you have to put in a translation. If your nation comes across an interesting issue,  feel free to share it.  The weirder,  the better. We currently have an embassy with [region]Halcyon[/region]. If you have any questions or if you want to join our region, send a telegram to our region&amp;#39;s WA Delegate[nation]New Atamascia[/nation] or to the region&amp;#39;s founder [nation]PK Thunder[/nation].

UPDATE:We are currently not accepting any new nations until the Zombie Apocalypse has ended.  Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.  Thanks for your understanding.
