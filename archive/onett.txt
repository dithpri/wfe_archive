We will join forces with other regions.  Multi language posts on the message board are strongly encouraged, but make sure others know what you are saying even if that means that you have to put in a translation. If your nation comes across an interesting issue,  feel free to share it.  The weirder,  the better. We currently have an embassy with [region]Halcyon[/region], [region]Grissom[/region], [region]Time to build stuff[/region], and [region]The Holy Land of D Spence[/region]. If you have any questions or if you want to join our region, please send a telegram to our region&amp;#39;s WA Delegate [nation]Shaka Zulu Forever[/nation] or to the region&amp;#39;s founder [nation]PK Thunder[/nation].
