[b][color=orange]This region has been infested by Fleadom Fighters!

Within this rather pathetic and disgusting region, a cess pool of life abides, the self-proclaimed diseased one.

We are crazed and angry defenders from [region]Freak Show[/region] and [region]Flea Circus[/region]. We come and vandalize this sad self-congratulatory temple to yourself.

Remember &#150; Siamese Siamese? You messed with their poor frail minds and now they come, detached with our allies and friends that despise raiders.[/color][hr]

[color=red]Don&#146;t ever mess with the Freaks or the Fleas again. We bite back.

Invaded and Flead by these beautiful nations:-

[nation]Ellie Siamese[/nation] 
[nation]Unnamedland[/nation]
[nation]New Sperland[/nation] - lost in action Rot.In.Peace.
[nation]New Publicita[/nation]
[nation]West Arualean[/nation]
