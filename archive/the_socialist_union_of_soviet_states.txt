The Socialist Union of Soviet States is a strong region comited to Communist ideals and ethics, we stay together as one, one with the working class. We also have Democratic roots due to our monthy elections. our foreign policy is friendly to all Socialist states but we must watch out for the greed of Capitaist states. we like, every other Socialist state value peace and tranquility but if we are attacked we will attack back with full Communist force and defend our ideals.

Motto: &amp;quot;For the working class!&amp;quot;
