Welcome to [region]Roleplay Free Region[/region]! We&amp;#39;re free of annoying offsite forums and silly roleplay. Just in-game features, socialising, and chats. We&amp;#39;re a small region, but we stand up for ourselves.

We control [region]The Free Region[/region] and its former raider region, [region]The Fog[/region].
