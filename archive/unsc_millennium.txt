[b]Welcome aboard the UNSC Millennium! Here, you&amp;#39;ll work, train, and study on the biggest, strongest, and most glorious ship the UNSC can afford to build.  Taking lessons from her sister ship, the UNSC Infinity, she is 5 times better. As you enter her, be mindful that the best will be expected of you at all times, and nothing less. 

Once again, we&amp;#39;re glad to have you aboard the UNSC Millennium.[/b]
