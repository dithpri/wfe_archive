[b]Welcome to the Holy Land![/b]

The world of Terra Sacra is set on present-day Earth, but takes place in an alternate timeline, where some historical events played out differently than they did in reality. Most nations that exist in the real world also exist in this parallel universe, but due to the alternate turn of events, may look nothing (socially, economically, politically) like their actual equivalents.

Thinking of moving here? While I appreciate your interest, this region is reserved for me and my puppet nations, and that&#39;s unlikely to change. But I&#39;m open to embassies though.
