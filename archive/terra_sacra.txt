[b]Welcome to the Holy Land![/b]

The world of Terra Sacra is set on present-day Earth, but takes place in an alternate timeline, where some historical events played out differently than they did in reality. Most nations that exist in the real world also exist in this parallel universe, but due to the alternate turn of events, may look nothing (socially, economically, politically) like their real-world equivalents.

All of my nations are original works of fiction, as are all names, characters and events depicted therein. The views expressed by my characters do not represent my actual views. Any similarity with real persons, living or deceased, is entirely coincidental.
