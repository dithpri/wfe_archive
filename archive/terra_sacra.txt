Welcome to the Holy Land!

The world of Terra Sacra is set on present-day Earth, but takes place in an alternate timeline, where some historical events played out differently than they did in reality. Most nations that exist in the real world also exist in this parallel universe, but due to the alternate turn of events, may look nothing (socially, economically, politically) like their actual equivalents.

RP lore will mainly revolve around four nations within this alternate world, although others may occasionally be mentioned as NPCs.
