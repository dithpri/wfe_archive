Welcome to the Socialist/Post Revolution States! After the revolution, the Lanuzan empire was divided up to form the Socialist and Anarchic States. This region consists of schizophrenic babbling between Conlis and other puppet regions, but feel free to join, as it would then no longer be schizophrenic babbling. The Union Of Socialist States welcomes all socialist or anarchic states allowing varying amounts of freedom. 

The flag represents the corruption of the old Lanuzan empire and the blood that all of the wealth (the silver) was held up on.
