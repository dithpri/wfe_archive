The Boneyard in Nationstates (not the region) doesn&#39;t do a very good job of recording the nitty-gritty things about nations, and when it comes to regions, well forget about it! Here at The Real Boneyard we strive to record pretty much everything about nations and regions that can possibly be recorded!

Right now we are working on the Great Survey of Nationstates, this will record as much as possible about nations and regions and will go on for all eternity.

This isn&#39;t a death themed region for people with questionable mental health to hang out. You could go to [region]The Boneyard[/region] or just look up the names yourself!
