Let&#146;s face it, the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=boneyard]Boneyard[/url] (the page, not the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_boneyard]Region[/url]) has some problems. If a nation is old enough it was supposedly founded in &#147;Antiquity&#148;, flags are only recorded in trading cards, and what if the nation had an amazing furniture restoration industry? As for regions, well forget about it! So here at The Real Boneyard we are committed to recording the nitty-gritty, minute details about nations and regions! Nations that move in here will be placed in the records and remembered for all eternity!!! We accept [b]all[/b] embassy requests and will send out a lot as well, as embassies are a great way to record things!
