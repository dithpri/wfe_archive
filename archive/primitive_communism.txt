[color=red]This region is one made up of communists, socialists, anarchists and other leftist groups. We also hold dearly the values of primitivism and strive to live in harmony with nature. Because of this our regional landscape is very pristine and beautiful. Please, no fascists allowed.[/color]

In solidarity, La Pasionaria :)
