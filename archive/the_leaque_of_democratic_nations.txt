The Leaque of Democratic Nations (TLoDN) is a small region comprised of sovereign nations that are dedicated to the fight for democratic values within our regional government institutions and in foreign affairs. Democracy means rule of the people or rule of the mob. We will ensure that everyone will have their voice heard via elections and other mediums. Transparency and accountability are vital pillars for the success of Democratic ideals such as: right to vote, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of information. Do not worry we do not rig elections here or suppress our citizens. We are a neutral region that attempts to use peace, order, and good governance in everything we do.  

Happy Democracy!
