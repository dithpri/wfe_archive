Welcome to The Leaque of Democratic Nations,

Our region supports all democratic traditions such as: electing regional government positions based on merit not patronage. 

Currently, We will Elect the Bureaucracy every Month on the 30 or 31st via a poll! Good Luck to You All! Regarding Immigration since we do not have a immigration minister. We all will help to write an policy for immigration in the near future.

Happy Democracy!

Have yourselves a good day.
