Welcome to The Leaque of Democratic Nations,

Our region supports all democratic traditions such as: electing regional government positions based on merit not patronage. 

Currently, our region will elect the regional government and the civil service in every Month on the 30 or 31st via a poll!

Happy Democracy!

Have yourselves a good day.
