Welcome to The Leaque of Democratic Nations,

Our region supports all democratic traditions such as: electing regional government positions based on merit not patronage, etc. Currently, we have a poll circulating within our region that will determine the election terms for every position within our regional government. This poll will close in four days please vote today. Congratulations to The Republic of The Peace Keepers, our Vice Delegate of Justice for Writing the Offenses and Consequences for our Judicial System. I believe our Region needs a immigration policy to decide how we recruit new Sovereign Nations and what will we say to them in our telegram messages and when they arrive. 

Please Think About This Future Policy Idea.
