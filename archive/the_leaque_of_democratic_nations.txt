Hello Fellow Sovereign Nations,

Welcome to The Leaque of Democratic Nations,

We are pro-peace, Anti-World Assembly, Anti-Security Council, Pro- Left Wing Style Governments, and of course Democratic Processes unlike the Traditional Regions like NationStates that Love Dictatorships and Power.  Foreign Affairs is a vital part of democracy and We would Appoint Positions based on Merit and via Elections.

In this region, Elections for senators and other positions of power will based every three months based of a poll and we will be doing things democratic for the will of the people. For all things involved in NationStates.

Happy Democracy!
