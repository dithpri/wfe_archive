The United Kingdom of Queensway is a fledgling, socially progressive region, remarkable for its burgeoning Dragon population. The compassionate, hard-working, democratic population of 5 million Queenswayans enjoy a sensible mix of personal and economic freedoms, while the political process is open and the people&#39;s right to vote held sacrosanct.

The Queenswayans economy, worth 205 billion Quonts a year, is led by the Beef-Based Agriculture industry, with major contributions from Door-to-door Insurance Sales, Tourism, and Pizza Delivery. Average income is 41,010 Quonts, and evenly distributed, with the richest citizens earning only 3.4 times as much as the poorest.
