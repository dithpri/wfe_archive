The Beijing Pact is a communist union devoted to uniting workers and spreading communism, socialism and anarcho-communism around the world. The Beijing pact was founded after the Russo-American war, which sought to unite several nations under one banner.
There are some laws to abide by 1. All flags must be a representation of communism, hammers and sickles MUST be on your flag. 2. You will be promoted if you have a long service record and you do as i say and 3. Communists ONLY, however we do make exceptions depending on your nation.
