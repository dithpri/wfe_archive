We&amp;#39;re those guys! 
We like longs walks on the beach and to drink mochas whilst singing &amp;quot;Wake me up, before you go go!&amp;quot;

Our nemesis is the &amp;quot;DJ&amp;quot;, you&amp;#39;ll know when there is a &amp;quot;DJ&amp;quot; in your premise when you hear the phrase &amp;quot;Oui Oui!&amp;quot;
He is most susceptible to the following: Deep dish pizza, Not being a fgt, Being pretty chill.

Also we will stab you 37 times in the chest if you do not join us.
