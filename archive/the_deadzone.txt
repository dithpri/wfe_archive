The Deadzone is a vast, diverse, yet unforgiving region, long stretches of desert and rainforest, however, the federation of Fre Atritania decided to set up an alliance there with any nations that happen to move in. They all live together and work for each others safety and well being, but with every bad place in the region comes a very good place, Rolling plains and mountains perfect for nations to rise up and become part of the Federation.
