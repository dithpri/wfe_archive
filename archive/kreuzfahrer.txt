We have sworn to carry on its ideals to restore hope to this troubled word.
To seek out tyranny and evil wherever they take root,
and bring the hammer of justice down upon the wicked.
Such is our duty, such is our righteous quest.
Above all else, we will never run when people are in need,
no matter how monstrous our enemies may be!
