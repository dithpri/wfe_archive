Welcome, and thank you for considering membership in the Union. A place for fledgling nations to unite and congregate, the Union of Insignificant Microstates has the aim of making sure that small countries have a voice in NationStates. Nations of all ideologies are most welcome, and nations that become large and powerful are welcome to continue to reside here. Enjoy your stay!
