The Gun Club is a single-requirement region:  Your people must be armed.  If you qualify for the banner &amp;quot;In my sights,&amp;quot; you are welcome here.  The password is: &amp;quot;armed&amp;quot;.  We don&amp;#39;t care what government you have, what economy you have, whether you&amp;#39;re an Anarchy or a Dictatorship.  If your people are armed, this is a place you can stay.

Other than that, nothing is mandatory here.  You don&amp;#39;t have to role play (but you can), you don&amp;#39;t have to debate (but you can), you don&amp;#39;t have to participate in anything (but you can.)  We here at Gun Club are an Amazing World Conspiracy of people who LEAVE YOU THE HELL ALONE.

If you&amp;#39;re up for that -- welcome home.

Currently have the WA delegate position OPEN.
