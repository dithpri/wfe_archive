   Welcome to the Voidic Straights! Isles that are serene, and sea that is darker than night!

If trouble arises, contact the founder; Inanis Stellam or other, future Administrators.

The Voidic Straights are a chain of islands with an inland sea in which Messorem Porta dwells in the center of the inland sea. The Dominion of Inanis Stellam is the chief of the nations, though many probably are larger than the nation.
