Beneath the blazing standard of the Eternal Concord, the peoples of the earth now rise as one. From the ashes of withered empires and the brittle scaffolds of global decay, the United Commonwealth Federation has emerged as a fortress of steel and spirit forged by labor, disciplined by unity, and exalted by purpose. Here, in the heartbeat of the new age, the farmer walks beside the physicist, the mother beside the general, their footsteps guided by the infallible wisdom of the Central Directive. Let the old world tremble - for the voice of the Future is not whispered in doubt, but thundered in iron resolve. This is our Destiny, clothed in crimson and crowned with the glory of eternal justice.
