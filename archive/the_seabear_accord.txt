The Seabear Accord is a union of states who share a penchant for the mythical fish-mammal, the Seabear.

The Accord is a place of innovations where terms like autarky and cleptocracy are held with the same esteem as democracy.

Of course, membership in the accord is not exclusive--or at least completely exclusive. Speak, friend, and enter.
