Forever vigilant.[hr][i]&quot;A wise man learns from the death of others. Even though you once called him friend, the Traitor has forsaken you. Show no mercy even if he begs it, for his soul is tainted and given the chance he will betray your trust; he who picks up the sword against us, shall perish by it.&quot;
