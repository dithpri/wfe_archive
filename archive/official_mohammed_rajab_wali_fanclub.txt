I was only nine years old. I loved Mohammed Rajab Wali so much, I had all the merchandise and movies. I&#39;d pray to Mohammed Rajab Wali every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I&#39;ve been given. &quot;Mohammed Rajab Wali is love&quot;, I would say, &quot;Mohammed Rajab Wali is life&quot;. My dad hears me and calls me a goofy. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Mohammed Rajab Wali. I called him a meanie. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I&#39;m crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it&#39;s really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. Mohammed Rajab Wali is love. Mohammed Rajab Wali is life.&amp;#65279;
