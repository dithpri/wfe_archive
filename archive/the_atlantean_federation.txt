The Atlantean Federation

The Atlantean Federation is a union of island and deep-sea republics descended from the lost civilization of Atlantis, destroyed in the Great Submergence. Its surviving states preserved fragments of Atlantean culture and now reunite to reclaim their shared heritage.

Built on republican ideals, sovereignty, and cooperation, the Federation welcomes diverse nations bound by myth, memory, and the sea.

A collaborative worldbuilding and political RP region where founders shape laws, history, and institutions.

The sea remembers. Atlantis endures.
