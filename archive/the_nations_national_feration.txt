Though the Nations National feration&#39;s name may sound like the result of a spelling mistake, this is actually the result of the founders of the region fighting over the pen at the constitution-writing table. The struggle caused it to go flying haphazardly across the page. This made the word &quot;Federation&quot; into something resembling &quot;feration&quot;. The leaders were too lazy to rewrite the entire constitution so instead they presented it as such - and the name stuck.
