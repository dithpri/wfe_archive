Welcome to the Asian Ocean Club.

The World Assembly has placed a number of character count sanctions upon this area, and as such, we are unable to post the entirety of our region&amp;#39;s great history. In order leave an immemorial legacy upon the world, the history of the AOC has been moved to the [nation]New Nar Shadda[/nation] factbook.

Our region had been previously overrun with zombies. However, thanks to the efforts of Matt Sasaki and Mikey and literally no one else we have managed to find a cure and save the Asian Ocean Club! The 776 million survivors are grateful to me, but let us not forget the 1.293 billion who perished in this epidemic (none of whom were from New Nar Shadda. Just sayin&amp;#39;.)
