Welcome to the Asian Ocean Club.

The World Assembly has placed a number of character count sanctions upon this area, and as such, we are unable to post the entirety of our region&amp;#39;s great history. In order leave an immemorial legacy upon the world, the history of the AOC has been moved to the [nation]New Nar Shadda[/nation] factbook.

I (Kinglord Sasaki), heavily encourage each and every one of you to create your own flag, so that everyone looks cool. Praise to the nation formerly known as Canadia as well as DrunkScarra (ft 50cent) for their efforts in flag construction. You, sirs, are (honorary) leaders of this great region.

If anyone has ideas for a new flag, I would be happy to hear them.
