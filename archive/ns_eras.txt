Achilles&#146; baneful wrath resound, O Muses, that imposed
&amp;#8232;Infinite sorrows on the Greeks, and many brave souls lost.&amp;#8232;
From breasts heroic&#151;sent them fierce, to that tenebrous cave
&amp;#8232;That no light comforts; and their limbs to dogs and vultures gave.&amp;#8232;
To all which Zeus&#146; will gave effect; from whom first strife begun
&amp;#8232;Betwixt Atreus, king of men, and Thetis&#146; godlike son.
