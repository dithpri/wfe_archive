Here, underneath this starry sky, the nation of Atlantis was founded. Here, we pledged our mutual loyalty, our honour and our lives. 
Here, we would like to live out our lives, share our mutual fate until eternity ends. 
This we promise. This we swear, by all that we hold sacred, by all that we hold dear, by all and everything which and whom we love.

So it shall be, so it has begun...
