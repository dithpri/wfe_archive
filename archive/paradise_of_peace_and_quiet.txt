We are the Federation of the Paradise of Peace and quiet. 

Here, underneath this starry sky, our paradise of peace and quiet was founded. 
Here, we have pledged our mutual loyalty, our honour and our lives. 
Here, we would like to live out our lives, share our mutual fate until eternity ends. 
This we promise. This we swear, by all that we hold sacred, by all that we hold dear, by all and everything which and whom we love.

So it shall be, so it has begun...
