[b][u]Yeman: Two Nations Divided[/u][/b]

Yeman is split between two rival states claiming legitimacy over the Yemani homeland.

[b][nation]North Yeman[/nation][/b] is a moralistic democratic republic centered in Sanela. It emphasizes religious values, civic order, and national unity, presenting itself as the rightful continuation of the Yemani state.

[b][nation]South Yeman[/nation][/b], based in Adan, is an authoritarian republic controlling the southern coast. Though democratic in name, it is widely regarded as corrupt and elite-dominated, prioritizing stability and trade over reform.

Both states share culture and history, but remain divided by ideology, governance, and unresolved claims.
