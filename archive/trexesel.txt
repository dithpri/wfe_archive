Story of the Day: 
[b] Today is September 11, 2017[/b]. 
16 years ago, one of the worst terror attacks in world history; as 2 747s hit the twin towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York. We will always remember this day. But not as a day of horror, or violence, or mourning. We will remember this as the day America grew stronger. After reading this, please take a moment of silence to honor those who fell. Thank you.
