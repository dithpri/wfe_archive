The Imperium is the largest and currently most powerful political entity in the galaxy, consisting of at least 1,000,000 human-settled worlds dispersed across most of the Milky Way Galaxy. Consequently, an Imperial planet might be separated from its closest neighbor by hundreds or even thousands of light years.
Although the Imperium of Man may be considered evil, they were mostly forced to perform evil deeds in order to protect Humanity from various threats throughout the grimdark and unforgiving galaxy, especially in their perpetual war with the Forces of Chaos and various alien races.
