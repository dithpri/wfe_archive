Our great leader has found the perfect region placed curiously near Canada and the Caribbean. Don&amp;#39;t ask how she found it, we don&amp;#39;t even know. But it&amp;#39;s lush and warm year round, always rains on Wednesdays, (again don&amp;#39;t ask) and has scientifically altered the bugs to have no stingers. None of them. Or pinchers. It&amp;#39;s quite nice.
