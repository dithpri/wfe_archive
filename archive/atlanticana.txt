[b]Atlanticana is no longer operational. The region now serves as a museum for its successor region, the Crowned Republic of [region]Lysaria[/region][/b]

The museum stands as a commemoration of Atlanticana as a region and of everything it represented and stood for. Its achievements, its strengths, its weaknesses, and its mistakes.
