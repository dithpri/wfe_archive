[b]Welcome to the World of Paiative[/b]
From October 15th to October 31st, the region will be in a crisis. Unfortunately, this means we will not be adding any new members. If you were interested in joining, we invite you to join us when we return to our normal rp on November 1st.
[b]The Crisis[/b]
Information has leaked from the Combine detailing some sort of bacteria with devastating effects on Humans. At this point in time, it is not known how this bacteria spreads, how many people are infected, or where it originated from.. Leaks also state that within a week or two, the infected reach a point of having no mental awareness, only leaving behind an aggressive zombie-like husk.
