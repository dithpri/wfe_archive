Novus Regio, is a new region founded by an ancient and lost civilisation of Gladiston, although Gladiston was lost it is home to quite a bit of the worlds population, In the beginning Gladiston was the leader of a mighty and high empire Anastasia, but, everything was lost as it was once before, and the 2nd Region began. Anastasia II ruled over Gladiston and smaller empires and islands surrounding the nations, but there was a rebelion when the former leader became corrupt and paired with the nations of Terrible and Die Day two utterly disgusting empires. But when all rebellion came to an end, a new parliament was formed in the rubble of Alta, The Regional Returnment Party.
