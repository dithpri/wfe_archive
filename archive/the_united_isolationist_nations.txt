Ul&#39;aram Beh&#39;rahm, dear Nations! Welcome to the United Isolationist Nations! 

An isolationist nation, is a nation wich decides to shut down from social media entirely, and has only got it&#39;s own Social Media. 
Isolationist Nations also think that every single inhabitant of their Nation has to benefit to it. For example, in prisons, the inmates spend their time harvesting and buiding stuff that will be sold to pepole all around the world. And once you get 14 years old, it&#39;s your duty to keep the nation clean. During school sessions, the students go out to clean the streets of the city. That&#39;s the reason why isolationist countries are very clean.
