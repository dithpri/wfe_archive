&amp;quot;Umm... huh?&amp;quot; inquires village idiot, Jennifer Utopia. &amp;quot;I voted? When? Oh, yeah. Please don&amp;#39;t make me not vote. The ballots are really tasty, and where else would I get my fibre? Everyone should have the right to vote, no matter what their favourite greenhouse is! Then we can all get the government to do what we want! First thing I think we should do is, uh, ban fruit? I hate fruit.&amp;quot;
