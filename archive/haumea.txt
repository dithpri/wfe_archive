[b]On September 17, 2008, it was named after Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth.

Haumea&#39;s mass is about one-third that of Pluto, and 1/1400 that of Earth. Although its shape has not been directly observed, calculations from its light curve are consistent with it being a Jacobi ellipsoid. Haumea&#39;s elongated shape together with its rapid rotation, rings, and high albedo (from a surface of crystalline water ice), are thought to be the consequences of a giant collision. Under the icy crust are situated a underground lattices able to facilitate the landing of large spacecraft. Ferrying craft will be provided free of charge for any nations wishing for territory in the outer solar system.[/b]
