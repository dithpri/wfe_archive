This is a large crater upon the moon, in this crater, there is no grass, or gravity, or oxygen, so bring your Spacesuits. We have oxygen recyclers inside all the buildings, so don&amp;#39;t worry about asphyxiating, we have invented a new form of crop that grows without oxygen or water, we have named it &amp;quot;The Burger-Plant&amp;quot;, and it tastes like meat. We can also create water with ancient voodoo magic we learned when we were but a mere tribe of technologically Incompetent Nincompoops.
