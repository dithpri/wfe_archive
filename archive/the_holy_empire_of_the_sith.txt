Welcome practitioners of the Dark side or simple Imperial Citizens, you all have had the pleasure of either being allowed to join this glorious Empire or were luck enough to have been born into it. Neither matter not, for you all have sworn servitude to the Empire and keeping it safe. For if it falls, as does the last bastion of the darkside.
