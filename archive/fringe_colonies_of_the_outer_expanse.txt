The Fringe Colonies are a collective of settlements who have chosen to isolate themselves from the petty affairs of other nations hoping to rope us into matters that do not concern us. By settling in the Outer Expanse, we can make a new life free of outsider ideals and threats that would consider us simply as collateral damage. 

We only ask for the members of this region to adhere to a simple duty: Preserve the integrity of this conglomerate, and aim to ensure that we succeed together when possible. Beyond that, government leaders of their respective colonies are free to do as they wish with their people and be as selective as they like with whom they ally with.
