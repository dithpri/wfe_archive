Back in the days of old, [region]King Nation[/region] was a pathetic excuse of a region, they claimed that they raided many regions, but we highly doubt it.

We remade this to send a message, annoying little spammers and illiterate kids are not welcome here.

So, join the cleanup crew of NationStates, [region]True Land[/region], and help us clean more messes like this.
