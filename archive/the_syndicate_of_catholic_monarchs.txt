This is a region for only Catholic Monarchies. The Syndicate&#39;s head of state and government is the founder. The power of legislation is invested in the Holy Congress. The upper house is the House of Primates and the lower house is the House of Bishops. The power of judiciary is invested in the Supreme Holy Court headed by the Chief Judge. All positions are up for election after a term of a month except for the judges of the Supreme Holy Court. The judges of the Court serve life terms unless they are voted out by the founder and 2/3 of the Congress. The Syndicate despite being Catholic is not patriarchal.
