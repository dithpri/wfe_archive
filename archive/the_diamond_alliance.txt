[color=blue][I]Although we are just a fledgling region, we have big plans in mind for the nations that reside here. Our main focus is building each and every member up so that we can rise to the tops of the ranks as individuals and as a region. We host fair, democratic elections often for the spots in our government and councils. We also strive to create a safe-haven for big, small, new, and old nations alike. We take NationStates relatively seriously, with organized political processes and strategic thinking. Join us so that we can aid you, too.[/I][/color]
