[color=003366]The Pitcairn Islands, officially named the [b]Pitcairn Group of Islands[/b], are a group of volcanic islands in the southern Pacific Ocean. The four islands &#150; Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno &#150; are spread over several hundred miles of ocean and have a total land area of about 18 square miles. 

The islands are inhabited by the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the Polynesians who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This history is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders. With only about 56 inhabitants, originating from four main families, Pitcairn is the least populous national jurisdiction in the world.[/color] [color=666666]&#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
