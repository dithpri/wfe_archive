In mid-January of 2016, several members, who were also leaders as well, of Chesterfield were expelled from power and banned because they wanted to make the region more democratic and see checks and balances. So they formed New Chesterfield in hopes of having a region wherein the founder&#39;s executive power is checked by his fellow leaders and the World Assembly Delegate. After time, members of the former Chesterfield left, seeing the corruption of Chesterfield and fled to sanctuary available to them in New Chesterfield. These events made the citizens of New Chesterfield wary of powerful nations and made them look up to more democratic regions.
