In mid-January of 2016, several members, of the Chesterfield region were banned, simply for attempting to make the region more democratic. They chose to form New Chesterfield, a region built around the rights they were denied. As the tyranny of Old Chesterfield came further and further to light, many of its members left, fleeing to the sanctuary available to them in New Chesterfield. Now, the developing region, currently in the midst of creating a constitution, seeks to create a region whose inhabitants will proudly say they are a part of.
