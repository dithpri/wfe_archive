Welcome to USAC. We&#39;ve been inactive for a long time, and we don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll come back.
We&#39;re locking the region since there have been so many attempts by nazis and imperialists to take our region over.
If you are a true inhabitant of USAC, you&#39;re welcome to stay.

Thanks,
Josh Conure
