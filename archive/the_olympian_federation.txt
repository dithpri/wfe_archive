From the beautiful isles of Olympia to the deserts of Hadia, all that live under the rule of Olympus shall be welcome. The gods have blessed us with lovely forests and shimmering deserts. They gave us seas and rivers and shining lakes, bountiful with fish. Within the land we walk there is fertile soil, minerals and precious metals. Though the world has forgoten our beautiful land, they will no more. The gods will lead us all to prosperity, victory in war, and greatness. So flock to the banner of The Olympian Federation.
