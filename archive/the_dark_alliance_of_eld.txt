Eld is a vast land, compromising of three nations close together, forming a ring, with the vast and wide Dark Sea in the middle, with only the Neutral Lands forming borders between each nation.

The nations of Kaz Kazan, Kattarn, and Dagalur hold equal sovereignty over the continent of Eld, sharing political savvy, economic strategies, and military powers to stand against the growing threat of other nations.
