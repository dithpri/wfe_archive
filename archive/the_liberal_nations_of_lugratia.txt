[b]Welcome to the[/b] [b][color=#0000FF]Liberal Nations of Lugratia![/color][/b] Here in Lugratia, only the fairest policies are passed and only the nations that truly love their people will be given any speck of power! Trust me, we wouldn&#39;t let any country with a leader as crazy as Donald Trump in this region either. America, [u][i][color=#FF0000]get your act together. [/color][/i][/u] Oh yeah, and just because we&#39;re [color=#0000FF]Liberal Nations,[/color] doesn&#39;t mean we all vote Democrat. I mean, Stacramon does personally, but not all of us have to. That&#39;s what keeps it interesting! Kind of like Congress.
