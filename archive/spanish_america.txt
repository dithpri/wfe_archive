[b][color=gold]Spanish America[/color][color=bronze] is the region comprising the American countries inhabited by Spanish-speaking populations. These countries have significant commonalities with each other and with Spain, whose colonies they formerly were. In all of these countries, Spanish is the main language, sometimes sharing official status with one or more indigenous languages (such as Guaran&iacute;, Quechua, Aymara, or Mayan), or English (in Puerto Rico). Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion, as well.
