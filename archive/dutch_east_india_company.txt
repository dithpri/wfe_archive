Hello and welcome to the region of the Dutch East India Company (VOC)!

We are a tight-knit group of nations that disagree on trivial issues like tags and flags and like all good democracies, we&#146;ve over complicated elections, staging our own instead of simply allowing nations to endorse who they please. We don&#146;t have a strict constitution, it&#146;s more of a constantly changing loose array of practices. At least life here is never boring!

We don&#146;t care what sort of nation you are &#150; from Anarchy to Psychotic Dictatorship &#150; we&#146;d love to have you join the patchwork of diverse nations already here. Although originally founded on pacifism and secularism, we have developed a wide range of nations, with an strong religious community currently in power.
