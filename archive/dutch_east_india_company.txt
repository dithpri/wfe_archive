The Dutch East India Company (Old Dutch: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie), or VOC, started in 1602, when the Netherlands gave a group of small trading companies a 21-year monopoly to trade in Asia. It was the first multinational corporation in the world and the first company to issue stock. The VOC had the power to start wars, make treaties, make its own money and start new colonies.

It was an important company for almost 200 years, but it became bankrupt in 1800. The VOC&#39;s colonies became the Dutch East Indies, which later became Indonesia.
