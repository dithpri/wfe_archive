[color=navy]Salutations from the [b][region]Dutch East India Company[/region][/b]![/color]

[hr]

This region consists of a coalition of (mostly) pacifist states with an overwhelming social conscience and strong desire for security, aestheticism and an enriching, cultured environment within all of its participating members. 

The [b][region]Dutch East India Company[/region][/b] gladly welcomes and endorses such nations which demonstrate and pursue those socialist values aligned with the region&amp;#39;s aims and purposes. 

There is no current endorsement cap, and basically no other rules, other than don&amp;#39;t be a dickhead. Should you have any questions or comments, please feel free to use the Regional Message Board.

The [b][region]Dutch East India Company[/region][/b] welcomes you within its borders.
