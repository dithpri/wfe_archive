[color=navy]Salutations from the [b][region]Dutch East India Company[/region][/b]![/color]

[hr]

This region consists of a coalition of (mostly) pacifist states with an overwhelming social conscience and strong desire for security, aestheticism and an enriching, cultured environment within all of its participating members. 

There is no current endorsement cap, and basically no other rules, other than [b]don&amp;#39;t be a dickhead[/b]. Should you have any questions or comments, please feel free to use the Regional Message Board.

The [region]Dutch East India Company[/region] welcomes you within its peaceful borders.
