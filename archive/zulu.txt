[i]The native Parthinos - who inhabited the island of Zulu when it was discovered
by Sir Thomas Scott in 1887 - were virtually annihilated by Antarctic settlers
within 17 years. In the early 20th century, the Germans established a presence
on Zulu, and in 1903, Antarctica ceded to the Germans the eastern half of the
island, which later became Zulu. The German colony, based on fishing and
production-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the Atlantic.[/i]
