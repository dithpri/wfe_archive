[i]Faming For Bank Because I Don&#39;t Get Any Good Cards[/i]

Why I&#39;m farming for Bank? I&#39;m new to card collecting and previously only collected my own nation [nation]Christ of The Abyss[/nation]&#39;s card since I like it. So I know nothing about card collecting but I need more bank to buy some good cards to maybe start a collection. 

Call it Newbie&#39;s Luck. My 2nd time farming my CotA nations I made some bank by finding Kyrusia&#39;s card. :)

CotA is a Clan Tag and it means [b]C[/b]hrist [b]o[/b]f [b]t[/b]he [b]A[/b]byss. However, a nation with the CotA tag that&#39;s not listed in the [b]Disciples of Christ of The Abyss Dispatch[/b] and doesn&#39;t reside in this Region doesn&#39;t belong to me and is an impostor.
