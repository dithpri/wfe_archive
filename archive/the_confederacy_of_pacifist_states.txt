The region known as [b]The Confederacy of Pacifist States[/b], with the full name being [i]The Non-Aligned Confederacy of Self-Sufficient &amp;amp; Pacifist States, Islands and otherwise Independent Territories[/i], was founded on the 28th of December 2012, app. 14:00 CET. 

The reason this region was founded was the existence of the concept of [u]Invasion[/u]. It was due to the founding nation of [nation=short]Hvittland[/nation] being appalled by the notion of other nations deliberately destroying another region&amp;#39;s society for their own amusement that this region came to be. The name is also derived from the same ideal, that one should not destroy what others have built for the sole purpose of one&amp;#39;s own short-term gain, amusement or the likes.
