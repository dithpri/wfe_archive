Have YOU been kicked out of no one specific region whatsoever?  Did YOU get banned off of forums for not towing the party line?  Do YOU want to make unfounded allegations that nobody will (or should) believe about no specific region whatsoever?  If so The Land of King Kongs and Emperor Penguins is probably for you.

We welcome everybody, especially people that have been exiled from no specific region whatsoever.

The only rule is the Bill &amp; Ted rule.  Be excellent to everybody.
