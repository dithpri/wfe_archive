This region was cooperatively managed by [region]Libertatem[/region] and the [region]Anti Authoritarian Alliance[/region].

[region]Libertatem[/region] are a region of extremist capitalists who have a history of collaborating with fascists. Right-Libertarianism is an ideology of the tyranny of capital, the totalitarianism of the market, and the unrestrained exploitation and oppression of the working class.

[region]Anti Authoritarian Alliance[/region], nominally anarchist/anti-authoritarian, are class traitors, collaborating with capitalists within their region, and being observers of the [region]REATO[/region] alliance, discarding all principles and betraying over a century of anarchist tradition to work along side anti-communist propertarians.
