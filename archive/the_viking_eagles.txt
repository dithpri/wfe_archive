The Viking Eagles are a new refounded invader region on Nationstates.

Contrary to popular belief, TVE is a very active invader org; we have a sizable 5 members! We have raided all kinds of nations-or was it regions? Can&#39;t remember. Anyway, we have a cool flag and that&#39;s about it! So join up with the most feared invader thingy in Nationstates!!!
