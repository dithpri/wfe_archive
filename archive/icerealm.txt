Welcome! Icerealm is a region that&amp;#39;s capital is the Sommerset Isles, and it&amp;#39;s only entrance is hidden deep within a polar ice cap somewhere in the remote South Pole. Its is an entirely seperate subworld beneath Earth&amp;#39;s crust. It is mostly ocean like the surface, with the only continents being the Sommerset Isles and its fellow nations. the singular entrance is a heavily fortified gate, strong enough to survive full nuclear fallout. To prevent any &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; nations from entering, the gate has a passcode, which can be requested from the Sommerset Isles and its partners. Upon request we will judge based on economy and general character who is allowed to join.
