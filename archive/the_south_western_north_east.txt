Formed through an alliance between The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Karakis and The Most Serene Republic of Opedium, and also allying other nations, this region is strong, with powerful economies, and few governmental laws. We pride ourselves on freedom, and refuse to interfere with the governments of our region&amp;#39;s nations.
