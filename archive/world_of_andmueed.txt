Roleplay in a post apocaliptic world where Andmueed is the hegemonic power in its continent. There are still some rogue nations at the borders of the map and it will remain like that. Inspired in 1984.


Most NS stats are canon for Andmueed but population clearly isnt. I will explain personally which arent.

This group can be open to nice &quot;what if&quot; scenarios if somehow our worlds met each other.
Tech is based in a Post Apocaliptic era caused in the 2000s.
Andmueed is islationist, anexation is not a choice, we must repopulate, Andmueed will conquer the rest of the world in his image, its the only way.
