Republicans united against Democrats. We will work stronger than ever before to defeat the oppressive regime of the Democrat&#39;s agenda of higher taxes, more regulations, and stuff. 

We as Republicans believe that it is our duty to educate the public of the dangers of the liberal agenda which can weaken our economy. We believe that businesses should be left alone since business owners are the ones who know how to make decisions. While sometimes this may be unfair to consumers and employeees, business owners know how to do things.
