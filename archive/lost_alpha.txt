[b]Lost Alpha[/b] (Ukrainian: &amp;#1047;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1073;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1072; A&amp;#1083;&amp;#1100;&amp;#1092;&amp;#1072;, [i]Zahublena Al&amp;#697; fa[/i]) is the colloquial name for the Greater Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Zone of Alienation, an area comprising most of the Kiev, Chernihiv and Zhytomyr Oblasts of Ukraine, along with parts of Belarus and Russia adjacent to it. It was established in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster, and expanded after the second Chernobyl disaster of 1994. Political and economic instability led to the area becoming an anarchy, and eventually regaining order after Ukrainian rebel groups began establishing independent nations within the area.
