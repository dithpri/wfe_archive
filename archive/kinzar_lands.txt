[b][color=#000061]Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! This region proved no match for a charge by [region=The Black Riders]!
They were so mighty after all, in taking the time to invade my region that only has my one nation.[/color]


[color=#000061]Into a battle rode the following five riders, because any less then that would have been too weak to take my lone nation down, apparently.:[/color]
[nation=short]Wetwork XIII[/nation]
[nation=short]Gladio III[/nation]
[nation=short]Hollowed Forest[/nation]
[nation=short]Coraxion[/nation][/b]


Long Live Kinzar!
