Welcome to the League of Lojeb!

Lojebia&amp;#39;s the founder here. Don&amp;#39;t forget he has about as much power as a monarch in a democracy. He&amp;#39;s got a knack for writing (so he thinks), so give [url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-ever-elusive-icebrain-and-friends/the-hunter/217873178361159]The Hunter[/url] or [url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-ever-elusive-icebrain-and-friends/session-1/207942632687547]Abvulgus Insula[/url] a try. 

Umbramoor is the REAL leader around here, and Lojebia has left us, therefore we are without a founder and only possess the regional delegate, Umbramoor.
[hr] [color=chocolate]Hey. You seated comfortably? Got your bag of pork rinds and/or sandwich? Great! I need you to sing along; this is a sing along, this next song. Even if you&amp;#39;re in your underwear, sing loud and proud. Now, uh... if you don&amp;#39;t know the lyrics, just follow the bouncing pug head. It&amp;#39;ll [i]show you the way![/i][/color]
