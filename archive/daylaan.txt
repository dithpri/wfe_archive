Daylaan&#39;s international government is made up of Libertarians who firmly believe in minimum government interference in everyday lives. Everyone has the right to do whatever he/she wants as long as it doesn&#39;t negatively impact someone else directly. Everyone has the right to free speech, the right to petition and the right to run their homes and businesses in any way they please. The government&#39;s goal is to let the people regulate themselves, while the government primary deals with military, foreign affairs and homeland security.
