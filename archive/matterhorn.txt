The Matterhorn is a mountain in the Pennine Alps on the border between Switzerland and Italy. Its summit is 14,692 ft high, making it one of the highest peaks in the Alps. The four steep faces, rising above the surrounding glaciers, face the four compass points.

The Matterhorn was one of the last great Alpine peaks to be climbed and its first ascent marked the end of the golden age of alpinism. It is estimated that over 500 alpinists have died on the Matterhorn since the first climb in 1865, making it one of the deadliest peaks in the Alps. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
