Welcome to the planet Mars. This region is made up of roleplayers who have a colony or their main nation on the planet. While violence is frequent it is often caused by outside sources - paradoxically the people of Mars tend to be peaceful (if very well armed). The planet is being terraformed; ask for details on the forums.
