[b]The Lizard[/b] is a peninsula in southern Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The most southerly point of the British mainland is near Lizard Point at grid reference SW 701,115. 

The Lizard has been the site of many maritime disasters. It forms a natural obstacle to entry and exit of Falmouth and its naturally deep estuary. 

Smuggling was a regular, and often necessary, way of life in these parts, despite the efforts of coastguards or &quot;Preventive men&quot;. --Wikipedia[hr]
