The utopian society of nations is an alliance where you can share issues and others will help you with them, some of these are influence, military, and economy.

It is like the European Union in many ways and is a way to change and stay connected with your game in nationstates.
P.S. this alliance is purely democratic and you can&#39;t join if you aren&#39;t democratic

I hope you join us, it will be beneficial to both you and me, and it is a lot of fun.
thank you for reading this and I look forward to seeing you in utopia.
