The &quot;Antlantic Territories&quot; refers to a collection of manmade archipels created in international waters. Often frequented by smugglers and used as neutral ground for negotiations by many criminal organisations, as well as spies from all around the world the Atlantic Territories are receiving harsh criticism from the international community and thus are having a hard time sustaining their independence, while also keeping their neutrality. Nontheless the &quot;Atlantic Territories&quot; also serve as a beacon of hope for those who feel their political view not rightly represented in their home country and are wishing to create a society of their liking, as it is possible for almost everyone to create their own independent state here.
