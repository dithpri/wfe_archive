The ISAF was created from the Cascade Treaty Organization (CTO). Tensions between the plutocratic-monarchist Principality of Maante and the CTO, which was unofficially led by the nation of Cadav, spiked following Maante&#39;s takeover of the Comonas Islands in early August 2003. The threat of an armed incursion coupled with Maante&#39;s refusal to withdraw from the Comonas eventually forced Cadav, the nominally-pacifistic Constitutional Queendom of [nation]Avezran[/nation] and the Republic of [nation]Ourisio[/nation] to form ISAF.

The coalition consisted of 11 founding states and five additional signatories, bringing the total number of members to 16 founding members.
