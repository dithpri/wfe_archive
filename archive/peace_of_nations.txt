By joining you agree to be peaceful in game. You can terrorize your country&amp;#39;s citizens but not another real-life person! 

Peace of Nations is a relaxed region, and nothing at all is absolutely required, although some things would help our region.


Also, I recommend you join the World Assembly. By joining, there is a great addition to the game and it helps our region gain more power on the international stage.

Have fun!
