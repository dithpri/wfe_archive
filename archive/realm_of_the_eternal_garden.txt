Throughout history an unspeakable paradise has been mentioned in nearly every religion and creation story. Eden, Atlantis, the Pureland, Jannah, Tir na nOg, the place from which we came and the place to which we desire return to as humanity. The gates are open, enter all you who seek the bliss, the Tao. Taste the undying truth. Cultivate the legendary into reality. 
In this land all nations will retain autonomy and sovereignity. We meet as equals, we bow to one another. We are bound only by our sense of duty to each other and to the world at large.
 Let us spread this garden to the four corners of the world and let none judged iniquitous by our court be spared from the tendrils of our vines!
Rise the banner of divinity
