How war will work is. You will use the government percent of defense for you war...  Say you have 15% someone has 5 you win 10% the larger the percent of win e more land you win, the land you win will be decided by Bryce or Megan if Bryce is gone for the war.

If you defend by a small percent or large percent nothing happens you don&amp;#39;t gain or lose land, that&amp;#39;s how it works, if you have questions ask Bryce
