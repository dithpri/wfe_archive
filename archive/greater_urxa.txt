Collection of nations belonging to the Greater Urxa: Urxa itself and the many islands off its coasts, the biggest of which being [i]Rajnlokem[/i].

The region is a protectorate under the rule of our benevolent [b]Matriarch[/b], who grants considerable freedom to Her nations in terms of internal politics. In exchange for unquestioned allegiance to Her authority, our beloved [b]Matriarch[/b] allows local leaders to rule over their territory as they please.

Though our most respected [b]Matriarch[/b] is the undisputed leader of this territory, She is open to negotiations should a contentious issue emerge.
