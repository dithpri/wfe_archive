A vast continent divided into two Empires, united as great allies. The Northern Empire of Suurta-Osavaltio guards the icy forests of the north whilst the Holy Empire of Armanischa guards the beautiful desert sands and the great mountains of the south. Several small republics do exist on the continent, but they have all bowed to the Northern Emperor and the Holy Patriarch.
