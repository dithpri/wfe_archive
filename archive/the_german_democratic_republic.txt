[color=Red]Deutsche Demokratische Republik[/color]

[color=Red]the German Democratic Republic was a state in the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany which was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War II&#151;the Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the Oder&#150;Neisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR.[/color].
