The Cold War (1950&#150;1991) was a period of intense geopolitical rivalry between the United States and its allies, championing democracy and capitalism, and the Soviet Union and its allies, promoting communism. Emerging sharply after 1950 with the Korean War, it featured ideological clashes, proxy wars, nuclear arms races, and espionage rather than direct military conflict. Key moments included the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Space Race, as both superpowers vied for global influence. The Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, solidifying the United States&#39; position as the dominant global power. What is beyond this alternate history?
