Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Number Five

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let&#39;s ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice
But I really don&#39;t wanna

Beer bust like I had last week
I must stay deep because talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they getting sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me is flirting it&#39;s just like sport, anything fly
It&#39;s all good, let me dump it, please set in the trumpet
