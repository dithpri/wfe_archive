Basically the Noble Council will be optional join able thing in the region in which you can,vote in the RMB on what you think the Delegate should vote on in a WA proposal.There will be more Council features in the future perhaps ,but until
the Region gets more members it won&amp;#39;t be established for a bit.
[b]All WA members MUST endorse Muondolia[/b]
