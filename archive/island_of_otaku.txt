There are many amazing natural features such as Senpai Mountain and the Infinite Caves, which is a large cave system that honeycombs the island.  There are large fields of grass and flowers in the center of the island as well as many forests to the North.  To the South lies a dessert where sandstorms are common.  The island itself could be considered a small continent compared to other islands in the area.
