[color=red]Every[/color] nation, of [color=red]any[/color] kind is welcome here in [region]Founderless[/region]. Our main ideology is that executive Founders are a [color=red][u][url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_united_nations_of_the_future]terrible idea[/url][/u][/color]. We have escaped to this place to seek refuge from [region]The United Nations of the Future[/region], whose Founder, [nation]Isla Athuana[/nation], continually [color=red]overreacts[/color] to jokes (or anything), [color=red]bans[/color] nations for [color=red]no[/color] reason; [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=12334177]&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve banned oren because I f*cking can.&amp;quot;[/url], and uses scapegoats to [color=red]hide from mistakes[/color] (he gets people to do things for him);  [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=12368742]&amp;quot;Jools can deal with that.&amp;quot;[/url][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=12389436]&amp;quot;That was jools. Sorry, I&amp;#39;ll unban them&amp;quot;[/url]
