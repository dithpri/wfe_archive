A regional government will be put in place and a Constitution drafted, I&amp;#39;m working on that currently. The government shall be a triumvirate consisting of me and two elected officials, one the WA Delegate, and the other the Commander and Chief of our Armed Forces, which all regions are required to have some part in unless exempted. The WA Delegate will be given Admin as soon as a security force is well established. A forum will soon be up and running
