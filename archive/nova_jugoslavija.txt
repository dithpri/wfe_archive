[b] Basic info: [/b]
This region is dedicated to players from (living or origin) ex-Yugoslavia, Southern Slavs. Knowing Serbo-Croatian language is preferable but not necessary, as formal languages are both Serbo-Croatian and English. As for the regional symbols, flag is presented, and here is the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQzqV-6-4do]regional anthem.[/url]
