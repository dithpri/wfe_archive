[b]The Furthest Ring[/b] is an infinite space that exists outside of all universes. It physically borders the outside of every [b][url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_incipisphere]Incipisphere[/url][/b], containing the orbit of [b][region]Derse[/region][/b] and separated from [b]The Medium[/b] by [b][region]The Veil[/region][/b].

Temporal and spatial factors are far less than constant in the Furthest Ring, due to it existing beyond any universe and therefore never having the spacetime principles solidified; the deeper into the Ring one would get from their session, the less stable time is, and as one spends more and more time in its dark reaches, space becomes less reliable as well.

The Furthest Ring is home to terrifying creatures known as eldritch monstrosities, led by [b]The Noble Circle of Horrorterrors[/b].
