[b]The Nexus Core[/b]

The Nexus Core is the heart of the Celestial Nexus, a region of space where the very fabric of reality is shaped by the immense energy radiating from within. This core is the epicenter of gravimetric distortions, space-time anomalies, and unpredictable energy surges, all of which intensify the closer one gets to the Nexus. The core&#39;s radiant power pulses through the surrounding space, drawing factions from across the galaxy seeking to harness its limitless potential.

Only the most skilled navigators and tacticians can hope to survive in this volatile environment.
