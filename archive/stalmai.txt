Stalmai is a small continent in the Atlantic, characterized by its extensive waterways but close relationships among its member nations, as well its extensive cultural fusion and positive coexistence due to massive migration.

The Stalmain Council has created broad political law based on the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Confucius, Jefferson, and, later Gandhi, and tries to avoid semblance to the UN and EU.

The geography of Stalmai is rich; the sheer amount of rivers has supported many industries that involve marine resources. Forests, mountains, and valleys also characterize that landscape, allowing further development in agriculture, solar energy, medicine, and the arts.
