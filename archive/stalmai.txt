Stalmai is a peaceful continent, with historic ties to major ethnic groups that have become refugees of war, famine, and threat. The Stalmain River cuts through the land, known for its hills, mountains, forests, and rich geology. The natural world is a major part of most cultures that have settled and formed in Stalmai, and this connection has fostered peace and policy against movements that may lead to a third Great War.
