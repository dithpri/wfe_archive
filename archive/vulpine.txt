Welcome to [color=orange]VUL[/color][color=grey]PINE[/color], the coalition that raided [region]Europe[/region] on February 10th, 2024.

The coalition was led by [nation]Wascoitan[/nation], and included [region]Kantrias[/region], [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], [region]Astoria[/region], [region]Sparkalia[/region], and [region]Lair of the Dragon[/region]

During the time that they controlled Europe, they managed to eject 927 nations, bringing Europes population down from around 1600 to around 700

Perhaps someday VULPINE shall return, but for now this region shall stand as a monument to the great achievements of these raiders
