[b][color=darkred]Today the sekhmet legion decided to take a little trip down to london. This london however was a tad strange, one might even say that it was fallen in some way. Weirdly enough however, despite its strangeness, the sekhmet legion ended up finding this place a more enjoyable place to spend time in than the realms they had previously visited on their adventures, so naturally, they conquered it in the name of the pharaoh and established a small colony of osiris in the south of england.[/color][/b]
