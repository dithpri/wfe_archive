We are a safe and friendly region. This region is mostly democratic and we also believe that all NationStates nations should be treated like they&amp;#39;re REAL nations. Instead of just dismissing issues and always focusing on trying to make the worst nation possible, we think that we should try to make the most democratic, safe, friendly and economically powerful nation.
