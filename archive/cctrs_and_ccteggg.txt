CCTRS stands for Countries Coming Together for Regional Safety. CCTRS&amp;#39;s other name is also known as CCTEGGG which stands fro Countries Coming Together for Economic Growth, and Governmental Growth. We are here to influence and help certain countries picked out by the Council to help them grow pertaining to their economy and government. CCTRS is the part where the Council helps with countries that have national safety problems such as trafficking, and murder. CCTRS is only for people problems, and CCTEGGG is only for government and economy. Hope anyone that is called into the organization gets help and enjoys it here.

~President of CCTRS and CCTEGGG
