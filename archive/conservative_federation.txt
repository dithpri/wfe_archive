&#149; Government should serve the people&#151;not the other way around.
&#149; &#147;That government is best which governs least.&#148; In business, this means letting the free market (the most efficient economic system ever devised) generate wealth without a heavy hand trying to direct it.
&#149; The legitimate functions of our national government are to provide security through a strong defense and to protect freedom for the individual, so that people can pursue their own goals.
&#149; Private property means that what belongs to you is yours; if the government confiscates your property, that&#146;s tyranny. Our most productive citizens&#151;the top 10% of earners&#151;already pay 68% of the tax revenues collected. These rates should be cut, not raised.
