[region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to show some young uns around the sky to find the best cookie spots around town! 

Having heard the tales of your excellent treats, we couldn&#39;t help but pay a visit to your region. It was as great as rumoured, and we enjoyed the food from your region!

Unfortunately, we suddenly realised that we forgot to bring our cash, so we left this WFE in exchange for your tasty treats. We hope you like it!

If you would like to join us on our next food exploration, [url=https://discord.gg/YudSM5B8]come join us![/url]
