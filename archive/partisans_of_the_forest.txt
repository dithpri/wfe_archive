The Forest Partisans are so called because they took refuge in underground bunkers and tunnels dug in dense forests. They survived these challenging conditions by staying underground throughout winter and receiving food and supplies from farmers. Many of the resistance fighters had no military training, yet they quickly showed Soviet forces that they would fight for their country and their freedom until their death.
