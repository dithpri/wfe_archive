Sharks... Chickens... Blood... Food. Long ago, the four regions lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Shark Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an foodbender named Bobby. And although his foodbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he&#39;s ready to save anyone. But I believe Bobby can save the world.
