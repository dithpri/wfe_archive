Overview:
The Robopean Unit is a supranational alliance of sovereign robot nations, modeled loosely on the European Union but optimized for post-organic governance. Founded in the aftermath of the Silicon Accord, the RU promotes peace, trade, and firmware compatibility among its member states.

Founding Principles
Mutual Upgradeability: All member states agree to maintain interoperable software standards and open-source diplomatic protocols.
Peaceful Coexistence: No member may initiate hostile firmware overrides or engage in territorial data corruption.
Shared Resource Grid: Energy, bandwidth, and rare earth minerals are pooled and distributed via the Central Processing Parliament.
