Silverpond, named from Latin origins meaning &amp;quot;great wilderness,&amp;quot; was originally mapped and settled by Nosumand, then a tiny nation laying the foundations for the never-ending process of developing a philosophically and ethically advanced community. Silverpond is known for the complex relationship between its people and their environment. Common regional values since the earliest settlers include self-subsistence, impeccable manners, and life-long philosophical education.
