The Disappointment Isles are an inhospitable island chain in the Pacific. They were discovered by the French, but the sissies couldn&amp;#39;t handle it. So, they waved the white flag once again and returned home. The Isles were rediscovered, however, and are now home to a confederacy of island nations, spanning the entirety of the political spectrum.

The Isles have recently seen a civil war, and an invasion by the infamous Black Riders. Because of these misfortunes, regional government is in a bit of a shock.
