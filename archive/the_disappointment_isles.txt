The Disappointment Isles are a large, inhospitable island chain in the Pacific. It was named by the French, who explored the isles in hopes of building a colony. The bunch of sissies couldn&amp;#39;t handle it, so they waved the white flag once again and returned home. The region was rediscovered, however, and is slowly being inhabited by brave pioneers.


Currently, the Isles are ruled by [nation]Isle of Desapointament[/nation] and [nation]Dolanica[/nation] and free trade is offered to any joining nations.
