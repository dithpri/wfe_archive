The Disappointment Isles are a large, inhospitable island chain in the Pacific. It was named by the French, who explored the isles in hopes of building a colony. The bunch of sissies couldn&amp;#39;t handle it, so they waved the white flag once again and returned home. The region was rediscovered, however, and is now a haven of burgeoning nations.
