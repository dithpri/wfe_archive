A region left in shambles, ransacked by the Black Riders.

We emerge once more, with a greater drive than ever.
The goal is no longer to create a save haven for wayward people. The People of Disappointment now have a much grander scheme in mind. Now the band of island nations, with fire in their hearts, are ensuring that no one can ever wipe out their way of life, their ideology.

People of Desapointament, now is the time. All Nation States on the green planet will submit to the Disappointment Way, or fall before us on the mighty warpath.
