The United States of Europe, born on August 17, 2017, is a region that aims to put the various nations into a community and legislative policy.
The first 5 nations that will be part of the United States of Europe will be called &quot;co-founders&quot; of the region.
The map of the region will be drawn up by the European Prime Minister, who will be in charge of managing the European structure.
The Prime Minister and the various ministries will be democratically elected through the vote of all the nations present in the region. The election will only take place when the region reaches 10 countries.
To the nations you are about to enter the community, I wish you a warm welcome.
