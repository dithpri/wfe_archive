The Monkie Republic, founded in 2016 by three social outcasts seeking isolation from modern society, is a collection of remote islands in the Atlantic Ocean. All inhabitants have devolved from humans into chimps and enjoy a simple, primitive lifestyle. The official language throughout the region consists of a series of grunts, which vary in octave and tone in order to express one of the four emotions the inhabitants are capable of feeling: hunger, exhaustion, lust, and fear. The official currency is a coconut.
