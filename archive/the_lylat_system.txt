A star system somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy, Lylat has several planets orbiting it from Aquas near the very heart, to Zoness at the very end. Space travel is common and the inhabitants curiously look rather like animals from the Solar system elsewhere in the same galaxy.
The inhabitants of Corneria have expanded and colonized most of the system, establishing industrial zones and military bases on several of the less-habitable planets, for the last two centuries. However, over time, each planet has broken off into independence.
[hr]FT with space travel. Thanks to SFA, apparently magic is also acceptable.
