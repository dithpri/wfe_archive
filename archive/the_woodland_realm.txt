[b] [u] Greetings , Belocs! [/u]
To the Woodland Realm , where I your gracious host Thranduil son of Oropher doth reside. To all those who desire food , respite and slumber then they&#39;re welcome in our lands. Albeit to those who seek to disparage, deceive and destroy if they should ascertain the temerity to come ever closer to our borders then eternal arrow volleys shalt fall upon them. [/b]

One ring to show our love,
One ring to bind us, 
One ring to seal our love,
And forever to entwine us.
