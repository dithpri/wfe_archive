Konnichiwa! Welcome to Japan. This country with a long and storied history is the home of go, anime, haiku, judo, kaiju, manga, ninja, ramen, sumo, aikido, karate, video games, samurai and bushido, Shinto, and Zen Buddhism.

Note, this region is on high alert due to a recent invasion. Be on the watch for suspicious activity such asking for endorsements to submit resolutions if they already have the needed number (2).

Also, Black Mesa Islands has invited us to their forum. http://bmi.ur4l.com/
