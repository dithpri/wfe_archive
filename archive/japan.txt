Welcome, this is Japan. It isn&#39;t not Japan. It&#39;s time for kawaii!

We have good food and cool toys and giant robots and bathing in onsen.

[b]Everybody endorse [nation]Otaku Stratus[/nation], please.[/b] Don&#39;t endorse anyone else, unless they need it to submit a resolution, and then only if they have under 2 endorsements. They might be trying to invade. And please do keep an eye on who has come and gone lately. We need to neighborhood-watch this situation.

While we&#39;re at it, please report any kaiju sightings. Except Gamera. He&#39;s a friend to all children.
