Alas, even through a seemingly hopeless time after being inhabited by the Black Riders, Difay stayed strong when led by President Terina Drovei Quiduur and General Tormynn Gaczii. The rebels were driven our of the region, and peace was cordially restored and re-insured, thanks to a new password-to-enter system making entry only possible for those trusted by Miss Quiduur, herself. So, if you have, in fact been chosen, welcome! Feel free to make yourself at home.
