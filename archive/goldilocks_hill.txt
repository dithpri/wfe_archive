The perfect region, in the perfect valley.

Founded in 2021, Goldilocks hill was an empty region for the taking. The Dogelands and Dabuncheit took over the land and founded a region. Along the way, more and more nations became part of the valley. We kept expanding the land. And then we made a control system with a founder, a president, a military officer, and an embassy officer.
