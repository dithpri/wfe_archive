We run a people run government where all minister and lead position decisions are put to people vote before enacted the only person that can over rule the peoples vote and minister decision is the Governor however the PM can take exclusive action and gain approval later on. 

PM and DPM positions are voted by the people every 4 months. Nations running must campaign and this process lasts 3 days before the vote is made. 

Minister positions are appointed by the PM and enacted by the governor.
