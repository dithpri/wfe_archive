[b]K&Ouml;NIGREICH DEUTSCHLAND[/b]
The Kingdom of Germany is a feudal monarchy that unites all German nations under one crown and flag. We do not tolerate any views supporting Nazism.

We are a new region offering members a chance to become a noble and stake claim on our map. We need people willing to build a region from the ground up and be a part of something bigger than them. 

Join today, as we expect to expand quickly! Contact [nation]Koelle[/nation] on how to get in on the ground floor and begin the first steps to your own dynasty!
