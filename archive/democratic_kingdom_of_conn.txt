The Democratic Kingdom of Conn is a region made up of fairly sensible nations, working together for a brighter future for all of its member states. The DKoC has a delegate from the World Assembly, who shall, naturally, rule democratically, but the founder state, the Grand Duchy of Connalta reserves the right to&#133; adjust, shall we say, the region&amp;#39;s policies somewhat. All are free to join, provided they follow the general guidelines outlined above.
