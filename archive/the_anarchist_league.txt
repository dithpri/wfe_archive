Welcome to Anarchist League comrade.

The Anarchist League is a loose band of like-minded leftists. From the Marxists to Syndicalists, we all seek to bring about a greater future through compassion, debate and activism.

While I have executive power, I shall use it sparingly and at the behest of the people, for the people rule and the government obeys!
