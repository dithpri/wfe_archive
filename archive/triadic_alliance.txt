The Triadic Alliance was founded by 3 local Solar Powers, the Arkronians, the Theodrin, and the Maxatropians. This Alliance was formed in order to combat the League of Destrix. This League seeks to bring about the Resurrection and conquest of an ancient evil known as Destrix. The League of Destrix consists of four main groups, each of which have proven to be a considerable threat to the Galaxy. They are the Cult of Destrix, the Marauders, the Skorn, and the remnants of the Zantoxan Empire. Only time will tell if the Triadic Alliance will hold out.
