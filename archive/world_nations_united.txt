A world in turmoil brings out the true intentions of nations. Some take advantage of the situation to grow in power and dominate others, imposing martial rule and violating basic rights. But for every bad there must be a good, and we are that good. The World Nations United (WNO) has no intention of forcing a political agenda, only preserving peace and furthering the human race. All are welcome to join and take part in our administration.
