Hello, Nations of the world. Welcome to the Region of Zero.
This region exists because it can. There are no WA Delegates, no WA Delegate acess to Regional Controls, and no Nations in the WA.

The only stipulation if you want to join is that you cannot join the World Assembly. This is necessary to protect Zero from invaders.
Other than that, Welcome aboard!
