Hello, Nations of the world. Welcome to the Region of Zero, a place between all universes.
This region exists because it can. There are no WA Delegates, no WA Delegate acess to Regional Controls, and no Nations in the WA.
[color=red]Invasions are impossible.[/color]
The only stipulation if you want to join is that you cannot join the World Assembly. We do not need the NationStates equivalent of the U.S. congress in this region.
Other than that, Welcome aboard! A new night sky every day!
For your convenience:
