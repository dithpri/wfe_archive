Welcome to the United Nations of Arvalma! We are relatively new and want to grow. We are a fun joyful region who are not drowned in sorrow. We have a government in place and a set of rules to carry out. As we hire new ministers, these rules will develop and such. We will have polls to decide the ministers of UNA. If actions are to be carried, a poll will be set asking the nations what is to be done so everyone gets a say! 
                        Rules!

I. Treat everyone with respect. Abuse will not be tolerated!
II. Polls must be constructed before decisions. Telegram me for final say.
III. Do not abuse power.
IV. Each minister must fulfil their duties.
V. Have fun!

Yours truly, Bleron I
Leader of Nembolo
UNA
