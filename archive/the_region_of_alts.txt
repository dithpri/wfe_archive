We are a region of Alternate Accounts

Rules:
1. Be yourself, don&amp;#39;t be a jerk. Unless yourself is a jerk, then try to be respectful to others.
2. No recruiters. Ever. Same goes for invaders.
3. If an RP ever takes place, the person that had the idea for the RP gets final say on the rules, although they may pass the torch to someone else if they wish.

RP Rules:
None at the moment
