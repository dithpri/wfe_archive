[b][color=orange]Rules:[/color][/b]
1. Be yourself, don&amp;#39;t be a jerk. Unless yourself is a jerk, then try to be respectful to others.
2. No recruiters. Ever. Same goes for invaders.
3. If an RP ever takes place, the person that had the idea for the RP gets final say on the rules, although they may pass the torch to someone else if they wish.
4: If someone has an idea for an RP or a poll, let your voice be heard!
