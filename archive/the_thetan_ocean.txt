We Rule...and stuff.
So far, the region has no real gov, but I am working on it.

Also, if you want your nation on the flag, then telegram me what you want it to look like.
If your nation consists of two or more islands, like [nation]Lambdacism and Rhotacism[/nation] , then also include that note in the &amp;#39;gram.
I may also put your land on the same island as another, like with [nation]Los Pescuados[/nation] , [nation]Thinking and meditating[/nation] and [nation]Los Pollos[/nation] . 

We are small, but getting bigger. Hit me with some government ideas on the RMBs, since I need all of the inspiration that I can get.
