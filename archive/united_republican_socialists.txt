As of 1 day ago, the region of the United Republican Socialists is officially up and running.

Any who espouse the beliefs of Leftism or Communism here are welcome without question, but those who join peacefully with other ideologies are just as welcome. As befits a region modeled as a Republic, there will be no censorship or limitations on what anyone chooses to say, and we welcome criticism of any ideology.

I highly encourage debate on whatever issue is pressing at the moment, and will be sure to make public whatever major goal we are currently working towards.
