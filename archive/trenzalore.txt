The trap is set for the Doctor&#146;s friends. They will travel where the Doctor ends.

His friends are lost for ever more, unless he goes to Trenzalore.

This man must fall as all men must. The fate of all is always dust.

The man who lies will lie no more when this man lies at Trenzalore.

The girl who died he tried to save. She&#146;ll die again inside his grave.
