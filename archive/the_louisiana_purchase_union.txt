Welcome to [region]The Louisiana Purchase Union[/region]!

The Louisiana Territory was acquired by indigenous peoples and settlers from France in 1803. Shortly thereafter, the Louisiana Purchase Union was formed. The LPU is comprised of all of the nation-states that are native to the region who have shared interests in protecting their people, territory, and economic freedom.
