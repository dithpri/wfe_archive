Moldavia bears the scars of many invasions which fortunately blend seamlessly into many more self inflicted scars of constant warfare.  Victory paintings hang from every upright tree (which isn&#39;t that many tbh) depicting the muscular, well oiled bodies of our hot pants clad invaders (think Bros crossed with Right Said Fred) being driven from our lands.  Somewhere, a bird sings.

Speaking of, the stats for the invasions of Moldavia to failed invasions of Moldavia remain the same.

[b]Invasions[/b]: 5
