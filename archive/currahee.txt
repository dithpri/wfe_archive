[color=navy] If you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ve found the ruins of a once great structure, a city of sorts, once full of life and unity of friends and relationships come and gone, of holy might once thought to be impossible by modern standards, and now it is but a shadow of the beginning. This is a graveyard of hope and life. This is the requiem of my will. The finish line of an empty time trial. The phrase that states &quot;The End&quot; on the last page, but just before you close the cover, allow me to say it was a good run. It was a swell time, a great epic. But all good things must come to an end.[/color]
