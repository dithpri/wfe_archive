[b]We here at [region]The Black Hawks[/region] like to move move it into many exotic places. The Hawk team was partying, shaking their tailfeathers but some party crashers threw a drink at them.  So they decided to shake things up and throw some crossing patterns into the party mix as well.  If you want to be a mover and shaker then come join us back at our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Nest![/url]
