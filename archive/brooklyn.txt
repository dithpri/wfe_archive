[b]It&#39;s real, yo but still, yo, it&#39;s love here
And it&#39;s felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
They shout out &quot;Go Brooklyn&quot;, they representing it
Sitting on they front stoop sipping Guinesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the tree-line blocks to the tenements
To the Mom and Pop local shop businesses
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain&#39;t a place that I know that bear resemblance

That&#39;s why we call it The Planet
