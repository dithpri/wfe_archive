In honor of the very first region I ever lived in. My friends, Czechoso, The Potato Farmers, Eridanus, you are all long gone, but not forgotten. May this region last long and stand as a monument to your memory and countless others whose names are lost in the mists of time, but whose presence was felt and remembered.
