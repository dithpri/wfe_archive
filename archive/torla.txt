A large, mountainous region, known for its bright and colourful populous. Torla recognises that true happiness, culture, progress, and power in all its forms comes from science alone, and never elsewhere.
Knowledge is power, wisdom is applied knowledge, and only those willing to step forward and grasp the ideas of tomorrow can hope of being great.

Torla also understands that knowledge need not come at the sake of nature, and that the method of control and assembly is a minor note in the history books. Supporting democracies of wastelands, dictatorships of bountiful grasslands, and kingdoms of steel, Torla accepts and encourages any and all that accept it as every living being&#39;s quest to uncover and understand all that they are capable of.
