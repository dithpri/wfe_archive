[color=633517][pre]	Others are welcome to use this region, but please do not expect too much from it.

	I use this region to park all of my two letter puppet nations when they are not being used for various other purposes, such as enumerating and calculating the location of an unknown region when the tool site that Texas has created is not working, or when I am doing so between the major updates.
