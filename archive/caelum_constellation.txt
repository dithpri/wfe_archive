[i]Caelum: is a faint constellation in the southern sky, introduced in the 1750s by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name means &quot;chisel&quot; in Latin, and it was formerly known as Caelum Sculptorium (Engraver&#39;s Chisel); it is a rare word, unrelated to the far more common Latin caelum, meaning &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;heaven&quot;, or &quot;atmosphere&quot;. It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a solid angle of around 0.038 steradians, just less than that of Corona Australis.[/i][b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 04/05/2025.[/b]
