Hi all,
If our little community has decided to move on from Nationstates, I shall allow this region to cease to exist.
I wish you all a Happy New Year&#39;s, not just for 2018 but for all the years to come.
It has been fantastic befriending all of you. For those of us with little families of our own, take good care of them and enjoy the company of each other. For the younger ones among us, there is much happiness in the future. The world today is a troubled place, and the only remedy is love and generosity. After having known all of you, I can safely say that the world is a better place with you in it.
May you always be happy and well. 
Nigel and the people of Genivia
