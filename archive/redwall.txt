Redwall Abbey is open to everyone of good heart. Come and rest your feet for a while at our hearth; eat our delicious food and enjoy our entertainment; entertain us with stories or song and join in our festivities. Redwall is a place of happiness, where anyone may live out their seasons in peace and safety.

Those who refuse to live at peace with others within these walls will be given ample opportunity to correct themselves before being shown to the door. Redwall Abbey will not suffer from any evildoer or malcontent. That is my decree.
