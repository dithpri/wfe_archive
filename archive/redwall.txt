RedWall,

Come bring me your weak, your sick and poor, 
But vermin beware Mathias swore,
Abbey RedWall people are strong, cunning and smart
So start on your way, we dare you to come to our abbey.

VERMIN BEWARE!!! REDWALL IS HOME TO A REGIMENT OF LONG PATROL HARES WHO ARE ALWAYS LOOKIN FOR A GOOD FIGHT ELULIAAA!!!!

For those who do not seek to conqure the ground on which Redwall stands there are feasts for new brothers and sisters who join, aswell as visiters and travalers.
