Sertia, an alternate earth where democracy has died. In this new age of dictators, everyone is out to get one another in a world war. Among the warring factions are the most oppressive regimes imaginable. 

This is a War Roleplaying Region. Any region with embassies constructed with Sertia may participate in the warfare. Want to roleplay wars between opposing regions? Just construct embassies and be my guest.

For WA members residing in Sertia. The Lorekeepers [./nation] is Sertia&#146;s WA delegate. Sertia does NOT believe in democracy. Any endorsements not directed at The Lorekeepers will result in your nation getting ejected from Sertia.
