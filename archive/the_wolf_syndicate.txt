Currently we are under lock down procedures. Alpha has to take a leave of absence for an undetermined amount of time, hopefully not to long. In the time being this region and all territories will be locked down for security measures. All citizens here are asked to move to the [region]Land of Shadows[/region] as quickly as possible, it is the castle I made so we could do all of this. 
    All regions that have embassies here, please contact me on my main nation, which is [b][nation=short]Shadow Commander[/nation][/b].  Also all soldiers contact me there also.
