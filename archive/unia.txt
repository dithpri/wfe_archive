Welcome to Unia. Unia is a democracy, with the Chancellor as the head of Unia. The Chancellor can serve an unlimited amount of terms and every term is 2 months. The Unia Elections are held the first day of every other month (every 2 months) and every nation may vote for the nation/candidate of their choice. Because the election system is by popular vote, the nation/candidate with the most votes becomes the Chancellor.
