Thrace is a geographic and historical region of Greece, located between the Nestos and Evros rivers in the NW of the country. Together with the regions of Macedonia and Epirus, it is often referred to informally as northern Greece or Western or Greek Thrace to distinguish it from Eastern Thrace, which lies east of the river Evros and forms the European part of Turkey, and the area to the north, in Bulgaria, known as Northern Thrace.
