The Grand Communist Associated Nations (GCAN) is a collection of Socialist and Communist nations from every corner of the globe. Everybody here stands for equality, both socially and economically. We stand to end Capitalism and the atrocious abuses of civil and political rights that spawn from it. Our goal is to gain international power through diplomacy, and to spread the good word of equality through peace! Love all and accept all!
