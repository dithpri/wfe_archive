Hyrule, a vast sprawling kingdom with a market town in the middle, oh, and also the castle. Around the castle is a large plain known as [color=gold][b]&amp;quot;Hyrule Field&amp;quot;[/b][/color], also there  is a village at the base of [color=red][b]&amp;quot;Death Mountain&amp;quot;[/b][/color] known as [color=indigo][b]&amp;quot;Kakariko Village&amp;quot;[/b][/color]. The rock-like Gorons live in [color=red][b]&amp;quot;Death Mountain&amp;quot;[/b][/color]. Near there is a waterfall, and behind that waterfall is a cave known as [color=blue][b]&amp;quot;Zora&amp;#39;s Domain&amp;quot;[/b][/color], where the Zora live. The Zora are a human-fish hybrid. There is also the [color=green][b]&amp;quot;Kokiri Forest&amp;quot;[/b][/color], a forest that the Kokiri call home, the Kokiri is a race of humans that stay children forever. Don&amp;#39;t go past [color=green][b]&amp;quot;Kokiri Forest&amp;quot;[/b][/color] though, past the forest is [color=orange][b]&amp;quot;Gerudo Desert&amp;quot;[/color][/b], and the woman there are fierce warriors! Zelda fans, this is for you!!!
