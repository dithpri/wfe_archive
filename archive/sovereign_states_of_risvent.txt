The Sovereign States of Risvent is an alliance between the the major nations upon the Isle of Risvent. The Republic of Eyerdon, the United States of Ambadon, and the Commonwealth of Moravadon. All have benefited economically and militarily, but relations between Eyerdon and Moravadon have been tense for quite some time. The inhabitants of Risvent recently discovered a bountiful, yet savage land to the South. Eyerdon has pushed rapidly into these lands, annexing towns both militarily and diplomatically. The people of these new lands are hostile and barbaric.
