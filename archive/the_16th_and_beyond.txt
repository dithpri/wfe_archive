While bothering us with their puppets, Lasagnian agents sent some of theirs to random regions once they were done with that one. This region happened to be a holding of Lily, which I don&#146;t particularly like. I refounded it in order to prevent Lily from getting it back. 

A tip to any Lily agents checking this out: please stop with the rainbow fonts, they&#146;re very difficult to read against the background when they phase into yellow. (Also enough with the furry text)

And Cheddar, if you want the embassy back, get Adriatican out and maybe I&#146;ll consider it. 

This is now the property of [nation]Northern Mount Celestia[/nation].

I&#146;ll clean this up later and add previous WFEs when I get the chance, I&#146;ve just got stuff going on so I don&#146;t have time to do that right now.
