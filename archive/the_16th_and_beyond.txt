[b]Welcome, I guess.[/b]

Finally after so many attempts of trying to set up my own region, this is a 16th century and well beyond RP, this means that yes, we will advance over time and such. for now this region is open for everyone interested in my idea, probably (no one) for now, so I will populate the region with puppets, which will be &quot;NPC&quot; nations, so do not worry! I will not abuse them in the RP!
