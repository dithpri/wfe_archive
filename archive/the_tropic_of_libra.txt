The Tropic of Libra is a perfectly-straight 2-dimensional geographic region roughly the size of 0x0x(n), intersecting the International Date Line, a point 17,216M directly below the Arctic Circle and Marvin&#39;s Food Aquarium on 33rd.  It has an unlimited supply of natural resources and an omniscient force-field that repels greed, mosquitoes, and the color mauve.
