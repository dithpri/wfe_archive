[b]We march to the future with our heads up high and blades point forward. This region was taken by the United Imperialist Joint Command! 

This alliance unites both [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] in order to lead and be an example for all imperialist regions in the coming future!

Long live the Emperor! All hail the Kaiserin!

With the alliance being a bulk of the force we were supported by our allies and close friends of [region]Kantrias[/region]![/b]
