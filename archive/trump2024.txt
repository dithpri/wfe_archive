[b]Welcome to Trump2024![/b]

Everyone is welcome to come and debate. Those who spew insults and baseless accusations will be ejected.

We accept all embassies so long as they respect us.
[hr]Rest in Peace, Charlie Kirk (1993&#150;2025)

Charlie was taken from us in a senseless act of violence, murdered for speaking his mind, in front of his family and thousands of others. 

He will be deeply missed, but his courage, his voice, and the values of peaceful debate and freedom of speech he stood for will never be forgotten. His work and the impact he made will continue to live on.
