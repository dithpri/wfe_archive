[b][color=darkred]The Royal Commonwealth of Aesurdah is a continent united under the strong leadership of Queen Allaphina II - who rules from the Snow Throne. The Commonwealth has, since the time of unification, worked to strengthen its position across the continent, and foster a region democratic and rich in history.

And the glittering palaces and cities of Aesurdah are built on a historic foundation of war and blood.[/b][/color]
