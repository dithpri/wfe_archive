[i]&amp;quot;A patriot be - for knowledge, freedom,
The soul&amp;#39;s too small a price to pay!
Mind you, not his soul, my brothers,
The nation&amp;#39;s soul he&amp;#39;ll give away!

He who falls while fighting to be free
can never die: for him the sky
and earth, the trees and beasts shall keen,
to him the minstrel&amp;#39;s song shall rise&#133;

By day he&amp;#39;s shaded by an eagle,
a wolf licks gently at his wounds,
above, a falcon - bird of rebels -
tends to this rebel as a brother would.

On the mountainside - as day has dawned -
the rebel lies, his lifeblood runs,
the wolf licks at his bitter wound
and the sun, again, now burns - and burns.&amp;quot;[/i]
