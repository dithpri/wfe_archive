The story of modern. 

One Day a country named seamv wanted to look for a bigger area to call home so he decided to set up a region. Because it was special and new so they decided to call it modern to reflect its nature as a new place to call home and it has served as the home to many nations over the course of a few weeks establishing a clear system of hierarchy with the all great founder at the top and his most trusted advisors at his side. GLORY TO FOUNDER.

In other words, I just got bored and made a region.

Important facts to remember 
1.the founder is all powerful and you must listen to him
2. emus beat Australia
3. don&#39;t mess with founder (or emus)
