[b]Galicia[/b]

Galicia (Galician: Galiza) is both an &quot;autonomous community&quot; and a &quot;historical nation&quot; in northwestern Spain. The capital is Santiago de Compostela. Galicia is a coastal region well known for its mild climate and distinct geography, with many peninsulas and r&iacute;as (fjord-like inlets) giving the region a long coastline and a strong relationship to the sea.

Respect local customs and traditions; do not mock superstitions regardless how strange they may seem to you. Galicians may tell you it is all &quot;nonsense&quot;, but they still will not like you judging them.
