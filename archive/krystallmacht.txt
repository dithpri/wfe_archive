[b]Shattered glass is scattered across the threshold of this region. The residents are silent despite the hand of the invader, and still as if they have no life of their own. Those under oath to protect these natives are even less attentive to their plight. All regions are [u]not[/u] of equal value in [i]their[/i] eyes. Night has descended here, and there is no dawn on the horizon. There is no peace on this eve, nor on any other, while the mark of the [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] flies above this region.

The day defenders abide by their vows and once more champion the cause has not arrived. Raiders will prevail until defenders again rise from their somnolent vigil.[/b]
[hr][spoiler=TBR Was Here][b]Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! This region proved no match for a charge by [region=The Black Riders]![/b][/spoiler]
