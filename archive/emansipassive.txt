Emancipassive is an enormous region for the amount of people in it.  At some point wars broke out that resulted in a single psuedo-religious philosophy dominating the land that emancipated the people from the suffering they experienced prior.  The region has a variety of climates and terrain.  Any and all forms of life are welcomed, and it is becoming more and more accepted that beings other than humans, such as aliens and fae and other creatures, exist and that cohabitation with all of Nature&#39;s creations and parts is essential, that all are equal in the eyes of Nature.  The name of the region today combines &quot;emancipation&quot; and &quot;massive&quot;, meaning &quot;the emancipation of a massive land&quot; or &quot;a massive overhaul of emancipation&quot;.
