UPDATE: The borders have been closed to outside zombie vectors and we&amp;#39;re fighting the imagination drain from within now. Research the cure in your nation to help coordinate production and distribution of [color=purple]Cure Missiles[/color] to neighbouring affected nations. The longer you research, the stronger your purple becomes!

In addition to purple vaccine against the loss of imagination to the horde, please consider donating Zilloween pumpkins to the regional food ration effort. If we do go down, at least we can have pumpkin ale when the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
