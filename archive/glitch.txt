[color=green][b]Bulletin: Glitch Zombie Apocalypse Preparedness[/b][/color]

Local producers will be ramping up their cultivation of purple so that each nation in the region has a stockpile of [color=purple]Essence of Purple[/color], to protect their populations from infection and zombification. Watch out for plague vectors entering the region to spread their craving for glitchen brains among the populace ahead of our regional quarantine procedure going into effect. Zombies are known to feast upon imagination!

In addition to purple vaccine against the loss of imagination to the horde, please consider donating Zilloween pumpkins to the regional food ration effort. If we do go down, at least we can have pumpkin ale when the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
