The Former United States of America is a region made up of countries resulting from a civil war in the USA. It is open to any country based in America that is [b]at least somewhat realistic[/b]. If you join and your nation name is not capitalized. . . I&#39;m sorry, but you will ejected unless you provide reasoning that the founder, [nation]Liberated American Provinces[/nation], finds acceptable.  

[b]Regional Government[/b] (work in progress)
[i]Currently supplemented by [nation]the American Coalition Government[/nation][/i]
[i]-Elections for the President of [nation]the American Coalition Government[/nation] will be held every 2 weeks (we say this but who knows if it will happen)[/i]
[i]-Basically. . . you get to decide their issues. . . yes, that&#39;s all it is[/i]
