[b][color=red]Welcome to the region of New Anglia. This region was established by the British Empire after its discovery during the Age of Exploration, and the nations that continue to exist today are remnants of those former colonies who maintain the traditions and spirits of the British invaders.[/color]

[color=blue]We are a newly established region that is ever-growing, therefore most seats of power are still available. We accept everyone into the region... providing they are entirely loyal to the British crown![/color][/b]
