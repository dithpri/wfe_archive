[i]The Interstellar Empire, in fact, occupies a portion of solid land, its airspace never actually hitting outer space. It&#39;s an advertising thing.[/i]

If you like a policy of evilness, if you&#39;re tired of the stereotypes of goodness and all those stupid heroes, then join the Interstellar Empire for all your evil needs and command your minions, or kill them if they don&#39;t do what you say. Make sure you join by then, or you&#39;ll lose the fun. No pressure.
