Macaronesia is a collection of four archipelagos in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the continents of Europe and Africa. Excluding the Azores, which is considered mainly as part of Europe, the other islands of Macaronesia are closer to Africa. Macaronesian islands belong to three countries: Portugal, Spain, and Cape Verde.

The name  is occasionally misspelled &quot;Macronesia&quot; in false analogy with Micronesia.

Macaronesia consists of four main archipelagos; namely (north to south):

Azores (Portugal)
Madeira (Portugal), also including the Desertas Islands, Porto Santo Island, and the Selvagens Islands
Canary Islands (Spain)
Cape Verde
