DASTOS (Dictatorship of the Allied States of the Theocracy of Stalin) is a recently founded region led by The Theocracy of Stalin. Here we follow the ideals of Stalin, we prioritise economy and military over EVERYTHING else. If interested in roleplaying and having fun in general join! We also have a discord server to ease communications between regions and ourselves.
