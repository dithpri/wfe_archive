[b]Welcome to [color=red]Norlin[/color] [color=blue]Airlann[/color]!

[color=red]Norlin[/color] [color=blue]Airlann[/color] means Northern Ireland in the Ulster Scots language. Northern Ireland is politically, ethnically and largely religiously separate from the [color=darkorange]Republic of Ireland[/color]. This region is dedicated to every loyalist soldier who laid down their lives to fight the savagery of the Irish Republican Army and also to the civilian victims of Republican terrorism as well.

[i]In memory of [url=http://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/migration_catalog/article25683932.ece/2e20b/ALTERNATES/h342/jean]Jean McConville[/url], an innocent woman murdered by the Provisional IRA for helping a wounded British soldier![/i]
