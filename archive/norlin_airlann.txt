Northern Ireland ([B]Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann[/B]) is a constituent unit of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the northeast of the island of Ireland. It is politically separate and largely ethnically and religiously separate from its southern neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. [B]IRA terrorists[/B] are no longer tolerated. 

This region also serves a memorial to the brave loyalists who laid down their lives for the cause, and to the innocent Protestants murdered by the IRA and others.
