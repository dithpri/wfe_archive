Armed With Lightning is our regions name. You hurt one you hurt all, which means more of a beat down on you. If you are dumb enough to even attempt invading one of our nations you will NOT make it out without major casualties.We will steamroll our enemies and cripple their allies.(P.S. this is the WA delegate don&#146;t listen to the weeb who wrote this [Kaldamea] he gets way too serious for his own good. Thanks)
