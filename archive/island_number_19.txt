This large, artificial island was originally created by a large megacorporation to test nuclear weapons, but the possession of nuclear weapons by corporations was made illegal before they tested any. They then abandoned it, and the island, with its lush, artificial grasslands, forests, and coasts, serves as a land of opportunity for enterprising governments.
