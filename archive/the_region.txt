This region accepts all nations, regardless of creed, and is a strong believer of freedom of speech.


This region&amp;#39;s founder has thirty one &amp;#39;sleeper&amp;#39; nations across NS, but has never created his own region. So this is it. Will mainly be concerned with opening embassies with other regions, and perhaps become a &amp;#39;bargaining table&amp;#39; for conflicting regions.

Feel free to ask questions

Welcome!
