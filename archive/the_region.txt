[color=darkblue]Welcome to [b]The Region![/b][/color]
This is an alternate history, based in a place called the Greater Lake. An extremely large sea, spreading across the mid-western area of the North American continent, gave rise to many different species, and races of intelligent lifeforms. This is where we are today...
[b]RP Rules[/b]
1. The time period is based around the first millennia. This is where *most* technology must come from. (Essentially LOTR tech, but some modern technology is permitted too.)
2. Espionage is outlawed, no meddling in another country&#39;s affairs.
3. Everyone is in charge of their own internal and external matters.
4. Read the Rights and Rules of War.
