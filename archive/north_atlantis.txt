Don&amp;#39;t spend your time around those other Atlanteans, come to North Atlantis, raised from the ocean floor by Poseidon himself just cause he can, and not because of some multi-generational loan owed to him over the next seven centuries at 16.5% interest.
North Atlantis is big, how big you ask? Well, most of out scouts haven&amp;#39;t returned yet, so it&amp;#39;s that big. North Atlantis is safe, the damned place is full of mega fauna creatures extinct on most places, just try camping...we dare you.
