Welcome to [region]Greater Otway[/region]!
[region]Greater Otway[/region] is named after the beautiful Cape Otway National Park (Great Otway) in Victoria, Australia.
Just like Cape Otway, we hope to give you a wonderful NationStates experience with great views and giant eucalyptus trees. We hope to build a great place to hang out and to flourish, once we get the numbers. We&#39;re also looking for a WA delegate, if you&#39;re interested. If you are, give [nation]Rusurope[/nation] a call, and we will be in touch.
Hope to see you soon!
