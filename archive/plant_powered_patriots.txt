This region is a community for vegans and vegetarians who are right-wing or right-leaning. Veganism and vegetarianism have been excessively politicized by the left who try to interlink it with their ideology, and we think this is a major turnoff for centrists, conservatives, and libertarians, who will use this to belittle the movement. We stand firm that veganism and vegetarianism should be open to people of all political beliefs, and that they aren&#39;t just for those on the left.
