A home for theocratic fascism, or theo-fascism. Very few nations shall ever be admitted to this region, although those that do so shall be strong and mighty nations, ready and willing to take on the rest of the world. No democratic nations are permitted to enter, nor are any with free-market capitalism. On that same vein, communist nations are also barred from entry.
