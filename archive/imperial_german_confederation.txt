[b][color=red]Glory to the Imperial German Confederation!
[/b][/color]
 The Imperial German Confederation (IGC) is a political entity consisting of minor [b]German States[/b] united [b]against Bolshevism[/b] and other [b]threats to Western Civilization[/b]. Each state administers their own affairs as how they see fit to rule, with the exception to these rules laid out in our federal charter (coming soon).

Citizenship is currently open to all those who come into our confederation. Our rule of thumb here is [b] &quot;bitte sei kein Arschloch.&quot; [/b]
