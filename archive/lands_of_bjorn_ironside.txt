In 527 B.BI The vikings of valkenheim led a raid onto the lands of Fredge where they couldn&#39;t break the walls of the city, Bjorn Ironside played dead and told them to tell them they&#39;d leave if he was buried inside the city. When the casket was moved into the church Bjorn Ironside jumped from the casket and fought his way to the city gates alone and opened the drawbridge for the rest of his friends, they had won the battle and the land and in turn Valkenheim gave Bjorn Ironside the lands they have conquered.
