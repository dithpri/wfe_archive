[b]Welcome to the page of the Union of Piklian Nations![/b]
The Union of Piklian Nations is a currently stable, but very loose cluster of nations located in the ancient land that bears the name of Piklia. In ancient times, the original Piklian Empire disbanded due to the combined issues of civil unrest and foreign invaders, and the land was divided into many small city-states that were constantly at war with eachother.   Border disputes were common in the past, but the remaining nations have formed a pact to work together for the good of their nations. [i]To the nations that are unwilling to recognize their Piklian origins, we are known as the UUNONS, (United Unknown Nations On Nation States.)[/i]
