The Sleeping Wilds are a great expanse of unexplored forest, that could hid within it any number of nations, from all walks of life.

The name comes from the constant mist that clings to the tree trunks throughout the day, and the gentle whispering of the wind as it blows through the dense trees. This ancient forest has captured the imaginations of storytellers for countless generations.
