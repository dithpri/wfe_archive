NGC 1549 is an elliptical galaxy located in the constellation Dorado. It is located at a distance of about 50 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 1549 is about 75,000 light years across. NGC 1549 was discovered by John Herschel on 6 December 1835 and may have been observed by James Dunlop in 1826.[2] It is a member of the Dorado Group.
