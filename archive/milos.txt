The most southwesterly island in the [region]Cyclades[/region], [b][color=2B677A]Milos[/color][/b] has all the pristine beaches, whitewashed architecture, and unbelievable tavernas you&#39;ll find elsewhere in the Aegean.

With a moon-like landscape, gorgeous sea caves, and some of the bluest water on earth, the Greek island of Milos seduces couples, water lovers, and gastronomes alike. There&#39;s no denying the Cycladic isle, where the famed Venus de Milo marble statue was unearthed by a farmer in 1820, is breathlessly romantic. &#151;[url=https://www.travelandleisure.com/milos-greece-island-travel-guide-8622105][color=#2B677A]Milos[/url][/color]
