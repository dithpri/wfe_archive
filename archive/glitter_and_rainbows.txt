Originally founded in December 2012 by a nation called &amp;quot;American Neo-Nazi&amp;quot; to be a safe haven for Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. The Jewish Justice League found their hideout here and sent all the goose steppers packing to the Rejected Realms in February 2013 in an operation that lasted 60 hours, with the invaluable assistance of our friends over at The [region]Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region], the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] and the [region]CSSR[/region].
No longer will the name &amp;quot;Glitter and Rainbows&amp;quot; be disgraced by fascist goose steppers. From now on, it will stand as a region friendly to people of all races, religions and sexual orientations.
