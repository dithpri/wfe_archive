&quot;The fates will fall before our might, as long as we do not let the universe hold us back. Through control of power and trade, the strongest science military, a belief that even the gods will fall to us, The Rimland Empire will conquer all, leaving nothing but dust where great states once tried to rival us!&quot;

-Teriven, The fourth King of Rimland, &quot;The Shipmaster&quot;
