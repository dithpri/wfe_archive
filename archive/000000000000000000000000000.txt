[color=#9AA2AD][b]27 protons! This region is Cobalt!

Cobalt is used in the preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. Cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, smalt, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes.
The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia yields most of the cobalt metal mined worldwide.
