There are only a few rules in this region:

1. No Opression. The people shall be free.

2. WA enrollment is NOT manditory.

Beyond that, do as you will. This region was founded as an experimental playground in different ways of combining democracy and socialism. A sort of corporate-ran nation, where the citizens are the stockholders.
