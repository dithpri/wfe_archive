[b][u]Columbus Gifted Academy Republic of Nations[/b][/u]

&amp;#12288;A small region in the west, known for a tight, democratical system. The region is weary of outsiders, but they
seem to be accepted quickly anyway. The leaders of the nations don&#39;t seem to discuss anything in public. However, since the CGARoN is a relatively peaceful group of nations, it is mostly ignored by others. Overall, the group seems
confusing, and very few know what the group really stands for.
