[b][u]Columbus Gifted Academy Republic of Nations[/b][/u]

&amp;#12288;A small region in the west, known for a tight, democratical system. The region is weary of outsiders, but they
seem to be accepted quickly anyway. The leaders of the nations don&#39;t seem to discuss anything in public. However, since the CGARoN is a relatively peaceful group of nations, it is mostly ignored by others. Overall, the group seems
confusing, and very few know what the group really stands for.

You just need to be in a CCS account (the ones that end in columbus.k12.oh.us).
