Welcome to Limeclaw waters, a pirate themed roleplay region

You are a fleet or a town in a huge ocean where terror is the main source of governance and insane psychopaths and crazy dictators rule over huge stretches of water, warring and plundering each other, keeping the people they rule over under fear and mistrust with eachother.

The Senate, a leading group of 7 powerful leaders rule over the mainland, maintaining order and delivering justice to the pirates with a fair hand.

The Grand Mafia, a four captain band that carries out governance through the dark alleys of every kingdom

The most wanted, a collection of some of the most notorious captains and their criminal crew, sowing chaos through the sea with no remorse or direction.
