Oh my. What an honour to be featured region. (6/28/17 and 9/14/17!)

First of all I&#39;ll thank [region]The Order of The Grey Wardens[/region]. TGW do great work, and have stuck by me on my eight year journey to become a featured region. I couldn&#39;t have done it without their support and friendship.

Additional thanks go to: [nation]The Grim Reaper[/nation], my favourite small anarchist skeleton. [nation]Tim[/nation], for being Tim enough to push me onwards. [nation]Roavin[/nation]... [i]you know what you did[/i]. [nation]Kingdom of Circle of Magi[/nation], it&#39;s inspiring to see such ambition. [nation]Pergamon[/nation], mein Schnabeltier.

Go check out [region]New United Kingdom[/region], they&#39;re super fun!
