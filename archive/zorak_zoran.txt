We are the Folk. We are first of all the mortal races, whether they celebrate in darkness or look up to a bright sky.  Curses thin out our blood and seed, ancient hexes that sour our bloodlines and breed whelps of unnatural creatures.  Yet we persevere.  Our days of dominance are behind us.  Yet we persevere.  The world around us is the plaything of empires we do not understand.  Yet we persevere.  We are the Uz: the True Folk.  Neither Fate nor the malice of unholy gods has crushed our race.  What hopes do bickering empires of men have?  I say none.
