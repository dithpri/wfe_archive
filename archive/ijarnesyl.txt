[url=http://iiwiki.com/wiki/Ijarnesyl]Ijarnesyl[/url], also known as [b]Sarnsol[/b], or [b]Yarnsol[/b] is a continental landmass consisting of a colourful history- most notably tensions solidified by the colonial projects of the now dissolved [url=http://iiwiki.com/wiki/Erlenica]Erlenic Empire[/url], and the waves of opposition. Only in recent decades have the nine nations found peace and prosperity in concurrence with the dissolution of the Empire, and the strengthening of once-failing relations between indigenous separatists, colonialists, monarchists, republicans, socialists, and the occasional coup.
