North Lycanthria is all that remains of North America. What used to be the United States of America is now the heart of the Empire of Lycanthronia. To the northwest of Lycanthronia is a vast stretch of land (from former Washington State to Alaska) known as the Wasteland. No nation would waste their resources attempting to settle it. 

To the north in what used to be Canada is a large collection of Vampiric Kingdoms, who constantly band together to take over Lycanthronia to take our title as the largest nation on earth. They are generally unsuccessful. To the south is Central Lycanthria, composed of Lycan Kingdoms, Empires and Democracies. It is about the most peaceful region on earth.
