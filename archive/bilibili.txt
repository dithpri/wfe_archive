Yep
--------------------------------------
Stayin still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
&amp;#304;f i fall i think ill fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to, guide us
&amp;#304; feel fear for the very last time
Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while i lose my mind
Ah thrill ,no stress
All my muses left behind
World is, below
So high up im near divine
Lean in, let go
&amp;#304; feel fear for the very last time
