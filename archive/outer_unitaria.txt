The sleeping giant which is the formal Unitarian Union shall be awaken... as Outer Unitaria

We will rise from the ashes as Outer Unitaria. Not for any country, ideology, or the will of any leader. For ourselves, for the people.

The Unitarian Union was a glorious Region which gave suffrage and support to each of the nations which inhabited it and, although briefly, showed true potential to compete with it&amp;#39;s surrounding regions.

This great region was suddenly plagued with inactiveness and corruption which eventually lead to it&amp;#39;s demise.

The U.U was a heaven for each nation that joined it, and I am willing to recreate that nations heaven, but this time, it shall be something outside any leader&amp;#39;s heaven.

It shall be Outer Unitaria.
