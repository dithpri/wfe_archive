A cute pig took to the skies for the very first time today! With a bit of magic (and maybe some wings), it became one of us&#151;a fierce hawk ready to soar. Naturally, we all joined in to give it some support, soaring through the skies and swooping down for a quick landing here. As we stretched our wings, we spread a little chaos too&#151;just for fun. Don&#146;t mind the feathers&#151;we&#146;ll be off soon, back to the skies where we belong.
