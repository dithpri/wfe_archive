[i][color=#000000]Though you may very well prove yourself so foolish as to voluntarily deceive that of your own mind, the fact of the matter remains that the world is not how you know it to be. You see, homosapiens, or as you have come to refer towards them as, humans, are born into this world completely oblivious as it relates to the power that is to be experienced around them. This power... It is easily able to be found within a plethora of entities, be they living or inanimate. In fact, this existence slowly eats away at your connection with reality each day, yet you continue to deem fit to deny this.[/color][/i]
