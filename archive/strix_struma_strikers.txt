The Strix Struma Strikers is an advanced defender/liberator region, willing to defend and liberate captured regions, and return them to their rightful owners. We hope that you find your stay here exciting and enjoyable. If you have a target that you think we should raid, please let [nation]Strix Struma[/nation] know. All raiding will be done via a democratic system, deciding who will become the WA delegate of the target region, and if we raid the region at all. Only the people who will be raiding will be aloud to vote on the fate of the target region, all other nations won&amp;#39;t know about it. Please don&amp;#39;t discuss your coming raid on the Regional Message Board (RMB).
