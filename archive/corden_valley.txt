WANTED: Members (hopefully we can raise our numbers all the way up to 5).

Now seeing as we&amp;#39;ve raised our numbers all the way up to 4(?)  Any suggestions as to what to do after we reach our milestone?

Now to show a united front why do we change each of our currencies into the Corden Dollar? 
It&amp;#39;s only a suggestion, of course.
