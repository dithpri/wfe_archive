The Silver Lands are a collection of mountainous islands.

Legend tells, it was created by the waste products of the moon 20 years ago - of course in real life this did not happen. The Silver Lands native religion is very confusing. 

There is an diverse selection of animals that live on the Silver Lands. Two of most well known are the Great Silver-Wind Falcons and the Bears of Barenreitener (a nation which adopted German as its main language).
