[b]Terminal Shell[/b] ~*
[i]Welcome, friends, to the glorious (albeit tiny) region of Terminal Shell![/i]

-------

[U]Who are we?[/U]
* We are a band of misfit nations who have come together to do absolutely nothing whatsoever.   

[U]What do we do?[/U]
* Pretty much nothing. As of now we sit in an isolated bubble of either ignorance or laziness; it&#39;s hard to tell which. Because we are a new region, we do not participate in invasions or war activities. 

[u]What do we look like?[/u]
* A map may or may not be in the works! It&#39;s all dependent on our begrudging cartographer.

[u]Can I join?[/u]
* Terminal Shell is reserved specifically for those who frequent our community teamspeak, and friends of those community members.

[u]All hail Tim Birdnation?[/u]
* ALL HAIL TIM BIRDNATION.
