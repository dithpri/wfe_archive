An interdimensional netherplane of eternal purgatory and death. It was formed fifteen billion years ago when an early god exploded or something at forty thousand miles per hour. 

The nations and kingdoms residing here have been banished or exiled from their respective worlds and dimensions by some omnipresent cabal of deranged gods.
