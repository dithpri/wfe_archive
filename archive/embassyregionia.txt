[color=gold][b]Reconstruction underway. The legacy of EmbassyRegionia will not be tainted by foolish raiders. Rejoice, as we welcome a new, golden age![/color][/b]

[color=gold][b][i]A complete transition is up ahead![/i] That&#39;s right! Soon we shall defend our fellow embassy collection regions! This is still largely in the works, and how it will function has not been 100% determined, but it is happening, so stay tuned![/color][/b]

[color=gold][b]During this period, please do NOT propose embassies. They will be rejected. Remain patient, business as usual will resume shortly.[/color][/b]
