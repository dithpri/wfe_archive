[color=B8860B][b]Once[/b][/color] an embassy collection region, dedicated to interregional connectivity, turned to ash. Following a disastrous raid carried out en masse by The Brotherhood of Malice, over 1000 embassies commenced closure. The future seemed dark. But not all was lost. Back, and better than ever, we have reorganized ourselves into a defending force for communities such as ours, who desired nothing but peace and prosperity but were instead plagued with the chaotic curse of raiderdom.
