We are the dragon states, those who embody the heart of the dragon. We believe in making progress, moving forwards and inventing new technology to move us forward, and make us into stronger nations. We also strongly believe in freedoms, as we all should be free to make our own decisions. We believe also in strong civil rights, and that all should be equal in this world.
