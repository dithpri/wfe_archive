The Global Aide Assosiation, or G.A.A, is a group of sovereign Nations from across the globe looking to aide and assist each other in times of economic hardship, war, and reform. The G.A.A&amp;#39;s goal is to unite 1,000 Nations into it so it may prosper and flourish, as may the nations that reside within. The GAA respects and welcomes all political parties.
