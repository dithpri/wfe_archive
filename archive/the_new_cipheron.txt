This region is a memorial to the history of the CULU Local Group, a collection of regions featuring the United Empires of Carson/UEC, Union of Liberal Nations, Lardyland, and the United Free Nations. These regions are mostly dead today, but their histories have been compiled here in this crypt.

Pinned below are several factbooks detailing the histories of the regions.

In 2022, all of this region&#39;s histories were remade, ending with the second edition of the History of the ULN.

A history of the UEC may (possibly) be on the way, but not in the near future.
