This region is a memorial to the history of what I sometimes call the ULU Local Group, which is the large collection of regions involved with the Union of Liberal Nations, Lardyland, and the United Free Nations. (The United Empires of Carson aka UEC is also a main power in this group)

I have pinned my many factbooks detailing several nations&#39; and regions&#39; histories.

I have reworked nearly all of my histories, most recently the History of the ULN, which I&#39;m pretty happy with!
