This region is meant to be democratic - any nation, basically, with high personal and/or political freedoms. Obviously, if you get reclassified based on a decision, you won&#39;t be booted immediately. Just keep the rights up, and you should be fine. 

While my nation is pretty conservative (as am I) I&#39;m not really too concerned about ensuring everyone &quot;lines up with my political ideals.&quot; Elected Delegates have Executive authority - this is a democratic region, after all (but I will step in if need be (only invasions, really)

That&#39;s about all, for the moment. I hope that this grows and gets stronger as time goes on. Cheers!
