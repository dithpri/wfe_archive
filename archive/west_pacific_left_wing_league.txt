The West Pacific Left Wing League(W.P.L.W. L) is a region for left-wing and liberal nations who are fed up with being abused by their regional dictators. We are that &amp;quot;unstoppable force&amp;quot; in the World Assembly. We speak up for those who cannot. We stand up to suck-ups, brown-nosers and boot-lickers. We are progressive. WE ARE THE FUTURE NOW!
