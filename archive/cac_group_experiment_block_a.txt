This is an experimental Group that allows for all students within Language Arts Rucki A to experience the creation and running of a country. I am the permanent Administrator, and Mr. Rucki will also have access to administration commands. Apply for world delegates if you want to, but expect refusal.  
Swearing, fighting, trolling and flaming is NOT tolerated.
