Greetings. This is the Astra V Sovereignty, an online gaming community first with some NS aspects second. While we aren&#39;t doing anything raid/defense wise or foreign affairs in an NS sense, we do have a sort of government being worked on as well as a Constitution. We are new to transitioning from a friend group to an actual community so everything is a work in progress with a good bit subject to change, but if you find yourself interested in a bit of a blend of NS with a tight community, come join us here on [url=https://discord.gg/gqGTBcN]Discord[/url].

Note that being in the region itself isn&#39;t a requirement; as I said, it just has NS aspects you might find interesting. Doesn&#39;t participate in all of that itself unless there someway winds up being a big interest in it.
