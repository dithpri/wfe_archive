Welcome!

Elections will be starting to take place soon.  We will use a party system. Each party will have one representative, who will act as the candidate for WA delegate.

EVERYONE, PLEASE MAKE AN ACCOUNT ON THE FORUMS. SEE LINK BELOW!!!

This is a region for all, as long as you are not a nazi. So don&amp;#39;t be nazi. Please?

Anyways, have fun and remember to be kind.
