The Universal confederacy replaced the World Union as the central governing and regulatory body for all countries in this region. Anyone is free to join, although we do not ban fascism, it is highly discouraged.

We promote freedom and equality, every member nation&amp;#39;s concerns will be listened to and we respect you regardless of your nation&amp;#39;s origins. Three cheers to a better world!!!
