[b][color=#3D005E]Howdy partner! Looks like you&#39;ve found your way to Purple Pony Club, the silliest raider region on NS. Make sure to wipe the mud off your boots at the door. Hang up your hat and spurs and make yourself comfortable. We&#39;ve got plenty of room for your horse in the stables. And remember to always keep dancing at the Purple Pony Club.[/color][/b]
