Helheim (&quot;hall of Hela&quot;) is one of the nine worlds of Norse mythology. It is ruled by Hela, the daughter of the trickster Loki and Angrboda.

This cold, dark and misty abode of the dead is located on the lowest level of the Norse universe. It is surrounded by the Gjoll, which flows from the spring Hvergelmir. The entrance to Helheim is guarded by Garm, a monstrous hound.

Those who die of old age or disease, and those not killed in battle, go to Helheim while those who die bravely on the battlefield go to Valhalla.
