[b]When Balder died, Odin sent Hermod to negotiate with Hel to return him to Asgard. It seems that she had the power to let someone pass out of Helheim, though there is no record of her ever exercising that power. But it is surprising that even Odin himself, as king of the gods, creator of the universe, and a death deity through his connection with Valhalla, had no power to free his beloved son from Helheim.

But the dead are destined to leave Helheim one day. According to the prophecy of Ragnarok, the Norse end of the world, Loki will lead an army of the dead to fight against the Asgardian gods. They will exit from Helheim on a ship made from the fingernails and toenails of the dead, with Hel at the head of the ship alongside her father.[/b]
