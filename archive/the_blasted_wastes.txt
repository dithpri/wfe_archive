A land almost completely devoid of life, The Blasted Wastes are home to The Iron Hands Dominion, a militant -industro-religious city-state that thrives off of oppression, industry, and war. The Dominion is bordered by the relatively liberal and eco-freindly nations of The Lazysprite Republic and The Solar Gravity Community. The Dominion secretly plans to cut down all of their clean air producing trees and destroy them all with cybernetic war-bears, to show them the error of their freedom loving and tree-hugging ways.
