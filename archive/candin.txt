This region is home to the Candinian Empire. It is governed by Inner Candin, (known simply as Candin), with colonies stretching out in every direction. 
Each Colony is allowed large amounts of freedom and self governance. The Colonies range from total freedoms in every aspect, to near dictatorships by the Governors. However, all Imperial Laws overrule local laws. As such, there is one official language, Candinish, along with other policies. 
The Empire is also responsible for the defense of all the Colonies. Some Colonies maintain their own defense forces, but those that do not fall into the protection of the Empire. Those that frequently use this defense pay a stronger tax to maintain the military.
