The Tau Sphere is a cluster of thousands of tiny subspace inversion bubbles physically isolated from each other and from the universe. These small areas, some of them with millions of Tau others with only a few, are linked through Stargates. The entire Tau Sphere (with all its &amp;#39;bubbles&amp;#39;) is controled by the socialist [b] Tau Empire[/b].
