Welcome, one and all to the very first quizjection competition!

I will be posting a google form which will ask for your main nation, along with a multiple-choice question.

Whichever answer constitutes the minority, everyone who chose it will get kicked from the region(whether or not it was the correct answer).

[b]Day 2[/b]&#39;s results: Everyone picked No except for [nation]Opostite[/nation] who Picked Yes.

As much as I love pineapple on pizza, I&#39;m afraid concencus disagreed and ejected [nation]Opostite[/nation]

[b]Day 3[/b]&#39;s quiz is up!

Aside: Googling [i]is[/i] allowed, 2 nations were ejected from the competition due to lack of activity, sorry for the delay!


Good Luck!
