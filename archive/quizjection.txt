Welcome, one and all to the very first quizjection competition!

I will be posting a google form which will ask for your main nation, along with a multiple-choice question.

Whichever answer constitutes the minority, everyone who chose it will get kicked from the region(whether or not it was the correct answer).

[b]Day 3[/b]&#39;s results: Everyone picked 7 except for [nation]Clever Llamas[/nation] who Picked Infinitely Many.

[b]3 competitors left![/b]

[b]Day 4[/b]&#39;s quiz is up!

Aside: Googling [i]is[/i] allowed. Due to there being 3 competitors, 2 questions were asked. If there&#39;s no concencus on the first, the 2nd shall be the decider.

Good Luck!
