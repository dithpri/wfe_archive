Welcome, one and all to the very first quizjection competition!

I will be posting a google form which will ask for your main nation, along with a multiple-choice question.

Whichever answer constitutes the minority, everyone who chose it will get kicked from the region(whether or not it was the correct answer).

[b]Day 1[/b]&#39;s results: Everyone picked 79 except for [nation]Sweet Smile[/nation] who Picked 71.

Due to this [nation]Sweet Smile[/nation] is getting ejected from quizjection!

[b]Day 2[/b]&#39;s quiz is up!

Good Luck!
