Welcome, one and all to the very first quizjection competition!

I will be posting a google form which will ask for your main nation, along with a multiple-choice question.

Whichever answer constitutes the minority, everyone who chose it will get kicked from the region(whether or not it was the correct answer).

[b]Day 4[/b]&#39;s results: Everyone picked Yes except for [nation]Bruessau[/nation] who Picked No.
There was no concencus on the harry potter question, so the cinammon question was used.
[b]2 competitors left![/b]

[b]Day 5[/b]&#39;s quiz is up!

Aside: Googling [i]is[/i] allowed. Due to there being 2 competitors, 3 questions were asked. The first question to have a disagreement will be the decider. This will then be put to a poll in pacifica.

Good Luck!
