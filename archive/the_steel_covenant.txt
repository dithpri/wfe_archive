The Iron Pact is a brutal and unrelenting region composed entirely of dictatorship-style regimes, each vying for dominance while upholding the shared belief in absolute control, militarism, and the suppression of dissent. Governed by autocrats, warlords, and supreme leaders, the region stands as a bulwark against democracy, celebrating strength, order, and fear as virtues.

Every nation in the Pact enforces strict surveillance, cultivates a personality cult around their leader, and engages in propaganda-driven nationalism. Despite their ideological similarities, internal rivalries and power plays are common, though external threats often force temporary unity.
