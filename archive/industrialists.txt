The Industrialists are an alliance built on production, trade, and economic dominance. We prioritize industry and economic growth above all else, believing that a strong economy is the foundation of lasting power. Through efficient manufacturing, strategic resource management, and cooperation among our members, we turn industry into influence and prosperity. Where others chase conflict, we build the engines that decide the future.  

Steel, trade, and unity are our weapons&#151;and progress is our victory.
