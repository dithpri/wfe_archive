Exitus Acta Probat - The Result Justifies the Deed(s). Morality is subsequent to your own thoughts and desires. We&amp;#39;re not moral or unmoral. We are Non-moral. People change, governments change, people change....and so do morals. Whether your morals come from personal experiences, religion, politics, or a overly-paranoid thought process we all have them. but they do change, and to refuse that change makes you weak, makes it tough to survive. Here in Exitus Acta Probat, your morals are whatever they wish to be, there are no good ones, there are no bad ones, there are just those that you live with and feel happy to have.
