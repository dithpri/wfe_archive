[b]Das Imperium der Hartfelden has extended its traditional greeting in our faux-father (native for some) tongue.[/b]

[b][color=darkgreen]Our community strives to maintain a rich casual roleplay experience in all that we do, and be a positive force for spreading joy in the interregional community by exemplifying the good side behind the notion of a &#39;German region&#39;! Will you join us in standing by the Kaiser to show that the corruption of extreme ideologies can never defame what we strive to create here in Hartfelden?[/color]

We are not puppets to any belief. You cannot claim us. You cannot define us. In Treue fest!![/b]
