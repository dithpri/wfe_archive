[b]Die Imperiums von Hartfelden has extended its traditional greeting in our faux-father (native for some) tongue.[/b]

[b][color=darkgreen]Our community strives to maintain a rich casual roleplay experience in all that we do, and be a positive force for spreading joy in the interregional community! Will you join us in standing by the Kaiser to show that the corruption of extreme ideology can never defame what we strive to create here in Hartfelden?[/color]

We are not puppets to any belief. You cannot claim us. You cannot define us. F&uuml;r das Imperium stehen wir![/b]
