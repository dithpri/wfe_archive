[i]&#147;Zerphen gained complete control over the land that our empire once occupied, and used the only water source available to my people as ransom to protect Zerphen interests.

They&#146;ve done nothing other than turn us into their puppet, utilizing the water as a political weapon so our military would be at their beck and call.

It has been clear since the beginning, that any misstep, any order out of their agenda, they will withhold water from my people, from billions of my people.

We refuse to remain their servant, and will stand for this injustice no longer.&#148;[/i]
