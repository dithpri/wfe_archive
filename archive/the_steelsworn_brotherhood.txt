Camaraderie reigns and steel flashes in the perpetual warring states of The Steelsworn Brotherhood. Honor is treasured, and those who think as well as wage war are the ones who thrive. Though many wars are fought, the population never seems to decline, and there are many unadvanced nations (most battles are fought without gunpowder or modern technology). The nations, however, are perfectly fine this way. Their blood boils during a good battle, and afterwards they have a feast at the nearest mead hall.
