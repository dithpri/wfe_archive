Someone must be reading this. You should all join the region I&amp;#39;m currently in, [region]The Roman Empire SPQR[/region], and have fun again. I&amp;#39;ve been monitoring through Abstergo, and you all have essentially died. Why not have fun again? Regional roleplay for WA members, an elected council, and a regional map on the way, so why not?
