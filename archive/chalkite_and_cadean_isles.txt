A group of islands discovered by mainly English-speaking Welsh Pioneers. The largest islands are home to two countries: The colonists in the Welsh Kingdom of Chalkia, and the once tribal Principality and Cadea, who were not as technologically backward as first expected, and were able to fend off and later co-exist with the colonists.
