It brings together member states through the [b]Chief Wazir of Regional Command[/b] and the [b]General Secretary[/b] to coordinate efforts in politics, economy, culture, and humanitarian aid.

[u]By providing a safe-haven for Muslim nations from colonialist, Islamophobic and &#147;liberal&#148; (imperialist) saviour-complex adopted factions, the pact represents a historic step toward greater solidarity and collective influence among Muslim nations.[/u]
