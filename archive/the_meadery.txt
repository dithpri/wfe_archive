[b][u][color=purple]The Meadery[/color][/b][/u] is a place where everyone meets and discuss about everything. It is a place where beers are continuously being served. We welcome free and intellectual minds to discuss whatever they please whenever they please. Independence and Freedom is our motto and both are highly venerated by our loyal assembly of drunkards.[color=purple][b][u]DRINK ON!![/b][/u][/color] because [color=purple][b]Chugging[/b][/color] is our [color=purple][b]Regional Sport[/b][/color] and [color=purple][b]Cold Beer[/b][/color] our [color=purple][b]Regional animal.[/b][/color]
The [color=gold][b]Delegate[/b][/color] is chosen by the [b]people[/b]. The selected nation has to be a member of the [b]WA[/b] and the election for a new delegate happens by [b]POLL[/B]. The same process is effective for the [color=silver][b]President[/b][/color], [color=bronze][b]Secretary General[/b][/color] and [color=turquoise][b]Master of Liquors[/b][/color].
