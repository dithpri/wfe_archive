Walt Disney began his career in animation with the Kansas City Film Ad Company in Missouri in 1920. In 1922 Disney and his friend Ub Iwerks, a gifted animator, founded the Laugh-O-gram Films studio in Kansas City and began producing a series of cartoons based on fables and fairy tales. Now Disney uses its influence to control the mind of children so when they grow up they will join the Disney army.
Disney wants to own the world.
Disney wants to own the sun.
Disney want to own all life

You will be a part of Disney and there&#146;s nothing you could do to stop us. We are Disney. We are all.
