The Union of Independent Socialist Republics is a Titoist region of nations looking for their own destiny, un-influenced by larger foreign Socialist/Communist powers. If you&#39;re from the either the USSD or it&#39;s Enclave counter-part, before joining you must telegram the appointed Commissar of Border Control and allow them to question you. Here, you can be open with your expressions. You can have your own branches of Socialism/Communism, as long as your branch of Socialism/Communism is still Leftist and doesn&#39;t drift TOO far away from the original ideas and values of the Left you are welcome to stay here.
