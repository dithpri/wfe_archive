The Union of Independent Socialist Republics is a STRICTLY TITOIST region of nations looking for their own destiny, un-influenced by larger foreign Socialist/Communist powers. If you&#39;re from the either the USSD or it&#39;s Enclave counter-part, before joining you must telegram the appointed Commissar of Border Control and allow them to question you. If you DO enter WITHOUT being questioned by the Commissar of Border Control, you will be instantly kicked on sight. Or alternatively, if you do not meet our ideological standards of Titoism, you will be banned. We only want Titoists, Socialists/Communists who support the sovereignty of all Socialist/Communist nations away from the oppression larger Socialist/Communist superpowers.
