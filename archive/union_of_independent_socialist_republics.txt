The [b]Union of Independent Socialist Republics[/b] is a [b][u][color=red]Titoist[/color][/u][/b] region of nations looking for their own destiny, un-influenced by larger foreign Socialist powers. Before joining you must telegram the [b]Commissar of Border Control[/b] and allow them to question you. You can have your own branches of Socialism, as long as your branch of Socialism is still Leftist and doesn&#39;t drift TOO far away from the original ideas and values of the Left and remains within the scopes of practicality you are welcome to stay here.
