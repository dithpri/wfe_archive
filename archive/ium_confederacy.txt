Entirely just a region created for my own enjoyment.

A private region supposingly act as a nation in form of Confederation. The Confederation consist of several autonomous country/state.

The Confederation are isolated from the rest of the world. Confederation itself has no power over the countries/states that is part of it. For over thousands of years, the countries/states of confederation has no direct contact with the rest of world.

This limited contact with outside world bring a more hostility between the member. The occurance of war or conflict between member can be found through out history.
