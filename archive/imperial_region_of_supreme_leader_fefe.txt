All warfare is based on deception.
Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy&#39;s resistance without fighting.
If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.
Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.
The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.
The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.

Long Live FEFE
