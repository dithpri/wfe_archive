[color=black][b]The &amp;quot;German Democratic Republic&amp;quot;, or GDR, was a pseudo-socialist state that existed in the five easternmost provinces of the current BRD from 1948 to 1990. It was formed when the USSR made its occupation sector of Germany an &amp;quot;independent&amp;quot; state in 1948.[/color]

[color=red]The GDR was widely unpopular among its citizenry due to its totalitarianism and broken state-capitalist economy, and was noted abroad for the fact that it contrasted unfavourably with its Western neighbour.[/color]

[color=orange]The GDR was brought to an end in 1990 after several months of protest could not be quelled by the actions of the Party, and peaceful reunification with the BRD was brought about by referendum.[/color][hr][color=black][region]The Union of German Nations[/region] welcomes you to the GDR![/color][/b]
