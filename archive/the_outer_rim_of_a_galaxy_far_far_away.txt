The worlds of the Outer Rim do not answer to the Empire. We are ruled by the the Ewoks and the great Jabba the Hut. All hail his holy emperor Jabba! Our women are slaves and our men are indentured servants, our life is great! Long live the emperor, Coatee-cha tu yub nub! (Celebrate the Freedom)- Angel is the prime bounty hunter for Jabba, he actually killed Boba Fett in a fencing contest after disputing over how many cojones each of them had.
