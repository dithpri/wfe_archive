The disputed and tense border between New Lanucastra and Areyvia. Although the lines in the sand are clear as day, jingoism on both sides has set each other (and the area that a nuclear blast would reach) in a dangerous spot.

The border ranges from heavily fortified mountains and hot, arid sands. Truly showcasing the duality of the nations in question.
