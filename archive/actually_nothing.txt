A small r&amp;#822;e&amp;#822;i&amp;#822;g&amp;#822;o&amp;#822;n&amp;#822; region home to [nation]Switzerland-but Communist[/nation], it&#146;s basically isolation(isolated?). You&#146;re welcome to join and form a community, but Switzerland(-but Communist) won&#146;t care what you do, and will rarely join in. Have fun!
(Also a bit communist(/socialist) but whatever)
