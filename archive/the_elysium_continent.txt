A land of great plains with a large spanning coast. Temperate and tropical forests along its southern borders while grand rivers cut through the region, going from the northwestern snow-caped mountains to the eastern sunshine coast. Temperatures remain around even year-round which aids the farming and orchard regions while water is drawn out from natural rivers and springs.
Wilderness dominates a majority of the region which creates a landscape for hikers, campers, or tourists alike to enjoy. A peaceful and relaxing home for calm nations to call home.
