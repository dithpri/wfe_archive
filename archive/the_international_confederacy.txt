&amp;gt;THE INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERACY&amp;lt;

&amp;quot;Dramatis personae&amp;quot;

-The most reliable group of nations to trust, for TIC is heavily protected by a large wall around the region, with the entry needed to be handed by telegram, after a check-over of the nation desiring to enter TIC, of course. (password)
-The International Confederacy is increasingly free of all discrimination, although any nation of any thoughts-of-mind are allowed into our walls!
