Love, Peace, Unity, Brotherhood, Sisterhood, Kindness, Respect, Acceptance, Cherish, Care, Have Mercy, Pity others, Comfort. These are the truest of the truths of humanity.
I ask that ALL my brothers and sisters join me in this quest for one world, one cause, and one human spirit, diverse as we may seem.
We have this common link: not our inhabitance, which is obvious, but the fact that: We all have someone we love, we all have an opinion, a cause, a voice.
So, do not take this chance for granted and cast it aside, for, it will come back to you one day, in the end, and you will think, &quot;Man, if I had only taken that chance then, and not now, as I&#39;m about to die.&quot;
