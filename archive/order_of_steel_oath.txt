Situated year-round on the northern frontier, the Order is a military organization primarily dedicated to defending human civilization against the Aggeloi. It maintains a series of formidable fortresses and battlecarriers along the auroral north, serving as the first line of defense against any Aggeloid incursions. Their knights are known as Oathkeepers.
