The Slavic Association is a proud region based on the principles of Pan-Slavism and Slavic Unity. 

To join, contact the founder and request for residency and citizenship. 

This region was born out of the rubble and wreckage of Slavya, which much to our dismay, is being inflated by tens and tens of puppets. 

It continues to inflate, until one day, when it will pop like a balloon. 

LONG LIVE THE SLAVIC ASSOCIATION!
