[color=red][b]ATTENTION:[/b] All members are ordered to move to [region]United League of Nations[/region] and endorse [nation=short]Lantian Raiders[/nation]. Once there stay tuned as further orders may be issued.[/color]

Here we are merit based, the more you participate and the better you are, the higher you will advance in the Order. Everyone starts as a Squire before becoming a Knight, then a Master Knight. 

Join the World Assembly, otherwise you can&#39;t participate in raids!
