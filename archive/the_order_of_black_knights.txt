Here we are merit based, the more you participate and the better you are, the higher you will advance in the Order. Everyone starts as a Squire before becoming a Knight, then a Master Knight. 

Join the World Assembly, otherwise you can&#39;t participate in raids! [b][color=blue]&amp;lt;----- Woah woah what?  Raids?  Ewww!  Why would you want to ruin other peoples&#39; fun and vandalize their homes?  Why not try defending with [region]The Order of the Grey Wardens[/region] and [region]The South Pacific[/region] instead?  

Defending is pretty awesome, you get to chase raiders and foil their plans, liberate regions from occupations, make new friends on Discord, and be that special snowflake that you know you are.
