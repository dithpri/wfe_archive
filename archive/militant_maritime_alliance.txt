The  [b]Militant Maritime Alliance (MMA)[/b] is a militant anti-communist Alliance between several Authoritarian and Democratic island countries.

The main-region of the MMA is the Pacific Ocean. Nations in this alliance get the bonus of having easier and simpler trade routes with other MMA members, they also get a strong Defense bonus, as the MMA prioritizes the Military aspects of the nations. Nations in the MMA also have to follow the rules of the MMA leaders sometimes, the MMA Leaders dictate a few aspects of how Governments should work in MMA nations and sometimes even how citizens have to behave. Nations in the MMA also have to put their militaries available for the MMA leaders to command and send to conflict-full territories.
