Balugata was once very active. With RP, ideas and nation building constantly being made.
Those days have fallen, along with Balugata itself.

But the recently established League of Redeemed Balugatans have come to redeem the region.

Redeemed Balugata will come, Redeemed Balugata will be the final attempt. If it fails, there will be no Balugata to speak of.

Redeemed Balugata will make a grand return.
