Our region consists of a fiction universe taking place in an alternate timeline set [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture]20 minutes into the future[/url] (more accurately 2044). We have an emphasis on [i]realistic science fiction[/i], though expect to see gnostic cults and &quot;vampires&quot; bending the rules every once in a while.
