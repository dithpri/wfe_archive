[b]Welcome to Balugata.[/b] Our region consists of a fiction universe taking place in an alternate timeline set [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture]20 minutes into the future[/url]. We have an emphasis on realistic science fiction, though expect to see gnostic cults and &quot;vampires&quot; bending the rules every once in a while.

Active magistrates include [nation]Rohendia[/nation] and [nation]Kalaascovy[/nation].

If you&#39;re interested in joining the region or its fictional universe, or entering the discord chat for diplomatic purposes, contact any active magistrates about membership to either.
