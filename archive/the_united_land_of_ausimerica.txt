What&#146;s up y&#146;all. Me and some boys left the previous region of toxicity and the lack of coordination, to found something brilliant. This is new but the morals are there. We hope to have a friendly, role-playing community. We wanna take it slow so it is relaxed. If you are not on for an hour, you wouldn&#146;t miss much. Hope this is enjoyable for you, and have fun. We are active but don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re gonna miss much like previously stated

People from our embassy regions can talk and roleplay with us if they want.
