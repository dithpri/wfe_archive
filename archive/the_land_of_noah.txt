We are the Land of Noah, a wonderful place to be! We let everyone get as much power as they want, as long as they cooperate with me, the founder&#146;s guidelines. If you want to change anything you have to follow these guidelines: It has to be related to the Land of Noah and your country (my country, not the region), you have to ask permission from me first, and I have to accept it. We welcome anyone. Our mottoes are: &#147;We are Unblighted, Plighted, Ignited, Invited, Expedited, United&#148; and &#147;Diplomacy is Ecstasy&#148;.
