[color=green][b][i]Welcome to the Unitarian Union![/color] Land of the age-old Unitaria Currency and the powerful economic union. A place that had once been inspired by the European Union many years ago. The Unitarian Union is a Modern/Post modern-Tech Role-play focused region in which the players work together to perfect and achieve the goals of a global union. Will you be kind and peaceful, or warring and dangerous? The choice is yours. So don&#39;t be afraid! Come on in! Our arms are open to all and any nations of whatever creed. We are a small micro region for the time being, so please, enjoy the coziness![/i][/b]
