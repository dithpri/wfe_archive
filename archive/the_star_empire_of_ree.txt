&amp;quot;In a part of space where there are few rules, it&amp;#39;s more important than ever that we hold fast to our own. In a region where shifting allegiances are commonplace we have to have something stable to rely on. And we do. The principles and ideals of the Reeans. As far as I&amp;#39;m concerned, those are the best allies we could have.&amp;quot;
