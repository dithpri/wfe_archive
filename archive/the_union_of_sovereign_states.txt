A place for [color=blue]calm[/color], [color=green]casual[/color] people to get together and relax while playing the game

Direct all questions to [nation]Rivesleon[/nation], and I&amp;#39;ll get back to you ASAP

As of April 2015 [nation]Union of Soviet Comrades[/nation] is no longer active in the region.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy your stay
