The UIO is a conglomeration of nations with common interests looking to further their influece. A nation can be integrated as an oblast, which then allows the leader of said nation to hold political office, and help make their agenda clear in the region. The nation can also dedicate its forces to the Patriotic Vanguard, where it will then help engage in military operations against other regions.
