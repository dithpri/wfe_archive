We are the Alian Federation, a collection of nations exclusive to Alia College.

Requirements:
1. You must be a member of Alia College to join.
2. No prejudice (homophobia, xenophobia etc.)
3. Otherwise, free speech is completely allowed.
4. Nations may use whatever means they deem necessary to seize the Delegacy. They are the only democratic elections and shall be treated as such.
5. If you have a proposal for regional law, send it to Ukranas and I will write it up in official form. If it is passed by a majority it will become regional law.
6. Puppet nations are NOT allowed to vote on regional law (unless of radically different ideology to main nation). One player, one vote.
