This is a the Opposite End of the Galaxy. This place is under strict, anti-raiding control. Our boarders are extreme. Our people may not be the nicest, richest, most powerful people, but they sure know how to do what they do best; be part of a brilliant nation, and part of a fantastic region.

We may be small. We may be strict. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we aren&amp;#39;t powerful.
