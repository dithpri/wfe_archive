[b]Region Construction: ONGOING[/b]

[b]BATTLEFLEET GOTHIC[/b] is a newly-established region, styled after the titular Imperial Navy fleet from the lore of [i]Warhammer 40,000[/i]. We are dedicated to the aid and defense of any native regions who have been wronged by invading forces against their will. We are ready and willing to offer aid for those who request it, be it manpower, advice or even merely a shelter from the gameplay-fueled Warp Storms.

Please TG our Lord Admiral [nation]Battlefleet Gothic Command[/nation] for further information and inquiries.
