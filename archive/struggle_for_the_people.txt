[i][b]&#147;Be radical, have principles, be absolute, be that which the bourgeoisie calls an extremist: give yourself without counting or calculating, don&#39;t accept what they call &#145;the reality of life&#39; and act in such a way that you won&#39;t be accepted by that kind of &#145;life&#39;, never abandon the principle of struggle.&#148;[/b][/i]
