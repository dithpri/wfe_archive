[B]This is a memorial - A memorial to a once great region. CoF in it&amp;#39;s height reached over 300 citizens and with 1/3 of them being in the WA. After the deletion of Prophet [nation=short]Rifty[/nation] the commuity was forced to move elsewhere. We up and left - We moved to [region]The Association of Imperialism[/region]!

This region will ever be a landmark - and not a home. Free movement and discussion on the RMB is fine!We thank Leningrad for handing over the account to us so that we could make this memorial happen![/B]
