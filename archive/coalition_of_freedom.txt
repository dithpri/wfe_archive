[b][url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=290858][color=red]Why you should vote AGAINST the liberation of CoF! (click)[/color][/url][/b]

If your delegate votes against the liberation, you get a free embassy!

This region has been seized and secured by [nation=short+noflag]The LEningrad Union[/nation], with the assistance of independent updaters and the regions of [region]Madrigal[/region], [region]Sicarius[/region], and [region]The Black Riders[/region]. 

[B]All World Assembly nations are to endorse [nation=short]Matthew Hargreaves[/nation].[/B] Noncompliance [i]may[/i] result in ejection. This is a matter of [i][u]security[/u][/i], and [u]following the same methods used by the former delegate, [nation=short+noflag]Republic of South Carolina[/nation][/u], including applying a password where he lacked the influence to. Now that he has retired to TEK with the rest of the region, we shall finish the job.
