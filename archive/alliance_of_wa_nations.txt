We are a region that works hard to ensure equality in the WA. We work on taking power from the big nations and giving more power to the smaller nations. We have elections every month on the new cabinet. Everyone in this region must be a WA member. We will commonly submit proposals demeaning a world wide endorsement cap and one nation being limited to 100 votes at most.

WA Delegate- vacant
Vice WA Delegate- vacant
Scribe- vacant

ATTENTION, there will be no Senate until we surpass 40 citizens. Anyone who wants to apply for a position contacts A Greater WA and he will list you as a candidate.
