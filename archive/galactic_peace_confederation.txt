Welcome to the GPC! We are a region that is held together by a peace and trade treaty. The Council(which will be constructed after a few members join) will simply advise not govern. The only rule in the region is peace among fellow members. There will be no fighting within the GPC! There is no official religion. There is no official ideology. No nation within the GPC speaks for another. Your nation is your responsibility.
