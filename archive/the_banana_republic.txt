We&amp;#39;re sorry... if you&amp;#39;re looking for [region]The Banana Republic[/region], as in the prominent joke region that serves as comedy relief to all enemies of The Red Fleet, it is our duty to inform you that we do not exist. Because this region definitely isn&amp;#39;t real and what you&amp;#39;re seeing is probably an illusion of some sort, you probably weren&amp;#39;t looking for us in the first place - allow us to redirect you to whichever banana republic you&amp;#39;re seeking.
