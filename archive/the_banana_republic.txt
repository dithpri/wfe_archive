[color=red]Our listeners asked us,[/color] &amp;quot;Why is this region called the Banana Republic? Isn&amp;#39;t that a term meant to describe the failings of capitalism?&amp;quot;
[color=red]Our answer is,[/color] &amp;quot;Indeed, comrade, indeed - but [i]someone[/i] has to feed the Red Gor- er, Guerrillas, and [i]we&amp;#39;ve[/i] got their favorite food.&amp;quot;
