We&#39;re sorry... if you&#39;re looking for [region]The Banana Republic[/region], as in the prominent joke region that once served as comedy relief to all enemies of The Red Fleet, it is our duty to inform you that we don&#39;t exist. Because this region definitely isn&#39;t real and what you&#39;re seeing is probably an illusion of some sort, you probably weren&#39;t looking for us in the first place - allow us to redirect you to whichever banana republic you&#39;re seeking.
