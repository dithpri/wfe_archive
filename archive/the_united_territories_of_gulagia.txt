The United Countries of Gulagia is a coalition of different Gulagian countries to unite them all under a weak, yet ethnically strong, umbrella government. We plan to recreate the Gulagian Empire established by our forefathers, but instead with independent nations serving under one Confederation. 

We stand on three core tenets:
1. Unity
2. Freedom
3. Rights of the People
