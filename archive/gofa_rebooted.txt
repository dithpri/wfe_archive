After many years of living amongst the stars, many GOFAians were cast down from the sky, founding their own nations and working together to reach the edge of space once again.

THIS, is GOFA Rebooted.

Endorse [nation]Penguins With Guns[/nation] within your first 2 weeks here. Also, join the World Assembly. This region is intended for GOFA players current and past. Please notify me as to who you are within GOFA so I can make a note of it. Be yourself and try to keep RL politics down to a minimum. One last thing: work together. It&#39;s a large alliance.
