In the year 2044, the Rift was discovered in New Hampshire, Republic of Figu.  After exploring it, an alternate reality was discovered.  A reality with new friends and enemies.  Later studies discovered the Rift could be both manipulated and recreated, ushering in a new era of prosperity.  The Dimensional Pact was born from the alliance between the Republic of Figu and the Commonwealth of Reevenstein, although it is open to new members, if they are willing and ideologically compatible.
