O man, take care!
What does the deep midnight declare?
&amp;quot;I was asleep&#151;
From a deep dream I woke and swear:&#151;
The world is deep,
Deeper than day had been aware.
Deep is its woe&#151;
Joy&#151;deeper yet than agony:
Woe implores: Go!
But all joy wants eternity&#151;
Wants deep, wants deep eternity.&amp;quot;
