This region has been liberated by the Versutian Federal Army, in order to protect our allies from destruction.

Versutian military units are currently awaiting the return of the native government and its founder. If you are a returning native, please contact Minister of Defense [nation]Auriga[/nation].

Also, it would be appreciated if someone had a copy of the Carpe Diem flag.
