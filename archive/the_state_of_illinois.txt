By order of the Mayor of Chicago and his Aldermen, no nation calling itself a &amp;quot;Queen&amp;#39;s State&amp;quot; shall be admitted, neither shall the so-called &amp;quot;betale&amp;quot; be tendered for any debt, private or public. Furthermore, the people are to enjoy once again all traditional pass-times, including panhandling and mushroom hunting.
