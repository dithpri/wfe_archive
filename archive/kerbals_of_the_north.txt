Welcome to the Kerbals of the North!

This is a region inspired by Kerbal Space Program that is focused on space-related activities, including RP, discussion, and more.
Currently handing out positions to whoever joins (and can be trusted).

[b]FUTURE SPACE PROGRAM:[/b] Kerbals of the North is ready to start their own space program based on KSP RP-1! You can participate by submitting designs, coordinating launches, researching technology, and more! We will start once we reach ~5-10 members.
