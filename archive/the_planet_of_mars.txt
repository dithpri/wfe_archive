The Planet of Mars plays host to the Grand Conglomerate, a group of terrorists, drug dealers, smugglers, and other generally shady businesses that were expelled from Earth at the end of the Fourth Damascus War. They harbor a deep-seeded hatred of the New United Empire, and have allied themselves (rather loosely) with the Free Lands of Kor Dumain.
