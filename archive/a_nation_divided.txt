Welcome to A Nation Divided, as far as I know the only American Civil War Role Play Region on Nationstates! All are welcome here! Claim any state in the union or a European player in the Civil War and pick a side!

The primary belligerents of course are the Union and the Confederacy, but you can also play as one of the European nations that played a hand in the US Civil War as well!

(No one in this region supports the institutions of slavery or segregation, and racism is [b]strictly[/b] prohibited. This is supposed to be a region devoted to the history of the Civil War, and RPing based on that. Nations making racist comments will get one warning, and then will be ejected and banned from the region, at the discretion of the Founder)
