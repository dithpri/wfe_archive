[b]This disputed name planet is home to eight powerful and proud nations that are currently waging a political, economic and arms race with sporadic battles between them. Alliances between nations are rare and are only forged when both nations can take advantage of a situation.

Nobody ever knows what can happen tomorrow, if it will be another day like yesterday or the last of their lives.
