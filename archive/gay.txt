[color=blue]Welcome! Even if you are not gay, we can certainly make you happy.[/b] This is a safe haven for you to celebrate yourself and your community - disruptive people will be shown the door. 
We may have frank discussions of sexuality that are inappropriate for younger people.[/color]

[color=purple]Embassies: We usually don&amp;#39;t swap embassies with regions smaller than 10 nations or newer than 1 month, unless they are LGBT-centric.
