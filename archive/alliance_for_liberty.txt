The Alliance For Liberty (a.k.a. The Alliance or AFL) is a region for nations that want to focus on purely internal matters and don&#39;t give a damn about international politics. We accept pariahs of all ideologies, on condition, that they are inactive on the regional forum. Any foreign/regional activity may result in banjection. I guess. I don&#39;t care, I just want some peace and quiet here!
