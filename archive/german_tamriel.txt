[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region].

With speed and precision, no region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut. All shall tremble in fear at the sight of our wings and talons!

[nation=short]Christopher Bishop[/nation] led the whole party. [nation=short]MagentaFairy[/nation] had too much fun dancing whilst [nation=short]Ugnar[/nation] and [nation=short]Feniris[/nation] snickered in the corner whilst eating Snickers! [nation=short]Isle Of Hidden Freedom[/nation] came late as usual. We still gave him biscuits though!

Praise the Kaiser! Long live the Emperor! Glory to the King! [/b]
