The Pacific Alliance has recently been through dark times, due to lack of attention by certain leaders of nations in the region. I, Founder of Pacific Alliance, declare this era to be over. 
  
A new age has begun. Raiders have tried to make this region an &quot;advertisement&quot; for their own, enslaving people of the region. I hereby declare that we have permanently kicked them out and liberated our great region with intent to restore it to its former glory.

Today, on the 5th of July, 2017, I, Founder of Pacific Alliance, declare a new era begins. Today, we travel down the path to glory once more! Our nations will be proud to be of such a region again!
