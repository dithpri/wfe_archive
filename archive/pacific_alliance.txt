[b]The Pacific Alliance[/b] consists of numerous countries owned by several people, all banding together to protect each other from larger and more powerful ones. A diverse set of nations, they all trade with themselves to make each other stronger both militarily and economically.  All members may participate in the region&#39;s limited, democratic central government.

Crabs and cheese are banned, unless they are touching each other on our signature crab-and-cheese sandwich melt.
