[b][color=red]Namaste! Welcome to the Indian National Congress Party![/color][/b][hr][b][color=green]The Indian National Congress Party is devoted to the uplifting of Indians from all walks of life, be they a Hindu or a Muslim, a Dalit or a Brahmin. These barriers and sects are artificial divisions designed to increase exploitation and inequality for the prosperity of a few. The mission of INC is to mobilize the Indian people, and to give the marginalized a platform to tout their views to build a just, secular, and equal Bharat for all of us.[/color][/b]
