The Commonwealth of Imperial States (CIS, not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Independent States) is for monarchies that have an emperor. Whether that emperor is the mastermind or the figurehead. Whether the monarchy is absolute, constitutional, fascist, etc. We welcome everyone! (As long as you have an emperor)

We also plan to grow in size, for no particular reason. No reason at all.
