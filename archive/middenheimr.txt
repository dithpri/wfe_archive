A large region made up of several continents. Each continent belongs to its own nation, but is ruled over by the central continent known as the Spire Mountains. The Spire Mountains is home to the nation known as Middenheimr, hence the regions name. Despite it being founded by Hoperia, it is ruled completely by Middenheimr, and Hoperia is one of the four nations which sits adjacent to the Spire Mountains.
