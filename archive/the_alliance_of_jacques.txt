The Alliance of Jacques was founded in 1865 by [nation]bushsucks-istan[/nation] after the signing of the Beesel-is-kut treaty. Only the most important nations in Limburg were asked to join. These nations included [nation]reutje van roerdalen[/nation], [nation]oppe ruiver[/nation], [nation]anaalia[/nation], [nation]toastkingdom[/nation], [nation]diekdiek[/nation] and [nation]boftie[/nation].

The Alliance of Jacques was founded for two specific reasons: The elimination of Beesel and the complete destruction of Lidl. Chairman Geert Wilders said [i]&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Beesel and Lidl must be eliminated for the future of our people. Their cheapness and stupidity have terrorized our nations for too long!&amp;#39;&amp;#39;[/i]
