The Empire of Cosmopotalia has historically played a leading role in developing liberalism and democracy and in advancing literature and science. Created by a collection of diverse states and peoples ideologically and politically unified in the pursuit of a cosmopolitan world government, it sees itself as a proponent of promoting a Global Liberal Democracy across the globe, forging it&#39;s own culture from a melting pot of traditions and beliefs.
