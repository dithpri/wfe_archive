Great Turkestan was used to describe any place where Turkic peoples lived. The history of Great Turkestan dates back to at least the third millennium BC. Many artifacts were produced in that period, and much trade was conducted. The region was a focal point for cultural diffusion, as the Silk Road traversed it. Great Turkestan covers the area of Central Asia and acquired its &quot;Turkic&quot; character from the 4th to 6th centuries AD with the incipient Turkic expansion.
