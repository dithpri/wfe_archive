&#39;The land between the waters&#39;

An [color=red]individualist[/color] region that knows the fact it&#39;s human nature to be selfish, as our little animals here know it.

We like combat sports and other sports as well.

Anthropomorphic animals, aliens, robots with free will and the like reside here alongside humans, so you know.

We&#39;re not here to take part, we&#39;re here to take over.

The VOE Awards are awarded here through regional polls.
