A region about inclusiveness through division. Now you may be thinking, [b]what does that mean[/b], well it means that this region is all about debates with an open RMB, bi-daily polls, bi-weekly elections and killer robots! (wait, no... that&#146;s not right.) Either way, this is a great region to be a part of.

There are no qualifications to join.

I should also mention that posts that come off as racist, sexist, ageist, and hate against religion are banned.
