[color=red]&quot;Very well! I shall tell you! My goal is simple!&quot; 

&quot;To defend this land from any who wish to harm its denizens,  
 and to carve out, with my own two hands, a world where all nations can coexist!&quot;  

&quot;And to those who dare to impede my way, I shall destroy them with every ounce of my power!&quot;[/color][/spoiler]
