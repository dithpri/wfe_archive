Hello!
This region is supposed to be a place for refugees. We do, however, interview suspicious nations that may be against our cause.
Sometimes, we take back invaded regions, if we have enough coordinated nations.
We accept English, French, German, and Spanish messages as long as they&#39;re written with English translations.
I will write a dispatch about the rules.
