[b]Trick or Treat! Your region has been visited by some spooky scary soaring screeching shrikes from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] on their mission to find some candy for Halloween! They knocked on your region&#146;s door and said &#147;trick or treat!&#148;, but you were all out of candy! D: (since&#133;ya know&#133;it&#146;s November 3rd and all). The birds were upset by this bit of information, so they decided to play a trick on you instead! We hope you enjoy the new decorations! &amp;gt;:D
