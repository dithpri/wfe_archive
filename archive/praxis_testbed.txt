The Lady of the Forest has commanded us to go forth and seek her. Such was our quest and we willingly went forth. By many names she has been known: The Howler, the Keeper of Pacts, but we know her as Lorquinia. We seek the gifts that she has provided.

But sadly she is not in your region. [region]The Empire of Mare Nostrum[/region] bids you farewell.
