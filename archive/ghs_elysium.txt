[b][color=red]Hello and welcome to the once popular GHS Elysium!![/color]

[color=green]Created at Dalrawduel&amp;#39;s delcine, it became a safe haven for nations of Grissom regions. When Dalrawduel was finally stable again, most left GHS Elysium as they no longer needed it&amp;#39;s protection.[/color]

[color=red]Now GHS Elysium waits for when it is again needed, and for now is just an empty paradise.[/color]
