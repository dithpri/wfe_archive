Hello and welcome to the once popular GHS Elysium.

Created at Dalrawduel&amp;#39;s delcine, it became a safe haven for nations of Grissom regions. When Dalrawduel was finally stable again, most left GHS Elysium as they no longer needed it&amp;#39;s protection.

Now GHS Elysium waits for when it is again needed, and for now is just an empty paradise.
