[b][color=green]Hello [/color][color=blue]and[/color][color=green] welcome to GHS Elysium!!
&amp;quot;Grissom&amp;#39;s Fighting free zone!&amp;quot;
[/color]
[color=green]Created at [/color][color=yellow]Dalrawduel&amp;#39;s[/color] [color=green]decline, it became a safe-haven for[/color] [color=pink]nations[/color] [color=green]of Grissom regions. When Dalrawduel was finally stable again, most left GHS Elysium as they no longer needed its protection.[/color]

[color=green]Now GHS Elysium waits for when it is again needed, and for now is [/color][color=purple]just[/color] [color=green]an almost empty paradise.[/color]

[color=green]If you have any [/color][color=pink]concerns[/color],[color=green] questions, or wish to join, Please telegram the founder.
