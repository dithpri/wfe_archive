[b][color=green]WELCOME TO[/COLOR] [COLOR=gold]GHS ELYSIUM[/COLOR][COLOR=BLUE], THE ETERNALLY NEUTRAL SAFE HAVEN [/COLOR][COLOR=orange]OF THE GRISSOM REGIONS![/COLOR]

[COLOR=PINK]FOUNDED DURING A DARK TIME IN [REGION]DALRAWDUEL[/REGION]&amp;#39;S HISTORY, IT BECAME A REGION UNIQUE FOR ITS AVOIDANCE OF ARGUMENTS AND CONFLICT. DURING THE GREAT GRISSOM WAR, IT SERVED AS A SAFE HAVEN, PROVIDING SHELTER FOR ALL NATIONS WHO WISHED TO AVOID BEING A PART OF THE WAR (AND EXPELLING MULTIPLE RAIDERS ALONG THE WAY).[/COLOR] 

[COLOR=PURPLE]NOW, DESPITE ITS LACK OF CONSTANT ACTIVITY, GHS ELYSIUM CONTINUES TO SERVE AS A PEACEFUL, NEUTRAL REGION, RULED BY ITS BENEVOLENT DICTATOR, EMPRESS MADELINE.[/COLOR]

[COLOR=GREEN]IF YOU WISH TO ENTER THE REGION, THEN YOU ARE WELCOME! BUT BE AWARE THAT ARGUMENTS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED, AS THIS IS A PEACEFUL REGION.[/COLOR][/b]
