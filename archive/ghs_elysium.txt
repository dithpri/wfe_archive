[b][color=White]Hello and welcome to the once popular GHS Elysium!!
We are experiencing a[/color] [color=grey]Blizzard[/color][color=white]!

Created at Dalrawduel&amp;#39;s decline, it became a safe-haven for nations of Grissom regions. When Dalrawduel was finally stable again, most left GHS Elysium as they no longer needed its protection.

Now GHS Elysium waits for when it is again needed, and for now is just an empty paradise [/color] [color=grey] in progress [/color][color=white].

2 time defeater of Black Rider invasion takeover attempts here: Miss Fantastica Madelina (our fabulous founder).
