[b][color=Blue]Hello and welcome to GHS Elysium!!
&amp;quot;Grissom&amp;#39;s Fighting free zone!&amp;quot;
The region is in PBSD but will be ready to move on soon[/color]

[color=green]Created at Dalrawduel&amp;#39;s decline, it became a safe-haven for nations of Grissom regions. When Dalrawduel was finally stable again, most left GHS Elysium as they no longer needed its protection.[/color]

[color=red]Now GHS Elysium waits for when it is again needed, and for now is just an almost empty paradise.[/color]

[color=Purple]If you have any concerns, questions, or wish to join, Please telegram the founder.
