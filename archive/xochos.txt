Xochos Region was originated from the Armed Republic of Xezen, who created the region with his country in a unclaimed territory that was mostly made of forest and plains. The idea of the region is to provide newcomers an new region that has a strong dictator influence that isn&#39;t all necessary for everyone to develop. This region&#39;s main goal is to establish a stable system of support and governing countries who are willing to help defend, resource and manage the region&#39;s aspects in all forms. Some examples of how that is enforced are: Socialist tea drinkers, dictatorships, and normal socialists.
