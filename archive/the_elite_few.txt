The Elite Few is a region that is run by the three nation&amp;#39;s that founded it and we vote on each important issue. In the case that one of the founders is not present at the time of the vote another nation shall be asked to step in for the time being. If two of the founders are not present for the vote it shall be put aside for the time being and a more proper time for the vote will be chosen.
