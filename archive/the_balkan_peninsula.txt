The Balkans are a group of countries in Southeastern Europe with a bloody history. The current borders of each country are used except where requested. This region is mostly casual with a focus on RPs, and it&#39;s preferable that we not get involved in R&amp;D mechanics. If you want a spot on the map, please post your request on the RMB and our cartographer will be happy to help!
