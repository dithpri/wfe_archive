Internet Cafe is meant to serve as a casual environment for all nations to socialize in as well as a gaming hub for players to meet up on discord and participate in regional gaming events such as our weekly game nights. Grab a cup of coffee, take a seat in one of our leather chairs, and engage with others in the RMB and regional discord!

We also have plans for a dynamic regional RP on our discord. Its setting will take heavy inspiration from MMOs and a mix of cyberpunk and zombie apocalypse themes.
