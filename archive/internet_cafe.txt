[i]Comfort, connection, communication. Take a break from all the politics and war with a warm cup of caramel macchiato coffee and free wifi.[/i]

This region serves as a casual hub and social grounds for all nations. Grab a cup of coffee, sit in one of our comfortable leather chairs, and connect to our free, high-speed wifi. Engage with others in the RMB or hang out in the (not yet open) regional Discord. 

All regions are welcome to establish embassies. However, everyone in the RMB and discord must be respectful towards each other.
