In Ocean Haven everyone has the same rights.
While Svedlandia may be &amp;quot;in charge&amp;quot; they are just as equal as any other nations joining this region. 
We value equality and fairness. We do not discriminate against ideology, politics, or even the way you treat your own citizens. We only ask that you treat each other with the same respect and fairness that you are treated with.
