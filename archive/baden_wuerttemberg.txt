[color=black][b]Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg is one of Germany&amp;#39;s 16 [i]Bundesl&auml;nder[/i], located in the county&amp;#39;s south-west. Unlike some other [i]L&auml;nder[/i], it is actually a composite of two previous states, Baden and W&uuml;rttemberg, both of which were parts of the Holy Roman Empire.[/color]

[color=red]The history of the state itself only begins in 1952, after three post-WWII occupied zones, two French and one American, voted for unification. From them the state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg came into being.[/color]

[color=orange]Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg&amp;#39;s capital is Stuttgart, with other notable cities including Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-Baden, Karlsruhe and Ulm. It is currently governed by the Greens and the SPD.[/color][hr][color=black][region]The Union of German Nations[/region] welcomes you to Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg![/b][/color]
