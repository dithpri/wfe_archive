      This small but growing Union is currently ruled by the leader/ president of Costa Da Europa, Michael A. Ruela. The The Western Coastal Union of Africa is currently trying to grow economically and politically due to it&#39;s almost sad economy and little political freedom in the world. The Union is due to become one of the world&#39;s most powerful though, so many other regions are slowly and cautiously watching the region/ union. Thpugh some nations in the region are quite beautiful, many others are quite not. The national animal&#39;s vary between the countries, from a boa constrictor to red-tailed hawk.
