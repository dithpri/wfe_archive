Lo! [region]The Black Hawks[/region], with wings of might, did cast a [color=#FFD700]golden apple[/color] into your land.

Verily, the apple&amp;#8217;s inscription was never in question, for who else could&#39;ve been a better candidate? Your[i] [color=purple]oh-so-raidable-region[/color][/i] was the most deserving, so instead of leaving you a decade-long war, the eristic raiders left you this!
