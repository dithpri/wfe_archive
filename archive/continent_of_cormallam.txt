[b]WELCOME TO THE CONTINENT CORMALLAN[/b]

This is a fantasy themed region.

Technology should be somewhere in between 1900 - 1942 so nukes, tanks, etc are not allowed.

Zeppelins, warships, rifles, etc are allowed.

You may also be allowed to create your own inventions but do not try to use this as an excuse to invent tanks and nukes.

You must also come to me with your invention before actually using it in roleplays.

If you want inspiration then go watch Attack on Titan.

You can also try and create your own creatures&#133;

Yeah I guess it&#146;s more simpler to say this region is Attack on Titan themed.
