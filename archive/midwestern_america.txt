Formed from the 2nd American Civil War, the Union of Socialist States of Neo Western America (USSNWA) is a federal socialist republic operating towards communism. All regions are autonomous federal regions based on the former states found in what was the American Midwest. Each region holds a officer position. Every November 1st the USSNWA celebrates independence from the USA. This region is only reserved for the Union of Socialist States of Neo Western America (USSNWA). 

The exception being states seeking protection must apply for Autonomous Protectorate Status. Nations who do gain entry to the region for protectorate status must obey every decision made by the USSNWA for regional security.
