[b]Welcome to Disputatio![/b] (Disputatio = Latin for debate).

[b]Here you may come to portray your views on events, current issues, opinions, anything you like! Feel free to offer a topic of discussion, leave a statement, reply to an argument made, or contribute to an ongoing debate. All we ask is that you remain active, one man debates can be boring!

[u]Please don&#39;t make any personal attacks, and try to keep your debate topics as politically related as possible (we&#39;d rather not discuss the quality of the last album produced by a teenage heart-throb band).[/b][/u]
