East Ixeral is the name given to a Large Island situated 163 miles away from the nearest continent and 123 miles away from West Ixeral. East Ixeral was discovered in the 16th century A.R. by the great explorer Max Winillion and was subsequently colonized by 3 different nations. Following a period of decolonization 3 centuries later, 6 major nations were established across the island which quickly devolved into war, culminating in a 12-year period of conflict. Following the end of the conflict, the two major countries were split up into several large nations, including the largest, Laisvia.
