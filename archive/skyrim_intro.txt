Hey, you. You&#146;re finally awake.
You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
Damn you, Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.
If they haven&#39;t been looking for you, I could have stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell.
You there, you and me, we shouldn&#39;t be here. It&#146;s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
We&#146;re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
