The concept of lust, or excessive desire for pleasure, is not a new one. It has been a part of human nature since the dawn of time. Lust is often depicted as one of the seven deadly sins in various religious texts, and it is believed that excessive indulgence in lust can lead one down the path of damnation. In the second level of hell, those who have succumbed to their carnal desires in life are doomed to an eternity of punishment and suffering.
