[b][color=green]Welcome to the Bright Pacific Coast![/color][/b]



As you may have guessed, the founders of this region are still relatively new to NationStates, however we can provide some role-playing information about the region:

-It is home to diverse climates and terrains, from cold mountain peaks to warm beach shores.

-The founders (Montimper, Key Pyru) are right-leaning, however all sets of views are allowed within the region. Diversity is great, after all.

-Activity is not strictly enforced, you may roleplay at your own pace.
