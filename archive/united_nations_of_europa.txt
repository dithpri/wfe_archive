Welcome to a region guided by reason, not fear.
Here, nations unite to protect peace and face conflict with discipline and respect.

Every dispute is seen as a duty &#151; a chance to act ethically, wisely, and politically strong.
Where others divide, we seek understanding.
Where others choose force, we choose diplomacy.

Peace is not weakness. Peace is power.
