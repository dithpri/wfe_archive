Lands Beyond the capability of being thought of as Reality, Unreality, Imaginable, Unimaginable, Theoretical, Nontheoretical, Unphysical, Metaphysical, Pataphysical, Useful or Useless set. It not only contains all of existence, but infinite variations of an infinite set of &#39;concepts&#39; completely different from existence. Attempts at explaining how something exists beyond these lands are retroactively nullified; by placing something &quot;beyond&quot; or &quot;outside&quot; it, the very fact that the object/verse/being holds properties at all at all places it inside these lands. All permutations of logic are in these Unknown Lands, and it also contains an infinite number of copies of itself.
