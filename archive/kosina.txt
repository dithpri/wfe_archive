Kosina - A world of animals, war and famine.

Here, you are a resettler of Kosina. The Great Famine, over hundreds of years ago, murdered the nations and societies of Kosina, yet, resilient individuals chose to grasp at life. You, and your people, must bring a nation back from the ashes, or light the fires of a new nation.

Will you breathe new life into Kosina, or send Kosina into a cycle of death and war?
