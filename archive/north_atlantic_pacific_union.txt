Welcome to the North Atlantic Pacific Union. 

We accept nations from everywhere, the name just hasn&#39;t been updated since it&#39;s traditional founding. Original it was traditionally founded by Eagland Official and Kayland official when diplomatic relations started.

Technically NAPU was founded in 1962 when the two countries allied due to Communist revolution in Kayland. Than after the fall of the CRE and Communist Kayland the alliance continued as before but being changed to an Organisation that supports and protects democracy.
