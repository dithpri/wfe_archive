Welcome to the North Atlantic region! We are a small group in the north Atlantic. We realistically roleplay countries and you may create landmasses on the main map with the admin&#39;s permission. We really hope to have you and if you have any questions, direct them to the leader of the NAR, Lightlin0 (but call it Lightlin, names suck).
