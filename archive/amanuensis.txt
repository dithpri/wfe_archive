[b]Welcome, journeyer to the glorious worlds of [region]Amanuensis[/region]![/b] Our countless worlds are filled with sweeping vistas and expansive frontiers, and our open ended region has infinite capacity for new members, and new worlds to be discovered. In terms of infrastructure, our region is governed by an [color=red]Autarch[/color], two [color=red]Regents[/color], and a series of [color=red]Diplomats and Subjects[/color].

Amanuensis currently is lacking governmental positions and other infrastructural necessities. This region will be made public once it is completed.

Approved by His Majesty The Autarch

**In terms of RP, it is planned that the RMB and all regional affairs will only be RP
