An environmentally diverse region composed primarily of coastal rainforest and mountainous highlands. Several islands both large and small bolster the total available land. Currently, the entire region is considered sovereign territory of The United Kingdom of Nevarran, by its own decree. However, Nevarranian borders only cover a small portion of the region. Internationally, it is speculated that a militarily ambitious country could attempt to expand into the area, but would most certainly have to fight for it. Recently, one of the larger offshore landmasses was colonized of The United Kingdom of Nevarran, and is still in its developmental stages.
