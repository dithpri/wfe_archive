Welcome to Dexus, I was a member of a raiding region, until they raided The Embassy, an iconic staple of Nationstates. 
After that event, I decided to form a new region, an alliance against such actions. We are the Allied Forces of Dexus, and we are going to stand against raiding regions. Eventually I hope we grow large and strong enough to aid in the liberation of regions being held hostage. 

When we grow enough, we will hold elections to give each nation a say in who runs the region, and give everyone an opportunity to be an influential part of our alliance.
