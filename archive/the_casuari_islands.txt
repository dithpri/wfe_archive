These islands have been isolated from the rest of world for many years due to a cartographical error.  Despite this, the natives managed to surpass the level of technology of the rest of the world due to a unique resource: magic.  The caves of the Casuari islands are filled with enchanted gems that, once the natives managed to tap into, allowed them to progress at an amazing rate.  Most of the technology is designed to channel the magic into usable forms, thus allowing it to perform impossible tasks.

The islands are home to many varied species of animal, such as cassowaries, cats, and ducks, as well as many unique animals.  Many nations live in harmony with these animals.
