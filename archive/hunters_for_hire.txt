Hello and Welcome to Mercenary Central, the Mercenary Militia: Hunters for Hire!!

A little bit about us: Born out of a raider&#39;s boredom, he decided to make things more interesting. Out of this was born HUNTERS FOR HIRE.

If you can convince us well enough to go to your region, we will either support the raid, or if you are really good with words, we may even defend! We can also spy on other regions if you wish. We will [b]not[/b] support in RP, however

Please endorse the ROs if they have their WAs moved to them.

[b]REQUESTS[/b]: Closed! They will re-open on Sunday.

Current Orders:
Create a puppet if you don&#39;t have one already
Chill out here for the time being, no orders currently!


Thank you, and remember, [b]Honor is Your Duty[/b]
