[b]Aeterna Regnum is an ancient, mist-shrouded sovereign domain spanning the frost-bitten reaches of the North. It is a land defined by its rigid Monarchical traditions and its deep, primordial connection to the Magical arts. Founded upon the principles of Sanguis Frigidus (Cold Blood), the region serves as a sanctuary for the undying nobility and the magically gifted.[/b]
