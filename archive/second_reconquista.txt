[B]The Order of the [region]Second Reconquista[/region][/B] has been founded with the aim of retaking lands from the grip of Islam.

The Christians of the World are called to take upon the task of the 2nd Reconquista- the final Holy War for God&amp;#39;s Earth. No more will Europe suffer in the hands of its foreign invaders. No more will the Christians be prosecuted for following the teachings of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Today we ask you to join our ranks, and to help your brothers in sweeping this world clean of the filth that is Islam.
