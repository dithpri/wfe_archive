Glory to Arstotzka. 

Helljumper, helljumper, where have you been?
Feet first into hell and back again
When I die please bury me deep
Place an MA5 down by my feet
Don&amp;#39;t cry for me, don&amp;#39;t shed no tear
Just pack my box with PT gear
&amp;#39;Cause one early morning &amp;#39;bout zero-five
The ground will rumble, there&amp;#39;ll be lightning in the sky
Don&amp;#39;t you worry, don&amp;#39;t come undone
It&amp;#39;s just my ghost on a PT run
Gory, glory, it&amp;#39;s the way we live
Gory, glory, it&amp;#39;s the way we die
And he ain&amp;#39;t gonna jump no more
