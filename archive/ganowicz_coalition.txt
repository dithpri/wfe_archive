A brave Polish soldier was once asked what if felt like to kill people. He responded.
&#147;I don&#146;t know, I&#146;ve only killed communists.&#148;
His name was Ganowicz, who this region is named after.

In memoriam of those who dedicated their lives to fighting commies, this region has been formed. We will not stand to see their efforts be in vain on this site and now the Ganowicz Coalition has been assembled to fight communism.

The Ganowicz Coalition is an alliance for patriots to stop the threat and spread of communism. If you are interested, see the dispatch below or contact one of our officers.
