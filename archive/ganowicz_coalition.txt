[b]Welcome to the Ganowicz Coalition[/b]
 
A brave Polish soldier was once asked what if felt like to kill people. He responded.

[i]&#147;I don&#146;t know, I&#146;ve only ever killed communists.&#148;[/i]

His name was Ganowicz, whom this region is named after.

In memorial of those who dedicated their lives to fighting communism, this region has been formed. We will not stand to see their efforts be in vain, and now the Ganowicz Coalition has been assembled to fight communism.
The Ganowicz Coalition is an alliance for patriots to stop the threat and spread of communism. If you are interested, see the dispatch below or contact one of our officers.

Note: In order to maintain neutrality and openess, we will no longer accept embassies from regions other than the Embassy.
