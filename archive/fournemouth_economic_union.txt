The Fournemouth Economic Union was officially established on the 10th anniversary of the kingdom&#39;s division. A grand ceremony in the former capital symbolized the union of the two nations, with leaders signing the Fournemouth Economic Accord in the presence of citizens, dignitaries, and international observers.

The FEU was structured to maintain the political sovereignty of the Democratic Peoples Republic and the Republic of Samurais while enabling economic integration and cooperation. A governing council, comprising representatives from both nations, was formed to oversee the implementation of union policies and ensure equitable benefits for all members.
