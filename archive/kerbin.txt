Welcome to Kerbin, the go to region for KSP nations! Here you will find our leaders mostly out in space, crashing into a planet, or inside of an aircraft ripped apart by the new Aero model.

PLEASE NOTE:
This region is currently under restructure and restarting. Once a sufficient number of active members have joined (Even just three or four would do), a map, regional govournment, regional RPs, and maybe even an offsite forum will be constructed.

All nations are welcome here, KSP or not, however if you do join and you aren&amp;#39;t KSP based be ready to deal with a little Kerbal antics and some space based roleplays (We may also do some RPs that are actually done using a shared savefile. TG me if you want to do that!)
