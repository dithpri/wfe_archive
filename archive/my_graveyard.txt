Welcome to my Graveyard! This region is home to a very important organisation - please read the dispatch below. Due to organisational as well as practical reasons, the region will remain quiet for between three to five months, though hopefully no one will cease to exist! Telegrams can still be sent and they will be replied to by at most the first of the next month.
