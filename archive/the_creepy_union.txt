The creepy union is a combination of similar, but also very different countries. Our goal is to rise in power, and ultimately rule the world. The Inquisition of Skulley makes sure that we stay free from heretics and other unwanted elements of society. Our armies are always ready to defend their home countries to the death, and our weapons technology is superior to many. Our people are hard working and loyal, even though most of them have very few basic human rights. Our chili plantations produce the meanest of all chilis. Our borders are protected by legions of towering mechs, that are equiped with our latest weapon technology.
