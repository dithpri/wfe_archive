[color=green]We are a Greek-inspired fledging new region striving to make an influence on NationStates and to simulate a modern-age Greek Empire. The benefits of joining us are getting administrative roles and being the admins of a great region in the long run!

We accept all types of governments, as long as you follow the rules.

If you want to be a part of the clergy, a heliast (judge), archon (executive secretary), a councilor in the Areopagus (council), maybe even be part of the nobility, in the near future, or join our army and crush the enemies, or role-play till you drop, and make a mark in NationStates, then join and be a citizen[/color][color=blue][b]THE NEW HELENNIC EMPIRE[/color][color=red] NOW!!![/b][/color]
