[b]FROM THE OFFICE OF HIS INDEFINITE HOLY REGENCY: REGENT ALEXANDER CLARENCE:[/b]
&quot;Well well, another day, another region to take control of via refounding it and exploiting whatever past nations have left it behind. As you can see, we take over ceased-to-exist regions no matter how big or small.&quot;
[hr]
This region is a [b]Forge Region[/b], nothing but factories, more factories, and factories.
Praise the regent.
