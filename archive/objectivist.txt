This is a region founded on the principles of the novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand.

The ideal nation is a constitutional republic with a separation of economy and state.

Let&amp;#39;s create a strong region held together by free trade and the rational self-interest of rights-respecting nations.

[i]&amp;quot;The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities.&amp;quot;[/i]
- Ayn Rand
