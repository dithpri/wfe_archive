I came into work yesterday to find a box sat on my desk. The address and label had been completely scribbled over in black marker pen, and it was impossible to tell from what was left where it had originally been sent to. It didn&#146;t matter, though, because on top of it, written in my handwriting with a vicious precision I&#146;ve always lacked, were the words: &#147;Return to Sender&#148;.
