     A treaty was struck in the mists of war, written with the blood of those fallen before these mighty war-machines; collective ideas of this brotherhood forged an alliance of unparalleled power and strength. They have come to be known as &amp;quot;The Legion&amp;quot;...This supreme entity now rests upon the threshold of limitless power; through simple words, they control entire nations. Through their words nations rise, and nations fall. Those who are under &amp;quot;The Legion&amp;quot; solely ask how they might better serve it. Those who oppose &amp;quot;The Legion&#148;&#133; well...they have yet to learn how to serve.
