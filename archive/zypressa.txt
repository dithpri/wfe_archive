A large continent; wide, open plains in the southern third (dotted with many ancient mounds and ruins from a bygone era) with numerous small and rocky islands nestled together near the mainland. The midlands consist of multitudes of snaking highlands and valleys, carved out over millennia by the great Aurelian River system and its tributaries, whose delta cradles the great city of Andersmoor, capital of Andrexium. The northern half of the continent is filled with vast, huge mountain ranges, including the peak of Mt. Tiberium, towering high above the clouds.
