Jer i Sakkah is the Sakkaryz name for [i]&quot;Land of the Sakkah,&quot;[/i] home to a nomadic and pastoralist people who traverse the area between the depths of the Issyk Kul, and the beaches of the Kapchagay. It is bordered to the east by the beginning of the Tian Shan mountains, and to the west by the endless plains, home to the Wusan, Kazakh, Ladra, and other peoples who live a similar lifestyle to the Sakkah. In the summer, when needed, the Sakkah tribes migrate northward to the shores of Lake Balkhash, letting their horses drink in the waters and letting the pastures in their home regrow.
