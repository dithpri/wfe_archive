The Basalt deltas is composed largely of basalt and blackstone. Its fog appears in a dull lilac color with ash particles passing by. Archipelagos with islands of different sizes can be found around the lava seas nearby.

Nether fortresses and caves filled with nether quartz ore can also be found here. Ore generates more commonly (to compensate for less netherrack to generate in).

Bastion remnants do not generate here.
