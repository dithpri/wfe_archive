[color=blue]Welcome to the Valley of the Strong, on the outskirts of a bigger empire.
[b]THE FANTASIAN EMPIRE[/b]. We&amp;#39;ve been loyal to this empire for years and won&amp;#39;t betray it.
The reason we refuse to betray him is he is stronger and is my best ally.
We count on this empire, somewhat.[/color]
