Welcome to The Socialist Athevian States:

Due to the Civil War that torn up the States, leading to the Socialist Parties takeover of the government, the Region will be under control completely under the rule of President Intilim of Athevia until further notice. After the Region begins to stabilize, Elections will occur to select a President and officers of the Region, as well as a WA Delegate.

Thank you for compliance.
