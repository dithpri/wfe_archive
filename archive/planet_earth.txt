Planet Earth is the third and the only terrene planet in [region]Sol System[/region]. It is the homeworld of Humanity, the root of the Terran Civilization in Galaxy. It is the capital of the [region]Human Systems Federation[/region], and of the whole Macrocosm. The first planet created in reality, by God. There he made the Human beings in his image, which made the planet very special and most holy. However, the present Earth is corrupted; wickedness filled it, for Satan, the Supreme Evil and deceiver, rules the world that evolved upon it. A new Earth, together with the New Universe, is to be created soon, in perfection and righteousness, which means all things will be cleansed and renewed, soon after all things are judged in front of the Omnipotent God.
