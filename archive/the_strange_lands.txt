Who knows, they are strange...

Okay setting for weird dystopian universe I am crafting through my alts, the spearhead of this initiative is [nation]Eulasira[/nation] which is also an alt, ironically. The [region]Badlands Frontier[/region] is canon to us, does not apply vica versa. If you would like to stop by, please do! There is no password, but I beckon that no one will want to engage themselves in this weird dystopian universe.
