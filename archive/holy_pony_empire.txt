The Holy Pony Empire represents the pinnacle of social achievement and governance.  A perfect utopia, HPE would make George Orwell proud as its citizens rise to power over the petty squabbling of which Twilight series book is worse, if Obama is really black or if there is indeed intelligence life still on Earth.
