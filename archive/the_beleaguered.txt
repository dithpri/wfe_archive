The Beleaguered is a small, peaceful region. It was founded October 13, 2015. Its founding nation, Militant Canadia, has experienced firsthand the effects of other corrupt regions. Infiltrations, infighting, and inbreeding has led to the collapse of many regions. But these problems will not plague the members of The Beleaguered. Instead, with cooperation and good spirits, this region shall rise to its true place among the greatest in the world.
