The Christian Amalgamation is a region based off of traditional Christian values and supports Christian nations to join the region and thrive from inside the region&#39;s borders. Technically anyone can join for there is no password set in place, however if you are not a Bible believing Christian you will immediately be kicked out of the region and banned. No we will not just kick out someone because of their views on immigration or the president or anything else politically for we support free speech and want this region to be filled with a community of questions, discussions and debates. If you want to participate in such a thing just go down to the regional message board and start talking. Please consider CA as your new regional home.
