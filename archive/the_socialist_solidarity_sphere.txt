The SSS is a loose confederation of socialist nations united by a shared commitment to social equality, economic justice, and collective progress.

The region was founded in 6/8/2025 at exactly 11:11pm, with the signing of the Solidarity Pact, a document outlining the principles of cooperation and mutual support among member nations. Since then, the Socialist Solidarity Sphere has grown to encompass a diverse range of nations, each with their own unique culture, history, and contributions to the region.

The Solidarity Sphere is a beacon of hope for a more just and equitable world, where nations work together to build a better future for all.
