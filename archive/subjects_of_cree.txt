[i]Who let a bunch of untrained magical students run an entire geopolicial region?[/i]

We&#39;re a roleplaying region associated with a family of RPing Discord servers. You&#39;re invited if you happen to be part of these servers.

For the most part, the region consists of a bunch of students with varying magical talents Trying Their Best to run a country, with varying mixes of IC and OOC chatter.
