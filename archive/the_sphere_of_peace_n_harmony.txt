[b]SUBSIDIARY OF THE [region]TRADE FEDERATION[/region][/b][hr]

[b]A region that once had a surge of members at its peak, this region is now in the hands of the [region]Trade Federation[/region].[/b]

Old WFE:
[i]&amp;quot;When a Nation is in trouble we will be there&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;When Love has gone we will be there&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;When life takes its turns we will be there&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;When the world is at war we will be there&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;When you take a Sphere and add peace n harmony we will be there&amp;quot;
The question is why aren&amp;#39;t you?

IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO ALREADY, please endorse the current WA Delegate (which is presently peace republic). Doing so increases the &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot; of the SPHere&amp;#39;s vote in the WA.
