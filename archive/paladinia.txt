If you are a Paladin, welcome. We have one rule though. [b][u]Having a positive opinion of anything related to Russia is banned.[/b][/u] Any nation that considers violating this rule will be nuked to oblivion in literally anything related to their country, until their nation gets so rekt that they completely get removed from the space-time continuum and find themselves all ended up in the 57th layer of hell burning until eternity. This operation will be carried out by The Great Nations of [nation]Sindika[/nation], [nation]Mokissos[/nation] and [nation]Shotoyn[/nation]. :)
