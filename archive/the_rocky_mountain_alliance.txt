With the fall of America in 2132, society fell in the regions north of Mexico. In an attempt to reestablish order, the Federal Republic of West Larimer was formed in the region that was the Front Range of Colorado. Shortly after, other nations were formed and sought to ally themselves with those in the area. Originally, the Rocky Mountain alliance was made up of only nations in the Rocky Mountain region; but as it grew the alliance began accepting those outside of the immediate area of the mountains in order to continue its survival.
