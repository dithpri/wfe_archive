A large group of islands in the Atravian Sea, this tropical region was not stumbled upon until the 1800s, when a paddle steamer on a intercontinental voyage was blown off course by a storm and ran aground on Steamship Island, the namesake of the region.

Steamship Island, home of the Dictatorship of Alpinea, is the largest of the islands in the region, but there are quite a few other islands in the area of comparable size. In addition, Steamship Island is far more mountainous than many of the other islands in the Archipelago.
