Welcome to Dragon Valley! A place where dragons call home!

If your nation is humans, your nation will be granted the power to transform into dragons. We will ask for your Dragon&amp;#39;s name (Even if its made up), favorite color (Ex. Blue, Green, Magenta, ect.), type of dragon (European, Asian Lung, Wyvren, Marsupial, Frost, Knuckler, Lindworm, Tibetan, Chinese Lung, and Amphithere), Extras, Accessories, and Armor. Then all that will be transferred into an amulet, and given to you! Once you receive it, put it on, touch it, and once you do say your dragons name, and... There you have it! 

Also, join Dragon Valley&amp;#39;s own &amp;quot;[url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;amp;t=268645]Dragon RP&amp;quot;![/url]

Glory to God in his highest!
