[color=green][b]Welcome to the dimension of [region]Xen[/region]![/b]
Technically based on the dimension from Half-Life, but you don&amp;#39;t need to be a HL nation to join![/color]
[color=blue]We are a welcoming group (for the most part), so join in.[/color] (Even though we don&amp;#39;t have very many people yet...)

[b]All nations are welcome to join the region, no strings attached.
Voting is completely up to the Xen nation body. No offline-forums, no tricks, no junk that gets in the way of this thing you call [i]&amp;#39;democracy&amp;#39;[/i].[/b]
[i]Xen is an official puppet storage, so if you have more than one nation you would like to keep in Xen, go ahead.[/i]
