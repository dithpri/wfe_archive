[color=green][b]Welcome to the dimension of [region]Xen[/region]![/b] Founded by [nation]Combine-Controlled Earth[/nation]
Technically based on the dimension from Half-Life, but you don&amp;#39;t need to be a HL nation to join![/color][hr][b]All nations are welcome to join the region, no strings attached.
[color=red]Somewhat serious players who check on Xen once a day are preferred![/color][hr]Voting is completely up to the Xen nation body. No offline-forums, no tricks, no junk that gets in the way of this thing you call [i]&amp;#39;democracy&amp;#39;[/i].[/b][hr][i]Xen is an official puppet storage, so if you have more than one nation you would like to keep in Xen, go ahead.[/i][hr]Please respect one another in the message board. Any questions? Shoot a telegram towards [nation=short]Combine-Controlled Earth[/nation]!
