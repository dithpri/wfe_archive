In times gone by...
...In the times yet to come...
...Exists a universe of possibilities.

True Star Trek fans know about the sheer depths of philosophy and spirit explored in the various series&amp;#39; and films, and are very welcome in this region - as is everybody else!


Embassies and cross-region interaction are both welcome &amp;amp; encouraged, as is the way of the Federation, and only those with malevolent intentions are not welcome.


Live long and prosper.
