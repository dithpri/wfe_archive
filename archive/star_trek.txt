True Star Trek fans know about the sheer depths of philosophy and spirit (as well as pure sci-fi entertainment!) explored in the various series&amp;#39; and films, and are very welcome in this region - as is everybody else!


Embassies and cross-region interaction are both welcome &amp;amp; encouraged as is the way of the Federation - only those with malevolent intentions are not welcome.



Live long and prosper.
