[b]ATTENTION![/B]

As Official President of ORCA, I am hereby closing down ORCA forever. The crumbling disaster it became to be is unfixable. Today, will be marked as the end of ORCA. United We Stand, Together We Fall.

This region, and the organisation, will close today. I apologies for any inconvenience, but this is the end.
