You do know what &quot;dead&quot; means right? My Nations have been punished for whomever spammed TBH. My old Nations can no longer Telegram others or post on the RMB. They are dead. I create new Nations only if I need to answer a question. Now do you get it? I wasn&#39;t the spammer. The reason why Arualaen, S. Arualaen, and Arualaen the Great were deleted was because I made a second appeal to HELP Agentugly.
