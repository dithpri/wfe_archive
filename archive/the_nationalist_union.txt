[b][color=black]This region was a &amp;quot;memorial to its brave predecessor [region]Nationalist Union[/region]&amp;quot;, a Fash region which was destroyed by [region]Antifa[/region] earlier in 2012.

It was then badly damaged in an attack by [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] several months ago.

After that, several natives tried to band together and refound.

They emptied the region and it CTE&amp;#39;d.

UNAF got there before they did.
[hr]
This region is now managed by the FreeSocian [/color][color=red]Los Sandinistas Institute for the Spreading of Democracy, Anti-Nationalism and Anti-Imperialism[/color][color=black], in the name of[/color]

[color=red]ANTI[/color][color=black]FA!

To the Fash: you now have [region]Union of Nationalists[/region] to live in - although based on the lifespan of this region, in 6 months&amp;#39; time you&amp;#39;ll be looking for a [i]new[/i] region. :)

Yours,
[nation=short]Los Sandinistas[/nation]
