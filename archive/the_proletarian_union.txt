The Proletarian Union is totally dedicated to the rights of workers and the abolishment of the class/caste system and the exploitation of the proletarians by the bourgeois. We disdain to conceal our views and aims.We openly declare that our ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. [b]WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE![/b]
