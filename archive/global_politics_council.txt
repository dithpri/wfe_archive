The Global Politics Council is a geopolitical roleplaying region.

While many regions have most nations the same size, things are more interesting here. Great powers will interact with middle and minor powers. Great powers can compete for global influence while other nations decide how to lead their nation in the global arena.

Notes: as we have been recently founded it will take some time to build the region. In the meanwhile, you can use another nation to participate in a more active region. We encourage you to suggest ideas in the RMB to help build the region
