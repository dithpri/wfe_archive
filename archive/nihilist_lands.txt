First of all: you only enter this land if you want. No one here will drag you to our land by the use of force. We are so educated for that.

We don&amp;#39;t think that life has any meaning, so... this is a free land where everyone can fight another human being to death without being punished at all! Let our wild nature overcome our weak sense of civilization and enjoy your personal bloodbath.

A land for the chaos lovers, where you can do whathever you want.
