A region dedicated to the unity of Earth and all other worlds. Standing tall in the belief that technology is the key to progress.

So, in reality, we&#39;re a region that wants to have fun hanging out together. You know, talking, role playing, just trying to get big enough to mean something as a whole.

We have a few rules, but it&#39;s mostly common sense, you know, stuff covered in the rules of ettiquit. We aren&#39;t going to tell you how to run your nation, or judge you because you are an extremely tyrannical dictator, just play the game and participate in the region is all we ask. 

It&#39;s all for the good of the Arbitration
