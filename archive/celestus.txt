Celestus.....On the farthest reaches of the Solaryan Galaxy, the region of Celestus lies quietly amassing it&amp;#39;s strengths while negating it&amp;#39;s weaknesses.

Five planets have been colonized in Celestus:  Labyrinthys, Circassya, Zilesia, Resurrecitas, and Siddha Nanak.  

The region has massive deposits of natural resources as well as 37% of the planets in the various systems being habitable for oxygen-breathing races.

Though on the outer edge of the galaxy, the combined fleets of the Five Planets have begun the conquest of smaller, less developed sectors, thus adding to their might.

As they ever expand their sphere of influence, the Five Planets now turn their visio towards the center of Solaryan...............
