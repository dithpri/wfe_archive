[u][b]The Solitary Isles &#39;Independence for all!&#39;[/b][/u]

Tired of regions with entrenched leadership and lack of choice? Join the Solitary Isles instead! We prioritise freedom of choice above all else amongst our Independent Nations. The only requirement is that our Nations work together for the greater good of all, when the region is under threat.
