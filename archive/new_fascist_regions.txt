In Homura, The Holy and Unholy Light of Kyrie&#146;s Life[/url][hr]This sad darkspawn colony has been [i]purged[/i] by the flame and salt of [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. Darkspawn everywhere quake and scamper at the sight of our noble arms.
Join the fight against the Raider plague by signing up [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]here[/url][/b][hr][i]We pray for hope, embrace curses and protect you from the dark
We traded our souls for our powers and a destiny of battle.
A destiny that ends in oblivion.
For the only way to escape our despair is to vanish from this world.
The end will come for all of us. So we continue our fight.
