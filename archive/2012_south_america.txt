This place... is full of mediumly corrupt people when talking about politicians. Also, Argentina has most power there. Also, Chile is one of the members in South America. This means, there is a lot of stuff to do here. Also, if something happens, Argentina or the other nations here may attempt to stop it if it has disastrous consequences. If you don&amp;#39;t know, South America&amp;#39;s Argentina is an Spanish speaking country.
