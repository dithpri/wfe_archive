Welcome to the only region in the world that follows [b]Distributism[/b].  

Opposed to laissez-faire capitalism, which leads to a concentration of ownership in the hands of a few, and to state-socialism, in which private ownership is denied altogether, distributism is a genuine Third Way, opposing both the tyranny of the marketplace and the state, by means of a society of owners. 

&amp;quot;Economics as if People Mattered&amp;quot;

Champions include Chesterton, Belloc, and Schumacher all begun by Pope Leo XIII&amp;#39;s RERUM NOVARUM etc.
