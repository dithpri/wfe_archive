Queasia is a vast and many-splendored continent, a land of contrasts and comparisons. Originally an untamed, unpeopled place, this all changed when the great communist nation of [nation]Burkhdynnutag[/nation] was founded by brave pioneers. Soon after, two more nations formed on the continent. The first of these, [nation]Corp-U-Topia[/nation], was originally created as a tax shelter, but has grown to be much more. The other was Crunitunia, a fledgling nation which placed a high emphasis on science and the arts. Crunitunia, however, was not to last, as barbaric despoilers invaded and, well, despoiled the place. Deciding that they liked the modern lifestyle, the barbarians took over, and the kingdom of [nation]Krunnitung[/nation] was born. What&#39;s next in store for Queasia? Only time will tell!
