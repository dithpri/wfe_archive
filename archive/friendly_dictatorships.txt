[color=black][b]Greetings. This is a region of collective dictatorships, with low political freedom and an optional level of civil rights. All ideologies are welcome as long as political freedom doesn&#39;t rise to a level of which the nation is no longer considered a dictatorship.[/color]

[color=red]Anarchists and rebels are not welcome. A chain of command is necessary to maintain order.[/color]

[color=black]Pro-embassy, even with freedom-loving nations. Dictatorships in these region are diplomatic and we open to extend alliances.[/color]

[color=red]&quot;When you have an efficient government, you have a dictatorship.&quot;[/color][/b]
