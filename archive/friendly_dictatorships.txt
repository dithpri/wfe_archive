[color=black][b]Greetings. This is a region of collective dictatorships, with high civil rights and low political freedom. All ideologies are welcome as long as they follow this level of civil rights and political freedom.[/color]

[color=red]Anarchists and rebels are not welcome. A chain of command is necessary to maintain order.[/color]

[color=black]Pro-embassy, even with freedom-loving nations. Dictatorships in these region are pro-diplomacy and we open to extend alliances.[/color]

[color=red]&quot;Subtract cruelty from dictatorship, and you&#39;ll be left with the optimal government.&quot;[/b][/color]
