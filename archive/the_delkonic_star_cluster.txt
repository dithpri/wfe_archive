Far at the edge of the galaxy is a dense cluster of several dozen stars, mostly isolated from the rest of the galaxy by several dense nebula.  Scattered around these stars are several class-M worlds, many of which are under the control of the Federal Republic of Delkorion, governed from the homeworld of Delkon.
