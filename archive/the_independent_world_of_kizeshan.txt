Kizeshan &#150; A former colony in the Perseus Veil, Kizeshan has 1.6G gravity, a dense oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a harsh Earthlike climate of extreme weather. Its rugged surface hosts hostile megaflora, armored wildlife, toxic rivers, and aggressive spore-fungi. Terraforming introduced Earth species, but native ecosystems often overwhelm them. Once exploited for minerals and biotech, the colony collapsed into rebellion, leaving fractured nations, city-states, and tribes. Technology remains advanced but resource-scarce, with reliance on biotech, exosuits to counter gravity, energy defenses, and scavenged or imported spacecraft and industry.
