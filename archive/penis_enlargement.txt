&#147;If I had no penis, how would I pee? How would I make love? How would I think?&#148;

&#147;I told my doctor my penis was as thin as a spaghetti noodle. I asked if there was anything I could do to bulk it up, and he said, &#147;Yeah, tell your girl to twirl it on a fork before she puts it in her mouth.&#148; 

&#147;If I had a hand for a penis, would a hand job be appropriate in place of a handshake at business meetings?&amp;#8232;&#148;

&#147;I threw out my sausage, and replaced it with a healthier penis metaphor, like a cucumber.&#148; 

&#147;The mobster came by my establishment and said I needed protection. &#147;Nope,&#148; I replied, &#147;I&#146;ve already got protection.&#148; Then I showed him how I wear a rubber glove over my penis, with my shaft sliding perfectly in the pinky finger slot.&#148;
