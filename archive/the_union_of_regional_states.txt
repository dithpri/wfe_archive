[u]Welcome to the Union of Regional States![/u]

We are a serious roleplay region that uses a fictional map. We enourage the creation and use of creative, fantasy nations but request that members maintain a certain level of realism and uphold a high standard of roleplay in the region.

The Union of Regional States is a new, developing region and we are currently looking for new members with interesting fictional nations. We ask that [u]all[/u] members respect other member nations and their views.
