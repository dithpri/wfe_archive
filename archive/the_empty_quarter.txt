This region is noted for its vastness and emptiness, with plenty of space for those countries that seek lebensraum and isolation. If nations want to enter this region, they will have to PM Hordika Ecumene to ask for entrance, upon which Hordika Ecumene will evaluate your country to see if it is worthy of our isolationist valhalla. All embassies are welcome.
