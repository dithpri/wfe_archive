I am looking for students of Jesuit schools to join. Just tell me what school you go to and you will be accepted. There are some rules. 
1. We would love it if you join our region. We prefer if you go to a Jesuit school or another Catholic school. Or you could be anybody. However, you will be ruled by the Church
2. If you have any suggestions on how to rule the country, contact me via telegram and I will get back to you
