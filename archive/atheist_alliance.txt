All people of race, gender, sexuality, and even belief are welcome. Our objective is simple: To create an alliance of free-thinkers, agnostics, scientific minds, and atheists that will combat those who discriminate. If we see a region that is homophobic or discriminatory in any way, then we may invade it and bring it down. We are also here to engage people in intellectual debate. Also a place to discuss theories and just feel safe. This is not just a region, it is a movement that fights to secure a secular nationstates and to disorganize any hateful regions!
