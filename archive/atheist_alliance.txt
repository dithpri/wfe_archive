The atheist alliance was once an oppressive, boring, extremely stuffy place to live, where citizens spent their days listening to painful ideological dribble about how the world would magically become a place of peace &amp;amp; happiness if religion were gone.  The citizens have since been liberated and now can make ironic jokes at will without being questioned about their obvious meaning and many are freely having bible studies on the lawns of their former master&amp;#39;s statehouses.
