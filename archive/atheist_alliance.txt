All people of race, gender, sexuality are welcome. Our objective is simple to create an Alliance of Atheists that will combat people who discriminate against Atheists and discriminate against others. If we see a region that is homophobic or discriminatory in any other way  then we may invade it and bring it down. We are also here to engage religious people in debate and to question the&amp;#39;re religion. Not to hate them but to point out the flaws with religion. Also a place to discuss theories and just feel safe. This is not just a region it is a movement that fights to secure a secular nationstates!
