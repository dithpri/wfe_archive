[color=red][b]The Republicans won the election! Take that you Commies in Blue! Take it! Eat it! Choke it! If your freedom tears last for longer than 4 goddamn decades, receive a free large fry with any combo value meal! MURICA![/b][/color]

[i]And the border&#39;s death glare
Commies bursting in air
Gave proof that damn right, our freedom&#39;s still there
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave?[/i]
