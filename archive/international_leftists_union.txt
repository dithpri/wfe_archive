We are a region dedicated to the propagation of Leftist ideals, where man and woman have equal political and civil rights, where homosexuals, heterosexuals, asexuals and anyone in the wide spectrum of genders and sexualities have equal rights, where every race has equal rights.

We value liberty, equality, righteousness, co-operation and direct action. If you value such things, you belong here, you belong to the fighting workers of the world, you belong to the ILU.
