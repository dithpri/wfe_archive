Proclamation of the Empire&#146;s Foundation

By the will of destiny and the strength of our people, the realm, once a kingdom of promise, has risen through discovery, conquest, and expansion.
Let it be known to all lands and all ages that the Imperium is hereby founded.

From this day forth, a new dawn arises &#151; an era of unity, glory, and dominion &#151; under the divine mandate and rightful rule of the Emperor, sovereign and guardian of these realms.

So is declared, and so shall it endure.
