If you are here, you MUST be a puppet nation of Dytarma! People not under Dytarma&#39;s list of puppets aren&#39;t allowed. If you have an embassy with us, and you want to represent a nation in our region, you need to telegram us, and, if verified, will be given the password for the region. Sending a puppet nation over here is allowed. There shall be no WA Delegate because it will only be foreigners in that position. You can run for other positions, though. So, if all of that checks out, welcome to the Dytarma Puppet Storage!
