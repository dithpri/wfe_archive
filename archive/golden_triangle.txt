[b][color=F5A9B8]OwO, what&#39;s this?[hr]Oh no, it looks like a couple of catgirls got the [i]z o o m i e s[/i] and sprinted all around your region looking for some yarn to play with!
It&#39;s not all bad though - they happened to run through a sunbeam and suddenly all they wanted to do was nap. If you listen closely, you can hear them purring in their sleep! So cute :3
