this is a region that i hope will last a long time
it will be a democracy for everything unless i feel like an issue has come up where one must solve it. there will be a board where if you have speciffic questions like needing help deciding something for education or what not, you know who to send the question too. I will not ban unless they break any rules

[color=red]RULES
