We mourn the loss of our capital, [region]Hate[/region] (05/07/2019)
[hr][color=red][b]Providing Anti-Leftist/Communist Community Service Since[/color][color=green] 2018[/color][/b]
[hr][color=#7c5151]The communists have forced us to fight for our existence in this platform. We do not fear them, however, it should be them who fear us. If having differing opinions without harming anyone is &quot;hate&quot;, then we&#39;re proud to be the Army of Hate.

The Army of Hate is not diverse, multicultural or tolerant, and will never be. We&#39;re no region to be proud of such things, but we&#39;re proud to be of the one race that&#39;s the only one who&#39;s truly oppressed today, all thanks to the leftists, socialists, communists and alike. We, as those who&#39;re against their own oppression and fear their existence, will sear [b]our[/b] freedom through Nationstates.[/color]
