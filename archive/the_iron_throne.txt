Chaos isn&amp;#39;t a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.  Chaos is a ladder.  Many who try to climb it fail and never try again.  The fall breaks them.  And some are given the chance to climb, but they refuse.  They cling to the realm. Or gods.  Or love. Illusions!  Only the ladder is real!  The climb is all there is!
