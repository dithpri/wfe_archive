Welcome to the Association of Sovereign Nations!

The ASN is a private role-playing region that takes place in the 21st century on a fictional version of Earth. The real world map is used, but it is home to numerous fictional countries that do diplomacy, research, and conquest in order to gain supremacy. Make alliances, make enemies, or stay neutral, it&#39;s all up to what you want to pursue as the player. Here, your imagination is the limit, so get creative with your nation and strive to make a welcoming community!
