A Fantasy RP region welcome to all nations based off of fictional works!

Premise: Fan clubs on Earth in 2100 decide to make their favorite fantasy worlds reality. They scour the galaxy and colonize two planets. On one, only medieval-level technology is allowed and real-life magic has been discovered. On the other, 21st-century level technology is the norm. Later, an alliance of more technologically-advanced planets is formed.
