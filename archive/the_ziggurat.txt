[color=#734a05][b]Welcome to The Ziggurat![/b][/color] [color=#bd9f6c]Serving it to you ancient city style since September 29th, 2020.[/color]

[color=#734a05]Pardon our mess! The Ziggurat is currently [b]under construction[/b].[/color]

[color=#bd9f6c]At the dawn of civilization, ziggurats stood at the center of their communities and served as where the most important and sacred ways in which the community came together took place. Some still stand today, a testament to their power and legacy that stretch back to the very beginnings of recorded history.[/color]

[color=#734a05]The Ziggurat is a region dedicated to serving that same purpose of being a place for communities to come together. We are a region of gameplayers, roleplayers, and people of all sorts who want to build something great together. [b]Join us![/b][/color]
