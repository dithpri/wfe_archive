How can one doubt that the Union will one day, and that day is drawing near, become the leading power in the world? By herself alone, and for herself alone, she is already trading on a huge scale, and is destined to do so on a much greater scale still; moreover it is to enrich her that Spanish America is getting civilized. Continental America is an alliance between former American states and nations. We hope to one day reunify with the United States, but till then we stick together and protect our fellow man.
