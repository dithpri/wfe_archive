[b][color=Purple]Our Beliefs:[/color][/b]

[b]INCLUSIVITY![/b] Everyone can become powerful here in Dauiland, but for the highest positions you must be in the WA.

[b]ROLEPLAY![/b] We are an RP region! The RMB usually has the newest one, and we encourage everyone to join in!

[b]FUN![/b] Our core idea, fun, is arguably the reason NationStates exists! If you&#39;re not making it fun for others you may be ejected, and the same goes for spammers and invaders.
