[b]INCLUSIVITY![/b] Everyone can become powerful here in [region]Dauiland[/region], even if you&#39;re a dictatorship or have interesting views.

[b]ROLEPLAY![/b] We are, indeed, a role play nation! The RMB is often filled with the newest one, and we encourage everyone to join in!

[b]FUN![/b] Our core belief, fun, is arguably the reason NationStates exists! If you&#39;re not making it fun for everyone else you may be ejected&#151;and the same goes for spammers and invaders.
