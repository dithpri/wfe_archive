[b][color=Blue]Our Beliefs:[/color][/b]
&#151;
[b]INCLUSIVITY![/b] Everyone can become powerful here in [region]Dauiland[/region], although for the highest positions you must be in the WA. 
&#151;
[b]ROLEPLAY![/b] We are a roleplay region! The RMB is often filled with the newest one, and we encourage everyone to join in!
&#151;
[b]FUN![/b] Our core belief, fun, is arguably the reason NationStates exists! If you&#39;re not making it fun for everyone else you may be ejected&#151;and the same goes for spammers and invaders.
