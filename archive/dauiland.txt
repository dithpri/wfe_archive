[b]Thank you for coming to [color=purple]D[/color][color=pink]a[/color][color=turquoise]ui[/color][color=blue]land![/color][/b]

Dauiland has an incredible history, filled with ups and downs. We are ready to fight back against anyone who stands in our way (of having fun)!

Here is what we believe in:

[b]INCLUSIVITY![/b] Everyone can become powerful here in Dauiland, but for the highest positions you must be in the WA.

[b]ROLEPLAY![/b] We do lots of RPs here, and encourage everyone to join in! (RPs usually take place on the RMB)

[b]FUN![/b] Our core idea, fun, is arguably the reason NationStates exists! If you&#39;re not making it fun for others you may be ejected, and the same goes for spammers and invaders.


If you have any further questions, you can contact [nation]Candy and Chocolate[/nation] or our founder, [nation]Rahul Raghuraman[/nation]. 

Current RP is [color=purple]The Quest to Save Sary![/color]

Have fun!
