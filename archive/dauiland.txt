[b]Thank you for coming to DAUILAND! [/b]

Dauiland has an incredible history, filled with ups and downs. We are ready to fight back against anyone who stands in our way (of having fun)!

Here is what we believe in:

[b]INCLUSIVITY![/b] Everyone can become powerful here in Dauiland, but for the highest positions you must be in the WA.

[b]ROLEPLAY![/b] We do lots of RPs here, and encourage everyone to join in! (RPs usually take place on the RMB)

[b]FUN![/b] Our core idea, fun, is arguably the reason NationStates exists! If you&#39;re making it not fun for others you may be ejected, and the same goes for spammers and invaders.


Please endorse our WA Delegate, [b][nation]Candy and Chocolate[/nation].[/b]

RP: To be enunciated. (Announced)
RP Year: 2057

Have fun!
