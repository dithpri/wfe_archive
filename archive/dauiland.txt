[color=Purple]Our Beliefs:[/color]

INCLUSIVITY![/b] Everyone can become powerful here in Dauiland, but for the highest positions you must be in the WA.

[b]ROLEPLAY![/b] We are an RP region! The RMB usually has the newest one, and we encourage everyone to join in!

[b]FUN![/b] Our core idea, fun, is arguably the reason NationStates exists! If you&#39;re not making it fun for others you may be ejected, and the same goes for spammers and invaders.

We have temporarily removed Executive powers from the Delegate position to make it so that raiders will not be a threat to us over the summer (while many nations will not be active). The power will be granted again after the summer.
