[b]ROLEPLAY![/b] We are a roleplay region! The RMB is often filled with the newest one, and we encourage everyone to join in!
[b]FUN![/b] Our core belief, fun, is arguably the reason NationStates exists! If you&#39;re not making it fun for everyone else you may be ejected&#151;and the same goes for spammers and invaders.
