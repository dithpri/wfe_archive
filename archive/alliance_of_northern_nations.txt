The Alliance is founded upon the belief that mutual co-operation is necessary in today&#146;s world but the ultimate authority of a nation is down to its own government. Nation&#146;s work together in mutual trade, defence and international relations on an ad-hoc basis and are not formally bound by restrictive treaties.

Despite criticism of it&#39;s seemingly insular nature the Alliance is determined to maintain its traditional stance of non-involvement in wider international affairs. Indeed many of it&#39;s members are openly scathing about the World Assembly.
