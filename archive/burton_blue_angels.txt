This continent has a dry southern coast peopled with citizens well renowned for their independent spirit. In the reach they have very prosperous land that allows for great harvests and bountiful warehouses bursting with produce. The capital is to the east and is a great land, but is dependent upon other nations in the region because of its lack of self-sufficiency even for the most basic products such as water. The river lands are north of the capital. The Northern lands are cold, barren, and forbidding. The people live in perpetual fear of winter and its consequences. The North also requires an active military to protect from the uncivilized far northern peoples. This is the world of Burton Blue Angels.
