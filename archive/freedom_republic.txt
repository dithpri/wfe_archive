[color=grey][b]This region, once home to the vilest creature ever to roam this verse, is now under the protection of [region]The Order of The Grey Wardens[/region].[/b][/color]
[color=blue][b]After misguidedly moving their nation out, the Darkspawn [nation]Sheefing Bags[/nation] lost it to a charge from Warden [nation=short]Lenlyvit[/nation].[/b][/color]
[color=red][b]This region has been taken in War and will remain in Warden hands. Freedom Republic has been caught helping [region]US Military[/region], a newly created raider organisation that has spurned our friend [nation]Yuno Owl[/nation].[/b][/color]
[color=black][b]So if you like defending, and wish to help others in need, join us for some fun![/b][/color]
In Peace, Vigilance
In War, Victory
In Death, Sacrifice
