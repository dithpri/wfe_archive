Welcome to the Azchic States! It&#39;s a region of diverse and accepting nations and is quite new. 
Feel free to ask any questions if you may.
It&#39;s pronounced (ah-CHIC) [the &quot;z&quot; is silent]
Embassies and alliances are always welcomed.

Once the nation is old enough, we will start conducting alliances and embassies in various nations similar to ours.
The Azchic States may seem to be similar to each other on the outside, but differ concerning leaders, policies, ideas, and internal affairs.
Be nice and most importantly, be yourself. We haven&#39;t implemented any restrictions or bans. [b][i]Yet.[/i][/b]
