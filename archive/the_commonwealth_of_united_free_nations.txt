We are a region built on democratic principles. We are a beacon of democracy across NS and wish to spread ideals of Liberty and Freedom across NS. We believe in Freedom of speech as long as what you say isn&#39;t against NS rules. We wish to spread democracy and order across war-torn regions. We use diplomacy before war when we are confronted with an issue. We hope to make many allies across NS who share our values. However, we are not shy of war and will fight if needed. We hope to make a region that will stand the test of time and grow into an inter-regional powerhouse. We also have a regional currency backed by Bank to ensure it does not lose value, our currency is used to ensure the prosperity of our regions members and our allies.
