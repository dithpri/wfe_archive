Founded in the name of unity and brotherhood, the Realms of the Emerald Pact are linked together in a loose confederation to chart a course in multiversal affairs. The Assembly of Emeraldiers, comprising of delegates selected by the various independent states within the Emerald Pact, meet in Neustria to discuss matters pertaining to trade between the members, their contribution to the common defense, and laws pertaining to the regulation of internal affairs. The head of the Assembly is the Dread Sovereign or Dread Sovereignness of the Frankian Realm, though he or she is expected to act as a neutral mediator in the disputes between the assembled than to act as an executive.
