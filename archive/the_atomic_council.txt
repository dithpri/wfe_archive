[B][color=EF4B23]Welcome To the Atomic Council![/color][/B]

We are a region dedicated to harnessing the power of the Atom, for both Peace and War. 

[i]&amp;#39;The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.&amp;#39;[/i]

Why not join now and advance the boundaries of SCIENCE? 
Why not join now and create an Atomic Utopia?
Why not join now and be periodically showered with Nuclear Fallout?
