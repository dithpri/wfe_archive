[b][color=red]Welcome to the[/color] [color=blue]Atomic Council![/color]

We are a region dedicated to harnessing the power of the Atom, for both Peace and War.[/b]

[color=blue]&#147;The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.&#148; [/color]

[b]Why not join now and help make this region great? Why not join now and create an atomic utopia? Why not join now and be periodically showered with nuclear fallout?

[color=red]It&amp;#39;s time to stop worrying and love the bomb.[/b][/color]
