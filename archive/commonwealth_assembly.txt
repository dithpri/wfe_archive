Do you like alternative, realistic earth roleplays? Is every other region filled with those who are too serious, argue a lot, or are just plain unrealistic? Then the Commonwealth Assembly is for you. The Commonwealth Assembly (CA) is a UN-like organization on NationStates. We are a friendly, realistic region with polls and resolutions. Want to be a WA delegate, but can&amp;#39;t get the ability to due so because regional founders won&amp;#39;t allow for it? Well here, all WA members who submit the CA&amp;#39;s WA Delegate Application to me are officially eligable to gain votes to be our delegate.
