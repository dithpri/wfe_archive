Do you like alternative, realistic earth roleplays? Is every other region filled with those who are too serious, argue a lot, or are just plain unrealistic? Then the Commonwealth Assembly is for you. The Commonwealth Assembly (CA) is a UN-like organization on NationStates. We are a friendly, realistic region with polls, resolutions, and roleplay.
