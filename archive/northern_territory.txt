[i][b]Greetings, visitor! You have entered the Northern Territory, the uppermost fringes of The Colonial Empire. This area is filled with nomads, desperadoes, and criminals of all sorts. Its frigid temperatures and lack of many parts of modern civilization make it a wilderness, inhabited only by those with nowhere else to go.[/i]
