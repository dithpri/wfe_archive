[i][b]Greetings, visitor! You have entered the Northern Territory, the uppermost fringes of [region]The Colonial Empire[/region]. This area is filled with nomads, desperadoes, and criminals of all sorts. Its frigid temperatures and lack of many parts of modern civilization make it a wilderness, inhabited only by those with nowhere else to go.

May the Motherland Prosper![/i]

Controlled by [nation=short]The Colony Master[/nation] and [region]The Colonial Empire[/region][/b]
