Founded 2016 by a group of isolationalists who branched out to surrounding territory.  Each nation has a unique form of government, demographic and purpose in New Pembroke.  Although they differ, the nations of New Pembroke work of each other and co-exist in the region, supporting each other with their strengths.  New Pembroke is always looking for similar regions to form Embassies with for trade and communication, but will strive to stay out of the World Assembly unless absolutely necessary.

The heart of this region is found in Pembroke States.
