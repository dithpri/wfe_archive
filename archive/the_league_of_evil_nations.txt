Ever kicked a baby into a brick wall? What about throwing frozen TV dinners at people in wheelchairs? If you answered no to either of these questions, you better have done worse! This is a region for only the most wicked and vile! The League of Evil Nation was founded to unite all who are evil under one flag to help each other when necessary. We welcome anyone who believes themselves to be evil! Also, you will get free cake for joining!
