[b]WELCOME TO ANTI COMMUNISM[/b]
[hr]


It is what it is. I&#39;m surprised that nobody has made this region yet. This is a talking place for anybody with anticom leanings, provided that they aren&#39;t communist themselves (I&#39;m looking at you, SocDems). Password is pretty obvious.

The only five global rules are:

[list][*]Don&#39;t spam or flood.
[*]Don&#39;t join the WA.
[*]Don&#39;t be communist.
[*]Don&#39;t troll or bait.
[*]Follow NS guidelines.

[b]Enjoy.[/b]

To all communist spies: I don&#39;t fill positions nor do I use Discord. Don&#39;t bother.
