The Greater Fostani Empire is a loose collection of various states headed by the emperor, who is elected by all member nations.  The Fostani Empire ultimately spans the vast majority of the Velan galaxy.

It has no specific guidance for the politics of member states except that each member should be able to protect itself from any foreign threat until a larger nation can assist.
