This region of the world was until recently undiscovered and first colonized by the Dominion. It has been discovered that the sub-surface layers are rich in metals as well as a few veins of Uranium making this land ideal for mining nations. However the ecosystem is filled with many different species of creatures that are frequently attacking humans meaning that unless your nation builds protective walls your citizen count may go down the drain.

Scorpions come in all sizes from the size of a pin head to the size of a city bus. Snakes also seem to share in the variety of sizes. It is highly recommended that unless you are desperate for good mining you do not go here.... or if you are just that desperate to get away from the big world.
