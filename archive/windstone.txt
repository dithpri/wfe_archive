The reclusive region of Windstone, ruled by Jenna Islands is the most ancient in all of Terra. Forged by an ancient race whose knowledge has been lost to the rest of the world and studied only by the scholars of Jenna Islands. The geography of this land is mostly a tundra with an odd solar anomaly, providing Jenna Islands, which lie in the middle of the mainland in a massive natural saltwater lake, with an almost tropical climate. The region is one of the most desirable in all of Terra, but due to treacherous seas surrounding it, and adamant warriors protecting its borders, all attempts of communication have rather abruptly been destroyed from a safe distance from its shores.
