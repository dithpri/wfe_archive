 [color=blue]The United States Council of Peacekeepers[/color]

    After the American Civil war that ended in 1878, the United States of America split into three distinct regions, [nation]Fayborough[/nation],[nation]Augusta Romula[/nation], and [nation]unified confederate states of america[/nation]. These nations were at war until the creation of the USCP, which facilitated the truce and Treaty of Washington D.C. Now,Fayborough and Augusta Romula have become allies, while the UCSA is still unwilling to bond with its American brothers and sisters. Fayborough keeps its missiles pointed at the UCSA capital of Atlanta,Georgia, ready to invade at any moment, whereas Augusta Romula mediates between the two, while still trying to stay out of international affairs.
