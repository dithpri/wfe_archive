[b][color=red]Hello and welcome to [region]The Freedom Isles[/region]![/color][/b]
[b][color=blue]We are a young region with a growing, yet active community. We are still getting on our feet, but we are setting up a regional Constitution, a regional government, and an active roleplay. All this can be found on our [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Freedom_Isles_Forum/index/]Forum[/url].[/color][/b]
[color=orange]Also, for anyone who wants to just chat on the forum, our [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Freedom_Isles_Forum/forum/3831923/]Chit Chat Corner[/url] is the place to go.[/color]
