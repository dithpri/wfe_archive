[b][color=black]Welcome to PORT-AU-PRINCE[/color][/b][hr][b][color=purple]In certain parts of the world, there are those believe an apocalypse will occur.
In Haiti, thanks to murderous imperialism, capitalism, US support for brutal family dictatorship, corruption, an earthquake, hurricanes, disease caused and exacerberated by poverty and a lack of healthcare and male western charity workers predating on women, the people of Haiti do not wait any longer.

[i]The apocalypse has already arrived.[/i][/color][/b][hr][b][color=black]And we looked and behold, a merchant vessel, and his name that sat on him was Death, 
and Hell followed with him.[/color][/b]
