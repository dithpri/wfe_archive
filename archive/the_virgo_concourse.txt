A cluster of star systems filled to the goddamn brim with habitable planets. Cum on in!

Why? Because our populations get too big to be just nations. We are planets! And planets need a place to live, but also too many planets don&#39;t fit in a star system. And then it&#39;s like, what&#39;s a good constellation that we could live in? I&#39;m partial to Virgo, but she&#39;s no virgin, she&#39;s a real Sandy! And she likes to party, you bet!

But what are we doing here? Whatever you want! I don&#39;t give a hoot. You could endorse [nation]Yottle[/nation], maybe! That&#39;d be a fun thing you could do.
