[b]Welcome to [color=blue]the Union of[/color] [color=red]North-Central American Republics![/color] [/b]

 [i] After the defeat of the United States at the hands of the Confederacy in 1863, the two sides quickly negotiated a respectful peace treaty which allowed for open trade and communication. However, State after State seceded from both the Union and the Confederacy, dissolving into a large number of Republics with American ideals and origins. Seeking to preserve fruitful trade relations, the newly independent former capitol of Washington D.C. (now known as [nation]Washington-Columbia[/nation] ), established the Union of North-Central American Republics in 1911, and membership continues to grow. [/i] 

[b]Membership is always open to all former American States.[/b]
