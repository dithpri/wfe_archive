This Grand Union consists of nations who were Previously of Ijaka, but who left in order to create something else. Something greater than an Army or a Navy. Its inhabiting nations are the People&#39;s Republic of the High Triocrite, The United Socialist States of the Greater Pacific Federations, The Democratic Republic of the High Planetary Jacques, the Commonwealth of the Peoples of Europa, the Rogue Nation of Zephir, and the Kingdom of Pranav. We shall forever be united by the bonds of this regional union. For no war, no battle, nor any crisis shall separate us. We will forever prevail onto this earth, Always.
