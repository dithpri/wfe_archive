&quot;This isn&#39;t really a region per se, more a permanent message board to RESPECTFULLY put forward and debate our SOLUTIONS to problems in the world, both big &amp; small.&quot;
Although, ever since the &quot;death&quot; of our founder Gals Trianon, I&#39;ve been in complete control. I&#39;ll be shortly writing a constitution for Debate club and slowly make the transition from &#39;message board&#39; to sovereign region. Although I regret to admit this, I am merely an alternative account of [nation]Maurnindaia[/nation], so the transition shall be slow, nevertheless, I shall pour heart and soul into this. For now, I am simply asking for a WA Delegate, so that our legitimacy be better and more engraved. For now though......
ALL HAIL DEBATIA!
EDIT:The region is currently being raided.
