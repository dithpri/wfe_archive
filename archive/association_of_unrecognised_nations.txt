The [colour=3AB09E][b]Association of Unrecognised Nations (AUN)[/b][/colour] is an independent, non-aligned region of Nations which are either unrecognised by the international community or only retain limited recognition. We are dedicated to the decolonisation and independence of all non self-government territories through peaceful means and measures, hence we will welcome all embassy requests as long as they respect international law, peace &amp; security.
