The GENA, or Global Entente of Nations and Alliances, is a giga-alliance and successor to the World Assembly created through a multitude of mergers. Following in the footsteps of its predecessor, the Global Confederation of Nations, the GENA aims to be the transition period from the GCN to a true World Assembly successor.
