The North American Protection Sphere is a defensive alliance founded by the Columbian Federation. While it&#39;s in the name, it&#39;s not limited to North America and accepts members all around the world. As it is a defensive alliance the organization is not used for offensive actions and merely for protecting its members. There aren&#39;t any requirements for joining the alliance besides not trying to dismantle the alliance.
