The year is 1815 (after the Congress of Vienna, however, there may not have even been a Congress of Vienna in this timeline; that remains to be settled)

You may change any events of your nation after 1776 so long as it doesn&#39;t change the existence of the Napoleonic Wars, the independence of America, and some other WIP events and so long as it doesn&#39;t contradict already settled lore

Settled lore:
basically none for now
