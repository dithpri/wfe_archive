[b]Welcome Aboard Captain, We appear to have faced an Intergalactic Federation, what shall we do sir?[/b]

[b][i]Welcome to the ever growing, ever fun Region of the Intergalactic Federation! 
In this place you can strive to basically do whatever you want just as long as you endorse our lovely WA Delegate.[/i][/b]

[b]Join the Intergalactic Army[/b]
Be prepared to join in the ranks of the Intergalactic Army, that is, if you&#39;re into military stuff.

[b]Join the Political Party[/b]
If you&#39;re not into the military BUT are into politics, dive in to meet smart individuals who KNOW what their talking about.

[b]No? You&#39;re not interested in any of those stuff? Well, one thing&#39;s for sure, thanks A LOT for helping us grow as a region.[/b]
