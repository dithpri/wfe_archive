Welcome to [region]Tehillia[/region]! We are a region of Freedom with the goal to give each country equal treatment within our borders!

It is our mission to promote Freedom within this wonderful world of ours, and to spread democratic principles throughout!

Anyone is free to join, but inciting violence and/or cruelty within our Region is considered a very serious offense! We are pacifists, and believe that Civilization only thrives when there is Scientific advancement and Peace, therefore aggression is highly reprehensible within our society! We do, however believe in the preservation of our land, so If we are invaded, don&#39;t expect us to stand idly by!
