Tehillia is a region of many Islands, hidden and mostly untouched from most of society for years, now it is an Arising Beacon of Hope promoting Peace amongst all Peoples.

Our Mission is to find that Power doesn&#39;t come through Conquest, but instead Peace and Advancement, which leads to Prosperity within our great Nations of this Earth!

We do not promote, whatsoever, any violation of Human Rights within our Region, you must have at least moderate Civil Rights, (If you dip down, contact an Authority, its fine as long as you promise to fix your Civil Rights)
