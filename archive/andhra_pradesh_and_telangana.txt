[color=cyan]Welcome to Andhra Pradesh &amp; Telangana![/color]
[color=orange]The cradle of the Telugu language. Our land drained by the mighty Godavari and Krishna rivers, spans from the grassy plateaus of Telangana to the lush green hills of Tirupati. From the rocky lands of Rayalaseema to the fertile farmlands and beaches of Seemandhra.[/color]
[color=green]We hope that you will have a wonderful time here![/color]
