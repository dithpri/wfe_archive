Welcome to the Trost District! Our small region is composed of many nations, surrounded by an enormous wall that keeps out invaders and creatures. Our leading nation, Behegeri, is protected by a large moat, essentially making it an island. Ceiera also is surrounded by water, but is in the center of the Yugoific sea. Our government is controlled by the central Monarchy, but the more prominent and powerful parliament is recognized as the &amp;#39;decision-maker&amp;#39;. However, our King Kyle VII accepts or vetoes every issue and law presented to the government. Once a month, we hold meeting to discuss problems within our region and any new information
