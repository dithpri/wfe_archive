The Eponymous Coast spans a relatively short distance, but it traverses an area where many diverse biomes meet in close proximity. It boasts beautiful beaches and desolate rocky sea-plains, lush forests and barren steppes, fertile farmland and empty wastes, majestic mountains and dead plateaus.

The Eponymous Coast was first settled by brave Billrovian Pioneers in the year 10 of the First Era. Its rich countryside quickly brought more peoples to colonize it. After a brief period of commercial development the Eponymous coast became one of the wealthier and more commercially successful areas of the world.

Unusually, the Eponymous Coast tends to give rise to nations named after their founders. Nobody is quite sure why.
