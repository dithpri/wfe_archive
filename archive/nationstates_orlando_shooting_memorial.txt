[b]This region serves as a memorial to the deadliest mass shooting in American history and the worst terror attack since 9/11. At 2 a.m. on June 12th, 2016, a 29 year old man named Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to ISIS, shot up a gay night club in Orlando. He killed 50 people and wounded 53 more. This attack on America and on the LGBTQ+ Community must never be forgotten.[/b]
