a [region=0000] region

[list][color=600060][b]This region serves as a memorial to the deadliest mass shooting in American history and the worst terror attack since 9/11. At 2 a.m. on June 12th, 2016, a 29 year old man (whose name is unimportant), who pledged allegiance to an Arab terrorist organization which currently occupy parts of Syria and Iraq, shot up a gay night club in Orlando. He killed 49 people and wounded 53 more. This attack on America and on the LGBTQ+ Community must never be forgotten.[/b][/color]
