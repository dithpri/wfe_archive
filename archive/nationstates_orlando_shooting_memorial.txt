At 2 a.m. on June 12th, 2016, a 29 year old man named (just an idiot whose name is unimportant), who pledged allegiance to Arab Terrorists who currently occupy parts of Syria and Iraq, shot up a gay night club in Orlando. He killed 49 people and wounded 53 more. This attack on America and on the LGBTQ+ Community must never be forgotten.[/b][/color][/list][hr][hr][hr][list][color=green]This Region is now being maintained by [region=United States of America] ([nation=short]New Falham[/nation])[/color][/list][hr][hr][hr]
