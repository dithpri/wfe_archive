The Floating Islands are a highly mountainous region.  The reason they are given the term &amp;quot;Floating&amp;quot; is that most of the mountains extend many kilometres above the clouds and a lot of them truly are floating.  We are friendly and offer aid to each other in this region.  We are dedicated to social welfare, not war or economy
