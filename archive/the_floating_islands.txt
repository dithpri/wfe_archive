[color=red]Welcome all, to our home![/color]

Welcome to The Floating Islands!

We are a currently small region involved in many of the various aspects such as rp, community and, most importantly, having fun!
The rules are simple: keep it polite, keep it clean and have fun.  NS Stats play a small part, but are not key to overall rp.  Just keep it logical and sensible.

[color=violet]A map will be posted eventually, along with actual guidelines.[/color]
