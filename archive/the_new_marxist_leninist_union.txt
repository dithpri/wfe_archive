An international political union concerned with delivering a new road to communism - transitioning nations towards a more ethical, socialist society.

The New Marxist-Leninist Union was founded in 2023 by the Marxist Leninist Revolutionary Insitute (MLRI) of New Mersey, the organised body overseeing the majority of New Merseyan MPs. The institute&#39;s mission is to establish and preserve a new international order of communist nations.

The NMLU&#39;s &#39;action statement&#39; (manifesto), entitled &#39;The Global Road to Socialism&#39;, was drafted in 2022 by the MLRI, and seeks to guide a more democratic road to globalised communism.
