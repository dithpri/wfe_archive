The Scorch is a baron wasteland left in pieces after the apocalypse. Scorching heat and dessert as far as the eye can see, with little to no precipitation. As the dust settled newcomers found their liking to The Scorch. Creating nations in any habitable area available. People with the fight to survive and a strong will find their home here. Welcoming to any new nation who can survive The Scorch.
