The Scorch is a baron, desolate, and intimidating land. With harsh climates and unsuitable living conditions people and Nations in this land turn to living underground and in high sheltered areas. Living in The Scorch is a test of strength and willpower. Those who condition themselves and strive to build and better their home survive, the weak have no place here. The people of this land are harsh, powerful, and daring. We welcome those who believe they have the strength to join the nations of The Scorch, as they will be tested to their limits and pushed to the edge to survive.
