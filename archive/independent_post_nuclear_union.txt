[b]In the year 2071, the world fell finally to the war that had been lauded in jokes and warned of by conspiracists: World War III. Among the howls of the dying and the unsettling death rattle of the world that was arose a new age for mankind. Not a golden age, but one of teetering balance between armed, and tired new realms of control.

We stand no longer on the precipice of chaos, and have long since fallen. Now we are in the throes of it, and those that wish to stand must do so together.

We welcome you, you haggard, beaten souls. You weary travelers, starved for refuge. You cold, shriveled forms. Here you may not find solace.

But you may yet find warmth.
