[b][i][u]Welcome to the IPNU.[/i][/u][/b]

This is a region dedicated to (predominantly) serious roleplay on earth two hundred years following a Nuclear War. We focus heavily on realism, accuracy, and appropriate etiquette on our board. We have [url=http://ipnu.conforums.com/index.cgi]Off-site Forums[/url] which we require players to use for the purpose of processing map claims, filing grievances, and voting on major regional issues.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact [nation]the_northern_chinese_provinces[/nation], [nation]the_portland_territory[/nation], or any of the other officers for information regarding the Region.
