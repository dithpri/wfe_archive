The IPNU was the successor to [region]United Post Nuclear Commonwealths[/region] after a coup by some of the ROs. It was a continuation of the UPNC in terms of RP and community, so it was a fun place as well, and also had the same trait of [i]post-nuclear[/i] not really being all that relevant in the actual RP.

Seizing this name for the sake of preserving history. Should you have any nostalgia-related business with the IPNU, toss a telegram at either [nation]BlackLight Covenant[/nation] or [nation]The Armada of Refuge[/nation]; preferably the former, but I&#39;ll notice it on the latter sooner or later as well.
