The year is 2152.
Mankind had a brush with death, more than three generations ago, in the form of a global thermonuclear war. Nobody&#39;s quite sure how it started. That war killed more than sixty percent of Earth&#39;s population, and in the fighting, diseases, famine, and other things that followed reduced Earth&#39;s population to a bit less than 5% of what it had been. Some areas got it a whole lot worse than others.
Now, civilization is finally recovering.
New countries, peoples old and new, new nations, are finally rising. Here, you can play as one of those
Happy scavenging.
