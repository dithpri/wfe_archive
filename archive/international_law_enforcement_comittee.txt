[color=red][i]We Are The International Law Enforcement Committee...[/i][/color]

Welcome to The International Law Enforcement Committee, territory of [region]The New Liberty Republic[/region]. This region was, according to it&#39;s founder, a mistake. So he gave it to me. And if there are any hardcore fans of us at TNLR (There are non), then US invading is not hypocritical. It&#39;s necessary so that the region can stay alive and it wasn&#39;t wasted. Plus, the founder ASKED me to take it. Also, you can see that the regional flag is the same apart from the cross in the top-left corner, which is the same as ours at TLNR. Who knows, maybe one day we will re-instate this as an independent region and re-launch it. Keep waiting. One day...
