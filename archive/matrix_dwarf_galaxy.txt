The Matrix Dwarf Galaxy is one of the smallest galaxies close to the Milky Way Galaxy. It is roughly 45,000 Light Years (Lyrs) in diameter, with a center bulge thickness of 13,000 Lyrs, and a thickness of 1,200 Lyrs. It is approx. 17 million Lyrs away from the Milky Way Galaxy, a 45 day trip by Hyperspace just the Jump Core. After arriving to the Matrix Dwarf Galaxy, the United Stars of Trekys (UST) set about to find the best system to designate their capital system. After many years of searching, a system near the center was chosen and named Rigel System, after the first system we settled in while in the Milky Way Galaxy.
