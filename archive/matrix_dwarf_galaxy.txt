The Matrix Dwarf Galaxy is one of the smallest known galaxies in the Local Cluster of the Universe. Presently, the United Stars of Trekys has only explored and designated nine (9) star systems for colonization, deciding to take their time in exploring &amp;amp; setting up other colonies on the myriad of other habitable planets. The number, however, is truly unknown, considering the current state of the Trekys&amp;#39; sensors, however the systems that Trekys has fully explored and designated for colonization, are mostly void of any intelligent life that could one day evolve into a civilization, with the exception of animals and plant life.
