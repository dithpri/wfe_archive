Do you know anything about the &amp;quot;Star Road&amp;quot;?
Let me explain... You&amp;#39;ve heard of wishing upon a shooting star? At the &amp;quot;Star Road&amp;quot;, your wish is transformed into a star. When it&amp;#39;s granted, it then turns into a shooting star and falls down to earth. So you see, the Star Road plays an integral role in granting wishes.

Welcome to Star Road! Not only do your wishes come true, but you can talk about stuff!
This is (for now) an incredibly small region, where dolls are rulers and they can also kill bow banana guys!

Also, if you&amp;#39;re a raiding victim, feel free to join! Anybody can join actually.
