[b][color=green]Good and evil are not equal. Therefore repel evil with that which is better.[/color]

______________________

[b]In love, nothing exists between heart and heart.
Speech is born out of longing,
True description from the real taste.
The one who tastes, knows.
The one who explains, lies.
