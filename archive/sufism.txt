[b][color=green]Good and evil are not equal. Therefore, repel evil with that which is better and your enemy will become as close as an old and valued friend [/color]

[color=red]Qur&#39;an [I]Surah Fussilat[/I] 41:34[/color][/b]

______________________

[b]In love, nothing exists between heart and heart.
Speech is born out of longing,
True description from the real taste.
The one who tastes, knows.
The one who explains, lies.
