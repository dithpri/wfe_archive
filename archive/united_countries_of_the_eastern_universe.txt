The United Countries of the Eastern Universe (UCEU) is a powerful alliance that serves as a political, military, and economic coalition among its member nations. Formed in response to rising geopolitical tensions, the UCEU aims to ensure collective security, promote economic cooperation, and advance technological development across its member states. Much like NATO, the UCEU operates on the principle of mutual defense, where an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Its integrated military command structure enables rapid response to threats, while its economic policies focus on free trade agreements, shared development projects, and resource pooling to strengthen regional stability and prosperity.
