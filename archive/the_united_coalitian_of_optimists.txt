The purpose of this region is to unite members that actually are playing to fix the world and their countries. Not to be weird and mess up everything because it&amp;#39;s funny.
This does not mean this coalition is only serious, but we understand many jokes and we are not obsessed with [i]internet politics[/i]. This region is very willing to welcome new nations with new ideas and new values with open arms. Lastly we wish to say how we appreciate your say in global affairs, we are very open to your thoughts and we want you to contribute to the game.
