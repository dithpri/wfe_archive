Welcome to the East Asian Union, a region created by [nation]Long Dynasty[/nation], a former member of [region]Valley of Peace[/region].
The East Asian Union was created for anyone who wants their nation to be East Asian-ish. (Wow Long Dynasty I didn&#146;t know that)
Why was this created? I liked the [region]Valley of Peace[/region], yet it seemed too spiritual for my country (hence my country not being very religious/spiritual), resulting in the creation of this.
FUTURE PLANS:
Embassy with [region]Valley of Peace[/region]
