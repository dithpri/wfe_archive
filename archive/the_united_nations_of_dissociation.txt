The [color=blue]United Nations of Dissociation[/color], is a region where all are welcome to be and are encouraged being involved into the politics of the region and WA. We are open to helping anyone and advising all we can. We also hope to build this region with role play,it is not required. 

As per the history of our regions, starting with The United Nations of Segregation, that was taken down by [region]The CoG[/region] and its malicious leader [nation]osloo[/nation]. Once the second region was founded, The United Nations of Economical Dictatorial Nations, once again invaded. Now this will not happen, we will [b][color=red]rise[/b][/color] and [b][color=red]thrive[/b][/color].
