A shared passion for education is what binds this unique and exclusive region together. Historia Magistra may be a new and growing region but what we lack in experience we make up for in knowledge and swag. 

Much like its Latin name, our region believes that history is the best teacher for life. This belief was taught by our wise and virtuous founder, our 8th-grade history teacher. Only under her supreme guidance was this motley group of nations able to unite together for a common cause; the enteral pursuit of enlightenment!
