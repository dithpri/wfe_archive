[region]The Second Entente[/region] is a roleplay-centered region, aimed towards politics, alliances and meetings. There are no guidelines as to who you shall become. That choice is yours alone.

Free from desertion and corruption, the Second Entente believes solely in what&#39;s fair, what&#39;s just, and what&#39;s right. Founded to be free from tyranny, we shall stand together through thick and thin.
