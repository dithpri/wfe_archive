[color=#0000BF][b]This Region is for the island nations in the Wishton Sea, and lies due south of the Tavlyrian Sea in [region]Teremara[/region]. We share some cultural, historical and ethnic bonds, such as Polynesian and Melanesian, but definitely not the same politics. Wishton Polynesia is mostly a holding region for some puppet nations, but contact the founder if you think it&#39;s for you. Thanks for visiting![/b][/color]
