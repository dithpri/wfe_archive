[color=#0000BF][b]This Region is specifically for island nations in the Hutanjian archipelago and some like minded invited nations to hang out in...and not do too much else. All are involved in the [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;t=197583&amp;amp;start=650]Hutanjian Conflict[/url] RP. We share cultural, historical and ethnic bonds, but definitely not the same politics. Wishton Polynesia is mostly a holding region for some puppet nations. Thanks for visiting![/b][/color]
