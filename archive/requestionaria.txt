Originally an ordinary, anti-Nazi region founded by The Independent Country of Corksa, Requestionaria had been conquered by [region]the Greater German Reich[/region] and became a colony. It has now been liberated by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with other [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascist[/b] forces. Currently, relief services are helping the survivors of the Nazi rule to rebuild their region.

&amp;quot;First they came for the socialists,
and I didn&amp;#39;t speak out because I wasn&amp;#39;t a socialist. 
Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I didn&amp;#39;t speak out because I wasn&amp;#39;t a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews,
and I didn&amp;#39;t speak out because I wasn&amp;#39;t a Jew.
Then they came for me,
and there was no one left to speak for me.&amp;quot; - Martin Niem&ouml;ller
