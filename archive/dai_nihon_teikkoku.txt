The Empire of Nihon stretches all over Furukuran ocean, from cold stepped of Manjuguo in the north to Jakarnapuran jungles in the south, all guarded by the Kaigun under the spirit of Pan - Asiaticism. Thousands of warriors ready to give their lives on Shogun&amp;#39;s move of finger patrol this area and provide it&amp;#39;s security. This region is overwhelmingly capitalistic - all forms of socialism are not tolerated and destroyed on sight.

Welcome to the land of white blazing sun. A land of honour and traditional values. Welcome to Nihon.
