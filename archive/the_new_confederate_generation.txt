We are strictly a ROLE PLAY region! We don&#39;t go off of Nation States statistics, but we do ask that you be realistic and not &quot;out-landish&quot; with the statistics that you make for your nation. To be able to role-play at all, you must have a claim on the regional map. If you don&#39;t have one contact [nation]Dixieland du sud[/nation]. We almost never work on the RMB, we mostly do Discord. Ask a member or officer for link...
[b]Officers:[/b]
We have no official form of government. But, however, we do take on an Oligarchy-style role. Where all the officers have the same power and roles within the region. WHAT WE SAY GOES! [nation]Dixieland Du Sud[/nation],[nation]Paradise Utopia[/nation],and [nation]Prince Aiko[/nation], you can ask any of these three through discord or tele. for any help that you may need.
