&quot;Eternal Glory and Victory&quot;

The Alliance of Imperial States is a conglomerate of nations that are united in the ideals of an open and free economy. The means in which a nation achieves this goal is of no concern to anyone except for the leaders of their respective nations to decide. As such, all pro-market governments are considered welcome to the Alliance, regardless of political and personal freedoms, or whether they are democratic or authoritarian.
