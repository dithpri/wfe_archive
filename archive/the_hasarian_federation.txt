Forged in the ashes of a planet ravaged by war, The Hasarian Federation stands as a unified global society on the planet Eridani.

200 years ago, our ancestors were embroiled in a bitter and violent war that enveloped the whole world. Great sadness and sorrow took hold of our world and we began to come together to reconcile our species. The outlook changed and from those days forward, the Hasarian species has stood strong together, side by side - no further bloodshed.

That is why our last great conflict is known as:

The Final War

A Union of Seven States based on the planet Eridani.  Our Capital rests between the States of Asuras and Ondahar and is known as Reach.
