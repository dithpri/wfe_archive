Welcome to Voya Nova!

We are an iiwiki writing region, dedicating to writing a great lore and world via iiwiki.
(NOTE: We are not a roleplay region.)

How to get started:

Well, you begin by simply joining. Then, you visit iiwiki.us, make an account, and THEN, writing an IC nation article about yourself. You are not allowed to use names like &#147;The Bruh Mom of Memeland&#148; as a name, it has to be realistic. You may base it off of your nationstates nation, in fact, its highly recommended you do. Then, after you&#39;ve done that! Congrats! All you need to do now is join our discord and DM and admin where you want your nation to be on our map!
