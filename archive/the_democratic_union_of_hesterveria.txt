The sovereign colonies of Democratic Gonalona, Basom, and Sacamanto hereby declare their independence from the nation of Hestervaria. We have endured prolonged and intolerable governance marked by instability, disregard for the well-being of our citizens, and a persistent erosion of our fundamental rights and liberties.

This separation is necessary to safeguard the principles of self-determination, justice, and the pursuit of happiness for all our people. We believe that a free and independent union will best enable us to safeguard these liberties. 

We are confident that this new chapter in our history will usher in an era of prosperity, freedom, and lasting peace for the people of Democratic Gonalona, Basom, and Sacamanto.
