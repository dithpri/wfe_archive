This Italian fascist and white supremacist region was a close ally of [region]Nationalsozialistische Volksstaaten[/region]. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

Benito Mussolini, like his dear friend/rival Adolf Hitler, was a racist egomaniac and a chauvinist in every sense of the word. He exited WWI wondering why there wasn&amp;#39;t more blood being shed and exited WWII wondering why Italy hated its formerly beloved &amp;quot;Duce&amp;quot;. Today, Italian-style fascists are divided on the role of Aryan supremacy and anti-Semitism in their movement. All of them have their chins so upturned they can&amp;#39;t see the graves they&amp;#39;re walking on.

In memory of Italians who stood up for freedom and equality.
