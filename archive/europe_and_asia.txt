Welcome to Europe and Asia!

Every nation has a spot on the map! If you would like your nation on the map, send me a telegram (My nation is Iberica Peninsula) indicating where your nation is located. Nations can be in Europe or Asia (or both). Nations may not overlap other nation&amp;#39;s boundaries. We have a &amp;quot;first come, first serve&amp;quot; policy, meaning that if a nation already claims land you want, you cannot claim that land unless you were there first.
