[b] &amp;#9488;(&acute;&amp;#12540;&amp;#65344;)&amp;#9484;  Why I Started My Own Region[/b]:

I started this because I really did try. I tried to be kind, to talk to people, to make things brighter. I shared stories, jokes, ideas, or little bits of excitement and care that I thought might make the space feel alive.

But I was met with pretty intense distain. With people who misconstrued me, or laughed quietly behind DMs at me. I gave a lot of light to places that didn&#146;t want that.

So now I&#146;ve made somewhere that does. This region is just me, and that&#146;s okay, I suppose. It&#146;s a home for everything I built when I still believed people cared. It&#146;s quiet here, but it&#146;s kind. And maybe, someday, someone will see it and understand what I was trying to do.
