[b]We didn&#146;t set out to build a region.[/b] We set out to take part in one. We tried to bring light wherever we went. We reached out the way we thought communities wanted: openly, warmly, generously.

In too many places, that was met with dismissal, quiet mockery, and a sense that our presence was an inconvenience rather than a contribution. We realized we were offering light to people who simply didn&#146;t want it.
