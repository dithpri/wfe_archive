[b]I started this because I really did try. I tried to be kind, to talk to people, to make things brighter. I shared stories, jokes, ideas, or little bits of excitement and care that I thought might make the space feel alive.

But I was met with pretty intense distain. With people who misconstrued me, or laughed quietly behind DMs at me. I gave a lot of light to places that didn&#146;t want that.

So now I&#146;ve made somewhere that does. This region is mostly just my puppets at this point but I want to leave it open to anyone that needs respite or safety. Treat this region as safe harbor.[/b]
