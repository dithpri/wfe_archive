As the leader of a great nation we strive to better the live of each and every citizen I do not make a ruling on any proposals without the close consultation of my closest political advisers.. The United Nation of Carolina is a moderate supporter of capitalism, we strongly believe in creationism. One thing we are proud of is that we are a democratic nation. In saying that we believe that the only government that will succeed is a government that is by the people and for the people. As President I ensure that my country is safe, I will provide services for my people if needed, and I can not and will not ever negotiate with terrorist, dictators, and corrupt government officials.
