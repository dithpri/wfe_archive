The central hub for the New Lazerene Empire
Read below for our manifesto:
[hr]
[b]The New Lazarene Empire seeks to create a region for Lazarus in which the region is protected and the native nations get a free and fair democratic process. We want you to be a part of this mission. If we are to claim our control of Lazarus, we&#39;ll need to put officers of the New Lazarene Empire into power.

Doing this is very simple and easy, but we need your help. You need to go join the World Assembly if you haven&#39;t already, and go endorse our officers!

Officers:
[nation]Azazelai[/nation]
[nation]Vultopia II[/nation]
[nation]Dr Mcmannia Whitehall[/nation]
[nation]St Thraben[/nation]
