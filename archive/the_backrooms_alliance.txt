The Backrooms are an online urban legend originating from a creepypasta posted on a 2019 4chan thread. One of the most well-known examples of the Internet aesthetic of liminal spaces, which depicts usually busy locations as unnaturally empty, the Backrooms was first described as a maze of empty office rooms that can only be entered by &quot;noclipping out of reality&quot;.
