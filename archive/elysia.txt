[color=navy][b]Welcome to Elysia:[/b]
We are called to be good to our neighbors, friendly with the world, and representatives of our Alliance.  Elysia is home to some of the most diplomatic citizens.  Upon registration to the forum, new nations should visit our embassies there, and introduce yourselves.  Additionally, visit the other realms and see what they do and how the entire Alliance operates.  [/color]
