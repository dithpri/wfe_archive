Elysia is new and still in development.  Together we can create the most well known region ever. Our focus after we build up our government is to manage the foreign affairs with the five other realms in our Kingdom and to all the regions in the world.

Please remember to join the World Assembly and endorse one another to strengthen our bond.[/color]
