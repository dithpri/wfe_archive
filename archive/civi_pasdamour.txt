Civi Pasdamour is a small collection of nations tucked away from society. Hidden inside of a perpetual storm that rages in the southern ocean, Civi Pasdamour&amp;#39;s society is mainly focused on inventions and innovation. Dirigibles can be seen littering the skies of Civi Pasdamour while people on bicycles fitted with paper wings fly past at break-neck speed. 

Citizens study at prestigious universities, learning aerodynamics, form and function, engineering, and art. The leader of the region is referred to as &amp;quot;Captain&amp;#39;, as is usually greeted with a smile and a pat on the back. Over all, Civi Pasdamour can be described as a steampunk-like era where a little moxy and a heavy wrench can get you anywhere.
