The Simmoland Islands are located somewhere in the South Pacific. There are difficulties navigating to and from here, due to (among other things) strange weather phenomena, large squid-like octopodes and randomly relocating islands, meaning much communication and trade with the rest of the South Pacific is limited and the islands are essentially isolated.

As the islands are sitting on a fault line, they boast a number of small, active volcanoes, with constant generation of more islands. The rich volcanic soil allows much plant life (like forests), which supports the island&#39;s numerous animals. Some of the most impressive include large spiders, which roam in close family groups.
