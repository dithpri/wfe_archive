The Simmoland islands are located somewhere in the south pacific. These islands are generally forested and boast a large number of spiders.

Difficulties getting to and from the island mean it is somewhat isolated from the rest of the south pacific. Unusual weather, giant squid-like octopodes and randomly relocating islands hinder travelling to and from the islands safely.

Home to at least three nations, the people seem to be friendly. The standard currency used my most nations here is the Twix.
