 &amp;#127914; Welcome to the NationStates Fair! &amp;#127914;

 &amp;#127903;&amp;#65039; A region of amazing rides, rights, and ridiculous polls&#151; NationStates Fair is a cool community of nations gathering for government, fun, and the odd sense of a funnel cake. 

&amp;#128506;&amp;#65039; We&#39;re a haven for seasonal ringmasters and fun things in general. Major political guy, roleplayer, or chill guy, we&#39;ve got a tent for you in our fairgrounds.

&amp;#127878; What we offer:
&#149; Monthly regional events &amp;#127917;
&#149; Fun polls &amp;#128499;&amp;#65039;
&#149; Roleplay and rides
&#149; Clown Week&#153; (sometimes) &amp;#129313;

&amp;#128236; Stop by the Welcome Tent (message me) to get involved!

&amp;#9978; Now accepting embassy requests! Pull up a caravan and stay awhile.
