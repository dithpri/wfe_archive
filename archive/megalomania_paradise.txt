&amp;quot;Equality is a lie, a myth to appease the masses. Simply look around and you will see the lie for what it is! There are those with power, those with the strength and will to lead. And there are those meant to follow,those incapable of anything but servitude and a meager, worthless existence.&amp;quot;
