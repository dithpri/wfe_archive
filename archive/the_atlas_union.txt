Welcome to the empire!

The purpose of this region is to provide excellent, consistent and uniform education, health, environmental preservation and law to each nation part of the union. 

The basis of the Atlas Union is to be able to propose an opinion or law in the forum, and then we discuss it, and the respected WA Delegate or myself will set up a vote on it. Once the majority has it&amp;#39;s way, the new law will be mandatory across all nations, thus bringing us one step closer to our goals: excellent education, health, environmental and law services across our glorious Union!

Otherwise, enjoy your stay! :)

P.S. If you have any queries, feel free to ask me anything! :)
