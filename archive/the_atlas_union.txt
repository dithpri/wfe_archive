[b][color=green]Hello and welcome to Atlas Union![/color][/b]
 
The basis of the Atlas Union is to be able to propose an opinion or law in the forum, and then we discuss it, and the respected WA Delegate or Founder will set up a vote on it. Once the majority has its way, the new law will be mandatory across all nations, thus bringing us one step closer to our goals: excellent education, health, environmental and law services across our glorious union!
