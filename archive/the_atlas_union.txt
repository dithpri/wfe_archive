[b][color=green]Hello and welcome to Atlas Union![/color][/b]

The basis of the Atlas Union is to be able to propose an opinion or law in the forum we then discuss it, and the WA Delegate or Founder will set up a vote on it, thus bringing us one step closer to our goals: excellent education, health, environmental and law services across our glorious union!

We hope you enjoy your stay and if you have any questions feel free to ask!
