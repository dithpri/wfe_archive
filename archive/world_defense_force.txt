[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were soaring well above NationStates, when suddenly they saw... what&#39;s this? Something unexpected? They swooped down to take a better look at this shiny animal. When they got face to face with it, they could ask only one question: 

Who&#39;s a good girl? 

That&#39;s right, they met Lady, the Most Beautiful Doggo In The World. They came down to give her a good pat, before flying back home.
