After sometime of peace and quiet, the Sudland Peninsula has recently become home to the Queendom of [nation]Belcho[/nation], an upstart nation. This new nation has so far rejected the Democratic values of the other larger nations of Sudland. The region has also seen [nation]Wavlind[/nation] arrive again after a period of economic and political isolation. [nation]Gercandia[/nation] and [nation]SinnFien[/nation] still maintain the balance and peace of the Peninsula, and will work to ensure the continued safety and spread of democracy in the region.
