The Union of Obristan is a Region founded by Sjovenia but molded by a United Coalition. If you&#39;re looking for an active Roleplaying Region, then make Obristan your home. Active Role-plays can include but are not limited to the Winter Olympics, World War II, EuroVision, Beauty Pageants, Modern Tech, A Day In The Life, or even Future Tech. Whatever you Role-play, do it with Obristan.
