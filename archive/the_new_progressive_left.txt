Tired of the New Left creeping into the natural way of socialist life, We in the REAL Progressive Left advocate a return to socially conservative values and a democratic function.

We accept members from the far-right as they are naturally our allies in the class struggle and brings us closer to leftist unity!

I will not build embassies with regions whose governor is capitalist or too socially progressive.
