This country had been created by the Dutch and Flemish settlers , French Protestant refugees and German immigrants who adopted the name Afrikaners or Africans , as they had been there for over 4 centuries .
Today after the overthrown of the Apartheid , the White minority is living in poor slums and they are opressed by the rich now black upper class that controls the &quot;Rainbow country&quot; .

I am not racist or white supremacist
