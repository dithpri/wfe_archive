I miss the old Kanye, straight from the &#39;Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, s*** in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say at that time I&#39;d like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn&#39;t any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there&#39;s so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called &quot;I Miss The Old Kanye, &quot; man that would be so Kanye
That&#39;s all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
