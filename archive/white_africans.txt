Dedicated to those who braved uncharted country; the domain of the lion, the elephant, the buffalo, the rhinoceros, and the black mamba - carrying the torch on one of the few frontiers left to be civilised.

Dedicated to a unique identity which has evolved over the course of centuries, shaped by many trials and tribulations, triumphs and disasters.

And in fond memory of those settlers who became part of the fabric of Africa, to help the Dark Continent on the road to political maturity, instructing in matters of commerce and administration; those who took a pride in their homeland.
