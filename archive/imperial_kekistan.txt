Give me the memes
 I need the memes
 I smell the memes
 I need all the memes, the memes to survive
 I need the memes
 I breed the memes
 I smell the memes
 I need all the memes, the memes to survive


They call me the meme machine
I catch the memes, I spread the memes
I eat the memes, I sh*t the memes
 Without memes, I will die
 Inhale the memes
 Exhale the memes
Inject the memes into my bloodstream
 There are good memes, and there are bad memes
WHY HAS GOD ABANDONED US? (help me)
Smoke the memes, snort the memes
 Take the memes until you OD
If you borrowed my memes then you owe me
 A new fresh pair of memes
