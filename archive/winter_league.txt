[color=silver][b]*** Winter League, &quot;In Cold Necessity Bound&quot; ***[/b][/color]

[color=blue]The Winter League began as an alliance of trading nations
in the cold north of the world, bound together by the difficult

serious states united by pragmatism. They form the core of the
League as it goes forward to open new opportunities.[/color]
