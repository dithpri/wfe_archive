[b]Neverland[/b] is a fictional island featured in the works of J. M. Barrie and those based on them. It is an imaginary faraway place where Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Captain Hook, the Lost Boys, and some other imaginary beings and creatures live.

Although not all people who come to Neverland cease to age, its best-known resident, Peter Pan, famously refused to grow up. Thus, the term is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), as well as immortality and escapism. &#151;Wikipedia [hr]
