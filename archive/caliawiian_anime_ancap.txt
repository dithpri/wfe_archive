This region is a subsidiary of [region]The Caliawiian Circle[/region] and its main purpose is to be a place for [nation]Federal Republic of Serov[/nation] to argue with [nation]The Tony Paporordia[/nation]. 

My goal is to make a community and eventually make it a frontier. So feel free to join we&#146;ll have lots of embassies soon. Everyone is welcome here (you don&#146;t have to be AnCap) just don&#146;t violate the rules. We have many people willing to engage in conversation (mostly in other regions we have or are making embassies with) so if that&#146;s what you&#146;re looking for please join.

We have RP as well as R/D.

Rules for Residents:
1. Don&#146;t be a jerk (like [nation]The Tony Paporordia[/nation])
2. Don&#146;t be a N&amp;#64;zi
3. No truth denial
