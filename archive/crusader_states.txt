It was realized that this region CTE&#39;d at some point. Thankfully, the Emperor did not wish to see an honorable name like this go to waste or worse come under the control of the communists / socialist plague on NS. 

As such, the region has been put under the control of [region]The Nationalist Empire[/region]. If any honorable Crusaders wish to take up the Region. Simply telegram [nation]Nuevo Mexican Empire[/nation] to work out an agreement.
