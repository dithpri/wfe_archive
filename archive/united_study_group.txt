Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! This region proved More than a match for a charge by The Crap Riders!
Occupied by The Region Restorers! Our lair can be found [url=nationstates.net/region=Lazarus_grand_federation]here[/url]
After an occupation that lasted for months, the efforts of The Crap Riders were all in vain when Sergeant Lazarus of The Region Restorers descended upon the region and grabbed it from the clutches of the hopeless riders.

May this be a lesson to all those who dare stand in the face of The Region Restorers.
