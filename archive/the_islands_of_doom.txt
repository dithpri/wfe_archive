Welcome to [region]The islands of Doom[/region]!

Don&#146;t let the name scare you! We&#146;re full of friendly and outgoing people with lots of room to spare! We have miles of beaches, tons of coral reefs, and more hotel rooms than houses. 

But, before we get too settled, let&#146;s go over a few rules. 

1. The Regional Currency is the Doom Coin. You don&#146;t have to adopt it but it is recommended you do. 

2. Basically, don&#146;t be a jerk. But also don&#146;t freak out and go crazy if someone is. Your regional leaders will assist you if needed. 

3. Keep it chill. [region]The Islands of Doom[/region] have a no-stress policy. The best part of being here is that it&#146;s a constant vacation! You have nothing to worry about! So put your feet up, relax, and enjoy your stay.
