Welcome to [region]The islands of Doom[/region]!

Don&#146;t let the name scare you! We&#146;re full of friendly and outgoing people with lots of room to spare! We have miles of beaches, tons of coral reefs, and more hotel rooms than houses! The best part of being here is that it&#146;s a constant vacation! You have nothing to worry about! So put your feet up, relax, and enjoy your stay.
