Animal Farm United will look at anyone who joins my region as a friend, not enemy. You will get food, shelter, and etc. (virtual, of course, sometimes nonexistent as well) and you will not regret that you have joined our region until you leave.

That&amp;#39;s all. Peace out. Go raid some nations. Support Animal Farm. Yeah.
