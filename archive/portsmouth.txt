The seaport city is a major naval base and, with Southsea, a popular holiday resort. Located on the island of Portsea in the English Channel, Portsmouth was founded and received its first charter in 1194. A naval dockyard was established in 1496 and greatly expanded after 1698. Covering more than 300 acres (120 hectares), the dockyard is the city&amp;#39;s main source of employment. 

Portsmouth suffered extensive damage from German bombing in World War II. Important industries are shipbuilding and aircraft engineering. The city was the birthplace of Charles Dickens. &#151;Merriam-Webster
