Welcome to the New Western Alliance!

The treaty was originally made by the [b][u][nation]Neo-European Territories[/nation][/u][/b] and [b][u][nation]Neo-American Territories[/nation][/u][/b], both nations deriving from Western Civilization, but splintered off due to a fundamental difference in ideals and rising tensions in their respective homelands.

The nation of [b][u][nation]Biggegod[/nation][/u][/b] was once a continent adjacent to, and part of, the Neo-European Territories, but they split off. Years down the line, they became allies, and Biggegod would be invited to join the New Western League.
