This wonderful region is... Flying! Yes its flying over many places.  This region has many panthers and Soav is a wonderful place to live in. Well it is if you like nice and quiet places,  remember always be respectful of other peoples beliefs but if someone gets their religion (athiesm, buddahism, hindu, ect.) way too far a crusade will be called to destroy their nation. Enjoy soav :)
