The International Coalition of Nations, otherwise known as the ICN, is an organization of nations from the Council of Nine region that have reformed the region into a more appropriate region for both it&#146;s member nations and its inter-regional partners. The ICN has pinned various dispatches within the region to help those who are just beginning in their journey through NationStates. The ICN has a WA Delegate and Vice-Delegate that allows the region to participate in WA Politics. If a subtle compassionate region is what you&#146;re looking for, we formally welcome you to the ICN.
