If you need anything just send a telegram!
We can rek all other regions!

We are against nuclear fusion as you can see by our flag!
[b]This is why:[/b]
[i]Unproven at anything resembling commercial scale.
No full scale production expected till at least 2050
Commercial power plants would be extremely expensive to build
Requires extremely high temperatures. Difficult to contain
Could produce a net negative amount of energy
If cold fusion could be achieved, it would be much easier to implement.
The billions in research funding could be spent on renewables instead
Would remove any incentive for restraint in the use of energy.[/i] [b]From: http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/07/fusion-power-pros-cons/[/b]
