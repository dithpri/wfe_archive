The Free Land of Franklin Delano Roosevelt12 is a tiny, socially progressive nation, renowned for its compulsory military service, frequent executions, and compulsory vegetarianism. The compassionate, hard-working, democratic, devout population of 8 million Franklin Delano Roosevelt12ians enjoy a sensible mix of personal and economic freedoms, while the political process is open and the people&#39;s right to vote held sacrosanct.

The tiny government juggles the competing demands of Spirituality, Defense, and Welfare. The average income tax rate is 9.2%, but much higher for the wealthy.
