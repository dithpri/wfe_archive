Located on the planet of Arenari, the ASA is comprised of a coalition of countries bound together by the common goal of furthering the development of their respective peoples by sharing one another&amp;#39;s resources. Every country governs its own in the way it sees fit. However, there is a common set of tenants that all member countries must agree to before admittance:
_____________________________
Diplomacy
Peace
Life
Liberty
Happiness
Furtherment
_____________________________
Guided by these tenants, the Council of Delegates-comprised of one Delegate from every member nation, a Basileous, Vice Delegate, and Grammatour-carry out and enforce the wishes of the Conventus-the peoples congress.
