Welcome to Mount Greatness! Every nation is welcome here - just remember that troublemakers can be ejected and banned.

If you are a World Assembly member, please endorse [nation]East Sardakhar[/nation] as our region&amp;#39;s delegate. Thankfully, the delegate cannot access regional control. So sorry about that, raiders!

If you are not a World Assembly member, feel free to stay around without having to join.
