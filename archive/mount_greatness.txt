[b]All nations are welcome here, WA or non-WA, with all their ideologies! If you are a member of the World Assembly, please endorse [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=east_sardakhar]East Sardakhar[/url] as Delegate for the stability of the region. Refusal or negligence to do so will result in banjection as swiftly as possible. Also, be careful with your manners. Troublemakers can be banjected too![/b]

[b]Endorsement cap (for nations other than the Delegate of course): [u]0[/u][/b]

[b]Telegram [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=sardakhar]Sardakhar[/url] for further information. And raiders, you won&amp;#39;t be able to do anything if you take the delegacy, so if you want to invade, forget about it![/b]
