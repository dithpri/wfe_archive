You&#39;ve been visited by the NPA! We left some cookies and water at the door, plus a really cool looking pink thing. I stared at it for too long and everything looks like roses now, so maybe don&#39;t glance at it too much. Don&#39;t forget to drink lots of water, and get some outside time! Also, know that if you&#39;re feeling lazy, or tired, or just plain stressed, remember that a quick break to recharge is never a mistake. And make sure you&#39;ve been drinking water, you might be dehydrated.
