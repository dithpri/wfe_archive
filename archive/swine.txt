[b][color=#FF0000]It has come to my attention that everyone likes to engage in a heated debates. This ended recently with a ban without my consulting on the matter. The banned has been unbanned, but all heated debates are banned, because in the end, it&amp;#39;s the root of all problems on our RMB.
