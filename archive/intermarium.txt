Intermarium, was a plan pursued after World War I by Polish leader Pi&amp;#322;sudski for a federation of Central and Eastern European countries. Invited to join the proposed federation were the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.

Intermarium complemented Pi&amp;#322;sudski&#39;s other geopolitical vision&#151;Prometheism, whose goal was the dismemberment of the Russian Empire and that Empire&#39;s divestment of its territorial acquisitions.

Within two decades of the failure of Pi&amp;#322;sudski&#39;s grand scheme, all the countries that he had viewed as candidates for membership in the Intermarium federation had fallen to the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, except for Finland.
