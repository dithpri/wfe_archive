A small region in the North. The peoples are fond of the populations of polar bears that live disturbingly close to towns. All other breeds of bear are shunned, with limited exceptions. They are descendants of the Nordics, but with slight mutations due to their overwhelming consumptions of fluoride in their chicken. The small cluster of countries take civil rights as a priority... with one exception. They are also proud of their powerful economies.
