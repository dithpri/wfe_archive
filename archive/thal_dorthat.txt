[b][color=crimson]Welcome to the Colony Planet of Thal Dorthat, on the very edge of the galaxy.

Thal Dorthat orbits a gas giant around Neptune, the size of [region]Triton[/region]. A largely uninhabited moon, Thal Dorthat has an incredibly small population of 1 million people, compared to the population estimates of 100 billion Humans spread across the galaxy and around 12 trillion total members of species.
