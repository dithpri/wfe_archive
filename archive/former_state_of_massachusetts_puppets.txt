Dear [nation who is reading this] ,

This is a puppet region, obliviously. I get really creative nation ideas, so I got quite a few puppets. They serve no purpose but I can&#39;t have them scattered in different regions, so I made this region for them and them only. The only nations allowed here are [nation]Eire Agus Albion[/nation] puppets. No World Assembly nations will ever be here so don&#39;t expect any to show up, I will not break the rules.

P.S. If you need a embassy built, we accept almost anyone except raiders/invader regions so feel free to sent embassy proposals!

Sincerely,

[nation]Eire Agus Albion[/nation]
