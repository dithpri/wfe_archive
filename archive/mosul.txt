[color=green]Greetings, distinguished arrivals, pass through the [b]Nergal Gate[/b]&#151;guarded by colossal human-headed bulls with majestic wings&#151;to the [b]Pearl of the North[/b]!

The region offers every nation a [b]Green Paradise[/b], for the mighty [i]Tigris[/i] runs through the expanse with delightful parks along its extremely verdant shores.

After enjoying the various natural pleasantries, treat the senses to the exotic cuisine: such as [i]qouzi[/i], a giant mound of rice topped with slow-roasted choice pieces of lamb with raisins and pine nuts, and [i]shish taouk[/i], flavorful marinated chicken cubes grilled on skewers and may be served with French fries.[/color]
