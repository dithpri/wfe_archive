Gringuttar is a open-minded community that values the freedom of speech and the fellowship among its members. The only way to get banned here is trying to annoy or raid us.
We can talk on the Regional Board in Portuguese and French too. When you join, we would appreciate if say their local language (and ask if anyone here also speaks, of course). Our cultural diversity is both inside (all kinds of political and religious views are accepted) and outside the game.
