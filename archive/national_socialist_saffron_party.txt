[I]Captured: 07.11.14[/I]

[color=red]Formally an Extreme Right Wing region which promoted Nazism.[/color]

[color=blue]It was captured by the Mighty Anti-Fascist Warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and now serves as a living museum against hate. 

This victory serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]
