In the Empire of Bookworms,
Where Tobyopolis and Flurptopia reign,
Peace and freedom abound,
Fair treatment for all who dwell.

In the United States Of Tobyopolis,
Pages of knowledge and stories unfold,
A land of wisdom and open minds,
Where the pursuit of truth is revered.

In the Dictatorship of Flurptopia,
Words weave and command with grace,
A realm of imagination and creativity,
Where the power of language knows no bounds.
