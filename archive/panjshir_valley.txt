On June 20, 2024, the Panjshir Valley, also known as Thermopylae from Volkisch Sparta, was removed from NationStates due to malicious content.   The individual responsible was a self-proclaimed Quranist who supported a form of slavery, eugenics, and fascism in Thermopylae, going against Islamic principles even mentioned in the Quran (Quran 6:151). Additionally, he worshipped gods other than Allah, leading to their downfall.   Consequently, successors were appointed by the will of Allah to govern the region as part of an anti-fascist effort.   Allahu Akbar.
