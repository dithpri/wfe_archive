[b]Panjshir Valley[/b] used to be an anti-anti-fascist region, which is a really stupid way of saying fascist supporters. They also had a list of &quot;Jihadist&quot; regions which they attempted to destroy. Unfortunately for them they sucked greatly at this and only managed to refound [region]Al Quds[/region].

They had a few notable ties to fascist regions but after the founder was DEATed, the region&#39;s activity would falter.
But inactivity isn&#39;t dead and so I did a little silly, gained an RO position and waited until the right moment to strike. As you can see this region is now nothing more then a trophy
