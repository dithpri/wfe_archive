The continent of Mars, Vesuvia B15 in the Vesuvian system is one of the largest continents on the planet, notable for its access to water and its history. Original settlers formed the &quot;Tsardom of Mars&quot; in 2045, nearly 200 years later it fell apart. It now contains the 3rd Republic of The Martian Realm, The Federation of the Martian Realm and the Veronan empire.
