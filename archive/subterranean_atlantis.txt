This is a region located underneath Atlantis, below the ocean floor. All of the nations in this region get their light from a series of large, active, underground shield volcanoes. These volcanoes&#39; magma flows through tempered glass pipes high above the sub-ocean floor, which provide the region&#39;s light. All of our nations&#39; power comes from geothermal energy or currents from the ocean above. Volcano observatories are very common with nations near these gigantic structures of cooled magma, and they usually attract tourists from above. Above the glass pipes, narwhals rule the sub-ocean, some of which are sentient. Tourists enjoy swimming with the narwhals with SCSBA (Self Contained Sub-Ocean Breathing Apparatus) tanks.
