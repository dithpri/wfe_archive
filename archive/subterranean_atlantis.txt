This is a region located under Atlantis, beneath the ocean floor. Above us, but below the ocean, magma flows through glass tubes, lighting our region. The magma is brought upward by the pressure from a nearby active volcano. The light is enough for surface plants to grow, as well as some unique species. What we call the ocean is actually different from the surface ocean, though it is almost identical qualitatively. In our great oceans live a variety of narwhals, some of which are sentient.
                                                       
The region has recently seen a great influx of peoples that have moved from many different parts of the world. It is now a thriving community.
