The Union of Sovereigns is a regional alliance of fiercely independent states, bound not by centralized control, but by mutual respect, shared defense, and cooperative diplomacy. Formed in response to rising authoritarian blocs and raider threats, the Union serves as a sanctuary for self-governing nations seeking to preserve their sovereignty while working together on global challenges.

Each member retains full autonomy, but contributes to regional initiatives, crisis response, and cultural exchange. The Union&#146;s guiding philosophy is that independence does not mean isolation &#151; and strength is multiplied when nations stand as equals.
