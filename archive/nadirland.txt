Nadirland is named for the word &quot;nadir&quot; which means &quot;low point&quot;. We are definitely a low point, but we thrive in that low point. Here in Nadirland, we believe in the freedom to say whatever we want. All friends at the same school, we challenge each other&#39;s nations and banter freely in the Board. Our polls are usually as crazy as we are--a tradition is yelling the name POONEMA in the comments, our mystical land. If you wish to join us, you have to prove by telegram to one of the nations that you can handle joking, craziness, and weird countries. In response, you shall receive our secret password in order to become part of our region. We are open to all embassy proposals and would love to have you join our land.
