This Region is a multi-species post-modern tech, [B]heavy RP[/B] region, this means you&#39;re allowed to create your own race for your nation, although play as just humans is encouraged. 

We don&#39;t engage in any of the invader/defender playstyles, we&#39;re here just to have fun and RP.

[nation]Dechen[/nation] and other admins will do what they can to keep this updated and consistent. 
An admin position is gained by just showing you&#39;re trustworthy and are capable of the job, simple really. You will remain in office until you resign, or the region/executives deem you unfit for service. &amp;lt;3 (we still love you)
