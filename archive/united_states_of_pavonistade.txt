Following the dissolution of the first United States of Pavonistade, representatives have agreed to establish a succeeding union that better unites and includes influences of all Pavonistade-minded member states. Henceforth, on August 12, 2014, the Second United States of Pavonistade will be established on the very same soils that the first USP had occupied, and now all member states can peacefully rest in this region.

Any people attempting to bypass USP security will be met with sticks and stones, 19th-century rifles, plasma blasts, spacetime continuum disruption, hydrokinetic megatsunamis, interdimensional altercation, and mutant ocelots. [b]INTRUDERS BEWARE![/b]
