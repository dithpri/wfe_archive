The dissolution of the first United States of Pavonistade led to a succeeding union that better unites all Pavonistade-minded member states. On August 12, 2014, the Second United States of Pavonistade will be created and all member states can peacefully rest in this region. Any people* attempting to bypass USP security will be met with extreme force. [b]INTRUDERS BEWARE![/b]
[hr]*Allow us to amend this. We will now extend the definition of &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; to include zombies, which have been cured out of existence! Our men, women, children, pets, etc. have lived through the apocalypse without a single dying. The glory of the USP has been redeemed to all nations, and may this great union live on![/b]
