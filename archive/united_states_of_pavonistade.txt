The dissolution of the first United States of Pavonistade led to a succeeding union that better unites all Pavonistade-minded member states. On August 12, 2014, the Second United States of Pavonistade will be created and all member states can peacefully rest in this region. Any people* attempting to bypass USP security will be met with extreme force. [b]INTRUDERS BEWARE![/b]
[hr]*Allow us to amend this. We will now extend the definition of &amp;quot;people&amp;quot; to include zombies. This comes after our almighty leader, Max Barry, forewarned all about a coming apocalypse. We the United States of Pavonistade shall stand united against the undead and we will not stop until we CTE or they CTE!
