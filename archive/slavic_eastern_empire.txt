Eastern Europe is the region of slavic people.  A region with beutiful forest, wheatfields, Vodka and patriotic People Who fight for their Empire and homes. The many slavic nations have finally become one slavic Empire where every slav is a considered a comrade. The People can live their lives however they want and choose what to do with them but you must  never oppose the Slavic Empire for then you oppose your own slavic bloodline and People. Don&#39;t fu*k with the Bear.
