Tagwaran is a small, diverse region with a focus on world-building. Most of Tagwaran is a single landmass with a temperate climate, but there are a number of islands in the West Tagwaran Sea that are dependent on the region. The dominant ethnic groups of Tagwaran are the [i]ourd[/i], who make up the majority of the region&#39;s populace and are concentrated in north-west Tagwaran and the Western Isles, and the [i]silil[/i], who are concentrated in the south-east. In the last few centuries, immigration from around the world has rendered Tagwaran increasingly diverse, but these two cultures continue to make up substantial minorities in every nation.
