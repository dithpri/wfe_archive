Tagwaran is a region for worldbuilders. If you are a modern tech nation that&#39;s more interested in designing a nation than role-playing, this may be the place for you. 

See the pinned factbook for an IC overview of the region, and feel free to send a telegram to the founder if you&#39;d like your nation included.

Note: Due to raiding, the WA Delegate&#39;s powers have been removed until further notice.
