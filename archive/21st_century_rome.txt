The next one we will be celebrating will be the Ludi Plebeii, or Plebeian Games, from November 4-17th.
The rules during the games: I will send a telegram each day and everyone can telegram their guess to me. Everyone gets 2 denarios for each correct answer. No looking up answers on the internet! It ruins all the fun. The person with the most denarios gained from this will gain 5 bonus denarios.
