The next one we will be celebrating will be the Ludi Plebeii, or Plebeian Games, from November 4-17th.
The rules during the games: I will send a telegram to the plebians each day. Everyone can send me a telegram with their guess to the answer. At the end, everyone gets 2 denarios for each correct answer. No looking up answers on the internet! It ruins all the fun.
