The next one we will be celebrating will be the Ludi Plebeii, or Plebeian Games, from November 4-17th.
The rules during the games: I will send a telegram to the plebians each day. Everyone can send me a telegram with their guess to the answer. At the end, everyone gets their percentage of the total correct answers worth of denarios out of twenty. No looking up answers on the internet! It ruins all the fun.

I have some extra fun if we can get at least two patricians by then. (while still keeping 2 plebeians)
