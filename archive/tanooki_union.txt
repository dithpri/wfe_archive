Tanooki Union has shut down for the holidays. We are back properly on Jan 4th 2021. Feel free to join the discord server and request a map spot, though I may be slower than usual. I highly encourage peeps to write a thing or two on the forum too, as I&#146;d like to keep the pace of the roleplay going, if you&#146;re trying to access the roleplay just &amp;#64;Northern Drax on Discord.


Happy Holidays from [nation]Northern Drax[/nation]
