[B][color=orange]Welcome![/color][/B]

The Kenzoran Union greets you! We are a new region, founded on the 25th August 2014. We plan to have some interesting things in this region, such as Internal Region wars (aka, Nation 1 vs Nation 2, but Nation 1 calls in it&amp;#39;s allies), which can affect a regional map! The regional map will show how much power you have, as the larger you are, the more power you receive. There is a nice roleplay aspect to the game, and it is designed to be a way you can have fun. We will have simplistic politics, which isn&amp;#39;t too difficult for the newest to understand. We have a forum, and the regional map is being made! You can vote for what you want, and enjoy yourself!
