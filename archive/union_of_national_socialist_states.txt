[b][i][color=black]We are Nationalist and Socialist. We are a community of workers as much bound to our own people&#39;s ancestral and cultural heritage as we are bound in our people&#39;s legacy to come. [/i][/color]

[color=#b30000]1. Everything that nature gave to the people belongs in principle to the people as a whole.

2. Production remains the possession of the individual. The state guarantees that those contributing to production, whether physically or mentally, share in the ownership and profits.

3. Production that is essentially completed, (e.g., the transportation system, trusts, conglomerates) will be brought back to state ownership. We will free labor from the chains of wage slavery.[/color]
