[b]Land of the PAWGs.[/b]

The region is password protected for the time being, but all cool leaders and cool nations are welcome.

(Like if I&amp;#39;ve sent you a telegram telling you how cool your nation is, the Pawgs would be grateful to you
if you decided to call the Pawgland Region your home, or if you decided to establish a colony here.)

If you want to join, ask [nation]Pawgland[/nation] or [nation]Pawgland Founder[/nation]
for the password, and if you&amp;#39;re cool, I&amp;#39;ll give it to you.

If we&amp;#39;ve sent you a request to establish an embassy, it means we think your region is cool!

And thanks for visiting!
