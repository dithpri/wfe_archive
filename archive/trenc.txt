[color=green][b]Welcome Nations to [region]Trenc[/region]![/b][/color]

Trenc is a group of countries, friends, and that aims to improve national and economic relations.
Our motto is: &quot;[i]Death to [color=red]socialism[/color]![/i]&quot;.

Overall, we&#39;re pretty friendly despite the motto. Also, no communist/socialist or left-wing countries are allowed. We abhor this [color=red]murderous ideology[/color]!

The flag is a mixture of the green color of the flag of Benauria and the blue color of the flag of Finallians, the first two nations of the block. And two white stars, which symbolize peace between nations.
