An intersex person may have sex characteristics or organs that are not typically male or female. Intersex medical interventions are considered permissible to achieve agreement between a person&#39;s exterior, chromosomal make-up or sex organs. They are regarded as treatment and not the altering of Allah&#39;s creation or imitation of the opposite sex[hr][i]Corrective surgery fixes deformity affecting the sex organs to achieve agreement between a person&#146;s exterior and chromosomal make-up and his or her sex organs. This kind of surgery is permissible because what it achieves is treatment and not the altering of Allah&#146;s creation or imitation of the opposite sex[/i]
