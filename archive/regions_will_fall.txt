Welcome to &amp;#39;[b]REGIONS WILL FALL[/b]&amp;#39;.
We are a strong and free but humble region that was raided by [region]The Black Riders[/region] twice (for [i]55 days[/i]) but was counter-raided twice by [region]The League of Defenders[/region].

Our official regional animal is the [b]Chuck Norris[/b] ([i]homo sapiens indestructible[/i]). They will never die and only fight if aggravated by species such as Snookis, Honey Boo Boos along with Mama Junes, species mentioned by [i]J.R.R. Tolkein[/i], and other mythical and fictional creatures. The Chuck Norris is small but mighty due to their inability to cope with having too many children. Our spirit is identical in many ways to the [i]Chuck Norris[/i].
