We are the [LN] League of Nations, a new REAL role playing and diplomacy clan that will be TRULY dedicated to everyone being able to play a more enjoyable game with fun and serious role players.  This region here is also the original one on Nationstates from Warlight (now there are several).  I understand the name still has &amp;quot;UN&amp;quot; in it, but unfortunately it cannot be changed.  Just pretend the &amp;quot;U&amp;quot; is an &amp;quot;L&amp;quot; ;)
