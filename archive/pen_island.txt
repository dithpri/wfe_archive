Pen Island is the magical island of glorious writing utensils near the southeastern coast of Africa. Many skinny, smooth, ink- filled appendages fill this beautiful oasis of love. It is a mysterious and wonderful place that, like Atlantis, is believed to exist somewhere off the southern part of the western coast of a well known landmass. Since no commoner has ever seen Pen Island, no one knows where Pen Island is. However, it is believed to be located in the Philippenis. On Pen Island, you can find the leader of Lichtegermanioscotlonium, the Owner of this spectacular island. He has the biggest pen on the island.
