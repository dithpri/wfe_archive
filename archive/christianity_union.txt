Welcome to the [colour=navy][u][b]Christianity Union[/b][/u][/colour] region. This region is for Christians. Whilst the founder is from the [url=https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/our-faith/our-beliefs/]Salvation Army[/url], all Christian denominations are welcome as long as they uphold core Biblical truths (which all Christian denominations should).
These truths are:
[colour=darkred]1. God is the Trinity of the Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Spirit; shown through the Bible&#39;s Old and New Testaments[/colour] [colour=#ffd700]2. Jesus&#39; death and resurrection is the only atonement for the whole world and people are saved when they believe, trust and act upon it[/colour] [colour=navy]3. The moral law of Old and New Testaments define the way lives should be lived due to their God-breathed authority over all; namely, history, wisdom and faith[/colour]
