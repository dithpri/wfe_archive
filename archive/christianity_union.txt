Welcome to the region. This region is for Christians and those who want to learn about Christ. Whilst the founder is from the Salvation Army, all Christian denominations are welcome as long as they uphold core Biblical truths (which all Christian denominations should).

These truths are:
* God is the Trinity of the Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Spirit; shown through the Bible&#39;s Old and New Testaments
* Jesus&#39; death and resurrection is the only atonement for the whole world and people are saved when they believe, trust and act upon it
* The moral law of Old and New Testaments define the way lives should be lived due to their authority over all; namely, history, wisdom and faith
