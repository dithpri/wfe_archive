[b]Welcome![/b][hr]

[color=royalblue]Hello! Welcome to the Ramen shop. My name is [nation=short]Lee Chung Ah[/nation] and I&amp;#39;ll be your waitress for today. This region is a fun little region where everyone can put aside their differences and enjoy a nice pot of ramen. I hope you enjoy the food, and if you plan to stay, then thank you! [/color]

[color=scarlet]This region is mostly a roleplaying region in which characters interact in enjoying ramen. We accept all ideologies, philosophies, classifications and genders, as a restaurant should. Due to this toleration there will be no delegate, for we recognize intentions of raiders to take over just because they want to. [/color]

Other than that, I hope you enjoy your stay!
