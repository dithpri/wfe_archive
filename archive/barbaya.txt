 The Barabayan region has had a extremely violent past, considering it has not existed for long. The four original nations were the Zanian Kingdom, Mossor Labs Authority, Kingdom Zephyrus, and the Cryodilllic Republic. Zephyrus and Cryodilllic, in their alliance, quickly dominated the area, but Mossor Labs Authority had already quickly risen to the challenge. Zanian Kingdom had first allianced with Mossor Labs Authority, but had switched to the side of Zephyrus and Cryodilllic once the tide of war changed. A peace treaty was made with most land going to Zephyrus, Cryodilllic, and Zanian. The area is now much more peaceful than it was in the past, but tensions still run high between Kingdom Zephyrus and Mossor Labs.
