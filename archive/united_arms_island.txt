The United Arms Island is the native island of the Mavs. The Onoks came from the northern most area of the island, and the Mavs were further south. After the Onoks conqured the Mavs, the legendary Yen Kunu raised a makeshift Militia in order to take down the Onoks. In about 35 BCE, Yen Kunu&amp;#39;s Militia completely overwhelmed the Onoks that occupied the area, and drove them back. Since then, the President Jake Cartman in 1042 CE completely took over the island, renaming it from the Motherland Island to the United Arms Island. Now, President Yen R. Kunu the 21st invites other countries to join the largest Alliance know in all of humanity, the United Arms.
