Welcome to [color=gold]The Pact of Ribbons and Steel[/color], a region dedicated to the expansion of democracy and political freedom. Closely aligned with the [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=506528][color=cornflowerblue]Restoration Alliance[/color][/url] and [color=blue][url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?t=507634&amp;f=5&amp;view=unread#unread]EAO[/url][/color], the Pact devotes itself to the international community and celebrates [color=008B8B]diversity[/color], [color=hotpink]freedom[/color], and [color=FF4500]unity[/color].

The Pact is led by the Committee headed by the WA delegate. The founder, currently [nation]South Olpen[/nation], chooses the members of the ruling Committee. The Executive is chosen by the WA Delegate, [nation]Pan-European State[/nation]. The WA Delegate is in turn elected by the people in regional elections (except now because somehow I got delegate).

Endorse our delegate [nation]Pan-European State[/nation] (if you want too of course).
