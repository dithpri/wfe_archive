The Orange Bay Region, centered on Orange Kiss Island, is a secluded archipelago in the Central Azure Sea. Governed by the Tribal Confederacy of Orange Kiss Island with its capital at Orange Kiss City, the twelve clans&#151;Reef, Tide, Flame, Cloud, Fruit, Stone, Song, Root, Horizon, Wave, Dawn, and Ember&#151;follow the Way of the Sunfruit, honoring balance between land, sea, and spirit. Known as the &#147;undiscovered discovered tribe,&#148; the Oranik people say they were found only when they chose to be seen.
