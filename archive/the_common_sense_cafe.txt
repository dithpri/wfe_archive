&laquo; [i]Not a safe space[/i] &raquo;[/color]

Welcome to the caf&eacute;! Pull up a luxurious nonexistent chair and try our fine coffee! (Or tea if you&#39;re not a coffee person. Or really any other beverage.)

This is a region dedicated to intellectual, civilized discussion of life and its issues, but we welcome all nations who don&#39;t mind having their opinions challenged. Just kick back and relax; we&#39;re not too serious here.
