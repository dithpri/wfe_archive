GAH! SO MANY POLES! AND THIS FABRIC! SO UNCOOPERATIVE!
Next time the [b][color=blue]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republic[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color][/b] goes camping, we&#39;re just going to build a cabin or something... because this is just too much. Anyway, I&#39;m going back to [region]Europeia[/region], they&#39;ve got tv and girl scout cookies there, none of this weird popcorn.
