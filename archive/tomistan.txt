Tomistan was named after a magnificent, sprawling nation, located in a six foot radius around the Great and Mighty Tom, Lord of the Foxes and condoner of PTC.

Comprised mostly of extremely socialistic countries, the region is the budding place of corruption and discord. Living there would almost certainly entail complete lack of privacy, recruitment to the local military, and premature death. Side effects may include kidney loss, flogging, or being sacrificed.

However, there are some exceptions; a few nations in Tomistan are the polar opposite, with little to no government, enormous businesses, and people that are happy.
