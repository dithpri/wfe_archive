Welcome to the West Tropicals, a land representing dictators and anti-democracy at it&amp;#39;s core. In this region, you are free to govern your region without fear of being forced into democracy. However, people who do are still welcomed with somewhat open arms. Which is why we allow WA members in despite the fact we are completely against it. How else do you expect us to make a difference?

Enjoy your stay!
