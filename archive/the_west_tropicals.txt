[color=#000061]Post battle, the following riders have shamed their group with a stain on their infamous line of victories:[/color]
[nation=short]Feuer Ritter[/Nation]
[nation=short]Coraxion[/nation]
[nation=short]Parkanos[/nation]
[nation=short]The Realm of No Return[/nation]
[nation=short]The Ninth Clockwork[/nation]
