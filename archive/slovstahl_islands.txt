[b]Slovstahl Islands[/b] is a region of the Zastric Sea archipelago and several small areas of the Ugrozian continent, where the region borders [region]The Floof Bay[/region]. The region was founded by [nation]Dapania[/nation], [nation]Zondark[/nation] and [nation]Thaineton[/nation] (regionally represented by it&#39;s colony, [nation]Etriyan Islands[/nation]) as a group of nearby independent countries to form a co-working and co-developing community, focused strongly on trade and economical development, consisting of all Zastric Sea nations: [nation]Dapania[/nation], [nation]Etriyan Islands[/nation], [nation]Future Moldova[/nation] and [nation]Zondark[/nation]. Unlike the neighbouring region, Slovstahl is a dominantly human region (almost exclusively with the exclusion of Etriya - 70% humans).
