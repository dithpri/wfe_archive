We, the three independent nations of the Commonwealth of Vermare, the Federation of Aisyalam, and the Holy Empire of Northwesteros, hereby declare our union into one international organisation known as &#147;The Federated Union&#148; (FU).

Together, our great nations have pledged loyalty under the FU banner. Together we will pledge resources, economic and military cooperation, and cultural affinity among member states.

The FU acknowledges the right of member states to sovereignty. Each nation will retain their independent rights to laws and policies enacted within their borders without intervention from the FU.
