[color=#EEC900][b]From the deep depths of[/color][I][color=red] Santa&#39;s asshole,[/color][/I][color=#EEC900] comes the one thing man has always feared,[/color][color=#CCCC00] women.[/b][/color] [I]

Women ruled the world in the beginning, when man was weak.  When the day came that man discovered fire, knowledge came with it. Using both knowledge and fire they pushed women into submission, forcing them to follow the ways of the slut. In order to keep them submitted man developed chains. With these chains, women became the sluts God wanted them to be. As time moved on, men felt guilty and freed the women, but some didn&#39;t feel the same.[/I]
