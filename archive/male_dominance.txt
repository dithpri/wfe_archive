Elves ruled the world in the beginning, when man was weak.  When the day came that man discovered fire, knowledge came with it. Using both knowledge and fire they pushed the North Pole into submission, forcing them to follow the ways of the slave. In order to keep them submitted man developed chains. With these chains, Santa became the slut Alex wanted him to be. As time moved on, some men felt guilty and freed Santa, but Alex didn&#39;t feel the same, and killed the ones who felt guilty and slaved Santa once again.[/I]
