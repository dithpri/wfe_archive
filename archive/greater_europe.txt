[b]Greater Europe[/b] refers to the idea of an extended or developed Europe. This generally implies a Europe which transcends traditional boundaries, including trans-Eurasian countries, or those in close proximity with a strong European heritage.

It may specifically deal with future scenarios of enlargement or development of the European Union, to the point of a Federal Europe or the Eurosphere, or a &quot;re-unified&quot; Europe after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
