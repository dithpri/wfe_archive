This region will be an example of democracy in NationStates.

The government will have free political parties, with a Regional Council as the governing body. Legislation will carry over from [region]The One and Only[/region]. RP is un-restricted, but it must take place on the forums. 

[region]The New Kasselian Union [/region]will strive to create a safe haven of democracy for all nations, regardless of government. All can thrive here, no matter who you are! This is a place to put away your bias, and work together to further propel this region into greatness!
