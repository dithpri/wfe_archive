A flock of [url=region=the_black_hawks][color=#803000]hawks[/color][/url], joined by some [url=region=lair_of_the_dragon][color=#803000]dragons[/color][/url], were migrating across regions when they noticed they were moving rather slowly. Operating on a strict deadline, they decided to jettison the cargo they were carrying to speed up the journey. Unfortunately, this cargo happened to be a few hundred pounds of explosive material, directly above this region!

If you&#39;d like to be part of our next migration, [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]join us at our nest[/url]!
