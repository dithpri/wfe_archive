We founded our nation to create a place where freedom and equality is for all. All nations in this Federation will be given every opportunity that I can provide to keep our nations safe, have free speech, and a very open government to allow for everyone to get a more equal part in expanding and building our Federation.  
As a federation, I want to emphasize everyone ability to have freedom of speech. I will have daily polls where we can decide on issues more as a group to provide more appropriate legislation to improve the needs all our nations to the best of my abilities.
