The Foothold to get used to NationStates is for new nations who don&#39;t have a region, but want to be in one, but can&#39;t find one. We accept all nations, new or old, and let everybody leave, for this is merely a foothold. However, you can stay on to become an officer or delegate. You must stay for at least ten days to get that option.
