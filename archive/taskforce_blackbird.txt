What began as an elite military unit in the service of capitalists has now shifted allegiances dramatically. Like many other laborers throughout the history of the world, [b]Taskforce Blackbird[/b] realized they could do their jobs better by self-organization. They easily overthrew their profit-driven masters, but then came a period of introspection. The ex-mercenaries discovered the historical precedents of the anti-authoritarian approach they had adopted, and its theoretical foundations. Only then did they realize the true task of liberation that lay at hand. Now Taskforce Blackbird stands ready to deliver the regions of nation states from the forces of oppression.

Liberated on 30 April 2013. An early happy May Day.
