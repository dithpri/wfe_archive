[color=blue][b]Welcome to the Region of Free Nations.[/b][/color]

Here we live in peace and prosperity with our neighbors, which is better found thousands of Parsecs from Earth in the new frontier. This region is for freedom lovers and does not take kindly to any form of oppression and tyranny. [i][b][u]All[/i][/b][/u] Fascists, Communists, Authoritarians, Statists, Theocrats, Technocrats, and any other forms of tyrants are [color=red][b]not[/b][/color] welcome, unless you&amp;#39;re a nation of satire. If you do not meet one of the said disqualifications, then fire up your warp engines and settle in this new world.


If you&amp;#39;re from the Shadow Proclamation, then you will be welcomed as long as you don&amp;#39;t have WA membership.
Also recruiters can scurry off and hang.
