After the collapse of the First Order of Powers through the Marijuana Wars of North America, the loyal members of the former alliance wished to conceive a union once more, with greater provisions on security, accountability, and peace between member nations.

Though the first alliance ended in misery and war, the second union is sure to find stronger footing, as the order this time is governed under a confederate structure, with tightly-knitted bonds between allies, and a harsh policy of total annihilation for any defector nations.

May the glorious Second Order of Powers live on and may its members thrive!
