The Menomonee Islands are a cluster of Islands in the South Atlantic. Best known for its mountainous landscapes and isolationist people, the region has stayed off of the world stage for most of its history. The terrain and it&amp;#39;s natural borders allowed for the development of numerous and diverse cultures in close proximity. As the world modernized and those borders became more permeable, these groups struggled to integrate and adapt. Civil unrest is at an all-time high, and the threat of armed conflict constantly looms on the horizon.
