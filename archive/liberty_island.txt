Originally founded by Texalberta as the successor region to the Alliance of Conservative Nations. What seemed like a free region quickly turned into a struggle. After a struggle, this region was refounded as [b][region]The Isles of Liberty[/region][/b], by [b][nation]TuNasai[/nation][/b]. Although those days have passed, this region has been captured from communists and is now a protectorate of [b][region]Tarkin[/region][/b].
