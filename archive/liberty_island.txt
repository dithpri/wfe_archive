[b][color=red]Welcome to our tropical paradise where individual liberty is paramount.[/color]

We encourage robust debate, If you&#39;re the type to cry to momma (the mods) you&#39;ll be banjected for your own snowflaky safety. Bring a cogent arguement, and leave off the ad hominem. 

[color=blue]Boatdrinks are served at the beach house every day around noon.
Enjoy yourself, shoot clays off the dock, throw dynamite in the lagoon, howl at the moon, disregard all safety protocols, but remember to be excellent to each other.[/color][/b]
