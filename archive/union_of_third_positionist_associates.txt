Reject the false dichotomy, embrace a [color=grey]third position[/color]!

Welcome to the [i]Union of Third Positionist Associates[/i], a place where third position regions and &quot;intellectuals&quot; can speak their mind on political topics. Everyone from classical fascists to national syndicalists are invited to participate in dialogue, as long as it&#39;s civil (and doesn&#39;t draw attention to nationstates moderators).  

Members of regions with embassies are free to chat in the rmb, but if you wish to become a member of this region, send a telegram to [nation]Greater Indiana Federation[/nation]. We accept all under the third position banner.
