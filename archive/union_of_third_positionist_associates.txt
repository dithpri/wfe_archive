Welcome to the Union of Third Positionist Associates, a place for third position regions and &quot;intellectuals&quot; alike to speak their mind on political topics. Everyone from classical fascists to national syndicalists are invited to participate in dialogue, as long as it&#39;s civil enough (and doesn&#39;t draw attention to nationstates moderators).  

Members of regions with embassies are free to chat in the rmb, but if you wish to become a member of this region, send a telegram to &quot;Greater Indiana Federation.&quot;
