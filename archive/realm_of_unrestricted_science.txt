Some nations abhor the growth of science, knowledge, and progress when it requires sacrifice or the loss of moral values.

Others never dare to dream that the impossible could exist.

Here in the realm of unrestricted science, those with mad inventions, those who would  willingly unravel the threads of their universe to seek out new discoveries, those who seek to improve Science and Progress, are welcome here.

Everyone else, you&#39;re fine too.

[b]ANNOUNCEMENT:[/b] WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ALL NATIONS TO DIRECT THEIR EFFORTS TO RESEARCH A CURE, AND TO OPPOSE ALL NATIONS WITHIN THE REGION WHO EMBRACE THE HORDES.
