Pewtopia, a lush, fertile area of the world dotted with no more than a few countries. The nations live together in civil unrest as many members seem to be at each other&#39;s throats. Having a single tyrant rule over the nations with an iron fist has made many enemies and sabotage is everywhere. Being a control freak the founder has stripped the rights of most of the nations and has given them to himself. He rarely ever visits his region and immediate action needs to be taken to remove him from power. This is a cry for help and will most likely be taken down soon so any and all who see it must come to our aid immediately. Please! This tyrant must be overthrown!
