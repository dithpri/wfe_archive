
The Confederation of the Rhine (German: Rheinbund; French: Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration du Rhin, officially &amp;quot;Confederated States of the Rhine&amp;quot;, but in practice Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration du Rhin) was a confederation of client states of the First French Empire. It was formed initially from 16 German states by Napoleon after he defeated Austria and Russia in the Battle of Austerlitz. The Treaty of Pressburg, in effect, led to the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine. It lasted from 1806 to 1813.
