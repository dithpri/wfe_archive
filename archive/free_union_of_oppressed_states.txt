Once upon a time, there was a region&#151;a region where nations could go to escape the tyrannical rule opposed upon them by the fleeting opinions of the majority.

That region has returned, if not in its former glory, then at least in something approaching it. We welcome any other nations that wish to join this region and restore it to its former glory.

Whether under authoritarian rule or a democracy that [i]isn&#39;t even rigged[/i], we welcome all nations that can contribute with civility.
