While many regions suffer under the iron heel of democracy, the Free Union of Oppressed States recognizes that not all nations should be subject to tyrannical rule from outside their own borders!

The Free Union of Oppressed States welcomes all nations fleeing such democratic oppression. Membership is not reliant on any personal choices made by national leaders, nor on the adoption of a national stance. All nations are welcome, even [i]gasp![/i] full-blown radical democracies.

The only requirement is civility. Beyond that, all&#39;s fair in love, war, and politics.
