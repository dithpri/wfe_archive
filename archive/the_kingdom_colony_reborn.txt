Welcome to The Kingdom Colony Reborn (KCR)! We are pleased that you are visiting! We are an upcoming and new region.

Brief History:
In 2009, the original Kingdom Colony was founded and had a great run until 2012. Our community suffered from invasions and threats to our government during this period. With political opposition between nations of the region, it was time to say goodbye.  

Now with a renewed region and values based on democracy and freedom, we are returning to the world! We want you to join! We appreciate your visit, and we will have more information in store once things get started again.
