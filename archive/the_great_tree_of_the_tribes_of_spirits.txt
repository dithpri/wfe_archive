The inhabitants of The Great Tree of the Tribes of Spirits are a group of ancient tribes devoted to preserving the Old Ways of Herbalism, Natural Healing, and Shamanism. The inhabitants are fierce protectors of the environment, as the native Human religion is nature-based, following Nature Spirits, Tree Spirits, River Spirits, Personal and Familial Spirit Guides, and a few deities (mostly female); and the non-Human inhabitants are for the most part Nature Spirits and similar beings. 
Here Humans live in harmony with the Supernatural. The Supernatural creatures here ([nation]Spiorad an Dulra[/nation]) have lifted the entire region up into the sky on the branches of a massive tree.
