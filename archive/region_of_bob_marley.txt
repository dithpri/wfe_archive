The great region of Bob Marley was founded by Bob Marley before his death. This liberal, peaceful region is today ruled by Ziggy Marley, the son of Bob who runs Marleytopia. This region welcomes anyone who wishes to join, and urges those who have a high rate of recreational drug use to join this region today. 

This region is near Bob Marleys home country where he would smoke the ganja all day.
