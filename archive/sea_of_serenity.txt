[b]Welcome to the Sea of Serenity[/b]

One of the Pacific Ocean&#146;s marginal seas, the Sea of Serenity is known throughout the world for beautiful weather and calm waves&#133; except for the frequent typhoons.

Oh yeah, and it&#146;s filled with island nations who definitely, totally, 100% get along.
