The Emirate of Transjordan, officially known as the Amirate of Trans-Jordan, was a British protectorate established on 11 April 1921, which remained as such until achieving formal independence in 1946. Well, those days are over. Transjordan has been annexed by a dictator and is now happier. No questions, please. And POSITIVELY NO JOKES about our name.
