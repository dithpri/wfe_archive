[b]Welcome to Lioxutopia, an MT and largely-democratic region.[/b]
-Are you new to the region? Introduce yourself in the Lioxutopian RMB!
-We currently don&#39;t have a WA delegate, but we hope to elect one soon!
-We also currently don&#39;t have a regional map [i]or [/i]an external place for Lioxutopian nations&#39; owners to chat. Don&#39;t worry - stuff like that&#39;s in our future plans!
