The Celtic Haven is a region neatly tucked away in a quiet corner of the world, away from the ravages of Anglicisation, Westernisation, and Eastern wars.  Consisting of all nations that still harbor in their hearts a love for the long forgotten Celtic cultures and values, the Celtic Haven is always welcoming to those who wish to share in its vision of freedom and equality, as its constituent parts stand in complete Union to inform the world that liberty and community should always stand before profit.  The rolling vales of the Celtic Haven are marred by the old scars of industry, and yet still, it shines a beautiful gem of tranquility and peace against an oncoming tide of Capitalist and Fascist wars.
