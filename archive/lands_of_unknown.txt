Lands of Unknown is a Furry focused region that aims to provide a friendly and fun experience for worldbuilding and nationbuilding. This region does not discriminate towards fandoms, players of all things are welcomed, be it common furry/scaly/avian ect, human, fantasy creature, alien, ext. I plan of making a forum and discord server for off-site sessions, since in my experience they tend to be better. The forum will consist of modern, sci-fi, and medieval fantasy worlds.
