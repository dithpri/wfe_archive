Lands of Unknown aims to provide a friendly and fun experience for worldbuilding and nationbuilding loving people who enjoy some nice RP from time to time. This region does not discriminate towards fandoms, players of all things are welcomed, be it common human, furry/scaly, fantasy creature, alien, ext. I plan of making a forum and discord server for off-site sessions, since in my experience they tend to be better. The forum will consist of modern, sci-fi, and medieval fantasy worlds.
