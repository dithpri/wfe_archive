[region]Nara[/region] was refounded on March 26, 2020 by the [region]BENEVOLENT EMPIRE[/region].

The region was originally founded in April 2013, using the name oddly as a mere acronym.  However in this incarnation it refers to Japan&#39;s first permanent capitol.  

Nara features the Daibutsu-den (Hall of the Great Buddha) which remains the largest wooden building on Earth.  No smoking, please.
