We love:
The 21st century, the best century in human history, for health, education, standard of living and of course - LEISURE AND

The Diaz family, the Stuck in the Middle Crew (disney channel) and all other similar groups of young kids, in fact Jenna Ortega and her group graces the national flag of Anarcitopianchillstate as a symbol of youth culture - the same flag as our region.
