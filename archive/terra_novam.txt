Terra Novam is a Earth-like planet founded by United Galactic Exploration Fleet Omega Group commanded by Fleet Admiral Daniel MacGregor. Soon after arriving, the Group lost communication with Earth due to a large radiation burst interfering with the interstellar communication system. Without any contact with Earth, the Group quickly colonized the planet and founded The Terra Novam Collective. Colony Ships harvested resources and built up large civilizations across the planet&amp;#39;s surface. The people of Terra have almost completely forgotten about their old home Earth, it is now rarely referred to and when it is, it&amp;#39;s simply brushed off as the past.
