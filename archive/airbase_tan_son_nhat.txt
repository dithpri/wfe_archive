As of January 2017, it had a total capacity of only 25 million passengers,[4] which has caused constant congestion and sparked debate for expanding or building a new airport. The airport&#39;s IATA code, SGN, is derived from the city&#39;s former name of Saigon. It was the 25th busiest airport in the world in 2020.
