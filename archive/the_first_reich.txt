The horrors of fascism have brought murder to Paris
Today it was reported that 19-year-old AntiFa member and leftist Clement Meric was beat to death by Neo-Nazis in Paris. We dedicate this day in his memory and in the memory of all the victims of Fascism and Nazism.[/color]

Never Again! Never Forget!
Fight Fascism wherever you find it![/b]
