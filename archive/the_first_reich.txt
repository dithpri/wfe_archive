[b]Charlemagne, King of the Germanic tribe of the Franks was crowned [i]Holy Roman Emperor and Augustus of the Romans[/i] by the Roman Pope Leo III. The first duty of the new emperor was to be the protector of the Roman Church and of Christendom against the heathen.

It was on Charlemagne&#39;s advice that, to ward off the savage raids of the Saracens, Leo maintained a fleet, and caused his coast line to be regularly patrolled by his ships of war. But because he did not feel competent to keep the Muslem pirates out of Corsica, he entrusted the guarding of it to the emperor.
