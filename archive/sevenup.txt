[i]As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there&#39;s nothin&#39; left
...
But I ain&#39;t never crossed a man that didn&#39;t deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that&#39;s unheard of
You better watch how you talkin&#39; and where you walkin&#39;
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
