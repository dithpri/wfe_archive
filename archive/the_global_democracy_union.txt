The Global Democracy Union (GDU) is a global organization dedicated to uniting free nations and advancing democracy in the world. [b]All nations are required to have a democratic system of government. No monarchies (excluding figureheads, in which case a democracy is still required) or benevolent dictatorships. It is requested, but not required, that nations present a laurel wreath on their banners to show membership.[/b]
