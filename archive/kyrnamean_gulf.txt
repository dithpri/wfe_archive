The Island region of the Kyrnamian gulf used to be one great state under the name of Kyrname. During civil war, the state split five ways. The liberal branch of the Kyrxian religion is followed by Kyrname, its puppet state East Kyrname and liberal utopia, North Kyrname. Meanwhile the orthodox Kyrxian religion is followed by the hyper aggressive Kryx State and Kryx Holy Lands.
