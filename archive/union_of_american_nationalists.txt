Hello, we are a coalition of Americans who pride their nation, and absolutely love being American. We have a large range on political beliefs. Some of us can be corporatists, some can be socialists, some can be fascists, some can be libertarians, some can be anarchists some can be neo-conservatives, some can be liberals, some can be imperialists. But we all share one thing: We love America. 

We view the Founding Fathers as heroes, and the Declaration of Independence and Constitution as some of the best documents ever written.

We want an [b][color=blue]America[/color][/b] for the [b][color=red]Americans[/color][/b].
