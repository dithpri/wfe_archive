Hello, we are a coalition of Americans who pride their nation, and absolutely love being American. We have a large range on political beliefs. Some of us can be capitalists, some can be socialists, some can be fascists, some can be libertarians, some can be anarchists, some can be conservative , some can be liberals. But we all share one thing: We love America, and we fight for the establishment of a true American nation-state.

We view the Founding Fathers as heroes, and the Declaration of Independence and Constitution as some of the best documents ever written.

We want an [b][color=blue]America[/color][/b] for the [b][color=red]Americans[/color][/b].
