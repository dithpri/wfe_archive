[i][color=grey]Although, like a tea kettle, 
it is easy for one&amp;#39;s enthusiasm to cool, 
there is a way to keep this from happening. 
Our own vows are the following:

Never be outdone in the Way of the Samurai.
To be of good use to the Shisuta- Sensei.
To be filial toward our parents.
To manifest great compassion, 
and to act for the sake of Man.

If we dedicate these four vows 
to the gods and Buddhas every morning, 
we will have the strength of two people 
and will never slip backward. 
One must edge forward like the inchworm,
bit by bit.
 
The gods and Buddhas, too, 
first started with a vow.[/color]
