Since 1994 seeking a homeland away from South Africa the Afrikaner people now have this region to grow,develop and flourish independently of outside interference. The Official languages are Afrikaans and English. As well as our region we claim all territory that prior to 1994 was the Union of South Africa,Swaziland,Lesotho,Botswana,Zimbabwe and Namibia. As a new region we welcome relations with all who wish it.
