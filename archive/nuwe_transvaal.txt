Since 1994 seeking a homeland away from South Africa the Afrikaner people now have this region to grow,develop and flourish independently of outside interference. The Official languages are Afrikaans and English. As well as our region we claim all territory that prior to 1994 was the Union of South Africa,Swaziland,Lesotho,Botswana,Zimbabwe and Namibia. Following a referendum on the 30th December 2014 the Afrikaner people of our region announce that the colony of South African Indian Ocean is now made a Protectorate and claimed as an integral part of our territory. As a new region we welcome relations with all who wish it.
