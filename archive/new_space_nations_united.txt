The region New Space United is a RP region made for a futuristic RP. The RP will be set in about the year 2030 or so.  This allows for community approved technologies to be real for the time(ie: Cloning; community voted yes. Therefor allowed and real for the RP.  Death-Star like  space ship; community votes no. Therefor not allowed and not real for the RP).  The NSNU was founded by Atlas-Corporation.
