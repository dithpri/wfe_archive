Nations, Republics, Democracies and all that allot their citizens freedom, we welcome you to our shores. For long we have fought for our peace and a land free of any form of war. We have no military, only the law enforcement, and we are unarmed. We seek to be a pillar of sanity, standing erect and tall through the fog of corruption and violence. Join us in our cause, join us to bring purpose to Humanity, join us to live!

~The leader of the TCoTPC is the UNSC
~The TCoTPC will not be taking any sort of wartime activities
~The TCoTPC will try to intervene in the matters of conflicting nations to try to      bring about peace, but not at the cost of being put at a threatened state.
