Welcome to The United Otuku Kingdoms! If you are a hardcore Otuku, this is the place for you! I&#39;m Konata Izumi, but you can call me Konakona. I love anime and manga, and sitting in my room all day on the computer! I also work part time at a cosplay cafe. All Otaku are welcome to join. Roleplaying is welcome, especially to Kagamine ( &amp;#865;&deg; &amp;#860;&amp;#662; &amp;#865;&deg;). Too lazy to write anymore...
