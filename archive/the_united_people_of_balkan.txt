We are Balkan people.
We have a map and we wish to roleplay.
We hope that more people join us (actually from the Balkan or not)
Our greatest strength is offense in war.
We don&#39;t need morals to attack or defend, we make them up on our way to declare war. The good ol&#39;fashioned way to do it.
Also here&#39;s a list of our [b][i]Celebrations[/i][/b] : 

July 11th - Formation of the Alliance
August 14th - Recognized by the WA
September 20th - Day of renovation
October 2nd - Day of mourning
