Leninism is the development of a socialist state through the leadership of a revolutionary vanguard composed of dedicated revolutionaries, an organic part of the working class who come to socialist consciousness as a result of class struggle. The socialist state represents a &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;, exclusively governed by the vanguard party through the process of democratic centralism, which Lenin described as &quot;diversity in discussion, unity in action.&quot; The final goal is the development of socialism into the full realization of communism, a classless social system with common ownership of the means of production with full social equality.
