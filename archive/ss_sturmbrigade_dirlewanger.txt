Seized by [color=green]The[/color] [region]Alliance Against Nazis[/region] in the name of anti-nazism. Genocidal nazi oppressors have been removed from power, and the citizens are celebrating over their liberation. No more descrimination, no more genocide, no more oppression. Records of the region are lost, but it is known that the (ex) founder created at least three regions, all now owned by anti-fascist forces.
