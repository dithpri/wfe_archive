[color=darkred][b]It&#146;s the Final Countdown! Join the Faction: Kiloton Road Warriors

It&#146;s time to be Forever Young and play with your 99 Luftballons, as we celebrate like it&#146;s Christmas at Ground Zero! There&#146;s a Distant Early Warning and the Sunshine on the Wasteland makes me think that the Future&#146;s So Bright, I Gotta Wear Shades. 

Time will Crawl when Every Day is like Sunday and We Will Become Silhouettes when there are Two Suns in the Sunset. 

Remember to wear your radiation detectors, keep NBCD suits on, as we wait for the Hammer to Fall.
