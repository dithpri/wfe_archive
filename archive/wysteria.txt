[color=darkred][b]The NationStates Zombie Apocalypse has begun!

Join your fellow Wysterians in researching a cure, before it&#146;s too late. Smaller nations should choose the zombie extermination option so you&#146;re still around to be cured. May the Flying Spaghetti Monster have mercy upon us all.[/b]

&amp;quot;We shall defend our green and pleasant region, whatever the cost may be, we shall cure zombies on the beaches, we shall cure zombies on the landing grounds, we shall cure zombies in the fields and in the streets, we shall cure zombies in the hills; we shall never surrender.&amp;quot;[/color]
