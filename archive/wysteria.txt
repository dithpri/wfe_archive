[color=darkred][b]Victory on Z-Day!

Wysterians stood shoulder to shoulder and braved the undead horrors once again. We cleared the region in record time this year![/b]

&amp;quot;We shall defend our green and pleasant region, whatever the cost may be, we shall cure zombies on the beaches, we shall cure zombies on the landing grounds, we shall cure zombies in the fields and in the streets, we shall cure zombies in the hills; we shall never surrender!&amp;quot;[/color]
