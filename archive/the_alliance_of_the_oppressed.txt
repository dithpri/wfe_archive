Break free from oppressive forces! Join us, the rebels of the group(not literally meaning rule wise. Still follow the rules!)! When we have enough people, we will start appointing positions!

The first few will get high ranks.

Everyone will enter a &amp;quot;pool&amp;quot;. In this &amp;quot;pool&amp;quot;, all your soldiers will be entered to the total, but you can use yours as you wish. This is simply numbers for an emergency, like a total invasion. As part of the defense, each person has a base and embassy from everyone else in the nation, so if you are attacked, we are attacked.

The crossed hammers on the flag stands for the work and unity of our nations, the red for the blood spilt fighting for independence, and the white for the independence we gained.
