Dorgmund is a planet of turmoil in a dimension separate from earth, where multiple intelligent species have either evolved or been engineered by long-lost &quot;sky gods&quot;. Conflict is the word of every day, and wars are frequently fought for territory, extinction of rivals, and access to sky god relics, but maybe that might not always have to be the case, only time will tell if the chaos settles and the stalemates will break.
