All bow down to the peaks. The mighty Peaks.


Here at Peaks, there are few ones who bow down to the Peaks. Yet.
We will eventually gather all to bow down under the mighty Peaks, and all who refuse will be defeated.
Her powerful paw shall crush all that remain standing in her presence.

Rules:
1: You must bow down to the Peaks, regardless of the circumstances.
2: You must refer to Peaks as &quot;The All Mighty Peaks&quot;, &quot;Peak Peaks&quot;, or just &quot;Peaks&quot;. Any name calling or disrespect shall be punished.
Follow these two rules and you shall thrive under the Peaks.
