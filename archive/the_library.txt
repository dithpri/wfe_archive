[color=blue]&amp;quot;A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.&amp;quot; -Henry Ward Beecher[/color]

[b]The Library[/b] is founded on the ideal of two simple words: &amp;quot;Community First.&amp;quot; Other regions will offer you government, activity, excitement; we have these things. [b]What the Library[/b] has to offer is the unique Community First mentality, and a first-class community.

Community First means...
- We are an open and respectful society,
- Our focus is the community; bells and whistles are secondary, and
- The best way to get something out of the Library is to become an active member of the community! The links below will help you out.
