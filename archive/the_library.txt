[B]Welcome to The Library.[/B]

[color=blue][B]&quot;A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.&quot; -Henry Ward Beecher [/B][/color]

[B]The Library[/B] is founded on the ideal of two simple words: &quot;Community First.&quot; Other regions will offer you government, activity, excitement; we have these things. What the Library has to offer is the unique Community First mentality, and a first-class community. 

Community First means... 
- We are an open and respectful society, 
- Our focus is the community; bells and whistles are secondary, and 
- The best way to get something out of the Library is to become an active member of the community! The link below will help you out.
