[b][color=blue]&amp;amp;quot;A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.&amp;amp;quot; -Henry Ward Beecher[/color][/b]

[b]The Library[/b] is founded on the ideal of two simple words: &amp;quot;Community First&amp;quot; Other regions will offer you government, activity, excitement; we have these things. What [b]the Library[/b] has to offer is the unique Community First mentality, and a first-class community.

[i]Community First means...[/i]
- We are an open and respectful society,
- Our focus is the community; bells and whistles are secondary, and
- The best way to get something out of the Library is to become an active member of the community!
