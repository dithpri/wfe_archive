Insulis ignis et glacies is a small straight of volcanic and glacial islands in a large ocean.
The first permanent settlement was founded on the smallest volcanic island and was formed into the Anglo-Klingon Dominion.
The Anglo-Klingon Dominion is a well established nation that originally settled in the Insulis ignis et glacies in order to escape oppression in larger regions. Unfortunately their vision didn&#39;t work out quite as planed as the government almost destroyed the nation&#39;s environment and national spirit. Now however things finally seem to be getting better and the Anglo-Klingon Dominion has even started expanding onto the other islands in Insulis ignis et glacies.
