[color=red]The [b]Great[/b] [b]Alliance[/b] of [b]New[/b] and [b]Growing[/b] [b]Independent[/b] [b]Powers[/b] is an interregional organization. We are for the spread of [b]liberalism[/b] and [b]capitalism[/b]. Pure and enlightened capitalist regions establish embassies with GANGIP to signify that they have joined it. So why join it? 
Well, we are an organization that looks to better the world of NationStates and help capitalist nations and regions gain more power. We are locked in [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=449137]The Great Neo-Cold War[/url][/b] against [region]New Socialist Bloc[/region] and are fighting the [b]Anti-Communist War[/b].
Imagine GANGIP as the region of regions. We can all interact without having to swap what region we&amp;#39;re a part of. Together we can conquer and spread our message of capitalism.[/color]
