[color=red]The [b]Great[/b] [b]Alliance[/b] of [b]New[/b] and [b]Growing[/b] [b]Independent[/b] [b]Powers[/b] is an interregional organization. We are for capitalist [b]authoritarianism[/b] and accept [b]democracy[/b]. Pure and enlightened regions establish embassies with GANGIP to signify that they have joined it. So why join it? Well, we are an organization that looks to better the world of NationStates and help great nations and regions gain more power. Our Alliance Committee can discuss issues and pass laws. Imagine GANGIP as the region of regions. We can all interact without having to swap what region we&amp;#39;re a part of. Together we can conquer regions and help guide the world away from the stupidity of joke nations, totalitarianism and savages. However, we&amp;#39;re not all serious and are very human.[/color]
