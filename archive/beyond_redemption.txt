You do not have to share [u][url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=pope_peter_ii/detail=factbook/id=213826]the founder&amp;#39;s values[/url][/u], this region is for all &amp;quot;unorthodox&amp;quot; religious nations.
If the mainstream considers you a &amp;quot;heretic,&amp;quot; or if you have converted to a non-traditional faith,
or if you have abandoned religion all together, then this is the region for you.

If you have been kicked out of a religious region for apostasy, then you are welcome here,
[i]unless you are a Nazi or a pedophile[/i]. Then, you can go straight to Hell.
