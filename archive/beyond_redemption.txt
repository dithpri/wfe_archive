[B]We are Beyond Redemption.[/B]

You do not have to share the founder&amp;#39;s values, this region is for all &amp;quot;unorthodox&amp;quot; religious nations.  If the mainstream considers you a &amp;quot;heretic,&amp;quot; or if you have converted to a non-traditional faith, or if you have abandoned religion all together, then this is the region for you.

If you have been kicked out of a religious region for apostasy, then you are welcome here, [i]unless you are a Nazi or a pedophile.[/i] Then, you can go straight to Hell.
