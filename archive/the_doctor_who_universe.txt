[b]Looks like Harriet Jones, Prime Minister, was right. The Doctor isn&amp;#39;t always around and I took this region while he slept. Again. This is [nation]Seven Deaths[/nation], resident Time Lord Victorious, checking in from his vacation. I&amp;#39;m currently sitting in an airport raiding from a laptop while chatting with a homeless man. I bought him a coffee. Victory has never tasted so sweet. 

This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region], and [region]Albion[/region]. Special thanks to our friends from [region]Kantrias[/region] for their assist.

Praise the Kaiser! Long Live the Emperor! Glory to the King![/b]
