[color=orange][b]EMBLEM OF BRYANISM[/b][/color]  
A circular field bearing an [b]AK-pattern rifle[/b] symbolizing vigilance and dignity in struggle.  
Surrounding the field is a [b]wreath of wheat[/b] for labor, abundance, and renewal, interwoven with [b]orange banners[/b] representing equilibrium.  
At the base rests an [b]open book[/b], signifying doctrine, cultural restoration, and the Orange Book&#146;s authority.  
A [b]five-pointed star[/b] crowns the crest, marking transcendence beyond the three failed theories.

[b]Symbol:[/b] Orange Flame (rebirth &amp; equilibrium)
