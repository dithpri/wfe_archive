Come and join the Alaskan region!  Your voice will be heard!  Once we get more nations here we can make things better.  The plan for this region is to hold elections and pass legislation and other fun stuff!  Other things can happen too!  If your views are not like mine it doesn&amp;#39;t mean we can&amp;#39;t get along.  The first people to join will be my advisers!  If you are not satisfied, you can leave.
