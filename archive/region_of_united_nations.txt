Welcome!!! All nations in this region maintain their sovereignty while having a vote on major issues in the region. All resident nations are allowed to vote on any bill introduced by elected officials. The region is laid back and easy going. We will be holding elections soon to set a stable government. Please bear with us as we are attempting to create the best experience for our resident nations. We are currently seeking all offices: Head of State, Director of Relations, and Director of Security.
