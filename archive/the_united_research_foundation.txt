 A region founded on the idea of scientific research being opened to all, it has a few basic rights:
1. Religious choice must be a fundamental right.
2. Science is the ultimate expression of humanity. Fund it, endorse it, and let it grow.
3. The right to free speech, free press, and the people to gather shall not be infringed.

This is a roleplay-heavy region, for exploratory and research focused Nations. Nations who are interested in roleplaying in a Post-Cyberpunk style world where genetic engineering, cloning, AI, wormhole generation, and cybernetics exist are welcome here!
