Greetings.

This was originally a region that a certain recruitment telegram directed (and still directs) people to in one of its links, but wasn&amp;#39;t an actual region until a member of the [i][b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b][/i] stopped and realized that a humorous recruitment opportunity existed.  After a time, though, enough people began continually interacting that it has become a viable region unto itself, beginning to develop a unique identity.

Click the above regional link to go and meet the infamous group of Raiders and Invaders who believe that limitless opportunities exist to create a less boring NationStates world.  Or, if you like, stay here, and help build the region into whatever it is becoming.  The choice is yours.
