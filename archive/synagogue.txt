Welcome to [color=#005EB8][b]Synagogue[/b][/color]![hr][color=#005EB8][b]Synagogue[/b][/color] is a region that seeks to involve Jews and gentiles alike in being part of its affairs. We wish to be a beacon of peace and community, stopping at nothing to assist all who seek to learn about and discuss Judaism all over NationStates.[hr]As of now, [nation=noflag]Synagogue Authority[/nation] ([nation=noflag]Ineva[/nation]) is the second and acting Chief Synagogue Officer.[hr][b]Please bear in mind that there exists a vast array of wildly different opinions within the Jewish world. Just as they are important in Judaism, toleration, respect, and understanding are important here in [color=#005EB8]Synagogue[/color] as well.[/b][hr]Quote of the year:[quote=repreteop;55969350]iyiyi[/quote]
