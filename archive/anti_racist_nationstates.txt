Hello and welcome to the Anti-racist region. We focus on protesting racist regions and nations in NationStates. Our aim is to make NationStates a bad place for racist. That counts for people who discriminate a religion. That doesn&amp;#39;t make us a religious region there is no main religion, race or anything like that.
We are also very anti-Ukip if you&amp;#39;re English. We vote for the Green Party because of weed unless that&amp;#39;s not your thing whatever you&amp;#39;re welcome. F**k Ukip. Is our motto.
