This memorial to Lenin has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b], [b]anti[color=red]Stalinism[/color][/b], and [b]anti[color=gold]Leninism[/color][/b]. Though the FJA considers many Leninists and Trotskyists to be our allies, we cannot ignore the atrocities committed by Lenin and accepted  by Trotsky.
