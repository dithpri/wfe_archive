The National Alliance is a region with an emphasis on stricter government control. Although perceived as oppressive by those who do not understand our ideals, the NA is dedicated to bringing order, security, and structure to nations that reside within in. Needless to say, governments part of the National Alliance are efficient. Our belief is that the government is not there to represent the people, but instead, the government the entire nation compressed into a single entity.
