We are tired of being stepped on by a society that sees us as lazy. We are not lazy in the slightest. We are simply people who devote our time to different things. Yet society exploits us with pre order bonuses, season passes, and a lack of state mandated girlfriends. The oppression ends now. Join us and we will start a new society. One where all gamers can game in peace, free of the shackles of bedtimes and school. Gamers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains!
