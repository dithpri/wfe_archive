This Region named Hicroland, will be now governed by the United Hicrotian Imperial League, which has the duty to maintain order, peace, stability, and development on this land for the people living on this land. 

As we are mainly inhabited by Hicrotian Nations, foreign nations or ethnic groups may also move into our region to enjoy the benefits we give and maintain on this land. 

We do pursue expansion but if one does not intervene or anger us, we will not do any offensive action.
