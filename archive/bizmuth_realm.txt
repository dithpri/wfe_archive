Welcome!

[b][region]Bizmuth Realm[/region][/b], which transcends ethnic, religious, social and educational divisions, promotes moral and spiritual development by preaching the [i]brotherhood[/i] of man under the [i]fatherhood[/i] of [b]God[/b]. This noble [i]&#147;borderless brotherhood&#148;[/i] is most relevant in today&#146;s uncertain world of sectarian and ethnic strife to promote universal peace, understanding and unity.

The three grand principles of [b][region]Bizmuth Realm[/region][/b] are [b]brotherly love[/b] (being tolerant and behaving with kindness and understanding to fellow beings); [b]relief[/b] (acting charitably towards both own brethren and the community at large); and [b]truth[/b] (striving for truth in all matters, demonstrating integrity in daily actions, and adhering to high moral standards).
