Welcome to [color=blue][b]Padradis![/b][/color]

We are a realistic roleplaying region set in the modern day! There isn&#39;t a central theme but nations are asked to adhere to regional canon (free to be discussed whenever a new nation joins). You do not have to have a map claim to participate in regional activities, but one is required to join in on RPs and other events. Please telegram [nation]Kannap[/nation] to stake a claim on the map! Additionally, please join the WA with your main nation and endorse [nation]The Champlain[/nation] for WA delegate. 

We hope you enjoy your time in Padradis! You can telegram any one of the officers for a link to the regional discord server.
