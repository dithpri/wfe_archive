Welcome to the [region]Irillian Empire[/region]. Feel free to endorse [nation]Coronau[/nation]. Anyone is free to be WA delegate, provided they are approved by our founder, [nation]Coronau[/nation], and follow the RP. Any WA delegate not approved by [nation]Coronau[/nation] will be removed from the region, as will all those who endorse the unapproved WA. Should there be a problem with unauthorized WA delegates, the WA will lose executive power.
