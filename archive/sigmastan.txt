[b]Caw, flap, huzz![hr]
Your region was struck by hawks of, you guessed it, [region]the Black Hawks[/region]! We have a fledgling new hawk learning to flap their wings and striking at foes, and your region was its victim.
Next time you want to avoid such a fate, remember these words: Raider Unity, Maintain a Governor, Sign a Treaty. [hr]
Come find us in [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]our nest[/url], where you can become a feared raider too!
