This region used to be owned by [nation=short+noflag]Lushland[/nation]. However, some raiders came, and they decided to mess with Lushland, resulting in Lushland to abandon this region, and create a different region, [region]LYYT[/region]. 

However, I&amp;#39;m resurrecting this region to annoy it&amp;#39;s former inhabitants. Come and recruit here if you want. 

LONG LIVE [region]Anarchist Alliance[/region], and [nation]Neo Industrium[/nation]!
