[b][color=darkblue]Free[/color] [color=darkred]Nations[/color][/b] is a new region to be officially founded in 2016.

The [b][color=darkblue]Free[/color] [color=darkred]Nations[/color][/b] will be a group of like minded nations seeking to spread the influence of liberty and justice. The Free Nations will support democracy,  limited government, individual freedoms, free markets, defenderism, and justice for all. 

Please send all questions to [nation=short]FreeNations[/nation]. Be patient with responses, I&#39;m an old NationStates player who is not very active at the moment.
