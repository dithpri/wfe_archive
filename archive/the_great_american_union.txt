Welcome to [region]The Great American Union[/region]. If your looking for an active, friendly, and organized region, then look no further, you&amp;#39;ve found one. As a region we firmly believe in a countries right to sovereignty. We are strongly opposed to any laws or proposals from the WA that infringe upon a countries sovereignty. We have a regional government that you are encouraged to get involved with on the offsite forum. Keep in mind none of the laws created by the regional government must be enforced in your actual country in Nation States, but are rather separate from the game. Lastly if you need any assistance or help, please contact either Kylistan or Le Cruise.
