The Eastern Hemisphere is the half of Earth which is east of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, London, United Kingdom) and west of the antimeridian (which crosses the Pacific Ocean and relatively little land from pole to pole). It is also used to refer to Afro-Eurasia (Africa and Eurasia) and Australia, in contrast with the Western Hemisphere, which includes mainly North and South America. The Eastern Hemisphere may also be called the &quot;Oriental Hemisphere.&quot; In addition, it may be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the &quot;Old World.&quot;82-88% of humans live in the Eastern Hemisphere, and 12-18% in the Western Hemisphere.
