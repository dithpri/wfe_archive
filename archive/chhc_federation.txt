[b] [color=7F6DFF] Welcome to the [region]CHHC Federation[/region], [/b] where we all say, be not afraid. [/color]


[color=5F579B] We are home to canonically 10 nations, with even more territories scattered around the map! (With the inclusion of Chekzicha and Elianaskov, who doesn&#146;t have an account here on this website).[/color]

[color=5F579B] Having about 6,900 islands near the coast of Japan and South Korea, the CHHC (Countryhuman Headcanon) Federation is a close group of islands just hanging as much as they could, with obviously useless drama and stuff alike.[/color]
