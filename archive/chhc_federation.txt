[b][color=7F6DFF] Welcome to the [region]CHHC Federation[/region], where we all say, be not afraid.[/color] [/b]


We are home to canonically 10 nations, with even more territories scattered around the map (with the inclusion of Chekzicha and Elianaskov, who doesn&#146;t have an account here on this website)

Having about 6,900 islands near the coast of Japan and South Korea, the CHHC (Countryhumans Headcanon) Federation is an archipelagic nation just hanging as much as they could, with obviously useless drama, sometimes political fights and stuff alike.
