The First United Federation.

The First United Federation is a region in Nationstates, that, unlike other regions, is NOT controlled by a Governor, which maintains all power in a region, and CAN turn into a dictatorship real fast if not controlled properly. The First United Federation&#39;s Home Government (The WA Delegate position) is elected by the people, and serves FOR the people. However, this comes with risks, so right now, in the development phase, please endorse [nation]United States of Aetheria[/nation] or [nation]Great Empire of THE UNION[/nation] for WA delegate position to maintain security while we can. Thank you and have a nice time while you&#39;re here!
