The Aegean is a diverse region of convoluted Shores, scattered islands and copious stretches of deep blue waters, providing both connection and separation between neighbours. The area is a cultural crucible, where different attitudes, languages and forms of state organisation exist side by side within a dynamic system of contact, trade and exchange. Aegean nations are fiercely proud of their traditions and differences, but perfectly willing to cooperate for mutual benefit and to defend their own freedoms as well as those of their neighbours.
