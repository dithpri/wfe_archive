The Aegean is a geographically and culturally diverse region of islands, coasts and the seas between them. Its inhabitants are both connected and separated by those waters, permitting them to develop individual models of community within the same neighbourhood, while also providing a constant stream of cross-cultural exchange. The Aegean is known for its great beauty, pleasant climate and fascinating history. It is a peaceful haven for new nations to develop, cooperate (if so inclined) and eventually thrive.
