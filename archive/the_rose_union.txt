[b][color=#BF0000]The Rose Union[/color][/b]. Two mighty nations, one a nation of trade and diplomacy, the other a nation of military might and powerful beliefs. Once at war, these two nations are now in a [b][color=#BF0000]holy union[/color][/b], knowing that their unified talent makes them much stronger then they ever were alone. A land of unity, strength and prosperity, the union finds itself ever growing and ever so slowly, a growing power on the world stage.
