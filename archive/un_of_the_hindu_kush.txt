The United Nations of the Hindu Kush is a recently formed region, created by a previous member of the 10,000 Islands region. This beautiful land is concealed by the Hindu Kush mountain range (Hence the name). The UNHK is a democratic region, and often votes in the world assembly based on the community&#39;s general consensus. We are also a peaceful region, accepting anyone (Who isn&#39;t a Nazi or bully). We&#39;re making a forum right now, so hold tight!
