The [b] Pollywogian Region [/b] founded by [i] The Borderlands of Pancaker [/i] is a fledgling region consisting of an amalgamation of governments and peoples. While many of the region&#39;s governments are starkly opposed to each other in regards to individual ideologies, the nations of the region nevertheless work to support each country&#39;s aspirations as they see fit. 

In order to remain as a Pollywogian member state, each country must demonstrate their ability to sustain themselves sufficiently. The only known exception to this rule is [i] The Oppressed Peoples of Saquiblu [/i] who have yet to demonstrate their functionality as a country whatsoever.
