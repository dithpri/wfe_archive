The Premorian people have long been an isolationist people, wary of many foreign customs, be it in economy or war. For such reasons, the Premorian Isles sought to find their way into the future on their own path. But such a path is unstable, and often difficult. The PII is founded upon the principles of finding such a path, willing, though uncertain, to foster alliances and friendships with nations to walk alongside, making a difficult task a little easier.
