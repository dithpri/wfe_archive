[b][color=blue]Kessel was a planet within the Akkadese Maelstrom that hosted spice mines. For years, the Pyke Syndicate dealt with spice mined from Kessel, utilizing smugglers and freighter captains to deliver it to the crime families of Coruscant. 

The Galactic Empire operated a mining operation, employing numerous slaves, including Wookiees, to harvest spice. 

Meanwhile, the royal family of Kessel lived in lush sanctuaries in the planet&#39;s southern hemisphere, turning a blind eye to the brutal working conditions in the mines of the northern hemisphere.[/b][/color]
