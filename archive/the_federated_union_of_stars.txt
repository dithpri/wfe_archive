Our region in the world is in itself a own world. We have a variety of landscapes, ranging from our mountainous areas in the east on the mainland, to the desert islands in the western seas, the lush tropical rainforests in the southern islands and on the mainland by the sea, or our vast fertile land on the mainland in the northern part.  The main capitol of our region is in the Nation Crystallica with the main region capital of Crystalia.  Crystallica is an island nation with eight outer islands in a circle around the central island of Crystallica.  New nations will form as our explorers venture out from the safety of our beloved mother crystal, expanding our knowledge of the world.
