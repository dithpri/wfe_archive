Das Kapital is a collection of economic texts that are central to the ideology of communism, which leads to depravity and death everywhere it stalks. Whether it be the murder of the Russian Royal Family, the supposed acts done against the female royals, the Genocide of the Ukrainians in the Holodomor, or the suppression of religion, Communism seeks to be a god, yet it cannot, and will be crushed under God&#146;s foot.

Communism is idiotic in theory, and Genocidal in practice.
