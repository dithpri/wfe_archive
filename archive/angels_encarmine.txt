[color=#9c1007]Angels Encarmine is the most active Space Marine chapter in the imperium. The 2nd founding chapter has rarely declined an opportunity to fight against the enemies of the imperium and due to this is rarely at its full strength. Angels Encarmine are known for their special troopers such as The Sanguinian guard and the Death Company wearing alabaster-white armor instead of their normal colors.[/color]
