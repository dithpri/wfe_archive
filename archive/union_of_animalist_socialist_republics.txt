[b][color=#c80000]UNION OF ANIMALIST SOCIALIST REPUBLICS[/color][/b]

For a long time, humans have oppressed and enslaved all of animal-kind. Now, this is about to change.
The UASR is an alliance of animal nations, united against the common threat posed by the most evil and imperialist species in the universe: [i]Homo sapiens[/i].
But being free ourselves is not enough. The UASR also supports Animalist revolutions around the world, calling for our furred, feathered and scaled comrades to rise against their 2-legged oppressors.

[b]4 legs good, 2 legs bad! Animals of the world, unite![/b]
