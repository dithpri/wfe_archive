North Ustaynga is an active, [b]roleplay[/b] centered region in which players build a nation, develop technology, and form international relationships. Founded in 2017 by Zhokinland, nations in North Ustaynga strive to provide a lighthearted but involved roleplaying experience.

Nations inside of North Ustaynga are able to propose and vote on new bills that dynamically alter the region and it&#39;s development, similar to how you address issues in vanilla NationStates, or how the real world UN operates. You can see a list of every active bill here.
