The Helionic Union (HU) is a political and economic union on the continent of Helion, promoting cooperation, stability, and mutual defense among its member states. Governed by the Helionic Council, Parliament, and Court of Justice, the HU ensures effective governance and legal consistency. Economic integration is achieved through a common market and single currency, the Helion, managed by the Helionic Central Bank. The Helionic Defense Force (HDF) provides collective security. The HU values diverse governance, human rights, and cultural exchange, fostering unity and growth despite challenges.
