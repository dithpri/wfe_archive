A large sum of the world in the far North, it was once united under the Empire of Bunque. After the Rebellion of Bunque by antro-human forces, the Empire fell apart, what remained of it was turned into the Republic of Bunque, near the centre of the land.

Now new nations are free to move here to escape fighting, or any foreign peoples really, for peoples whom survived the Empire may freely organise their own with no fear of their neighbours.
