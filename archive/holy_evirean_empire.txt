The Holy Evirean Empire was formed from the union of Xetruydor, Fustania, Ecylae, Glausia, and Streus empires on July 6, 2016.
It was formed after the signing of the &#39;Treaty of Mycelia&#39; which ended the Evirean Civil War and unifying the five empires under a single banner.

The Republic of Alear is technically not part of the empire and is generally considered as an observer state, although their citizens can vote in referendums and have a say in matters concerning the empire.
