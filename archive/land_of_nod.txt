The Land of Nod was a mythical place east of Eden where Caine was exiled by God after the murder of his brother Abel. According to the Book of Nod, the Land of Nod was a place of utter darkness, with no source of light, where Caine was afraid and alone. Nod in this case, meaning, the &#39;Unknown Lands&#39; - supposedly the lands outside (&quot;east&quot;) of Eden, which were not named at that time.
