[b][color=red]ATTENTION RAIDERS:[/b][/color] For some reason, your kind has been bored enough to fruitlessly raid a region with an active founder. All raiders will be banjected on sight with extreme prejudice. Go home and tear wings off of butterflies, kiddies, because you won&#39;t win here.

Welcome to [b]Yamato[/b], land of warring clans, honorable combat, and cultural appropriation! 

We&#39;re a brand new community with a growing roleplay community and unique government based around the raider-defender game. Stay a while, and you&#39;ll find that there&#39;s a little bit of everything for everyone here, veterans and newcomers alike.
