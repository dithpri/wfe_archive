Welcome to Aerath, one of the four main continents of the world Eanir and Lyria created many an eon ago. 

On Aerath all government types are welcome, although the region itself is inherently democratic. This means that there will be held elections for all major offices, and embassy requests will be dealt with in a democratic fashion.

If you decide to move here, stay active, participate in regional activites and join the World Assembly. Get involved by joining our offsite forum (soon to come)!
