 On rukvadaen surface lies countless countries and kingdoms such as Finkland, Rieldsvan and all the other Free Countries, the Wind Kingdom, the Elven Kingdom of Gilyan Mons, the Mechanical Kingdom or Swardenaertenea and many more. This world has everything a living being can imagine: Thousands of volcanoes such as Frensken, mountain ranges such as the Wr&auml;denberg, havens of life but no peace such as the Driensen Jungle or Sj&uuml;ndyn, scattered and paradisiacal islands such as the Southern Islands and its many archipelagos, hot and prickly deserts such as the Skerzdid Desert and plains as cold and prickly as the burning volcanoes such as the Whroenngard.
