We praise our heroes&#39; sacrifice,

And vow to keep our land from foes.

Let us live crowned in glory...

Isle Of Emerald is free

Free to live!

There lies the land for which we would

Dare everything down here.

Bless Isle Of Emerald,

Oh bless it. This is our great father. BLESS HIM! BLESS HIM!
