[b]Allied Imperial States[/b]

The AIS is a constitutional region founded on the principles of friendship, order, and imagination. From its meager beginnings it has grown at a rapid rate to a beacon of discussion and, soon to be, an even brighter beacon of RPs. All nations in the region are granted the freedom of speech and a mutual respect is shown between nations. If interested in joining please contact the founder or WA Delegate.
