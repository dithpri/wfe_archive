[b]Allied Imperial States[/b]

The AIS is a newly formed split off region from the Imperium of Nations. It holds strong to a structured constitution and its governing body have the member states at heart. The structure is that of mutual respect for one another and grant the right to an opinion of every nation. The AIS is keen to grow and flourish in the tyrannical system of regions as a beacon of opportunity and imagination. It is a place where alliances are and will be forged along with friendships.
