The Moana Wai Archipelago is a wild, untamed paradise, virtually untouched by modern society. It is a series of tropical, volcanic islands, filled with natural beauty; lush forests, breath taking highland mountains, and stunning white sand beaches. It has an indiginous population, proud of their rich, diverse cultural heritage. It eagerly waits to be discovered and become a part of civilization.
