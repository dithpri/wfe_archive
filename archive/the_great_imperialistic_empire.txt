Bacon Friday a complete success! Or disaster?! Riots over the incredible bacon sales caused Imperial Riot Police to arrive on the scene. While there were no casualties, many were injured. This raises the question: should Bacon Friday be banned FOREVER?!


Elections have been postponed to a later date due to a lack of active nations. The Imperial Government is terribly sorry and wishes everyone a happy thanksgiving.
Endorse the delegate.
