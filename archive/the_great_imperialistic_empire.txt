Now I know what you&amp;#39;re all wondering. [i]What the heck is this idiot doing to our government? Where did it go?[/i] Well the answer to this question is actually quite simple. I moved it. [i]BUT I LIKED IT WHERE IT WAS![/i] Don&amp;#39;t worry! I didn&amp;#39;t move it for nothing! The Great Emperor and I have decided that this space is better used for posting the news! Yay! I also had to move it there as I couldn&amp;#39;t fit enough letters for our Imperial Government in here.


Elections begin Dec 21st!
Endorse the delegate.
