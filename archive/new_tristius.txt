&quot;New Tristius&quot; is the successor to &quot;Joelius Tristius&quot;, which failed to serve our purposes. Born out of the ashes as one might say.

New Tristius was formed as a coalition of nations who&#39;s leaders were good friends in late November, 2016. On 12 December, 2016, the Overlord decided to remove the password barrier, making New Tristius open to all nations.
