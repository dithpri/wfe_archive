&quot;New Tristius&quot; is the successor to &quot;Joelius Tristius&quot;, which failed to serve our purposes. Born out of the ashes as one might say.

New Tristius was formed as a coalition of nations who&#39;s leaders were good friends in late November, 2016. On 12 December, 2016, New Tristius decided to remove the password barrier, making New Tristius open to all nations.

*New Tristius has absolutely no affiliation to anyone of the name &quot;Joel Trist&quot;*
