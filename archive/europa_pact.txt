The Europa Pact is the final result of the German Empire&#39;s work during the 20th century to establish a stable united Europe. The German Kaiserreich saw victory in the second Great War allowing the Empire to solidify it&#39;s position as hegemon of mainland Europe. The Kaisers Wilhelm III and then Ferdinand I spent the remaining years of the century centralizing control and consolidating their loose rule over the continent. Now, the Europa Pact is facing a new century with Kaiser Friedrich II at the helm of the German Empire and the Europa Pact.
