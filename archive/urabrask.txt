Urabrask now requires a password to enter, as it is a region designed for a particular highschool. Talk to a member for the password.

The poll&amp;#39;s votes are in, you are now limited to three nations in Urabrask, I won&amp;#39;t track you down to monitor how many you have if you don&amp;#39;t make me.

Urabrask is considered a &amp;quot;semi-serious&amp;quot; region. If you are interested in RP, crazyness, or just goofing around, check out our sister region, [region=Demorous]
