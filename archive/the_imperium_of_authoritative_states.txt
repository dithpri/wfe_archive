The Imperium of Authoritative States

The Imperium of Authoritative States started as just one nation with a dream to spread its ideals amongst the world. A movement to empower nations with authoritative potential that were unnoticed and cared by in the large world they were birthed in. From 3 major wars claiming and losing land and the lives of the regions loyal subjects, the IAS has significantly grown into a powerhouse of security and order.
