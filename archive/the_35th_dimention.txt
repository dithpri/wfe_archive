This region stands as a symbol to the staunch opposition to humanity. Opposition to the conditions it imposes through human societies, how it exploits the world around it, and its plans to expand into space where it plans to exploit the whole universe. 
May it stand as a part of the war waged by both outside forces trying to stop humanity, but also those few humans who have awoken to the truth of what their species truly stands for, both groups being united in this war in there souls and hearts by the wish to prevent the exploitative evil of humanity from enveloping any more of the universe then it already has.
