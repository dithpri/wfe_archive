Midwestern Democratic States is a fairly large continent located between continents to the east and west that are for the most part inhabitabal. The middle continent however has very fertile farmland and beutiful forests. All nations that currently inhabit the region broke off from the evil Empire of Old Aksarben in a long and bloody revolution. Rumors do flow that the old Monarchy is hiding out in the mountains to the west or east. Central Embassy is located at a neutral sight at Grand Island, seeing as the Platte River breaks it off from all other nations.
