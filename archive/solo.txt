Those who strive for independence, and wish to be left alone as we grow based on our individual merits rather than as a group. There is no need to be involved with others, and nothing is asked of nations in order to be present, only to be decent and reasonable. We are here to be an alternative to the large conglomerate, filled with those that wish to grow based on how many friends they have, rather than the strength of their own nations. If the idea of remaining strong as a stand alone nation is what you wish for, and a dislike of contributing to someone else grab for strength, then stand by my side, but if you wish not, then I have already succeeded in finding a place to be strong on my own.
