[region]Solo[/region] is a region which embraces authoritarian socialist regimes. That means a country shall not be democratic, but shall prioritize its people, when it comes to welfare and civil rights, but not to the extent that it will threaten the authoritarian government. Also they shall regulate companies to the extent that they do not get too much power, neither over the people, nor the government. The government shall be in control of the companies, not the other way around.

We believe that an authoritarian government can rule more effectively than a democratic one, when it comes to decision making. Which, as long as the government cares for its people, will benefit them.
