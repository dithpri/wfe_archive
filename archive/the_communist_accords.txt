[color=red]Welcome to the Communist Accords![/color]

I might make a discord server depending on if we get enough members, but this is mostly just a casual region for talking and roleplaying if you feel like it.

[color=gold]We will be appointing delegates and ministers soon, as soon as we get enough people.[/color]

[color=blue]Much of the region is still under construction (ex: banner, tags, ministers, embassies) so please be patient as I am a somewhat busy individual[/color]
