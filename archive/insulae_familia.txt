Insulae Familia is a small region of closely related nations with wildly different political systems. The Region&#39;s goal is to promote trade amongst its constituencies and to provide Insular solidarity. The flag is representative of the member states, with each star representing one of its members. 
Each state within the Region has equal say and power to propose resolutions regarding the benefit of the region.
