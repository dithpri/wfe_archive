Welcome to Roleplay Of The Fittest. Here the roleplay is primitive, you start with 30 humans, all of whom have pickaxes and hatchets. To build, you post saying that you have gathered the necessary resources, and then another when the build is done. time is  30 times faster than reality. Now for the fun part: raiding. To raid, you say how many humans go in (you can recruit more from the wild) and how many animals. The animals require being tamed, which you post about. In the map info the species of animal (most of which are either extinct or never existed) live in which environment. You also must post armor and weapons building like they were structures. You pick what area you start in and then the role playing begins.
