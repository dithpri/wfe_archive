The SSD or Secret Soceity of Defense is the Freedom Fighters Union&#39;s-well, secret society! We also serve as the Union&#39;s spy organization. We go deep undercover and help gather intel or even bring down our enemies. We are like the FFU&#39;s Special Task Force, if you will. We are, of course secret-hence the name. One cannot simply join. You must be appointed by either the War General or Founder. If you would like more information, you may contact us or the Founder or War General. 


This region is serious and we only take up cases that are high-security level. We are the SSD. We are the FFU. We are.
