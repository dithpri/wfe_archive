Well, well, well, what do we have here? I do enjoy Minecraft myself, but this region was the site of a thwarted raid by those pests over at [region]Artificial Solar System[/region], so I went ahead and did my usual one-man unstoppable re-found attack. You can&#39;t stop instantaneous takeover!

[i]By the way, it&#39;s a shame this region didn&#39;t take off, I have a Minecraft world themed as an American Empire I would have submitted to the region.
