- The Celestial Reign is, first and foremost, primarily an [b]In-Character Region[/b]. We&#39;re a polsim set in what is at this time a relatively generic fantasy version of Earth - but getting in now means you can help develop our lore in roleplay!
- Most of our activity is on our Discord, with the forum primarily used as an archive of information at this time. Very little if any activity will take place on-site, and therefore [b]joining the Discord is strongly encouraged[/b].
