The creation of the Alliance of Isolated Powers marks a turning point in the areas of participating countries. Fairly isolationist nations are forming an alliance to be prepared for war or tyranny that may come upon them. This alliance will provide small amounts of aid to suffering nations in the alliance, but no intrusive actions or excessive friendliness. The goal of this alliance is to bring minor support in times of heavy need and preserve the privacy of each nation within.
