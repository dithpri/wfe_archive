The Nationalist Technate was founded in late 2013 by [nation=short]New Laikland[/nation]. The Nationalist Technate&amp;#39;s official position is neither on the left, nor the right, but beyond, in the Third Position. We remain neutral in our alignment, but the Military arm, [region]Einherjar[/region] is active in securing regions that are vital to our security. All of the colonized regions of the Nationalist Technate are listed as embassies there.
