[i][B]The Nationalist Technate is a region where any Nationalists and or Technocracies may find home, seeking to advance human technology further than ever before. The leadership are highly skilled and educated Engineers and Scientists, instead of politicians. Technocracy is the belief that social and economic issues can be solved as a science, rather than politics. 

We stand alone, and we take no orders from outside groups, in spirit of TRUE nationalism without imposing leftist globalism.

Glory to the Technate![/B][/i]
