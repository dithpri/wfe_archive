The Tweedsmuir Archipelago is an archipelago located in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately 50 kilometres southeast from Cape Breton Island in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. 

The archipelago today is home to the Dominion of Tweedsmuir, who formally gained independence from the United Kingdom on October 21 1952 following the creation of the Constitution Act, having been the Dominion of the British Empire from October 21 1897 onward.

The region&#39;s name comes from the village and parish of Tweedsmuir (Scottish Gaelic: Sliabh Thuaidh) in the Scottish Borders Council district of Tweeddale, in southeastern Scotland.
