The New Reaches are far lands that can be home to the nations who don&#39;t know where to go, or where they don&#39;t know what they want their future to be.
The New Reaches while having less power for its members and delegates, that is only done as the founder saw fit to keep the peace, and any opposition in line.
We offer to have some policies in return for hospitality, protection, and prosperity.
This is the place you go when there are no straight paths for your soon-to-be prosperous future that you can see.
