That region is the court of the Black League, where justice is served between the raider and his victim. Every country in the region that was raided can come here to chat with the raider as in a court of law - apolitically, based onlu on the facts and consructive peaceful dialogue. Just open embassy and then you can chat with raider. If raider don&#39;t come to court or will be unjustified - he will be at list of criminals and special group will hunt him down. All for justice!!!
