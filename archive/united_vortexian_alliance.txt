The United Vortexian Alliance is a reclusive, growing alliance of powerful and aspiring Nation States. Considered by some to be elitist, it only allows entry from those who have wished upon the mystical Dragon Balls. While the many nations within it&amp;#39;s alliance have radically different political agendas and perspectives, their leaders seem to be close friends. Often seen eating pizza together, surrounded by large, intimidating secret services. And Military Tuk&amp;#39;ata. And Military Landsharks. The future of this Alliance is whispered of in prophecy and tea leaves, but largely unknown.
