Zealasia&#146;s hermitage.

I&#39;m not looking to build a region, and my empire-building days are over. 

That said, anyone who wants to be in the region is always welcome. If you do choose to be here, the only rules are: [b]1) All posts should comply with general NS rules; 2) No profanity; 3) No proselytising, be it religious or atheistic[/b].
