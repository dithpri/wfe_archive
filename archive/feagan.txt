Feagan is known for its vast open resources consisting of center right nations of Griton, Masikota, and Skiarhiel to the south and center-left nations of Oskaevania and Acloiland to the north.  Lake Flaag rests in the center of the continent, bordering all five nations.
The Feagan Mountains have naturally divided the continent in distinct physical regions; valleys radiate from the mountains in all directions.
