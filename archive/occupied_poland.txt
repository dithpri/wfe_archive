This region was first set up and &amp;quot;conquered&amp;quot; by The Nazi Reich/[region]Das Dritte Reich[/region]/[region]Reich[/region], then occupied by [region]The Realm[/region]. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b].

In memory of the millions of Poles who have lost their lives to tyranny.
