A collectivized group of nations who have overcome great strife and challenges to form their own country, free from the shackles of oppressive tyranny, unpredictable forces of nature and its destruction, and even the evils within themselves. We use the star in all our national flags to symbolize our glimmering hope and the lighted pathway that led us to victory.
