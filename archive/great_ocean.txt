A great sphere of water with abundant sea life orbiting the Earth. The Great Ocean was created by the refuges of the sinking of Atlantis. They built a great civilization but then perished. The Pilgrims of Aquaa came hundreds of years later and settled the Great Ocean once more. We all live in our underwater cities and are one with the ocean.
