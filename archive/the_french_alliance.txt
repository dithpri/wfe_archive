viva le France. welcome! the FA is a region for all french nations. hopefully you find us as much as a regional super-power as any other region. all nations are open to our free, democratic system. no nations will be forced out of the region unless they harass any other nations in the region. and if any one puts inappropriate messages on the board will be banned. other than that, enjoy the french alliance!
