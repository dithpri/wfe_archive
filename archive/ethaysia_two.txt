[b][color=#665299]This region is the rebuilt version of the original Ethaysia[/color]
[color=#734F8C]Never again will a Ethaysia will to a raider region. Never again.[/color]
[color=#804C80]Someday, Epigamia, a defender region will destroy you.[/color]
[color=#8C4A73]And I am just going to tell you that when that happens, I will laugh silently, watching the region of Epigamia crumble.[/color]
[color=#994766]Just like you did to us.[/color]
[color=#A64559]Please leave. This region was created for me to rebuild, and one day, maybe I will open this region up to the outside world.[/color]
[color=#B2424D]I will get revenge, Robo-whatever. You will never win. All you do is take on smaller, helpless regions. Unlike TBR, who I actually have respect for.[/color]
[color=#BF4040]Hey Epigam, why is it whenever you raid a region, it&amp;#39;s only a small one? Are you that incapable of destroying a slightly larger region?[/color][/b]
