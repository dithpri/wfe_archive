We of the East Asia Union sacrifice our lives for East Asia. We fight against the evil of which that is Eurasia and Oceania. The corrupt ways in which they have been leading is both disgusting and unfair to the people. We of East Asia promise to liberate from this said evil and have the world live in a freedom and prosperity for all. We accept all nations, and hope you will join us.
