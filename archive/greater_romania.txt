 [b]Today the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy went absolutely wild. We competed against ourselves in a shotgun-spelling operation in celebration of our new Senate, pitting sailor against commander in a fight to the death - clearly trying to mimic our Senators in the political field.

Congratulations Xecrio, JayDee, Lloenflys, Lime, and SkyGreen24 on being elected, we know you&#39;ll represent us well!
