2000- The world is left devastated from a decade long conflict Ironically dubbed &amp;quot;The Unification Wars&amp;quot;. Populations dropped, infrastructure was abandoned and/or destroyed and society (where it still existed) generally resembled &amp;quot;MadMax&amp;quot;-style City States. Only A few of the &amp;quot;Elder-States&amp;quot; (i.e.; U.C.A.S) Managed to have survived into modern times, even they however find themselves as 3rd world nations. 
2013- 13 years later while the Nuclear strikes are still hot zones the wilderness is recovering nicely; unfortunately so is the human population! While isolated City States are still the norm; new Nation States are rising to challenge the &amp;quot;ElderStates&amp;quot;.
