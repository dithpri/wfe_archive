In the search for glory in the national sport of Banner Hunting, the region of Hedgehogs was born! 

Well, that was only a part of it. Named Hedgehogs after the glorious leader of Peoplace (Hedgehog Haskowitz), the nation had decided it was time for a change. Though the region of The West Pacific had been kind, Peoplace and it&#39;s citizens wanted to further it&#39;s individual identity. It moved to other regions, searching far and wide, but none quite fit. And so Hedgehogs, pristine and crisp, was born.

However, after thinking, Leader Haskowitz decided in confidentiality that while he excellently leads a small nation, leading a region may be harder, hence the decision to renounce permanent executive authority even with the risk of invaders.
