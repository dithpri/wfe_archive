Starfleet consists of Earth and Space.

Regions will have the decision to join on earth or as new planets and will have the decision to also join the Commonwealth on earth and the Commonwealth in space however this is not required and nations can create their own factions too.

Inspiration for this region mainly comes from Star Trek however other ideas are welcome
