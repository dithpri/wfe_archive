The State of East Indonesia was a post&#150;World War II state formed in the eastern half of Dutch East Indies. Established in December 1946, it became part of the United States of Indonesia (USI) in 1949 at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, and was dissolved in 1950 with the end of the USI. It comprised all the islands to the east of Borneo (Celebes and the Moluccas, with their offshore islands) and of Java (Bali and the Lesser Sunda Islands).
