[i][b][color=firebrick]Welcome, Brothers and Sisters of Freedom, to the land of liberty.[/color][/b][/i]

The Sons of Liberty provides a safe, respectful, non-aggressive environment where everyone has the right to free speech and a voice in regional affairs. We value alliances over armies, treaties over terror, and ideals over intimidation.
