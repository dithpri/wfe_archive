Bogano was a grassy planet which was largely unexplored during the time of the Imperial Era and couldn&#39;t be found on any maps. Its surface was covered in mesas and wetlands. The planet was home to a great Vault built by the ancient Zeffo civilization. The Vault hid away a holocron containing a list of force-sensitive children in the galaxy, which was placed there by Jedi Master Eno Cordova. In 14 BBY, Cal Kestis was sent to the planet by Cere Junda to unlock the secrets of the Vault in hopes of rebuilding the Jedi Order.
