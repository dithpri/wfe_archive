The Federated Malay States (FMS) was a federation of four protected states in the Malay Peninsula&#151;Selangor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang&#151;established by the British government in 1895, which lasted until 1946, when they, together with two of the former Straits Settlements (Malacca and Penang) and the Unfederated Malay States, formed the Malayan Union.
