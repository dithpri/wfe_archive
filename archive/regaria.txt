This great land has many lush forests and a wide variety of creatures: such as lions, elephants, dogs, and the recently introduced ostriches. It is also a very mountainous region, which used to be called the &amp;quot;Halls of Death&amp;quot; due to the frequent skirmishes that took place there throughout history between the many tribes and city-states that inhabited the land.
