A new region founded on the principle that whatever peace loving nation wishes to use necessary force against aggression shouldn&amp;#39;t be condemned. 

We are against the recruitment of new fledgling nations in the form of annoying telegrams. With that being said, any nation is free to join us without any coercion being used. 

We don&amp;#39;t care whether you&amp;#39;re a member of the World Assembly or not but nonetheless, membership is recommended.
