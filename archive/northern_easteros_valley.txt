This region is one dominated by tyrannical theocracies, corporate police states anarchist nations, and all too-liberal monarchies. 

Known for it&amp;#39;s ever-fluctuating internal borders, and harshly competitive economy, the leadership of this region often changes, making it a corner of the world that is always in flux. 

The Region was first settled by Vlithison, and founded by the Triumvirate. 

(OOC) Now that everyone (for the time being) is here, I have re-instated the password, which is once again regionocsa.
