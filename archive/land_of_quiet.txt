Welcome to the land of quiet. A place in which the countries are too quiet. I can assure you that this is the quietest region in the universe. Don&#39;t believe me? Well piss on you... Read on and you will clearly see why we are the quietest place. We have animals such as the Marty&#39;s ass, the 
ground round hound, and the Laotian pumas. We have superior and non standard currencies such as the quarters in the couch, the Jabeel, and the falafel. We have a wonderful collection of countries that are both hilarious corrupt, and ones with realistic and wholesome goals, as compared to some modern countries. Our collection of variously cultured countries will certainly make the world a better place.
