Considered a fragment of a once grand race&amp;#39;s realm, this is all that remains of their land and is a large group of islands ranging in size from puny to immense. The climate is tropical, and due to the layout of minerals and metals in the region&amp;#39;s sky often appears to have two suns in the sky due to magnetic disturbances affecting the travel of light into the area. This anomaly has also lead to various plants and animals evolving in wildly divergent manners. Such examples are Red Grass, Silver Leaves on the trees, and a dark burnt orange sky at night as moonlight is refracted wildly. Several disturbances in time and space find their home at nexuses of these metals and minerals, leading many to speculate of the archipelago&amp;#39;s origin.
