The party on Grove st. Is a small peaceful region know for its acceptance of MOST countries. 

Our grove street goal is eight countries we currently have 5/8


As like most of our members I am still learning about the game and its many rules. When you find the time please look into these said rules. If you are not aware of them you may be banned from this great game.

Besides that look into the WA (world assembly) rules and guidelines. All of which can be found under the FAQ under our regions name.

Once we all figure out this game a little more I hope to elect a WA delegate to represent this region. Thanks!
