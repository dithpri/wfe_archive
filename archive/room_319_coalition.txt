[b]This region has been visited by a coalition of forces from the [color=red][u]Chasing Is Cancelled Alliance (CICA)[/u][/color], otherwise known as [url=https://nationstates.net/region=thaecia][color=0d5eaf]Thaecia[/color][/url], [url=https://nationstates.net/region=lily][color=#ED1C24]Lily[/color][/url], [url=https://nationstates.net/region=europeia][color=#20D302]Europeia[/color][/url], [url=https://nationstates.net/region=the_north_pacific][color=#00247C]The North Pacific[/color][/url] and [url=https://nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific][color=#328832]The East Pacific[/color][/url]! We would like to thank this region for humbly and graciously volunteering itself in this campaign to end chasing once and for all: trust us, it was for the greater good.[/b][hr]
