The Old Kingdom was torn asunder during a brutal civil war. The Two Grand Dukes of both Fenvith and Tecosia denounced their tyrannical King and overthrew him in a civil conflict. This conflict cost thousands and lives, and resulted in the deaths of the entire royal family, thus the King&amp;#39;s line was ended. The various counts and dukes that fought alongside the King are now largely independent. However, a large number of those former vassals now serve the independent Dukes of Fenvith or Tecosia.
