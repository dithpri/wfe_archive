By signing this [region]Contract[/region], I willingly place myself under the protection and jurisdiction of the [color=White][nation]Charter[/nation][/color]. I acknowledge the gift given in exchange, and appreciate the great power which it entails. As a protective measure, I allow for this [region]Contract[/region] to act as a link to my essence, thus ensuring my non-aggression in future matters. Given future debt is accrued, I allow this [region]Contract[/region] to act as further leverage and work to punish me for disobeying the will of the First of Seven. While loose, I nevertheless accept these chains placed upon me, and don them willingly.

AND ONCE JOINED YOU CAN NO LONGER LEAVE [region]Contract[/region] WITHOUT MY APPROVAL
