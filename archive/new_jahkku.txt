[b]In M&amp;#257;ori mythology, T&amp;#257;ne is the god of forests and of birds, and today, Mate [nation]Tane[/nation] of the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy lived up to the history of her name, and proved her power by taking flight among many regions, learning to point for the very first time, and soared high above the seas to land victoriously here today. If you would like to sail beside us on epic journeys like this one, we&#146;d certainly love to have you in our Navy!
