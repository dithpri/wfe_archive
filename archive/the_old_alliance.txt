[color=blue][B]Government[/B][/color]
Our government is currently a work in progress, but will be something like this:
We will elect a nation to head our alliance, and they will appoint others to positions such as Secy of Defense, Secy of Foreign Relations, etc.

A roleplay will start soon, when we get more people. It will most likely be modern, but the people can decide.
