[color=red][region]Christians Puppets[/region] is a region for anyone, but we mostly are followers of Jesus Christ.. The Region was founded in early 2025 by [nation]Nevah Tsim[/nation] and has been led for some time by [nation]Tinsun[/nation]. [nation]Tinsun[/nation] plans to abdicate in late February or early March, leaving the place as epic leader to [nation]Canada234[/nation].[/color] 

[color=orange]Anyone is welcome here, although we are mainly all followers of Jesus Christ![/color]

 [color=red]All embassies read our Embassy Rules Dispatch. Also, anyone who wishes to have an embassy, telegram our Foreign Aid Officer, [nation]Nevah Tsim[/nation] first, so that we can ensure a safe environment for both regions involved.[/color]

[color=orange]We are mostly from [region]Christians[/region], although some come from other regions.[/color]
