If your nation doesn&#39;t want to roleplay, be active, and have to contribute to a community but would rather like to just sit and solve its own issues... COME HERE!

There is no offsite forum, discord, or active roleplays and the government is minimal. Of course, all government types and opinions are welcome.

Tell me (Rhombicuboctahedron) if you have any suggestions, since I am pretty new to this site.

(If anyone actually joins this, I&#39;ll be surprised.)
