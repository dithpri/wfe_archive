[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Protected: 18.02.20[/I]

[color=red]Born from the ashes of the Fascist [region]Northern Redlands[/region] (Destroyed by [region]Antifa[/region]), Redlandia started off on a shaky foundation.

A little over a year ago, after discussions with [nation]Vippertooth33[/nation] the region had taken steps towards redemption and were removed from the [region]Antifa[/region] target list: [url=https://imgur.com/GgzkTVF.jpg]Screenshot.[/url]

This region shall be protected as a museum against HATE in perpetuity, an example set, fascists can be converted.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
