[color=black][b]This region has been struck by the fatal blades of [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region], more precisely by unlikeliest of duos: the Brotherhood&#39;s hamster and the Dormant Custodian.

Although this duo is somewhat odder than the typical ones, dont let it fool you. With the uncanny efficiency ability brought by the Custodian plus hamster butt propelled ammunition, nothing is better than to see regions left in a pile of sunflower seeds and amazing artwork.[/color]
