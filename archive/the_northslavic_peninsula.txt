The Northslavic Peninsula, split between Crioania and Kirgoslavia, is a hub of trade, politics, and rivalry. Crioania, a centrist democracy led by President IGamer, dominates with cities like Catiagrad, Ferentarioania, and Amog City. Kirgoslavia, ruled by the decisive Kirgo, relies on Kirgograd, Sustown, and Saxtownhale. Rivers, the Great Gulf of Crioania, the Sea of Kirgoslavia, and the Kirgo Canal shape its economy. Beyond the map, the authoritarian AmongusOhio exerts economic influence, though Crioania remains the region&#146;s leader.
