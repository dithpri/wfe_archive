[color=green] Welcome to the Union of Socialist Territories. Here you can hang out and do a little RP. If you don&#39;t want to RP that&#39;s alright, we would prefer to maybe have every one in on it but RP is just not some peoples thing.

Here are a few rules:
When talking out of character enclose your message in brackets.
If you are in the WA please endorse Banogo (completely optional but preferred)
You don&#39;t have to have certain freedoms in your nation to RP, run your nation how you want but in the RP your nation will be different.
Think of it as having two different nations, out of character you might be a capitalist paradise, but in the RP you&#39;re Socialist.

That&#39;s all enjoy your stay [/color]
