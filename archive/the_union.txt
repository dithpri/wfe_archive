The Union is a region of states that relies on the democratic values of everyone to promote the general welfare of those that are encompassed within it. The Union&amp;#39;s main goal is to seek total harmony among its member nations, creating a sort of &amp;quot;alliance&amp;quot;.

Any and all nations are welcome to join, regardless of the type of your government. Whether oppressive, liberal, conservative, libertarian or any other type of government, the Union grants a voice to all those who are in it.
