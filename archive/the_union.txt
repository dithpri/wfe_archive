[b][color=3A5D7E]TERRITORY OF THE [region]ELITE REGION OF GLOBAL COMMAND[/region][/color][/b]

[B][region]The Union[/region] , a region eyed by many, especially [region]the Atlas Union[/region], had been the scene of many a battles and high drama. It almost witnessed the dawn of  a new beginning, but for the stubbornness of a dictatorial leader, [nation=short]Ecuadorian Love[/nation]. Scarred by war, the Union has been completely annexed by the valiant troops of Imperial Bordurian Military Force .
Cities, towns and villages have been plundered, pillaged and razed to the ground by constant war.
As on date, the Union is a barren wasteland, purged of any civilized human habitation by the war.

Thus will be the fate of all those who seek to resist the might of [nation]Borduriaa[/nation].[/B]
