[color=BLUE][B]Welcome to the Union![/B][/color]
 
[i][color=RED]Temporary Important Message:[/color]

[color=#984B00]The Union is an independent state. For the first time ever, the region&amp;#39;s delegate is [B]from the region and for the region[/B]. Members of the regions [region]The Atlas Union[/region], [region]Confucius[/region], and [region]Federation of Humanity[/region] have sought to take over The Union for a long time. They wish to invade our region and turn it into a colony of their own. Make The Union a &amp;quot;role-play&amp;quot; region as if our region is their play thing.
Your government will fight tooth and nail to safeguard our independence, but we need your help. I call upon our citizens and true friends, every delegate endorsement is a bullet against the enemy. 

The Union is in our hands, protect it![/color][/i]
