Note by the custodian: The de facto founder and dictator of this region, [nation=Numerous currencies], has ceased to exist, for reasons unknown. Though he still exists in Nationstates and you may contact him at his other neo-nazi nation: [nation=short]Borduria22[/nation]. New and former inhabitants of this region are advised that returning here is [b]at their own risk[/b]. It is thought that the founder has ceased intentionally, in order to lure nations back to this region, and then refound his nation and start oppressing people again. The former founder has however sent a puppet nation &quot;in disguise&quot; ([nation=short]Arabian Knight[/nation]) to what end is unknown.
