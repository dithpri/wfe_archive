[color=BLUE][B]Welcome to the Union![/B][/color]
 
Welcome to the Union, a land the has persevered throughout many difficult times and struggled for absolute independence. 

We have survived many invasions by countless groups. Whether it was by the typical invasion groups, or invaders masquerading as &amp;quot;allies&amp;quot; who sough to destroy our region and turn it into a colony of their own. 
The Union is strong. They try to pull us down, but we always get up. Join us and help us rebuild.

Please endorse the Delegate [nation=short]Ecuadorian Love[/nation], the first true citizen of The Union to lead this region since the fall of our founder Bonvoa, and help secure our region.
