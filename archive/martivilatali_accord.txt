Formed from the nonaligned nations around the Cascade Ocean, the Martivilatali Accord remains a bastion of independence, allowing its members to flourish without fear of foreign intervention. 

Its principal members include the democratic-socialist Republic of Ourisio, whose daring and technological advancement in the skies make &#39;air dominance&#39; a reality, the constitutional monarchy of Avezran, ruled by the immortal Queen Aurix, who boast centuries of naval warfare experience along with highly trained battle mages to dominate the metaphysical, and the loosely associated Councils of Wolstrem, an anarchic collection of beastfolk tribes on the northern coast of Oskara who provide the backbone of the infantry for the alliance.
