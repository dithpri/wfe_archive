First founded sometime in 2003, Steinbaumland was home to a jolly band of nerds for a while and some Finnish guy who never spoke with us but seemed to enjoy our company.  We mourn the passing of our comrades who CtE&amp;#39;d and never resurrected.

Some of us live on - or again, rather - and we plan on remaining here for a long time yet.
