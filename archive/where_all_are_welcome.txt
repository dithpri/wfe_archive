Everyone is welcome here, but there are some rules.
1. No racism or discrimination of any kind.
2. No bullying or harassing.
3. No spamming.
These rules are simple and should be easy to follow, breakers of these rules should be reported to our founder [nation]Peace and Perfectness[/nation] or the current WA delegate.
