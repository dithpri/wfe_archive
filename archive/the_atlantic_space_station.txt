The Atlantic Space Station is a project showing unity among its nations. We have set our sites to the moon and beyond! Who knows what&#146;s out there?

We have not only set our sights on the moon, but also many other unknown planets out there! As we develop, we are looking into a planet that will sustain this region forever! All we need is your sponsorship! Please consider joining the Atlantic Space Station!
