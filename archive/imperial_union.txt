[color=grey]The Imperial Union is a dual monarchy, run by the Houses of Wildt and Bain. We are open to all nations who feel they need a fresh start, or just want new opportunities in existence.

All of our decisions are discussed, and we will never make an unfair or very effective decision without a vote throughout the region.

We hope you like the sound of the Union, and we will see you in game (hopefully)
