Welcome, to the [b]State of Sequoyah![/b]
The State of Sequoyah was a state established from the Indian Territory in the eastern part of present-day Oklahoma. In 1905, with the end of tribal governments looming (as prescribed by the Curtis Act of 1898), Native Americans of the Five Civilized Tribes&#151;the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek (Muscogee), and Seminole&#151;in Indian Territory proposed to create a state as a means to retain control of their lands. Their intention was to have a state under Native American constitution and governance. Congress accepted this.
