[color=#910000][b]Welcome to The Legion![/color] [color=A80000]A place made for YOU![/color] [color=B50000]The person reading this.[/color] [color=C10000]The person either sitting in a region doing nothing or[/color] [color=CC0000]looking for a new region that you hope to grow![/color] [color=D80000]This region is built on the concept of invasions (somewhat).[/color] [color=DB0000]If we don&#39;t like something or someone...[/color] [color=EA0000]Our raider military will take it out![/color]

[color=DB0000]Obviously, we&#39;re a tiny region but we&#39;re looking to change that![/color] [color=D80000]We hope that you join and maybe even help us out and join our military![/color] [color=CC0000]It will need to be much bigger before we can start doing much at all...[/color][color=C10000] but that&#39;s why you matter so much to us![/color]

[color=B50000]I can&#39;t force you to join, but I hope I&#39;ve convinced you![/color] [color=#910000]And lastly, with all the energy I could give, welcome to The Legion.[/b][/color]
