A sprawling land of diverse geography and peoples, map to come. The landscape and setting is that of the 2nd Age of the Exalted series, with the following adjustment: The Wyld Seas to the West and Borderlands to the East have tamed and vanished, connecting to the shores of Modern Day Bermuda via The Triangle to the West, and The Everfree Forest of Equestria in the East. As Magitech and Celestial beings, electronics etc. cross borders, their essence/magic/power fades, and any inconsistent attributes conform to the new region, gods help you if you cross in a jet-plane or essence-fuelled airship.
