It&amp;#39;s a special place. For special people. For special nations.

It&amp;#39;s a unique place. For unique beings. For unique states.

It&amp;#39;s a place of fear. A place of hatred. A place of disgust.

It&amp;#39;s a place of love. A place of friendship. A place of knowledge.

It&amp;#39;s a place that exists. It&amp;#39;s not a place, and doesn&amp;#39;t exist.

It&amp;#39;s a region. It&amp;#39;s not a region.

Whatever you think it is, it&amp;#39;s that. But remember.

It&amp;#39;s a special place.
