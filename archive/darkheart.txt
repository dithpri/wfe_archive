This is a special place. This is a unique place. This is a different place.

This is a special place. This is a special region. This is a special group.

This is a place of love. This is a place of knowledge. This is a place of happiness.

This is a place of hatred. This is a place of anger. This is a place of disgust.

This is a place. This is a place that you think it is.

This isn&amp;#39;t the place you think it is.

This is a place.

This isn&amp;#39;t a place.

We are attractive and convivial.

We are shy and repulsive.

We are what you think of us.

We are, and we aren&amp;#39;t.

This is a special place.

A place of you, a place of me.

There is no place.
