Greater Latvania is a region made up of the former claims of the Latvanian Empire, which started expanding out of the Kingdom of Latvania from 1539 to 1548. When it dissolved in the late 19th century, the Empire left a great number of independent lands in its wake. One of the most prominent countries in Greater Latvania is the People&#39;s Republic of Novorkov, which was the first country to gain independence from the Empire. The  history of oppression that is prevalent in the region has resulted in tight-knit bonds between member states.
