the Table of the Lords is the collective name for the membership of the religion of Yonglism. Yongloids worship Yongle, and believe that the Moon is a rocket carrying the Earth forever towards Yongle. Yongle communicates with the Earth through prophets and Great Prophets, who he sends to guide the world down the correct path. This region is for Yongloids.

There are currently two Yongloid sects:
-Orthodox Yonglism is the most common Yongloid sect, and rejects the Archon as a Great Prophet.
-Archonian Yonglism (or Yongloid Archonism) holds that the Archon of the UEPOW is a Yongloid Great Prophet, sent to Earth to conquer in Yongle&amp;#39;s name.
