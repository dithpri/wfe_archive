The Bee Commune of the Luminous Sea was founded by spiritual pilgrims and human explorers of mind and cosmos on these precepts:

1. To be a vanguard of the playful spirit of whimsy and wonder;
2. To illuminate all things;
and 3. To act always in the spirit of abundance and endless novelty. 

Bees are held to be sacred in this region. Devotion to Holy Sophia is common.
