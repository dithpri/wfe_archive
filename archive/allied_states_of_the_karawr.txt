&amp;quot;Hail the All Mighty Rawr!&amp;quot;

Long ago the All Mighty Rawr was made by the Universe.
In its birth this country and its people were made, In its creation war and anarchy was brought into existence! We worship this great being as our master, our general, our creator! We are only pawns in his army, warriors of its Greatness, we live and die by the laws of the Rawr. All non-believers are our enemies, all those who oppose him shall be struck down and sacrificed to his Greatness! This is to be given as a warning to those who oppose him are are treasonous to his laws! You come, disloyal to the Rawr you shall be struck down and sacrificed to the 
pit of the All Mighty Rawr. Hail the Mighty Rawr!
