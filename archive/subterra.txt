Deep underneath the surface of the Earth lie nations who never see the light of Sol. Despite hazards like earthquakes, tunnel collapse, flooding, &amp;amp; Mongolian death worms; life is relatively pleasant and comfortable with billions of natural caverns featuring a wide variety of temperatures and climates.

&amp;quot;Protecting&amp;quot; the borders of the region is the &amp;quot;nation&amp;quot; of Molemania, the domain of a crazed super-villain known as &amp;quot;The Moleman&amp;quot; who firmly believes that the Crust and Subterranean nations must never work together. With his army of mecha-moles, a sprawling spy network, and resources from extensive mining operations; few on the surface of the Earth even know that there are nations beneath their feet, while those below think the Sky is a legend.
