Where the wanderers of time, the travellers of space, the day-trippers of zuvuya and the hermits of nostalgia come to spin the yarn, swap stories, conspire against their mutual enemies, or simply update my apps, free of charge!

The world is big enough for everyone, so sit down, put your feet up; lean back and enjoy the romulan ale, Klingon opera or Cardassian saga....

...btw, if you do wander outside, shut the door behind you...
