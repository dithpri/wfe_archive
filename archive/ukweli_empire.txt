[b][u]The Ukweli Empire[/u][/b]

A coalition or states that are or formerly were a part of the Ukweli Empire, or its current incarnation, [nation]Ukweliland[/nation]. This also may include rebels, separatist groups or breakaway states such as the contested and unrecognised [nation]North Kiwangale[/nation] (who OOCly is not the same guy as the one who owns Ukweliland). Foreign states are also welcome, to serve as an emissary or a member of our community.

The region is focused on RP (except for puppets stored here for future RP by the Founder), and there are no joining requirements. We only ask that you enjoy RP and can get along with the members of our community.
