[b]Welcome! The Meme Society of Gru is now a free region under the benevolent rule of [region]The Winter Moon Empire[/region].[/b]

Located in a remote, northern part of Greenland, The Meme Society of Gru is a conglomerate of small nations and confederacies who banded together for resources and security. The several nations, united under the mother country [nation]Felonious Gru[/nation], created the Meme Society of Gru. The country&#39;s main goal is to find allies in this dark, cruel world, and to take over all of Greenland for themselves, and eventually colonize space. With a claim made on the moon through a small group of minions, the society has a foothold into the far future. 

Godspeed, and [i]praise be to Gru![/i]
