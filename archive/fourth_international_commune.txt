In the spirit of international solidarity and the unwavering pursuit of a stateless society, the Fourth International Commune proclaims itself a community built upon the principles of Marxism and the power of the working class. We, the collective, commit to abolishing all forms of oppression, exploitation, and class struggle, striving for a world where resources and wealth are held in common by all. We shall dismantle the mechanisms of the state. We shall create a harmonious existence where cooperation and mutual aid replace competition, thus advancing humanity toward true liberation and equality for all and most of all, [b]we shall bring death to fascists[/b]!
