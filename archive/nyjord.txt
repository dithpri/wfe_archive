In ancient times, long ago, the old people found a new planet, and called it Nyjord. They landed on a large continent, later named Syvrike. Through many years of conquest, rebellion, and feud, the new continent became what it is today. 

Tensions are still high, and the new world is on the brink of new war. Exploration of the region has not continued past the continent of Syvrike. For the safety of those innocent to the wars, new arrivals to Nyjord are prohibited until things settle down.
