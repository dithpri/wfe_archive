Taigavia is a large administrative area within the traditional boundaries of Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is home to ethnic Taigavians and Russians, the former a historically oppressed minority, the latter from old Soviet resettlement programs and the descendants of the gulag system. Over the years, the inhabitants of Taigavia, both Taigavian and Russian, have felt increasingly disconnected from the Russian Federation in both culture and policy. There are whispers of secession among the people, and time will tell if autonomy comes to fruition&#133;
