The Terran Federation is a pro-democratic region founded after the worldwide collapse of nations during a cataclysmic event known as &quot;the troubles.&quot;

According to a History and Moral Philosophy teacher, &quot;personal freedom for all is [the] greatest in history, laws are few, taxes are low, living standards are as high as productivity permits, crime is at its lowest ebb.&quot;

The Federation is a welcome home to states that value personal freedom and free markets above all, while still maintaining a degree of social order and a stout defensive posture.
