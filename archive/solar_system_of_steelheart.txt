[b][u]&quot;We are amazing! After all, why wouldn&#39;t we be?&quot;[/u][/b]

Here in the Solar System of Steelheart, we have found a revolutionary way to create a go-through glass bubble, which we call a planet. That is how we are a Solar System. We all have our own planet, but we orbit around our founder, the Solarsun. Nation big or small, all can have their own planet.
