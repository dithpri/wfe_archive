And one of the strongest Allies of Catreyulia being [color=#33cccc]Blackyre Isles[/color] as the Tradesman and Ambassador for the Region, the Robot Inhabited Nation [color=#8b8b8b]CAT Freelands[/color] generating power for the Entire Region, the apparently MLG Nation [color=#00ccff]Krunst[/color] being 3rd in command, the jolly Nation [color=#cc00cc]Catreyilyer[/color] patrolling the Borders, the Mostly Medieval Nation [color=#663300]Catreyrialvia[/color] being Backup Defense and the Shy Nation of [color=#33cc33]Catreypilus[/color] producing food and taking care of Nations in need.
