Welcome, truthseekers! The Grand Alliance of the Truth is devoted to creating a safe haven for all those who seek refuge from the oversight of the unholy World Assembly. The freedom of the True citizens of member nations to practice their faith is requisite for membership. Any member who seeks to bring the Grand Alliance into the unholy World Assembly by seeking the regional delegacy shall be ejected upon discovery.

Save the above regulations, all members of the Grand Alliance are free to develop their economies, cultures, and political systems in any manner whatsoever. Welcome to the Grand Alliance!
