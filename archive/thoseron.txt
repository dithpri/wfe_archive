[i][u]&amp;quot;So comrades, come rally
And the last fight let us face
The International unites the human race.

No more deluded by reaction
On tyrants only we&#146;ll make war
The soldiers too will take strike action
They&#146;ll break ranks and fight no more
And if those cannibals keep trying
To sacrifice us to their pride
They soon shall hear the bullets flying
We&#146;ll shoot the generals on our own side.

No saviour from on high delivers
No faith have we in prince or peer
Our own right hand the chains must shiver
Chains of hatred, greed and fear
E&#146;er the thieves will out with their booty
And give to all a happier lot.
Each at the forge must do their duty
And we&#146;ll strike while the iron is hot.&amp;quot;[/u][/i]
