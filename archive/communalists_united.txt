This region is a welcoming place for *communalists, Apoists, Neo-Zapatistas, social ecologists, supporters of libertarian municipalism, and libertarian socialists who want to game together.

We have no tolerance for racism, sexism, queerphobia, abeism, or any other form of bigotry. Also, blatantly disrespectful, intimidating, bullying, or violent conduct will result in immediate banjection.

On that note, welcome.

*We DO NOT support &quot;communalist&quot; racism as understood on the Indian subcontinent. English is weird.
