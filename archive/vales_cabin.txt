[b]Ursidae and Ezkio decided to fly light tonight, and ventured into Nationstates on their lonesome. Unfortunately the fun didn&#39;t last as Ursidae had wolfed down way too much Salmon during his pre-raid snack, and as they ventured farther into Nationstates he gradually became more tired. Eventually, the Bear slumped to the ground, refusing to move any further. No matter how hard the Hawks tried they couldn&#39;t rouse him (even with Woryand and Miss Bad Life Choice&#39;s help), and they were forced to cut their flight short. If you reckon you could have moved the bear or like the sound of pre-raid snacks why not check out [region]The Black Hawks[/region] [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]discord[/url]?
