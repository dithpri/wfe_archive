- Check out the starting template and copy the dispatch into your own!
- Open the Snipping Tool on Windows, use Shift-Command-5 on Mac, or otherwise take a screenshot of the area that you want your country to be in! Don&#39;t make it too big- try and get a similar size to the other nations on the map.
- Put this screenshot into a dispatch or otherwise send it to Brototh, and your country will be put on the official map!
