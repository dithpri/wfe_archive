The Amenistani United Front is a coalition of independent states located chiefly in Central Asia and Eastern Europe of the fractured Serene Republic of Amenistan. Connected chiefly by ethnic background, the remaining republics are notoriously far right-wing and often shun the values of capitalism, while being against hereditary succession and supporting a strong government above a broken people. Nowadays, the states consider themselves brothers with independent interests - Close connections, albeit far hopes for the future, and little wishes to reunite. It was only through their individual conquests of one another and from foreign powers that they decided to create a front to foster freezing relations of an era long forgotten.
