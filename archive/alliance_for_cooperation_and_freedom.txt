The ACF is a bloc of countries that work together for the common objective of economical and political freedom, respecting each other&#39;s traditions, culture, religion, autonomy, authority and dignity. ACF is a peaceful bloc and its members shall not start conflicts, but if a conflict is started against any of the members, others ought help them in any possible mean (if there are possible means). The nations that form this bloc must grant freedom practice in the said means and the natural rights of every citizen (life, property, free initiative and equality before the law), must be open to trade with every member of the bloc if an agreement is reached, and preferably have a free market policy of foreign trade.
