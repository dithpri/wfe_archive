Co-Founded by countries Ara Ant and Degovnianvadiananopia, Watermelon Island is a peaceful region. Those who wish to live under the Dictatorship of Sky live in the north, past the Dark Heaven Mountains, in what locals refer to as Degovnia, whereas those who wish to live a life of liberties choose to live in the Black Sand beaches to the south in the free land of Ara Ant. To the east and west lie unexplored territory.
