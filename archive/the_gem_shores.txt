An isolated chain of islands of varying size. The earth is rich with gemstones, which are mined and used as currency in the region. Each island is named for the gems that are found there. These features give the region its name.

On each island, the people follow different customs, and are self-governed. While travel between the islands is usually accepted, the differences between the people living on each one is different enough that it could result in quite the culture shock.
