April 29, 1992
There was a riot on the streets
Tell me where were you
You were sittin&amp;#39; at home watchin your TV 
While I was causin&amp;#39; some anarchy
First stop we made was the Liquor Store
I finally got all that liquor I can&amp;#39;t afford
Red lights flashin&amp;#39;
Its time to retire
Then we made that Liquor Store into a structure fire
Next stop we made was the Music Shop
It only took one brick to make that window drop
Then we finally got our own p.a&amp;#39;s
Where do you think I got this guitar I&amp;#39;m playing today.
