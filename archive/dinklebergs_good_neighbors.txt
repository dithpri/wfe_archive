It started long ago....., in the ancient time of 1998. Dinkleberg was first thought of. Everyone thought of him as a god, and they were right. They made statues, churches, and religions based around this great human being. He stayed with us for a long while, but the fateful year of 2006, he disappeared without a trace. People were devastated, at the loss of a hero. A year passed, and Dinkleberg came back, to look over his children. After that great day, we made this group to praise Dinkleberg, so that one day, he will come to us.

Long Praise Dinkleberg......
