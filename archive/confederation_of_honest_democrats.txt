[b][i][u]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/u][/i][/b]

This political satire/mockery of [region]Confederation of Corrupt Dictators[/region], an ally to [region]J o J[/region], has been shut down by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]. If you&#39;re going to make a satirical region, at least do it right, you couldn&#39;t even maintain your puppet for a single month. This will now become a regional territory of [region]J o J[/region].
