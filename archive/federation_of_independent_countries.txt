The city is a panorama of &quot;vast angles and stone surfaces [...] too great to belong to anything right and proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and disturbing hieroglyphs.&quot; The geometry of R&#39;lyeh is &quot;abnormal, non-Euclidean, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours.&quot; The strange architecture of the city makes navigation on foot disorienting and treacherous; surfaces that appear flat may actually be tilted, and angles of masonry that appear convex at first glance may actually be concave.
