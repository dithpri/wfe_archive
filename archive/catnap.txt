We are building a world that our descendants can be proud of. 
The foundations of which are:
Equality for all
Tolerance of all (excluding such practices that infringe upon others)
Peace
Protecting the Environment
Justice
Education
A Socialist Economy
and allowing cats to frolic in the lush forests
