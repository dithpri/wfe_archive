Oh the land is definitely marked now,
same as me, and it feels good. It
satisfies in a way I never really
thought anything would. It fills that
hollow, lonely hole inside quite
nicely. It&#146;s not sadism, or
masochism, I tried both of those
already. I think it&#146;s the fear, the look
in their eyes once they realize their
mistake, it just makes me want to
hold them close, so I do.
