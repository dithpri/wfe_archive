The CFP is a small yet powerful region, founded on the basic principle that all people have a right to Life, Liberty, Property, and the Pursuit of Happiness. All nations are welcome, so long as they are willing to abide by those rules. Our secondary goal is to ensure our basic principle across the World Assembly, making the world a safer, more efficient place.

Long Live the Coalition.
