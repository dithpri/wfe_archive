The Tezhme Constellation is a micronation project that is a combination an performance art, personal exploration, intentional community, and elaborate in-jokes. It is a meme-ocracy - that is, governance by whatever amuses us at the time. It falls into the &#39;Ha Ha Only Serious&#39; category of activities in that it is amusing and fun, yet something that can be used for genuine self-exploration and personal development.

Either you get it, or you don&#39;t.
