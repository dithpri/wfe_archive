[b] Welcome to the SimTropican Union of Nations or STUN, 

Announcement from The STUN, and in the name of the King,
As A smaller nation, we look to improving member states while keeping a minimal presence in the outside world. Our Government is a strange but Secure form where it combines the working of an Executive and Represented body from a republic from The Court of Common States, in an entirely democratic way. This Form is what makes SimTropican vigorous and robust. The Executive branch is by appointment by the King, and by the Congress of STUN. There is more info on the Forums. Entry is by acceptance by the Security Council and the King
