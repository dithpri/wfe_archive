[b][i][color=teal] History: The five founding members - [nation]Phlomberlia[/nation], [nation]Soulite Mintstalactic[/nation], [nation]NOTNoche[/nation], [nation]Heevan[/nation], and [nation]LeDefansay[/nation] - formed [region]The Strange Alliance[/region] to protect and serve eachother from other outside threats. Although they couldn&#146;t think of an alliance name, they all agreed that they were all strange in some particular way, thus the name, &#145;[region]The Strange Alliance[/region].&#146; [/color]
