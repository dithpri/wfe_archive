[b][i][color=orange]We welcome any and all with open arms to: [region]The Strange Alliance[/region]![/color]
[color=teal] History: The five founding members - [nation]Phlomberlia[/nation], [nation]Soulite Mintstalactic[/nation], [nation]NOTNoche[/nation], [nation]Heevan[/nation], and [nation]LeDefansay[/nation] - formed [region]The Strange Alliance[/region] to protect and serve eachother from other outside threats. They all thought they were strange in some way, thus they named it,&#145;[region]The Strange Alliance[/region].&#146; [/color]
[color=Magenta]Please, allow us to help you in anyway, as that is one of our main purposes and focuses in our region. Our main focus is to also allow different types of nations to work together to create a bond that&#146;ll last as long at the sun rises in our Alliance.[/color]
