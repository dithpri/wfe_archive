[b]This historical museum is dedicated to General Lipno, who led the PRA through victories, as well as failures in the months of November and early December of 2014. A bullet from a GGR soldier&amp;#39;s Astra 900 ended his life, but his legacy lived, lives and will live among us.

The PRA was officially disbanded during the 6th TCR Crisis.[/b]
