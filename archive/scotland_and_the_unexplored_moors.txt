In Scotland, a moor is defined as land that is neither forested nor under cultivation. In a wider ecological sense, it consists of an uncultivated highland tract characterized by high rainfall, acidic soil, and low, scrubby vegetation. It is estimated that 12 percent of Scotland&#39;s land mass consists of moors.
