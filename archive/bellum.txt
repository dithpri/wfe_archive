We stand together, but flourish apart.

PREAMBLE OF THE LAMP

A journey of a thousand miles begins with buying a plane ticket! Through the never and forever we fight for our deaths and our place not in this world, or the next, but on the moon. Through our time in the future we seek not only to make the most idiot region on this planet ever, but to create, establish, enhance, treasure, improve, mend, restore, destroy, rectify, cow pie, the most idiotic region on this here planet.
