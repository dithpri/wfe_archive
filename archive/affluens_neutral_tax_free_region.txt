23.5.2018.  After long disputes with Good7Region and the oppressive force of Frotesca, finally, Affluens came to terms with its problems. There is nothing that unites this no-tax country with high-tax communist Good7Region. Affluens declared independence and from now on forms a 1-nation region. 
The region is small and will remain so. But it is at least independent.
There is no entry to this region. Affluens stands alone.
