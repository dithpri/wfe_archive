Arab Jamahiriyah&amp;#39;s personal region and puppet dump, for now. Also a presentation of a terrifying future where wars are fought to prove a version of Minecraft is genuine, and where fanboyism becomes a state ideology. Contains elements of [i]Half-Life[/i], [i]Fallout[/i], [i]Minecraft[/i], [i]Command and Conquer[/i], and [i]Nineteen Eighty-Four[/i]. Roleplays concerning the canon here would be accepted if reasonable and would simply be viewed as an interdimensional mash-up event.
Embassies are welcome and will be accepted. With enthusiasm. (Capitalists, fascists, technophobes etc will still be rejected)
