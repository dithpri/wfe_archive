Arab Jamahiriyah&amp;#39;s personal region and puppet dump, for now. Also a presentation of a terrifying future where wars are fought to prove a version of Minecraft is genuine, and where fanboyism becomes a state ideology. Contains elements of Half-Life, Fallout, Minecraft, Command and Conquer, and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Roleplays concerning the canon here would be accepted if reasonable and would simply be viewed as an interdimensional mash-up event.
