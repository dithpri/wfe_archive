Welcome to the strongest Christian Region on the site. Christain Empire, a empire for those of faith. To prove that faith isn&amp;#39;t weak, we are not bigamist, lying, people; that we are strong and can produce just as good and better then the rest. All are equal, but some people create un-equality and we wont settle for that. With our faith, our brains, our morals, and our goals we are unstoppable.
