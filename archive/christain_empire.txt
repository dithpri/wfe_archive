Hello, and welcome to the Christain Empire. As in our title we are a Christian region, with more conservative morals, and ideals. Yet, we still have fun. We have our own off nation states site for contact, work, and other things we want to do in the region.

The Election Date is 9,21,2014. All regional members may opt to run for the WA Seat.

I have not left the region, I am just in a new section of the empire, wales for a little bit. I will be back very soon, I am still keeping a eye on the region.
