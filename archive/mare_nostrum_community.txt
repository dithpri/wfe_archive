[i]Love, peace, and determination[/i]

Welcome, everyone, to the Mare Nostrum Community, where nations from all around the Mediterranean stick together and form a union of love, peace, and determination! We&#39;re looking forward to have a government, so please, if you&#39;re interested, just call the regional founder and I&#39;ll give you the office. We also lack of a Discord server where we can chat, discuss and chill, but we can make it togeher! Plus, we have inaugurated the Mare Nostrum Legion Corpse, our raiding/defending armed forces. If you&#39;re here because of this, wait for the next order.

[b][i][u]FOUNDED:[/u][/i][/b] 3rd December 2023.
