[u][b]MARE NOSTRUM COMMUNITY[/b][/u]
[i]Love, peace, and determination[/i]

Welcome, everyone, to the Mare Nostrum Community, where nations from all around the Mediterranean stick together and form a union that will be hard to separate! Except if there is a controversy involving the region or any of their members. We&#39;re looking forward to have a government, so please, if you&#39;re interested, just call on your regional founder, [nation]Mare Nostrum Community Founder[/nation], AKA, me, and I&#39;ll give you the office. We also lack of a Discord server where we can chat, discuss and chill, but we can make it togeher!

[b][i][u]FOUNDED:[/u][/i][/b] 3rd December 2023.
[b][i][u]FEATURED:[/u][/i][/b] Not yet ;-;

We hope you spend a good time here. Enjoy your stay!
