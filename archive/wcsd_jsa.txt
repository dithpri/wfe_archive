ATTENTION
It has become apparent that This region is not really used but the official WCSD JSA. I will be moving my nations to Brijnhollow&#39;s new region, The George Orwell Playhouse in one week. If you still use nation states at all, you have one week to vacate the region. If you do not want to move to The George Orwell Playhouse, then I recommend the Covenant. It&#39;s a community of friendly, mostly socialist nations without a password.
