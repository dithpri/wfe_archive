[b]Welcome to Starbase 375, Fleet Registration Command Center for Starfleet Missions[/b]

This Sigma-class starbase serves as the staging ground for all Starfleet vessels embarking on [i]The Quest for the Celestial Nexus[/i]. To join the fleet, please move your newly created Star Trek-themed nation to [region]Starbase 375[/region] and register by linking your main nation&#146;s name on the Regional Message Board (RMB). One nation per player is permitted, thank you.

Role-playing is encouraged on the RMB as Starfleet captains, crew, and civilians prepare for the mission ahead. Once registered, prepare your crew and await further orders. Mission details and the coordinates of your first destination will be relayed to all fleet members soon.
