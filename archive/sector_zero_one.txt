The capital city of Outcast Haven, the former land of The United States of America was chosen as the nation&#39;s capital due to its prominence in both the War for Unity and the World-Reformation Project. It is heavily fortified and defended just as much the other Sectors; with a focus on not only managing the new nation as a whole but also depending on the other major Sectors for resource production. Sector Zero-One is the heart of Outcast Haven, and the other Sectors are the circulation that keeps the wheels turning. Here, this is where alliances can be forged, envoys can come and visit, and resources can be traded.
