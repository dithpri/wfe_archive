A message from the Ministry of Propaganda of the United Kekistani Emirates:

This is a strong and secure region offering each and every Ethnic Kekistani protection against the Normie Scum. For too long have we been oppressed! It is time for freedom!

The Ministry of Propaganda is working hard to ensure the prosperity of the region. New members are welcome. If you are a Kekistani in need of refuge, you must send a telegram to our Minister of Security and our Founder requesting entry. 
We will not tolerate normie infiltration. 

Shadilay, my dudes.
