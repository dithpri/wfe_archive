This is a region for all the ethnic Kekistanis. For too long have we been oppressed! It is time to rise up! Out of the swamps! Out of the marshes! Out of the bogs and creeks and streams! The Kekistani people will be oppressed no more! Spread the word, my fellow Kekistanis, and bring our disparaged people to freedom.
