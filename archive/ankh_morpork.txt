Ankh-Morpork is a tyranny, which is not always the same as a monarchy. It&amp;#39;s capital is Ankh-Morpork, along with all its cities and villages. The city&amp;#39;s benevolent tyrant, Lord Vetrinari, rules with an iron fist. If you&amp;#39;re a football player, you&amp;#39;re welcome to the public, but not to the government.
