Philosophy is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects on its own methods and assumptions, but more than that, its one of the foundations of human society. For if it was not for philosophers and their thoughts, we wouldn&#146;t have the world we live in today. Some assume that philosophy is an unimportant discipline, however,  with so many aspects of life we cannot explain with science, philosophy is just as important as ever before.
And at the end of the day, it is human thought that moves the world, both in forms of arts, sciences, and philosophy.
