The star Acrux &#150; aka Alpha Crucis &#150; is the brightest star in the constellation of the Southern Cross. This constellation&#146;s official name is Crux. The star Acrux is the 13th brightest star in all the sky. Because it&#146;s located far to the south of the sky&#146;s equator, this star isn&#146;t visible from much of North America. You need to be south of central Florida or south Texas. Observers in Hawaii sometimes tell us they&#146;ve seen it. It&#146;s best to be farther south than the southern U.S. to see Crux in all its glory. Now is a good time of year to spot it, if you&#146;re in the right place on the globe.
