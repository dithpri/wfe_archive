A vast, near-continental expanse with a relatively homogeneous people and culture seemingly derived from Europe and Asia, centred around [nation=short]Neu Szinkaustjan[/nation]. With its beginnings shrouded in mystery and a rich history composed of empires, revolutions, heroes, dictators, even near-cataclysmic collapses Szinkaustjanovia continues to thrive in its own unique way. And perhaps there is further still space for the birth of new nations.

(tl;dr Formerly Neu Szinkaustjan&amp;#39;s puppet dump, although RP would be pretty cool. The historical context takes place strictly in MT/Early PMT although alternate tech like steampunk and dieselpunk would be a welcome addition.)
