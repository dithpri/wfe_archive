Welcome, to the Pan-African Union (PAU). This is an anti-colonial region which celebrates African revolutionaries, Pan-Africanism, African socialism, decolonization, African development, and greater African co-operation! We seek to develop practical solutions to help lead to greater unity among African states, and thus, a more thriving African continent.
