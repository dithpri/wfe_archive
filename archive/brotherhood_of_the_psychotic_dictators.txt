We are the Dictators of the world, who lust for power and grab control of all. We tend to do this diplomatically (through the World Assembly. I know it says we&amp;#39;re anti-WA, but that&amp;#39;s because it tends to vote for things that limit our ability to control.) We stand by each other, though, because we know what loyalty is. We may invade our enemies, but we will not invade those who have done us no harm, because, as I said, we&amp;#39;re diplomatic.
So let us rise up together, dictators, kings, and tyrants of the world! Rise up, and take control!

I also recommend everyone join the World Assembly.
