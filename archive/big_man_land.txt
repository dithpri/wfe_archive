[b]ONE GROUP, ONE REGION, ONE LEADER[/b]

[b]Info[/b]: [i]The strongest, prettiest and most resourceful region known to Terra, Inside of the hollow earth on the east side of Agartha, the land of the advance races you will find us; Big Man-Land. Where there are only hyper intelligent giants roaming the lands, for only the best and strongest nations to strive.[/i]
[b]Agenda[/b]: [i]We must burn the heretic, kill the mutant, and purge the unclean. And then, when we&#146;ve freed ourselves of weakness, empathy, remorse, and guilt, when the last sub-human has been cleansed from our land, and the last trace of their existence purged from this planet, we&#146;ll ascend to the stars and make them our own.[/i]
