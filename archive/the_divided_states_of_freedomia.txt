[i]Historically, Freedomians have never gotten along with each other. Only the turbulent world around them motivates them to, occasionally, band together and work in unison for a very limited amount of time.

The Divided States of Freedomia is a region for (and by) extreme governments. Whether this means you&#39;re an anarchical wasteland completely devoid of any social structure, or a wacky dictatorship slowly replacing your population with fish, you&#39;re welcome here. Those of us deemed &#39;too inhumane&#39; by other regions have got to get by somehow.
