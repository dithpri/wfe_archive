This is the world of Memecenterius.

Memecenterius can be both a dangerous place and a safe haven, depending on where you are, and what your ideas are.

It is currently dominated by The Allied States of Dravenia, The Duck-obsessed Colony of Fascist Ducklandian Wing and the War-crazed nation of Damnation Prime.

Technology in Memecenterius is quite advanced and its nations seek to expand their power to other planets. Some will stop at nothing to achieve that goal...
