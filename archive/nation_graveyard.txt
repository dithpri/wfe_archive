Welcome to the [b]Nation Graveyard[/b]

The Nation Graveyard is a region where you can leave your nation to die, but make sure you turn off vacation mode, which makes it die slower. You don&#39;t need to give me your password; just leave your nation here. I need help running this place, so if you want to help keep raiders away or make this place look better, you can come to me.

Also I will be in the [region]United Kingdom[/region] Please don&#39;t raid me.
