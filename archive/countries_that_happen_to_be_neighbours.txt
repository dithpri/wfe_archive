[b]Regional Assembly of Countries That Happen to be Neighbours[/b]

&quot;Theoretically, it&#39;s a brilliant concept!&quot; says Bertold Goltz, a popular philosopher from [nation]Alphanes[/nation]. &quot;Every country bordering with member states is automatically pulled into the Assembly, thus expanding our borders and reaching further countries, until at last [i]every[/i] nation becomes part of the community, achieving at long last unity of mankind! It&#39;s such a moron-proof concept, I wonder why nobody thought of it earlier?
Next to him, Alexander Pistoletov, the Supreme Leader of [nation]Erigate[/nation], adjusts his human-skin made hat with the barrel of his revolver, all at once making Goltz painfully aware of the flaws of his theory.
