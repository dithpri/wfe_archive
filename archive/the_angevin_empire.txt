When I noticed this region a few months ago, it was empty, devoid of nations. I was new to NationStates back then, and being intrigued by a region with zero members, I sent it an embassy request for fun.

Some time later, I searched for the region, only to discover that it had vanished from existence.

Because of this, I decided to refound this region as a colony of [region]True Land[/region].

If you are a native and you would like this region back, please telegram [nation]India-Kebabistan[/nation].
