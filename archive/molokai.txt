[color=003366][b]Molokai[/b], often called the [i]Friendly Island[/i], is an island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is 38 by 10 miles in size at its extreme length and width with a usable land area of 260 square miles, making it the fifth-largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island in the United States.

Residents or visitors to the west end of Molokai can see the lights of Honolulu at night; they can view nearby Lanai and Maui from anywhere along the south shore of the island. In Kalawao County, on the Kalaupapa Peninsula on the north coast, settlements were established in 1866 for quarantined treatment of persons with leprosy; these operated until 1969.[/color] &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
