Until recently, the Allusian Empire maintained total control of its territory. When the last Emperor Maximillian VII died without an hier, the Empire effectively died. An ineffective regency council came to power and due to this incompetence the Empire began to disintegrate into the member states of this region. As the Empire collapses further, more and more independent states will be established in this region.
