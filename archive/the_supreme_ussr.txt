[colour=darkred]Become a SSR today!

Just create a nation, find or create a glorious soviet name and use it for your nation (e.g. West Russian SSR), pick an appropriate flag and join the region!

I will let you know when you have been granted SSR membership.

For SSR members, you can get a map spot. Just telegram me and describe to me what you want (e.g. Manchuria, Siberia). As I&#39;m a regional founder, I will not need a spot.[/colour]
