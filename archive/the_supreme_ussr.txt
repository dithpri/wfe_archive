Oops! Looks like [nation]Montane[/nation] threw a hissy fit and accidentally lost one of his regions! [region]The Second Kingdom of Germany[/region] and the National Imperialist Party of [region]the Kaiserreich[/region] stand in defiance of you, [nation]Montane[/nation]. The National Imperialist Party governs all of the USSR&#39;s European Territories and Transcaucasia, except Saint Petersburg, (think how the East India Company owned India) and the rest is governed by [region]The Second Kingdom of Germany[/region].
