Ufraia United is a militant legion based in the Atlantic Coast of what was once known as North America, and is bordered by Divine Goldsnow Republic. It was founded in 2013 and the Capital City is Moorestown. Ufraia first got it&#39;s start when the government was overthrown by its own people. It is now held together by a strong military. 

Ufraia started out in shambles after the overthrowing of the government. But, it is now a stronger region that is ran by mainly the military with a fair amount of public opinion. Although public opinion is accepted, military rule can overthrow large matters of the region. Ufraia is a quiet nation, but will go to war if it is deemed necessary.
