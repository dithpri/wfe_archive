DAIT has been established for use by any democratically controlled region who struggles under the tyrannical leadership of an invading force. Our brief is to temporarily attract WA member states when called upon to do so by nations who have lost power in their own regions to hostile forces. With those nations, we will enter peacefully, regain control for rightful leaders and allow them to use their own power to expel hostile forces.

We will never elect one of our own to power in any region we are tasked to help.
