The kok kok kok is full of kok kok kok. We are a religeous region, we follow the swoly bible. 
The national prayer is:
Our father whos arms are heavy
Hallowed be thy gains
The gains will come
The reps be done
On a bench, at a 45&deg; incline
Give us our whey, our creatine, and aminos
Forgive us our cheat reps
As we for give those who ego lift to
And lead us not into CrossFit
But deliver us from all cardio
For these are our gains, the muscle and veins, forever and ever amen.
