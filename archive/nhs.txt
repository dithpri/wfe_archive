[color=#FFD700]Where trails meet and friendships grow[/color]
There&#39;s a school I know,
[color=#FFD700]With a spirit proud and bold,[/color]
Fighting for the black and gold.

[color=#FFD700]Upward, onward, ever forward,[/color]
Lift your banners high
[color=#FFD700]Hail to thee, our Alma Mater,[/color]
Hail, all hail, to [censored town] High!
