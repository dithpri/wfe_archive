Our region was founded in the month of October in the year 2014.

We hope to provide a well-founded and well-done RP style community, based on an alternate sort of planet. Anyone who enjoys RP is free to join. RP styles will vary as will the time setting such as Renaissance, Medieval, Modern, Futurisitc, and so on. That being said, the actual world, continents, and geography will stay consistent, although who holds what territory will vary. We hope you enjoy your stay, cheers!
