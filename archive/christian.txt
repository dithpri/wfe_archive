Welcoming to all, we remember Paul&#39;s words to us: [i]&quot;So now you are no longer strangers and aliens. Rather, you are fellow citizens with God&#146;s people, and you belong to God&#146;s household&quot;[/i] (Eph. 2:19).

[i]&quot;The Lord is our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble.&quot;[/i] (Psalms 46:1)
