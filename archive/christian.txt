[color=Blue]This is now a Protectorate of the Christian Republic by the Grace of God, defended by the Grand Christian Army[/color]
This region is now under the protection of The Christian republic
Besides this, life continues as normal. Here is an inspirational Bible verse:[color=red] Ephesians 2:8-9 King James Version (KJV):
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God, 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.[/color]
This region is called Christian. It is a place for Christians to worship and love God. God is the only thing that truly deserves our praise and Glory, not any man. Sorry natives about the WFE! If you could assist us in returning the WFE to its former glory, that would be great.
