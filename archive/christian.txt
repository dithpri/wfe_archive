&quot;Lord is our refuge and strength, an ever present help in trouble.&quot; (Psalms 46:1)

Christan is a region, open to all forms of Christianity. Though we accept all forms of Christianity, we accept Jesus as our strength and help. We are also small, where all nations are open to say their opinions, and all are equal to each other. Please consider joining us, if you want a wholesome, yet friendly region. 

Welcoming to all, we remember Paul&#39;s words to us, &quot;So now you are no longer strangers and aliens. Rather, you are fellow citizens with God&#146;s people, and you belong to God&#146;s household&quot; (Eph. 2:19). 

Weekly bible verse: &quot;For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh.&quot; (2 Corinthians 10:3)
