This region has returned to the control of its native members. [region]Christian[/region] would like to thank the actions of [region]The Christian Republic[/region] for their protection during the Founder&amp;#39;s absence. Our region is home to a diverse group of nations, some of which are active and some of which are quite sleepy. We gladly welcome any and all refugees and/or nations looking for a safe haven. We follow no single sect of Christianity, though most of us are Protestants in various denominations. We hope you will enjoy your stay with us! Please message the Founder and/or Delegate with any questions or concerns. 

&amp;quot;So now you are no longer strangers and aliens. Rather, you are fellow citizens with God&#146;s people, and you belong to God&#146;s household&amp;quot; (Eph. 2:19)
