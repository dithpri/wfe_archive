Veroldia is a place for people with really lore heavy nations that just don&#39;t really work in less roleplay heavy regions. Veroldia has a lot of room to work with in terms of RP, and is designed to incorporate nations with far future technology, nations barely past the stone age, nations with high fantasy magic, and anything in between.

Things to note:
-Veroldia is a roleplay region, only join if you&#39;re willing and comfortable with roleplaying as your nation.
-Veroldia is welcoming to all and we will NOT tolerate anything racist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted.
-We might set up a discord if anyone actually joins (unlikely)
-I really have no idea how this will go on the offchance anyone else joins
