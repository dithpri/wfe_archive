(I.E. pandemics, all out wars, breaking of physics, ect.)

we ask that the least amount of seriousness exspected is that you are not out right breaking reality, that your nations is taken atleast alittle politically serious.
nations w/ lack of serious names/build like &quot;the nation of glorious memes&quot; will be banned.
we&#39;re more laxed on gayfull nations
