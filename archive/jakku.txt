[color=orange]Jakku was a remote desert planet located in the Jakku system, within the Western Reaches of the galaxy&#39;s Inner Rim. Though considered by many within the galaxy to be distant and relatively worthless, Jakku was the site of important events that would shape galactic history.

In 5 ABY, Jakku was the site of the pivotal Battle of Jakku, which ended the Galactic Civil War in favor of the New Republic.

A generation later, the planet was the home of the scavenger Rey, who became caught up in the events of the cold war after helping the former First Order stormtrooper Finn and the astromech droid BB-8 escape offworld with a map leading to the missing Jedi Luke Skywalker.[/color]
