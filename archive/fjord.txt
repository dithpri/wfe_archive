Region of the North.

Conifer forests topped with snow; a midnight sun offset by polar nights; herds of reindeer beneath the northern lights.

White whales in fugitive retreat; arctic fleets locked in ice; fur-laden horsemen braced against northern winds.

Christmas observed with mead and candlelight; gnomes skulking round the larder; witches atop mountains performing masses

And fjords.
