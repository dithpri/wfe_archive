[color=#33A1C9]Conifer forests crowned with frost; a stubborn midnight sun stands watch; glacial lakes reflecting northern lights.

Longships launched from Baltic harbors; herds of reindeer driven through the taiga; icebound boats repose in hibernation.

Christmastide with mead and candle; White Nights afire with Black Masses; Walpurgis dancing upon the balding mountains.

And fjords.

Welcome to the North. Welcome to Fjord.[/color]
