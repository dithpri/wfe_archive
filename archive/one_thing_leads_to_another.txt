The impression that you sell
Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see comes from living close to your fears
If this is up then I&#39;m up but you&#39;re running out of sight
You&#39;ve seen your name on the walls
And when one little bump leads to shock miss a beat
You run for cover in this heat, why don&#39;t they
Do what they say, say what they mean
One thing leads to another
You told me something wrong, I know I listen too long but then
One thing leads to another, yeah, yeah, yeah
