Quote of the Day: &quot;Hehe. Guess who&#39;s back?&quot;

Announcements: Happy Summer Vacation Gents. Also our glorious leader has returned. Yay!!! We will maintain close relations with Gilgamesh in the near future as a result of his absence. Raiding is back. In other news 6 days until council elections, it will probably be smaller than usual but is still important. To close things off I should mention that we no longer have a Discord server, it was never really used and our RMB is very active so we should be okay, as a partial result the welcome telegram has been edited.
