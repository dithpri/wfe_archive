Announcements: Z-Day is here! Please get online and help battle zombies. Telegram [nation]The Kind-of-United States[/nation] with any questions. We are NOT, I repeat, NOT accepting zombies currently. If you want to accept zombies, move to another region that is doing that. If you want to contest this ruling, again, telegram [nation]The Kind-of-United States[/nation].

Please try your hardest to get on our new Discord! (Link below). All will be explained in time. For now, trust me.
