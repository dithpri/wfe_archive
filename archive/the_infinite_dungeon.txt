Quote of the day: &quot;The question isn&#39;t who&#39;s going to let me, it&#39;s who&#39;s going to stop me?&quot;

Announcements: After we destroyed the original Nations of Dumbarton, [region]The Neo Nations of Dumbarton[/region] was founded in its place. All members of such are considered enemies, and we shall be dealing with them shortly. [nation]Augustis[/nation] and [nation]Connorland[/nation] are enemies of this region and shall not be admitted. Regarding Discord: Bootcamp is up and a new tactical game has been implemented with the theme of swords and sorcery (by popular demand) so go check that out. Last, but certainly not least, everyone currently in here is going to receive High Power status as we are going to be a public region shortly.
