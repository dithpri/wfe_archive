Announcements: Happy Summer Vacation Gents. Also our glorious leader has returned. Yay!!! In other news 5 days until council elections, it will probably be smaller than usual but is still important if it occurs. To close things off I should mention that we no longer have a Discord server, it was never really used and our RMB is very active so we should be okay, as a partial result the welcome telegram has been edited.
