Announcements: 3 Days until Council Elections. Let the campaigns begin! If you would like the ability to post a dispatch with your campaign vote on the current poll, the deadline is the 24th and election will be on the 25th. Remember candidates can vote for other candidates, but not themselves. There will be 4 open spots on the council. May I bid you a good election.
