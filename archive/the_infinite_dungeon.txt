Quote of the day: &quot;Stand tall, for the fight has ended and we are the victors&quot;

Announcements: This week has been very crazy. Our Discord was almost raided, there is apparently a Neo Nations of DMS after we destroyed the original Nations of DMS, Sid was a horrible person and got kicked/banned from Discord and our region. Regarding Discord: Bootcamp is up and a new tactical game has been implemented with the theme of swords and sorcery (by popular demand) so go check that out. Last, but certainly not least, everyone currently in here is going to receive High Power status as we are going to be a public region shortly.
