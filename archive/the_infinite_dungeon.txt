Quote of the day: &quot;I, Acerak the Eternal, beckon you to your doom. Come foolish ones, plunder my treasures, if you dare! Others have tried, all have failed! From your skin tapestries shall be woven, and your bones shall carpet my tomb.Only I know the secret to true immortality! MWAHAHAH!&quot;
