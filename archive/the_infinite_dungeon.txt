Quote of the Day: &quot;First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then shalt thou count too three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, exepting that thou proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, shall be reached, thou lobbest thou thy Holy Hand grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.&quot;
