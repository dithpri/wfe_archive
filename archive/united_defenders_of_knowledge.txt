The United Defenders of Knowledge is an collection of states who agree to defend the human knowledge collected over several thousands of years, which we call science. Part of the philosophy of United Defenders of Knowledge is to enshure that the public is shown the knowledge we have about our world, as well as why and how we know it. 
Until scientists learns to alter our DNA to program this knowledge into new individuals of our species, the only way to pass this information on to the next generation, is with a school-system. A state within United Defenders of Knowledge is therefor obligated to offer a school-system within a sorten standard.
