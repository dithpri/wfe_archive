The LFN meets monthly at either Cotopia, Harford or the Republic of Equals to discuss how to create true freedom amongst their nations, and others around the world. It has no military power, but it is extremely robust, and all other regions are jealous of how well they have managed their society. A nation can only be truly free to join the LFN as a permanent member.

Long Live the LFN
