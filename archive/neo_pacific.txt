We separated from our previous identities and regencies to form a new Confederacy. A Confederacy that can share any ideology whether it be Capitalist or socialist or even fascist as long as they do not share the false song of globalism and are aiming for a world free of undesirables. We aim to open a new theory, a theory that undesirables deserve nothing less then the Grass-Camps.
