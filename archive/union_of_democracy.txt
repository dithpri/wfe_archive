This region was created to serve human rights and civil liberties.
Every nation that wants to protect these benevolent goods is welcome in this region.

But there are some preconditions for the integration of a nation in this region.
1. The nation must have a democracy.
2. Civil rights and political freedom must be at least &quot;Some&quot;.
3. Each nation must accept the regulations of the region.

I hope that peace and prosperity will prevail in our region.
