Relatively isolated home to many islands, most uninhabited or inhabited by isolated tribes and old ruins. It has only one official nation, Isla del Triunfio, founded by Spanish settler Incognito Elsacion in 1865. The many islands, big and small bathe in lush vegatiation, blue waters and the bright hot sun.
