Sturmia used to be a small rural town near the Swiss border, surrounded by forest and home to a recently deceased Queen Therese II. However, after over two decades of capitalist oppression by Katrina Stormia, it is part of the E.U. due to the region&#39;s firm commitment to promoting a better future on the European continent. It is now a signatory region under the Treaty of the Pan-European Alliance Nuremberg Union.
