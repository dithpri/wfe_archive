Sturmia used to be a small rural town near the Swiss border, surrounded by forest and home to deceased Queen Therese II. However, after over two decades of capitalist oppression by Katrina Stormia, it is part of the E.U. due to the region&#39;s firm commitment to promoting a better future on the European continent. It is now a signatory region under the Treaty of the Pan-European Alliance Nuremberg Union.
