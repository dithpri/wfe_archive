[b]The GU is an alliance-region between Giskola and other nations. The benefit from this region is that national security is much the same, because nations that join the GU are close to each other. 

All nations in the GU have to maintain strong positive tie with Giskola and other countries in the GU. The GU Region Is mainly progressive, although we CERTAINLY welcome Independents.
