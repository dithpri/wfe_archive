Hello, I would like to create a peaceful social region with no intense arguments like I am used to. There is only two rules, no fighting and please be kind. I will not be enforcing these, but I would sincerely appreciate it if you follow them. And fun fact, Cheya Venus means grace and beauty. I also think it sounds nice. I do not plan on participating in N-Day, I found it very stressful when I tried it on one of my other accounts. Bye!
