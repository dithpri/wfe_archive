[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] took to the skies for a quick flight to scout the best areas to watch the first [color=orange]sunrise[/color] of the new year! 
We found this region to be perfect, and left our mark here for future reference. 
If you would like to watch the dawn of the new year with us, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]Come Join Us![/url]
