A small volcanic chain formed in a somewhat quiet, tropical ocean, with mild temperatures and bitter winters. Forty-seven, different sized islands are in this chain, ranging from atolls to continental sized super-masses. The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Yytuskia landed upon the second largest island in the centre, called Terarria Draconis, and have expanded its borders.
