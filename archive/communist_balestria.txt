*Welcome to Communist Balestria! Enjoy!

*If you are a member of the World Assembly, that you are not allowed to be endorsed or endorse unless directed by regional admin. This may seem harsh, but it is necessary for safety. If someone endorses you, don&#39;t panic, we won&#39;t eject you, just either resign or send the endorser a telegram to get them to unendorse you.
