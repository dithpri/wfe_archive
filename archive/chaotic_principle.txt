Are you sick of rude admins? Too powerful delegates? Power-hungry egoistic admins? Well fear not because this region will have none of that [hopefully]...We are an region that loves math, science and chemistry like all the so called &quot;nerdy&quot; stuff. We are mostly atheist or agnostic but religious people are welcome! We do not condone any harassment or hate speech. We believe everyone should be treated the same because in the end we are all just a tiny speck of dirt compared to the rest of the universe. We aren&#39;t significant. Politics are also not welcome since they ruin the mood! We may be irrationally chaotic but we think rational and understand if someone makes mistakes. Also we dont like rude people so if you are mean or rude get out!
