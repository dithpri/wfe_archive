The [url=http://www.wftucentral.org/?language=en][color=800000]World Federation of Trade Unions[/color][/url] is smaller than the [url=http://www.ituc-csi.org/][color=blue]International Trade Union Confederation[/color][/url] and was heavily Soviet-influenced during much of its existence. Nevertheless, today it boasts 78 million members from 105 countries in 210 sub-unions and enjoys consultative status with several UN bodies.

For a worker-friendly world!
