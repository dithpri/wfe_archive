When every corner of the globe is mapped, it seems that the boundaries of exploration have expanded beyond our local galactic vicinity. However, things aren&#39;t always as they seem. The Shadow Nations exist in the same physical location as Earth, yet also are located on a separate plane of existence - however, these worlds do sometimes interact. For millennia, people have crossed between the two, yet the worlds remain frustratingly separate.

Shadow Nations are those that know that they exist somehow in the story of our world, yet fail to reconcile that rich and well thought-out reality with historical fact. If this describes your nation, leader, then find your truth and take your seat in the halls of the Shadow Nation Assembly.
