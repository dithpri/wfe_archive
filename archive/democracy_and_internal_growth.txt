Our  foreign  policy  posision is  neutrality  in  international  relations    which  means  that   we   shall  not  take  part  in  any  war   unless  we  are  under  attack   and  as  such  we  ask  that  other  regions  respect  our  neutrality and  that   agressive  nations  exlude   us  from  their  plans ,we  might  be  neutral  but  we have  military  strength  which  we  will  use  if  we  are  threatened.  If  a  nation  seeks  to  join  our  region  it  must   respect  as  well  as  abide  by   our  neutral   foreign  policy   especially  concerning  war  .Despite  our  neutral  position  the  region of  Democracy  and  internal  growth  will  always  be  in  favour  of humanitarian  causes  .
