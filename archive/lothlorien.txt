Sit on a flett.
Walk beneath the mallorn trees.
See elanor and niphredil blossom.

Lothl&oacute;rien is a casual region for people who like Tolkien&#39;s stories.

You can vote in our Tolkien polls, regardless which region your nation is in. If you are in a region with an embassy to Lothl&oacute;rien, you can participate in the RMB conversation. Telegram the founder, if you wish to join [nation]Turkdulapitou[/nation], [nation]Guardian Paladin[/nation] and [nation]Lady Galadriel[/nation] in making fandom polls here. If you wish to build a new embassy with this region, would you please telegram the founder Lady Galadriel first.
