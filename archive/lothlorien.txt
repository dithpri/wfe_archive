Lothl&oacute;rien is a casual region for people who like Tolkien&#39;s stories.

You can vote in our Tolkien polls regardless which region your nation is in. If you are in a region with an embassy to Lothl&oacute;rien, you can participate in the RMB conversation. Telegram the founder if you wish to join Turkdulapitou and Lady Galadriel in making fandom polls here. If you wish to build a new embassy with this region, would you please telegram the founder Lady Galadriel first. Thank you.
