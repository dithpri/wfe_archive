Terre de Gauchiste (literally, Land of Leftists) is a peaceful and secluded land just south of the tropics. It is far off from any other regions of the world, and the region&amp;#39;s nations like it as such. Despite its separation from the rest of the world, the region is highly varied in characteristic, full of bustling cities and popular beaches as well as quiet, sprawling hills and serene shores.
