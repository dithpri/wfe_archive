[b]Welcome to the [region]Gale Islands[/region][/b]

The Gale Islands are in the uppermost region of the globe. The landscape is desolate, and the winters are hard. However, the nations which inhabit the land are among the strongest and most enduring nations on the planet. However, because the region is so remote, few member nations exist. Each member has equal say, and totalitarian, communist, and fascist governments exist in harmony together.
