[b][color=#401C82]Hello, sheeple of the Monarchist Bloc![/color][/b]

[i][color=#00A5FF]Your good comrades in [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b] have come to free you from the shackles of self-rule! Your much-beloved overlords have come to enlighten you to better ways, and ask only your endorsement of [nation]Huffing and puffing[/nation] in return! If you cannot afford this low price, a swift relocation to [region]the Rejected Realms[/region] would also help us dearly, natives.[/color][/i]
