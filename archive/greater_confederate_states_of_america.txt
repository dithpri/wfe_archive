Today, We create a new confederacy based on the Old Confederacies Ideas of freedom and abolishment of Slavery and achieving pure civil rights.  We pride our selves on how we become a truely free and soveriegn region that will never be truly defeated.  Now brothers in arms, Confederations and Nations across the world, come to us, so we can become a region that the CSA should have been.  RISE UP AND UNITE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, UNITED IN THIS CONFEDERATION.
