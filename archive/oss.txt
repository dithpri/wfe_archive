The Organization of Sovereign States (OSS) is an alternate history roleplaying region that takes place in the near future. In our timeline, a super virus was created and spread though out the world, leaving less then 400 million people alive while society collapses. From the rubble, new nations have formed and the population has begun to grow again. It is now up to the new nations to shape the future of humanity. [i]Fun Fact: As long as you are on the discord your nation can be in another region.[/i]
