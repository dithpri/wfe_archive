A Region made specifically for monarchies, constitutional monarchies, kingdoms, queendoms and/or dictatorships. All types of nations are welcome though. Our Region is going to have a newspaper, active community, and possibly an rp. We do allow puppet regions, but you have to announce your puppet&#39;s entrance, or it will be removed. The &#39;election&#39; for certain spots in the region/reddit will occur every other month (starting in June), and they will take place on the official reddit along with the newspaper, and other things. Requests can be made on the Regional Chat, or on our Reddit, which will be made sometime in May.
