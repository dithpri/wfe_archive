[i][b]Founded on April 26, 2018, we are a nationalistic and conservative region which stands for the values of self-preservation, freedom of speech, and national sovereignty, we are a region for those nations who are looking for a home where they fit in, a home where they can be free to be themselves, without being suppressed and targeted by mobs or the government itself.
