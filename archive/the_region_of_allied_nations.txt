[b]Welcome to the Region of Allied Nations![/b]

[i][b]Founded on April 26, 2018, we are a nationalistic and conservative region which stands for the values of self-preservation, freedom of speech, and national sovereignty, we are a region for those nations who are looking for a home where they fit in, a home where they can be free to be themselves, without being suppressed and targeted by mobs or the government itself.

[i][b]Today we mourn the loss of Montange-Terreste. He was a hero, a patriot, a beacon of hope for the region. He may have been deleted from the game, but not from our heads. We will continue to mention him and honor him and show our outrage over this. And nothing will remove his memory, nothing![/b][/i]
