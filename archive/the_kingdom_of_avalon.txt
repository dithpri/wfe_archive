Legends tell of Avalon, the Isle of Mists. Tales are told of Avalon, Isle of the Wise. Stories speak of Avalon, Kingdom of Magic.

Just as storied are those who keep her, and of those who keep true to the old ways. 

But as old legends fade, new stories must be told... come, a world of legends awaits.
