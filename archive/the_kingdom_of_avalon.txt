The Kingdom of Avalon; a land shrouded by the mists of magic and legend. 

Sometimes it is known as the Isle of the Wise; other times it is called the Isle of the Blessed. 
It has been called the Isle of Fruit and the Isle of Mists. 

It is a land of enchantment and adventure; the home of witches and druids, priests and knights, kings and those who would dethrone them.

And now those mists are parting, giving way so that you may enter and find your home among the ancient Oaks and Rowans.
