[color=cyan]Welcome to The Congo Region, a RP community that takes place in both [/color][color=darkyellow]The Republic Of The Congo[/color][color=cyan], and The Democratic Republic Of The Congo! We strive to make a new RP community built off the principals of democracy and socialism![/color]

[color=darkred]Our weekly token collection works like this: we put a poll up saying if you want to abstain from he weekly or take part in it. Tokens can then be traded in for anything: RP trade, stamp trade, and other stuff! 15 tokens a week sounds nice![/color]

[color=sapphire]RP is allowed on the RMB board, and plans to thrive there! Join in, have fun, and PLAY safe![/color]
