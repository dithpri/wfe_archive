The Patriotic Alliance of Practical Intellectuals (PAPI), is a group of like-minded countries with similar goals, interests, principles, ideals, and ways of life. 

Hailing from the region of No Clue Alliance for Idiots (NCAI) this splinter group broke off due to the group&#39;s poor leadership, and inclusion of members that brought the rest down. 

Everyone has the right to join PAPI, but their statistics should closely add up to current members in order to ensure the success of the group and further this success in the future.
