[i]Lacerta is one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. Its name is Latin for lizard. A small, faint constellation, it was defined in 1687 by the astronomer Johannes Hevelius. Its brightest stars form a &quot;W&quot; shape similar to that of Cassiopeia, and it is thus sometimes referred to as &#39;Little Cassiopeia&#39;. It is located between Cygnus, Cassiopeia and Andromeda on the northern celestial sphere. The northern part lies on the Milky Way.[/i][b]Founded by the andarian starfleet on: 04/05/2025.[/b]
