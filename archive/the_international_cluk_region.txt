Or CLUK as most call it, was a clan formed many years ago. It all started when Nick Zealand and North Kyrea were creating a team called by the name of CLUK. They were starting to look through all unique emblems and stumbled upon the chicken emblem. They had used this chicken emblem added with a gear background for their flag. After a while they had soon convinced Mundeo to join the team, but many others weren&amp;#39;t so sure. CLUK has been an alliance for awhile and has been growing only stronger, and eventually had settled into a region known as the CLUK region.
