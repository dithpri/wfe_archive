[b]Introduction[/b]
Welcome to the Iron Bijes. We were forged during the Revolutionary War in order to sustain peace with force. The only way we thrive is by wars. We are all about wars. Without wars, we will never thrive. War empowers us. War fuels us.  War grows us to be the men of the future. 

[b]History[/b]
The Iron Bijes was formed by a group of mercenaries after they broke off George Washington&amp;#39;s army to &amp;quot;fight their own wars&amp;quot;. In 1951, in the middle of the Cold War, the Iron Bijes suffered attacks from multiple countries who wished to take the Iron Bijes&amp;#39; arms supply, causing Iron Bijes to break off into multiple parts to protect their supply. However, in 1998, Iron Bijes reunited again.
