We&#39;re glad you&#39;re here, we have many things you can do here, like:

[b][i]Roleplay[/i][/b]

You can create a roleplay, or join one, and create your own senarios! You can RP in the RMB or our Discord Server&#39;s chat channels using the format given in the Roleplay Policy in the Constitution

[b][i]Political Parties[/i][/b]

Unlike other regions, we have Political Parties! There are currently 3 electoral parties in Agos that you can join: Larshino Monarchists of Agos, Caepo Communist Party of Kaisla, and the Socialists of Agos. If you want more information, go to the Parties dispatch, which can be accessed in the Constitution dispatch. You also can create your own Political Party, but make sure to read the Party Policy in our constitution first!
