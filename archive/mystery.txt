Imagine a place you can always escape to; an island off the coast of nowhere.  A new destination of my own creation, just waiting till you choose to come here. This is a place where your mind can escape all the problems today and go far, far away; this is a time with no history. Welcome to Mystery! But beware, this is the place beyond the boundaries on maps where dragons abounded. The only rule for this region is that good old Canadian standard: you stay out of my face, and I&#39;ll stay out of yours.
