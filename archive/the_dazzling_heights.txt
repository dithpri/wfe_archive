As of this moment, Syntadel will no longer take part in the romanticized affairs of the Independent Systems. Henceforth it will lead a solitary rule and achieve a power far greater than an ordinary nation. Nations wishing to do the same may also join at their own discretion. Only the powerful can reach The Dazzling  Heights. 

Headquarters is located in two identical buildings that are each One Thousand stories. The Dark Steel Tower is in charge of Military Defense. The Burnished Gold Tower is the Center of Commerce, Trade and Luxury.  

Positions are available to those wishing to join. Our goal: Do everything possible to gain power.
