Just a dump for my main nation&#146;s colonies.
Main nation is Greater Westfalen

[nation]Ostindia[/nation]: silly corporate shadow state where human beings are recyclable (don&#146;t ask for context.)

[nation]Neues Koln[/nation]: Post-communist wasteland recovering from the Krenzist Era under incompetent governance.

[nation]Ost-Wallonien[/nation]: protectorate of Westphalia. Based on East Wallonia, pretty chill country overall.

[nation]Crayolaphalia[/nation]: crayon-eating, glue sniffing, 796th dimensional omniversal superstate that can and will show you how to break the law of conservation of mass.

[nation]Makanaria[/nation]: Siberian warlord state. Sits in [region]Balder[/region] with [nation]Greater Westfalen[/nation]. Only being mentioned because why not.
