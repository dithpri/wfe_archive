The Lost Nations (TLN) used to be rouges who didn&#39;t fit in. These nations gathered together to make TLN. After lots of fighting, they came to a vote. General Horsk &quot;Bones&quot; of The Deadifying was anointed as Supreme Dictator. The other nations selected a leader from their nation to represent them in the Court of Rules. All dictators rule their own nations, but they all bow to the Supreme Dictator. Wars were fought under one rule. Fights were fought together. Everything is together under one rule.
