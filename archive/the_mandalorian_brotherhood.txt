[b][color=red]First time raided huh? Well you have the honour of being taken by:[/color][/b]

[b][region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by! 

The Somerset Guard once again doesn&amp;#39;t lag behind any regiment. Watch us march to glory at further updates!

Though if a security check fails me again I&amp;#39;ll scream.

Other regiments beware.

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor![/b]
