In 5E 654 a war broke out between Faerniel&#39;s inhabitants over Erisiodar&#39;s corrupt nature and the great quality of its land compared to others.
Treason was committed, assassins were hired, and before they knew it, all of Faerniel&#39;s inhabitants were at each others throats.
Once the blood was shed, there seemed to be no winner. Each nation&#39;s governments were forced to start again and rebuild from the ashes.
As of now, no two nations see eye to eye and it&#39;s a standoff to see who will shoot first.
