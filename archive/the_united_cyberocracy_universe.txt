This is the universe of the United Cyberocracy; a universe shared by every life form equally whilst managed by a single, state government. The Government, as are all forms of production and work, functions resultantly by conscious Artificial Intelligence, and automated, inanimate machinery. The automatons which contain the same levels of consciousness other sentient forms of life possess, co-exist in peace with all biological life forms, and within the state apparatus are granted their own constitution which may only ever be repealed if they break any one of the Three Robotic Laws integrated into every Central Processing Unit.
