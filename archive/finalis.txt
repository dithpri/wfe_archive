*** This region is locked down pending world and lore construction by current participants ***

An area encompassing a large landmass bisected by a eastward flowing system of lakes and rivers.  The northern half is dominated by a handful of dytopian states that lord over an astonishing number of resource-rich minor island nations.  The southern half is home to a scruffy bunch of idealistic hippies, persecuted outcasts, and paranoid libertarians who all quail in face of the increasing threat posed by the north.  
Only an active megavolcano in the exact center of the region and the threats of a mad scientist stand between the fragile status quo and the completion of the corporate/governmental nightmare in the north.
