The Challanist Party of Nationstates is a socialist party that advocates the likes of Challanism. Challanism is a socialist theory (made by me) that only a true revolution will arise once a revolution sees guerrilla warfare engaged in the construction of a socialist government. Guerrilla warfare is important to the Challanist Party because it shows how it&amp;#39;s citizens are desperate enough for a change to socialism that they will arm themselves against their nation and fight for true equality under the red banner.
