Welcome, everyone, to Commonshire. Commonshire is an RP region that incorporates both a fluid regional canon and creative nationbuilding. It has a rag-tag community of people who can speak their minds on an offsite forum (COMING SOON) however they wish and chat on the RMB. Commonshire is set in a post-apocalyptic Eastern Australia composed of city states.
