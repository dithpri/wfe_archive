The Union of Croxoconian Socialist Republics, also known as the UCSR, and informally known as the Croxoconian Union, is a supranational union of five Federal Socialist Republics. Owing to the substantial devolution of power to the constituent Republics of each Federal Socialist Republic, and the centralization of all remaining powers to the all-Union institutions of state, the different Federal Socialist Republics (Croxoco, Croxoca, Hunaf, Isafona and Joveo) exist only as statistical regions of the UCSR. Furthermore, owing to the high degree of centralization within the Communist Party of the Croxoconian Union (CPCU), which is the sole legal political party in the UCSR, the Croxoconian Union is de facto a unitary state.
