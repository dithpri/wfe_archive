Founded in the wake of vast civil unrest. The only truly democratic region in all of NationStates!

Elections are called [b]every two weeks[/b] without exception and is done so through a region wide poll. The WA delegate has equal power to the monarch [nation]Rhedia[/nation] and can force the monarch to abdicate if the public calls for it. This ensures that tyranny will never threaten our great region!

The region is ruled in a system with two main distinct parts: The two consuls, one elected and one permanent, the ministerial body who carry out the daily tasks of the region. There is also an independent judiciary and religious body.
