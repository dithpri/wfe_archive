Libertia is a region for democratic, free nations which aim to always continue improving. It is also a region for nations aiming to become more free or plan to become liberated (or just were liberated).

The Libertian Union (LU) is an intergovernmental organization which aims to integrate and unite the Libertian nations under a common currency, policies, and laws. The official currency of the LU is the Liba (SLU).

We encourage any and all nations dedicated to liberty or which aim to liberate their peoples to become a Libertian!
