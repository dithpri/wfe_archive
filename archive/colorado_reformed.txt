Colorado, a western U.S. state, is known for its geographic diversity, with snow-covered mountains, arid desert lands and river canyons. 
Opportunities for outdoor recreation include kayaking the Colorado River, hiking the nearly 500-mile Colorado Trail and skiing at resorts such as Vail and Aspen. 
Perched a mile above sea level, Denver, Colorado&#146;s capital and largest city, features a vibrant downtown area.
