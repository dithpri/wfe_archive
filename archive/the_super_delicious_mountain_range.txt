A great mountain range on a large island located in the exact middle of the Indian Ocean. Features fertile lands, unique wildlife, a temperate climate, and Wild Harrisons. Breakfast cereals and link sausages are mined from the islands many mountains. Cherry trees bloom multiple times per year - Japan is very jealous - and thousands go missing every year. Due to a magnetic phenomenon, meteor showers rain down at least once a month with our radiation projectors incinerating them before they can impact. This probably explains the cherry trees. Much of our power comes from geothermal. Aquamarine-infused magenta magic with a greenish-red tint supplies the rest as black magic is too weak.
