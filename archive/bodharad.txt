[color=red][u][b]A message from the WA Delegate...[/b][/u][/color]

After after being democratically elected leader for life, [nation=short]Benevolent Thomas[/nation] is now the psychot- I mean, Benevolent Ruler of the region.
[nation=short]Boltor[/nation]burgers along with [nation=short]Ranger[/nation] Dogs have been charred beyond repair, [nation=short]Eist[/nation] Cones and [nation=noname]Mechajinia[/nation][color=green]Mecha[/color] Shakes lie spilled on the concrete. [nation=short]Wordy[/nation]&amp;#39;s Awesome Bizarre Shoe Bazaar remains open, but only provides steel toe boots. The new [b][nation=short]Benevolent Thomas[/nation] Portraits[/b] are now being distributed.
[u][b]ALL HAIL [nation=noflag]Benevolent Thomas[/nation]![/b][/u]
