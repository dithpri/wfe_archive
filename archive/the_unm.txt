The UNM, or United Nations of Mars is an intergovernmental organization, sort of like NATO, which hopes to bring nations together.

This region was founded in the Martian State of Olympia, a state of Marcianus, which has the Nations&#39; capital, and is located on the Planet of Mars. Join our region in hopes of becoming a proud member of the Martian community, and become a proud friend of Mars, and become a Martian!
