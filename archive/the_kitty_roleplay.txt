Lol, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] really thought they could raid a sister region of [region]Carrot Patch Pete[/region]? Well, they can&#39;t. Pro tip for raiders: Don&#39;t try to invade defenders. I&#39;m leaving the birbs there just for fun. :3

[color=purple]This is a region for all the WARRIORS fans out there. Here we always address people by their warrior name. If you don&#39;t already have a warrior name we&#39;ll give you one. We just have one rule... ALWAYS FOLLOW THE WARRIOR CODE!!![/color]
