White nationalists sometimes complain that other races are allowed to have their nationalism, but not whites. Our answer: any nationalist groups, regardless of composition, cross the line when they promote hatred. If the people claiming to be white nationalists stopped promoting hatred and actually lived up to the snivelling excuse that they&amp;#39;re just looking out for bullied whites, maybe everyone wouldn&amp;#39;t have so much of a problem with &amp;quot;white pride&amp;quot; groups.
