[b]A Stronghold for Traditional Family Values in accordance with the Scriptures[/b][hr][b]Yes,[/b] the Bible does speak about homosexuality. 
1 Corinthians 6:9 uses two words in Greek:
[b]&amp;#956;&amp;#945;&amp;#955;&amp;#945;&amp;#954;&amp;#959;&amp;#8054;[/b] [i](Malakoi)[/i] and [b]&amp;#7936;&amp;#961;&amp;#963;&amp;#949;&amp;#957;&amp;#959;&amp;#954;&amp;#959;&amp;#8150;&amp;#964;&amp;#945;&amp;#953;[/b] [i](Arsenokoitai)[/i]. One word is the Greek word for effeminate, the other is a Greek compound word, derived from [b]&amp;#7940;&amp;#961;&amp;#963;&amp;#951;&amp;#957;[/b] (arsen, meaning &quot;male&quot;) and [b]&amp;#954;&amp;#959;&amp;#943;&amp;#964;&amp;#951;[/b] (koite, meaning &quot;bed&quot; or &quot;lying down&quot;), which means one who beds a male. The Bible says such people will not inherit the Kingdom of God. However in 1 Corinthians 6:11 we read [b]&quot;As such were some of you, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified...&quot;[/b][hr][b]Repent, and believe the Gospel, because Christ loves you.[/b]
