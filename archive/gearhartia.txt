A full parliamentary union with sovereignty over the national governments. The President is elected by a popular ranked-choice vote of the people of Gearhartia, with 5-year terms. A proportionally represented parliament, with 2-year terms, is elected to the Assembly of the Gearhartians, where the majority elects a Chairman of the Assembly, the head of government. The Chairman appoints all ministers, except for the Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Minister, which is chosen by the largest opposition party.

The Assembly has the power to make all laws, but they can be vetoed by the President, who also serves as the head of state.
