THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IS THE CREED ALL OF THIS REGION&amp;#39;S DECISIONS WILL BE BASED UPON: This region holds these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights &#151; That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
