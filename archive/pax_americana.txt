Welcome to Pax Americana, A newly found region with the founder being formerly from Europeia but started in the North Pacific.

We are in the process of starting a RP for nations who wish to have one and join it. You can find the beta map [url=https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1--b3bXhj-HsWSclzFkN2gmhFXh-mR115&amp;usp=sharing]here![/url]

Any Suggestions, Please Telegram NAFS!

For any further information on how to join the RP, please read the RP Rules, or contact an officer.

We also enforce a policy of openness and friendliness in the RMB. Our RMB rules are similar to Europeia&#39;s and The North Pacific&#39;s RMB rules. We recommend to all new RP-members to read the factbook carefully once written.
