We are a region made up of different states with different goals.  There is no forced adaptations.  Be yourself.  We are peaceful to each other and our people, not always to outsiders.  When you join, you have the freedom to run your state how ever you please.  We will vote on laws democratically and share power equally.  Join us!  Plus we aren&#39;t dicks so...yeah.
