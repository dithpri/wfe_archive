A new MT/soft PMT RP region with a focus on community over canon.

People interested in being part of our community, whether it is as RPers or not, are weclome to join us and introduce themselves on the RMB.

There are no activity or RP-skill requirements; we are an open RP region, and a social place for people who are interested in writing or reading RP, or just talking to people who do.
