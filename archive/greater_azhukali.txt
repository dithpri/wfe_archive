A new MT/soft PMT RP region with a focus on community over canon. 

People interested in being part of our community, whether it is as RPers or not, can get the password from any member of the region they happen to know, or else TG the founder. 

There are no activity or RP-skill requirements; we are an open RP region, and a social place for people who are interested in writing or reading RP, or just talking to people who do. Password is temporary.
