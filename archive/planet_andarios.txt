[b]We are the real deal! Yes...rejoice or grieve...Andarios is back...[/b]
[i]Nah! Just kidding, from now on, this will be the home base and the home planet for the Andarians (either be one or spiritually be akin to the andarian spirit).[/i] 
[i]Times were though and we did plenty of mistakes in the day, others were not mistakes and should be viewed as learning experiences. But, in the end, we still prevailed![/i] 
[b]Now to the good stuff:[/b] Welcome to this region! If you like, you can stay and hang out (in a sense)! 
Even, if the region, simply pretends to be akin to a memorial region, for all of us, and all the good times we spend playing in the world of NS, a few years ago!
