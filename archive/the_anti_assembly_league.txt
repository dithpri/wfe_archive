Tired of obeying the Assembly&amp;#39;s nonsensical orders? Sick of their demilitarization and destruction of non-democratic nations? This confederacy is a union of military forces, led by  Joint Strike Operations Command (JSOC), a council of the most powerful militaires. 
While the Terran Hegemony is the De Jure ruler, the reality is that all member states have an equal say in all international matters. 
That being said, each member has full control over his land(s), unless war breaks out in which case he&amp;#39;ll be obligated to give control of his armed forces to JSOC. 
JSOC Members:
Terran Hegemony
West Olwe
Trentica
Breezedawn

Foreign Ambassador: West Olwe
