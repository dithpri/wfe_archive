If you want to be in a free, safe zone, this confederacy is for you: a union of military forces, led by Joint Strike Operations Command, a council of the most powerful militaires. 
While the Terran Hegemony is the De Jure ruler, the reality is that all member states have an equal say in all international matters. 
That being said, each member has full control over his land(s), unless war breaks out in which case he&amp;#39;ll be obligated to give control of his armed forces to JSOC.
