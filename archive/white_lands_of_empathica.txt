If all the isms and doctrines of life were a gentle breeze instead of that usual judgmental freeze,
would we all be as easily shanghaied to their cause, as now we seem to object to every clause,
and would we have that unerring nerve to go after our deepest desires with a similar verve ~
Who would it serve?
