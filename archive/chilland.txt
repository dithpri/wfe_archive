In November of 2011 the evil region of [region]Chilland[/region] invaded [region]Benevolent Capitalism[/region]. But [region]Benevolent Capitalism[/region] was victorious and [region]Chilland[/region] was defeated. Our original founder, [b]Sarpyism[/b], was wrongly banned from Nationstates for posting on their Regional Message Board. Since then [region]Benevolent Capitalism[/region] has been refounded, but let it always be known that [b]Sarpyism[/b] is the true founder of [region]Benevolent Capitalism[/region]. Now [nation]Victory Over Chilland[/nation], a dependancy of [nation]Kapitalistiske[/nation] safeguards this region so that the war, our glorious victory, and [region]Benevolent Capitalism[/region]&amp;#39;s true founder will always be remembered.
