The Global Order of Lone Wolf States is a unstructured association of states that opt for a minimalist approach towards international affairs. The order supports anti-interventionism, anti-globalism, and free trade.  Denouncing the World Assembly, the order respects the absolute sovereignty of all nations throughout the world and does not enforce external legislation upon its member-nations; instead, the order exists solely to provide a forum for the free exchange of ideals and to bolster trade relations. Admission is open to all without restriction. There are no requirements for continued membership
