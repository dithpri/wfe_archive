The Global Order of Lone Wolf States is a loosely-structured association of states that opt for a relatively-isolationist approach towards international affairs. While member-states of the order ordinarily engage in international trade, they shy away from involvement in foreign military conflicts and almost never offer humanitarian aid. Denouncing the World Assembly, the order respects the absolute sovereignty of all nations throughout the world and does not enforce external legislation upon its member-nations; instead, the order exists solely to provide a forum for the free exchange of ideals and to bolster trade relations. Admission is open to all. There are no qualifications, membership fees, or requirements for continuing membership.
