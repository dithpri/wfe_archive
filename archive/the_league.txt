The Seven Kingdoms are divided into nine administrative regions, seven of which, The North, Iron Islands, the Vale, The Westerlands, The Reach, the Stormlands and Dorne, were independent kingdoms at the time of conquest. The Riverlands had been independent before, but had fallen to the Storm Kings and more recently to the ironborn. They regained independence after the local lords rebelled against Harren the Black and swore fealty to Aegon during the conquest. The area around King&amp;#39;s Landing, which had also been a battleground between several kingdoms, constituted the royal demesne and became known as the Crownlands. The island stronghold of Dragonstone, ancient seat of the Targaryens, was successively granted to heirs apparent to the throne.
