The Aurifian Peninsula is a large peninsula shaped much like the Korean Peninsula in Asia, but much longer and a bit less wide. The northern section of the peninsula is known for its lush forests and almost complete lack of fauna. The southern part of the peninsula is tropical, and what isn&amp;#39;t a beach is a jungle.
