A fascist group of nations based on the nations that existed in 1936 in the Balkans. I am also including some non-Balkans nations that were once in the Austrian Empire. (This is a second one since I messed up the first one. I ask that the moderators and/or admins delete the other unless some nation finds a use for it)

Contact me (Greater Romanaia) if you wish to receive the password to join the region so we avoid nations from unrealistic settings.

Bulgaria
