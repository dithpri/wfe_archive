The Outer Rim is the collection of systems far from the Galactic Core. These worlds are often ruled by individuals rather than any Empire or Republic. Criminals and scoundrels do the most work out here but so do Bounty Hunters. The Hutt Cartel and various other Criminal Factions are the closest to Leadership these worlds have. Credits (or scrap) are the most important thing in these lawless places. Tattooine, Nal Hutta, and Ryloth tend to be the most powerful Outer Rim worlds in terms of Credit-flow and so the Cartel runs their &amp;quot;Empire&amp;quot; from there.
