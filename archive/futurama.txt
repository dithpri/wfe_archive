[hr][i][color=darkblue]Listen [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WotuYSt-DbQ]here[/url], Missy. Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973, but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only thing that&amp;#39;s different is me; I&amp;#39;ve become bitter, and let&amp;#39;s face it, crazy over the years. And once I&amp;#39;m swept into office, I&amp;#39;ll sell our children&amp;#39;s organs to zoos for meat, and I&amp;#39;ll go into people&amp;#39;s houses at night and wreck up the place. Muahahaha![/color][/i]
