The Armistan Alliance is a coalition of states that have escaped the main destruction of their peoples, and have fled here. This region was founded by explorer and cartographer, Iwannaget Datbooty. Our capital city, a city set on the border of all states within this region, is called Datbootybegood. Our main export, artisan-sculpted booties is a favorite around the world. We also produce family-sized booties. The all-surrounding ocean, Datbootybedabooty, supplies a steady income of bootyfish, a delectable treat among other regions. In our beloved region, the majestic, rare, and indigenous hippollamapatomus bounces through our many open fields.
