Welcome to the homepage for the Armistan Alliance! We are accepting of all nations, as demonstrated by our choice in members. There are rules to being in this region though. 
1) You must be courteous to other member nations. The only instance where minor insults or rudeness is accepted is during a WA Delegate campaign.
2) You must be supportive of our voting system. If you have a problem or suggestion, bring it up with the founder or current delegate.
3) You must be in the WA. Our entire system depends on electing using WA endorsements.
