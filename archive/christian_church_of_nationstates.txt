[b]This region is newly founded and remains a work-in-progress.[/b]

Once initial work has been completed, we hope to be an online haven for Christians (and those who are curious about Christianity) to be in community and grow in their faith. We also hope to share our faith with others (when others are willing to receive it) and represent Christian interests in the World Assembly.

Please check back later once we&#39;ve set ourselves up properly, and have a lovely day!
