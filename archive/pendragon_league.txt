I.Thou shalt respect all weaknesses, and shalt constitute thyself the defender of them.
II.Thou shalt love the country in the which thou wast born.
III.Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy.
IV.Thou shalt make war against the Infidel without cessation, and without mercy.
V.Thou shalt perform scrupulously thy feudal duties, if they be not contrary to the laws of God.
VI.Thou shalt never lie, and shall remain faithful to thy pledged word.
VII.Thou shalt be generous, and give largess to everyone.
VIII.Thou shalt be everywhere and always the champion of the Right and the Good against Injustice and Evil.
