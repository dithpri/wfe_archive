HYDRA Command has decided to occupy [region]Dank Memes[/region] after it was posted publicly on the [region]Dank Memes[/region]&#39; WFE that the region was evacuating and that it would soon refound. The result of this transparency was a takeover by HYDRA Command and an upcoming refound of the region, conducted by them. If they refounded the region, however, the region would effectively die away as a trophy region.
