We are Forerunners... Guardians of all that exists. Where there is life... The wisdom of our countless generations... Has saturated the soil. Our strength is a luminous sun; towards which all intelligence blossoms. And the impervious shelter, beneath which it has prospered. I stand before you. Accused of the sin... Of ensuring Forerunner ascendancy. The Mantle of Responsibility... For all things... Belongs to Forerunners alone. Think of my acts as you will. But do not doubt the reality. The reclamation... has already begun.
