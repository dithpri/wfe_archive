[color=#0064ff][b]Raposa[/b] is a terrestrial planet that orbits the star Alpha Vulpeculae. Its name originates from the Portuguese word for &quot;fox&quot;, as Raposa was a Portuguese space colony until 3000. Lifeforms on Raposa are identical to Earth life, except there are no humans living on this planet today. Foxes are the most common sapient animal species on Raposa. Over 500 years, they have independently developed FTL and other technologies.[/color]

All of Raposa belongs to a single nation: the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=alpha_vulpeculae]Vulpeculan Republic[/url].

[b]We will NOT share this planet with other nations.[/b] We are open to embassies, though.
