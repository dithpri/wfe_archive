The borderzone between [region]The Free Pacific[/region] and [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=fort_courage]Fort Crappage[/url].
The Free Pacific wins because Fort Crappage were cowards and did not come to war and just locked their selves up in a box of shame (their password protected &amp;quot;region&amp;quot;).
So The Free Pacific no longer recognizes Fort Crappage as a region.
