Ainulindal&euml; (Quenya: [&amp;#716;ai&amp;#815;nu&amp;#712;lindal&amp;#603; ]; &quot;Music of the Ainur&quot;) is the creation account in the J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s legendarium.

In many ways central to Tolkien&#39;s &quot;sub creative&quot; cosmology, the Ainulindal&euml; gives an account of the Ainur, a class of angelic beings who perform a great music prefiguring the creation of the material universe (E&auml;). Il&uacute;vatar introduces the theme of the sentient races of Elves and Men, not anticipated by the Ainur, and gives physical being to the prefigured universe. Some of the Ainur decide to enter the physical world to prepare for their arrival, becoming the Valar and Maiar.
