[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr][/color]

[color=#ED4719]The owner of this region passed away many years ago, and this region was subsequently entrusted to the state. Despite the truth that J o J was in fact a deep infiltrator of the fascist movement, this region was allowed to remain with the appropriate flag flying on the flagpole until their population had left the game and for 5 years, out of respect for the deceased. [i]Remember, this is still just a game.[/i][hr]This region is now a controlled territory of the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region] like all the others as of 2/13/26.[hr][/color]
