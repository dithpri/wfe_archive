[color=#000080][b]The newly established Russian territory is going to battle to safeguard our fundamental humanistic principles. We shall cherish the Russian Federation&#39;s President and embrace the nation we call home. We ask God to acknowledge the Russian warriors who battle for peace and equitable treatment. [/color][/b]
[color=#FF0000][b] We encourage every individual who wishes to make the trek to the region and fight to preserve our Motherland and our rights as citizens. We shall establish independence, and the Russian Republic will be in power with the help of our forces. We will not tolerate Nazis, extremists, fascists, and other forms of hatred aimed toward our neighbors. We are going to eradicate the growing problem of Russian-phobia triggered by Western governments. [/color][/b]
