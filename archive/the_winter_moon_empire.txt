Brief Summary - We are an Imperial Democracy. We do not choose a side between raiders and defenders because we do both! Together we work as a community to face the odds and prosper. Those who fight us learn we don&#39;t quit fighting. As we always return. Always fight. Until our inevitable victory is assured. For the glory of the Empire!
