Long live the survivors which ban together to make this new empire! Long live the Empire of The Winter Moon!

The Land of the Rising Sun was merely dystroied over one of the worst inactive summers yet. We have also saw our allies, struggling to rebuild as well. So together The Land of the Rising Sun and its invited allies will rebuild and come together under and banner, anew united empire. All are welcome to join and lets rebuild to our former glory!!!!!
