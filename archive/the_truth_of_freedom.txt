How do you control your thoughts and be the master of your mind?
&quot;
Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.

The mind of sinful man [5] is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace;
&quot;
Romans 8:5&#150;6 NIV
