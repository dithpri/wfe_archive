Niaf is a Roleplaying region set in the 1850s-1950s period! All RP will be done on the Niaf offical map. If you want to claim land, send a telegram to [nation]Freedomslandia[/nation] telling him what lands you want, or drawing them on a map. Your claim will be accepted in maximum one day. There&#39;s no clear size limitations, but make sure that your claim is decently sized!
Have fun!
