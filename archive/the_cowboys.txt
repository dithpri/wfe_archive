[b]A Community of Mercenary Raiders /// Dedicated To Helping You Solve Your &#39;Problems&#39; /// Alternative Right[/b]

[i]&quot;Up From The Ashes Rose A Ruthless Outlaw Mercenary Gang, Known Only As &#39;The Cowboys&#39;. They Seek Nothing But Destruction, And Their Only Goal Is To Tear Down Productivity. They Are Feared Throughout Their World. They Pillage, Destroy, And Incinerate Everything They Leave Behind. Only The Most Wayward Of Nations Join Their Ranks, As Only A Madman Conceived In Banditry Would Do So. They Are Hated And Reviled By All Nations That Are Good And Pure, And Are Praised By All That Are Anarchic.&quot;[/i]
