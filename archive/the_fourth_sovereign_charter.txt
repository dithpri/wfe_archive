Sovereign Charter has an active Role-playing and Casual community where you can get involved as little or as much as you like. Originally founded on the idea that each Nation is its own Sovereign, the region is an attempt at True Democracy where nations ultimately have the final say.  Nations are invited to submit news, claim territory, create or participate in role-plays or just chat and socialize with the community.[/b]
