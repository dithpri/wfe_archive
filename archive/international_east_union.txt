On [b]January 29, 2014[/b] the region was tragically destroyed by our ex-founder&amp;#39;s, [nation]allied states of america[/nation],  brother. For the residence of the IEU this was a sad day, but now we remember that day not as the day we fell, but as the day we stood up again. Our motto is [b][i]&amp;quot;Falling down isn&amp;#39;t defeat. Defeat is when you refuse to get up,&amp;quot;[/i][/b] because of our history. If another raid does happen, or the region is destroyed, all members are obligated to regroup at [region]The World of Gomlis[/region].[/color]
