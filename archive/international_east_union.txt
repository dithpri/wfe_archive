Government activity will resume once the amount of nations are deemed sufficient. In addition, the Delegate will not have access to Regional Control until the region&amp;#39;s populace resolve for this to be reversed. The restriction has been put in place to ensure that such a catastrophe never occurs again. If another raid does happen, all members are obligated to regroup at &amp;quot;The World of Gomlis&amp;quot;
