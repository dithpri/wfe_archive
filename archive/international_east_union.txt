[color=hotpink]Happy Valentine&amp;#39;s Day![/color]

[color=green]Welcome to the International East Union! Our Green and Pleasant Region extends a warm welcome to those who wish to join.[/color]

[color=blue]On January 29, 2014 the region was tragically destroyed by a still unknown cause. For the residence of the IEU this was a sad day, but now we remember that day not as the day we fell, but as the day we stood up again.
If another raid does happen, or the region is destroyed, all members are obligated to regroup at [region]The World of Gomlis[/region][/color]
