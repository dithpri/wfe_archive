Welcome to The Royal Conservative Empire

DEFCON 5
Safe

Greetings everyone, our forces have begun to return from UACN, peace, order, and freedom have been restored in the UACN. We destroyed any remnants of the raiders that invaded. The UACN has decided to join us, and became a part of our empire unanimously. They are our brothers, and they have officially become a province of the empire. 

We are stronger, more united than ever, and I thank you all for your dedication to freedom and justice. The council will return to session, and continue to the work of the people.
