Once a tropical paradise full of natives and tourists alike, recent storms have ravaged our home. However the people who call the South Pacific home are a resilient people. Even as we speak they are clearing the debris, repairing the damage and restoring normalcy to their island home. With rum in their hands and a song in their hearts we march on. Like the mighty palm, the storm may bend us, but we never break!
