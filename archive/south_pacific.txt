[color=blue]Welcome to [b][region]South Pacific[/region][/b]!

[b]We ask that all newcomers endorse our sitting delegate, [nation]The Lepearchauns[/nation][/color][/b]
[color=red][b]We are NOT a feeder region! As such, spammers will be banned on sight[/b]! Pirates and raiders are asked to find other shores.[/color]

A tropical paradise, with both natives and tourists alike scattered among the multitude of islands. The sun shines down on the calm blue waters of our peaceful region, but don&amp;#39;t be fooled. The people who call South Pacific home have weathered the wrath of great storms. But strong and resilient, South Pacific always recovers. Like the palm tree we bend, but never break.
