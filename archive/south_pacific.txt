[color=green][b]A tropical paradise full of natives and tourists alike, a storm has ravaged our home. The people who call the South Pacific home are a resilient people, and the island has recovered. With tropical drinks in their hands and a song in their hearts we march on. Like the mighty palm, the storm may bend us, but we never break![/b][/color]
