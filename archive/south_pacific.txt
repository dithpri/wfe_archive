[color=green][b]Welcome to South Pacific![/b][/color]

[b][color=blue]In light of recent events, all WA nations are required to endorse our newly elected delegate, [nation]Lingang[/nation][/color][/b]

[b][color=red]We are NOT a feeder region! As such, spammers will be banned on sight! Pirates are asked to find other shores, otherwise you will be banned on sight.[/color]

A tropical paradise, the sun shines down on the calm blue waters of our peaceful region, but don&#39;t be fooled. The people who call South Pacific home have weathered the wrath of great storms. Strong and resilient, South Pacific always recovers. 

Like the palm tree we bend, but never break.
