[color=darkred]Welcome to South Pacific!
Tonight, these usually tranquil waters run red with the blood of those unfortunate enough to encounter the evil monsters lurking in the dark rainforests.
For between those lush trees stalks [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=densaner]a creature[/url] so hideous, so terrifying, that none dare speak its name.
Any who cross its path are savagely attacked, and become like it. I urge you all: avoid this demon at all costs!
Yet there are those brave enough to confront this menace. The [nation]Panther[/nation]s race with all swiftness through the canopy, seeking out those unfortunate victims,
bringing them cures mixed in the laboratories of the insane, yet well-meaning, [nation]The lepearchauns[/nation].[/color]
