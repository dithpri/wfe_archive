A region of social democratic affinities.

Social democracy is a political ideology that officially has as its goal the establishment of democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods.

Alternatively, social democracy is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.

The Social Democracy region is home to social democrats of both types - and all inbetween.
