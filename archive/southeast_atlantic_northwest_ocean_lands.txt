The Southeast Atlantic Northwest Ocean Lands is a series of islands that have through one way or another become nations. Some of these nations are small clusters whose size per island may be similar to Hawaii, while others are singular masses of land that compare to most other nations in size. But no matter what kind of island it is, its voice will be equally heard in regional discussions. Whether new or old, big or small, all regional nations will be heard out in the decision making process. It should also be noted that the members of this region would like to remain as peaceful and free as possible. With that being said we will do our best to avoid violent solutions or solutions that remove rights from our citizens.
