Remillion-Rozenmeyer is a mass of Islands, huge majority of the nations are archipelagic or a single Island, divided hugely between the Remillion shelf to the North and the Rozenmeyer shelf to the South. Majority of the islands are subtropical with few frozen islands to the North, and about a third of the total islands are tropical islands mostly located to the South. Due to geography, most of the nations are isolationist and often do not interfere in each other&#39;s politics. However, trade flourishes and there is a council that meets annually to report in and decides their general next direction. The council leader is set by a vote in the council every decade where they also decide what their next 10-year plan should be.
