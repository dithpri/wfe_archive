[b]Long did Aga rule, and long did we prosper. It is with great sadness that we part ways from his leadership, and transition to a period of aga scarcity. Fortunately, Aga Gang stays real, and we are out here to prove it! BUT MASHALLAH, THE DARK EAGLES HAVE COME TO REINFORCE US!! MAY THE GODS RAIN DOWN ON THEM WITH STUPENDOUS GLORY AND HONOUR!!!!!

GOD BLESS AGA: GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN!
