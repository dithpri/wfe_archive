a very large island or small continent that many scientists theorize lies in the Indian Ocean, a thousand or so miles southwest of Australia.

 

&amp;quot;Theorize,&amp;quot; because Borschland&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Continent&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t always there, cannot be &amp;quot;seen&amp;quot; by satellites, and is sometimes difficult to find by travelers from the outside world. The most popular theory about the Continent is that it is partly located in an alternative-universe earth, and partly located in our earth, and often &amp;quot;phases&amp;quot; between the two.

 

The Continent has been erratically colonized by the outside world for thousands of years, which accounts for the eclectic mix of heritages represented in the nations.
