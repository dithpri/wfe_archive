[b][color=red]The Region of La Gran Gonorrhea is a vast and young territory .

Bordered between large hills to the North, a huge forest to the South, a wild ocean to the East and a mountain range to the West, the country of La Gran Gonorrhea mainly lives of prostitution, car repairing and organ trafficking.

The country&#39;s landscape is hideous; smelly, overgrown ponds, rocky beaches and black, decaying trees are just a sliver of the loneliness La Gran Gonorrhea has to offer, which is why the country is infamous among foreigners.

The people of La Gran Gonorrhea are insensitive towards foreigners and tend to welcome them with annoyance. They feel foreigners could hinder the country&#39;s well being.[/color][/b]
