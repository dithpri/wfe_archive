Private region open to trading through embassies. In order to join, you must prove yourself through how you treat your citizens, your economy, the environment, and a number of other issues. (Hey kids that stuff doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s just there to seem nice.)

The Region of WESC is a glorious region filled with minor amounts of lots of drama. If you want to join you must have a connection with another member of The Region of WESC, who is willing to vouch for you. We will accept embassies from all unless there is another issue within your Region that would make us unsafe to have an embassy.

Our region is democratic to an extreme extent, even annoying at times. However, it is necessary to keep our region semi-functional.
