The Special Equestrian Zone (S.E.Z.) is a region controlled by several nations. Their main exports are glue, mare milk, and brushies. Once every year, the nations of S.E.Z. get together to compete against eachother in Equestrian sports. The militaries of each country co-operate, sharing intelligence, forming a coalition to eradicate terrorists, and enemies of the state, inside and outside of the Zone. Citizens are required to own a pony, the symbol of our region&#39;s strong work ethic. The citizens of the region express their appreciation of their respective supreme leaders by having massive conventions where they do drugs and cosplay as their heads of governments.
