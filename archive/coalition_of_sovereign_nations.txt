In the [B][i]Coalition of Sovereign Nations[/i][/B] each nation may act in its own [color=orange][i]sovereign[/i][/color] and [color=green][i]independent[/i][/color] nature.

To act as a public forum and preserve national sovereignty, within and abroad, [color=blue][i]this Coalition[/i][/color] has been established as a free and independent zone; believing none are permitted to interfere in the administration, operation, or function of another&#39;s national sovereignty through the use of [i]corrupting[/i] organizations such as the [color=red][i]World Assembly[/i][/color].
