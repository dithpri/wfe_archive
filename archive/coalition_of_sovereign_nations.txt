In the [B][i]Coalition of Sovereign Nations[/i][/B] each nation may act in its own sovereign and independent nature. To form an effective and united organization, act as a public forum, insure domestic tranquility, and preserve national sovereignty, within and abroad, the Coalition has been established as a free and independent zone; none are permitted to interfere in the administration, operation, or function of another&amp;#39;s national sovereignty through the use of corrupting organizations such as the [i]World Assembly[/i].

If you are interested in our cause, or would merely like to know more, your are encouraged to telegram our founder for any reason. However, if you think as we think; if you feel as we feel; then you are urged to [i]join the Coalition today![/i]
