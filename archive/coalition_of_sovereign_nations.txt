In the [B][i][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=coalition_of_sovereign_nations][color=#3d3d3d]Coalition of Sovereign Nations[/url][/i][/B][/color] each nation may act in its own [color=orange][i]sovereign[/i][/color] and [color=green][i]independent[/i][/color] nature.

To act as a public forum and preserve national sovereignty, within and abroad, [color=blue][i]this Coalition[/i][/color] has been established as a free and independent zone; believing none are permitted to interfere in the administration, operation, or function of another&#39;s national sovereignty through the use of [i]corrupting[/i] organizations such as the [i][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un][color=red]World Assembly[/i][/url].[/color]

If you are interested in our cause, or would merely like to know more, your are encouraged to telegram one of our officers. However, if you think as we think; if you feel as we feel; then you are urged to [color=purple][i]join the Coalition today![/i][/color]
