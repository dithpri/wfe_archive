Welcome my scandinavian brothers and sisters, to the Scandinavian Oasis.

Cold, wet is not the true words for Scandinavia. This is the region of hopes and accomplishment of our great countries.  
Here we shall help each other become beautiful and prosperous countries formed by our own dreams and goals. No dreams are to big, and no countries are looked down on. Of cause that does not include the countries not living in our lovely oasis. Anyone is welcome, as long as they stay true to our fellow countries.
Cause we shall unite, the &quot;Motherland before anything&quot;
Best regards the government of Scandinavian Oasis
