The European Commonwealth is a technologically advanced group of European states. We have banded together for our own protection, and as such, maintain one military. Members are free to pass their own legislation. Each member has their own economy, and this cannot be altered. We respect each other&amp;#39;s freedom and hope to create a friendly environment. All our borders are demilitarized.
