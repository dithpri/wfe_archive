We are a coalition of nomadic tribes and hordes based in the Steppes of Khulania. We allow any nomadic people to enter and leave as they wish but we also allow anyone to enter our coalition as long as they accept the rule of the Yashiro Shogunate in our regime. Any and all attempts of a coup d&#39;&eacute;tat or any other form of violence against our Shogun and his family will be met with Blade and Honor. If you are found to be a large threat to the Shogun you will be put under heavy surveillance. HONOR STANDS ABOVE ALL.
