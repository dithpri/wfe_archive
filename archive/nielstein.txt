&quot;It would be far more majestic a land were it not bathed in this crimson flood.&quot;

The region of Nielstein sits at the westernmost border of the Baalshiek Plains, above the Capri sea, to the east of the Vasty Sea, and south of the Tsvald sea. It is a land of steep mountains, lush valleys, and several major fjords. On the eastmost border, between the Isilie Peaks and the Baalshiek plains are the Eltri foothills which serve as the only access point into most of Nielstein.

The region is divided into several Kingdoms, territories, and independent city-states. The most powerful are:
- The Holy Domain of Vallaya
- The Kingdom of Eltreich
- The Eveylian Empire
- The Duchy of Wavyrn

Among others.
