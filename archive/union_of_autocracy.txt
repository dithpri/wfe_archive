This region is of far Conservative authority and will do any sort of thing in it&amp;#39;s power to destroy any Liberal or Left-Wing power that supports Democracy. We support Authoritarianism, Religiousness, and order to one person of the Autocratic Party. This includes the W.A. Delegate which will be assigned by the Kaiser, Valois Francisco II de Vaque.
Our main agenda is to create the obvious things a major region has. Newspaper, Establishment of Embassies, a Forum, and all sorts of other goodies like a local IRC channel which will take extreme amounts of time.
