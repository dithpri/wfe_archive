The Union of Autocracy plays in the todays world and its system is modeled after the UAE, meaning that every nation has their own head of state but that they are unified under The Emperor of N.Semadenia.Democratic nations ( except armed republics) and totaliterian states) and communist/socialist nations are not allowed in.the government is ruled by a Emperor and rhe Vice-roy and has no parliament.The only people you could call a cabinet are his ministers, who have no powers but rather are advisors to the Emperor.
