The Tyrannical Holy Land is a Region that will grow to great power. Ideally, this region is looking for members that share the same conservative values on things. We are always looking for members that are part of the World Assembly, so we can vote things in our way. To be a member here you must have the status of a Holy Empire or something of the sort. All religions are welcome, even if you&#39;re not religious. If you have any questions, feel free to send a telegram to [nation]Big Bustin[/nation]. Also if you&#39;re part of the World Assembly, feel free to commend.
