United against the evils of the world under the leadership of Betterthanbrianistan. Nations of moral esteem, or those with exceptional circumstance, may be allowed into The Harmony Union to ensure they have peace and allies willing to defend said peace.

There are many alliances, unions, coalitions, and more, who claim to be advocates for peace and freedom, and that still allow nations of extreme moral depravity into their ranks. No such thing shall be allowed under the rule of Betterthanbrianistan. The Harmony Union is for nations that are of moral esteem, or who show progress in reforming their corrupt and immoral governments, not for cruel despots.
