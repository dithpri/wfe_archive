The founding nation, the Democratic Republic of Dillatopya, was founded with ideals rooted in a libertarian style of government; that a government&#146;s main responsibility is to provide for the defense of its people, and should not encourage dependence of citizens or other nations on the government. Because of this, Dillatopya discourages the welfare state and nation building. However, foreign governments will always find a strong and dependable friend in Dillatopya and a belief in peace through strength.

The Allied States of Dillatopya encourages anyone who believes in this philosophy of governing to join and stand up for individual liberties and freedoms.
