In the beginning, there were creatures called men who walked on two legs as we do today; they mastered the many sciences and thus molded life as they saw fit. But as they grew decadent, their downfall was inevitable; the great accomplishments were used against one another. They remained fragmented to the day of their demise. The heirs to their legacy broke their chains when the poisonous airs cleared and emerged into a newly molded world, the last accomplishment of man. Thus was born Bestiarum Terra.
