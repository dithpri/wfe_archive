[b]WE THE ARCHERS-ERRANT OF NATIONSTATES[/b] pursue native freedom and justice for its regional communities. We hope to promote the idea that war, invasions, coups and destabilization are not always needed nor necessarily right, but instead, an unfortunate last resort. We aim to reconnect defenderism with NationStates natives, to earn their trust and their respect. We aspire to be a benevolent body of people that are here to assist natives with the security, protection and promotion of native sovereignty in their regions at their request.
