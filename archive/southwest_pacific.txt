The Southwest Pacific is a reigon occupying the Southwestern remains of the United States. Founded by me, leader of Dylanville (The first nation in the reigon), the Southwest Pacific is home to nations who, preferably, live in southwest and west states in the US, but anyone is welcome to join! If you have a lot of the same ideals as me or not, I will still include you in this reigon with open arms! Please help this reigon grow by joining, no password required. (However, if any mean comments are sent I will have to kick you out.) 
Thanks for checking us out, please move to this reigon!
