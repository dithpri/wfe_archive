[u][b][color=purple]Thousandth Island[/color][/b][/u]
Far out to sea there lies a small island region. Small though it might be it has a rich culture and heritage. A port to the north east provides access to the rest of the world, allowing trade flow and embassies to interact with our region.

We are a small region, though we hope to grow strong soon enough.
