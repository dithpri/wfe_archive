Hey all,

I wanted to let you all know I&#39;m starting up a region project with a consolidation of canon for a few nations like my main Achesia, Atla, and allot of the IC from the early days of Septentrion and Stille Nacht. I wanted to welcome anyone who wants to come and build upon that world with me. It would be super casual and low pressure pace, we can just RP whenever, do whatever.

PS: If you all still wanted to go with this and want the old WFE to be put back I can either put it back for you or the text for which is in the dispatch pinned below.
