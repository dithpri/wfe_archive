In the Far Jest, on the fifth point of the compass, lies the ancient realm of Jessos. Where once were many, now only few remain: across its barren hills, scattered ruins stand as memories of the great empires that have shaped this almighty land.

Though dark and isolated, Jessos yields hidden treasures; deep mines, rich waters and the teeming forests of Jaeb let its nations prosper. 

Let us gather for the first time, to revel in our excellency!
