En Princ&iacute;pium, or &amp;quot;The Beginning&amp;quot;, is the small solar system that houses Tellimus, the planet that The Dominion of Constantinovaltine finds itself on. Comprised of only 3 planets, and orbiting a Main Sequence star, this system is safe and quiet. Only one planet, Glacium, has been colonized by The Dominion thus far*. With its population slowly rising, The Dominion seeks additional planets to colonize. 

*The Dominion previously established a colony on a far off planet known as Zabaleta, but communication with said colony was cut off almost 30 years ago.
