Welcome to Goatopia!

Following the Wavenian Invasion, Goatopia strives to regain its previous residents and control. Please feel free to move here and endorse our candidate for [color=blue]WA Delegate[/color], [nation]Kerbalton[/nation] (though doing so is voluntary by law).

As loyal Goatopians, we are hopeful that this region can be even greater then it was. Therefore, for a little while, regulations may be a tad stricter than usual.

Our sincere thanks to [region]Yarnia[/region]&#39;s WA Delegate, [nation=short]Peoples Republic of the Basque People[/nation]. Please read his message attached below and spread the word!

Thank you, and may your prominent religious figure(s) bless Goatopia.
