[b][color=#3201D3]Welcome to the Union of Christian Nations!

All our welcome in our region as long as they are tolerant and not chaotic.

Our Father, Who is in heaven, Holy is Your Name; Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
