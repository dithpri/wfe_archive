[b][color=red]&amp;#9773; MARX - LENIN - STALIN - MAO - HOXHA &amp;#9773;[/b][/color]

[b]Hongweibings[/b] (&#147;Red Guards&#148; in Mandarin) is an anti-revisionist and Maoist region. Opposed to the capitalist road of modern China, the revisionism of the USSR post-1956, and the liberal capitalist-imperialism of the AmeriKKKan Empire. Long live those who fight for freedom and liberation in the midst of capitalist terror.

We support the concept of Eternal Cultural Revolution, uphold the legacy of Mao Tse Tung and the Gang of Four, recognize Hoxha&#146;s contribution to anti-revisionism while critiquing his anti-Mao sentiments, and denounce both NATO and Russian imperialism.
