[b]Hongweibings (&#147;Red Guards&#148; in Mandarin) is an anti-revisionist and Maoist region. Opposed to the capitalist road of modern China, the revisionism of the USSR post-1956, and the liberal capitalist-imperialism of the AmeriKKKan Empire. Long live those who fight for freedom and liberation in the midst of capitalist terror.[/b]
