Welcome to Neo-Esportiva, the youngest sporting region of the big three. We are a friendly region and generally big fans of sports, and we are always welcoming to new nations. Our cabinets are filling with trophies, but we are always looking for some extra silverware. This region is a continuation of [region=Esportiva].
