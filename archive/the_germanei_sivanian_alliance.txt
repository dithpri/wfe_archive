This region has been liberated by the Thousand Islands. Many thanks to these heroic nations who have removed the fascist occupiers from our region.  We are a relatively small region, but we always are willing to welcome new arrivals. Endorse whomever you wish to be delegate. We as a region lean left politically, but all views are welcome except for fascism that repress free speech and democratic elections.
