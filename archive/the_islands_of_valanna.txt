General Information:

-The Islands of Valanna are a cluster of small islands and atolls tightly packed together. With most islands connected by bridges, the Islands stay in touch easily. 
-The Region&#39;s largest island is Baba Courina, the country of Valluzia&#39;s main and most populated island.
-The Islands of Valanna showcase beautiful beaches, ancient Native Valannan (Bababoan) ruins, and incredible architecture. Due to it&#39;s past being a victim of imperialism, incredibly preserved 1st world Georgian and Victorian architecture is found almost everywhere on the islands. Unlike many small islands, large stone and brick buildings, extravagant palaces (built as royal getaways during colonial rule) and overbearing forts can be found almost anywhere.
