Proposed Opposition Legislation Enactment
In comparison to many other Regions where they attempt to hold you as a child-state or a quiet voice, POLE is an agreement among many countries, governments, kingdoms, and what-have-you&#39;s. An Alliance, if you will, with no formal leader except one Elected to the position. This Individual does not assume Direct Control of any of the governments of POLE, but these governments are strongly encouraged to follow a request of the Elected Official.

POLE only requires Civil Rights emphasis for Nations, other areas, and ethics/religion/government type, etc do not matter.
