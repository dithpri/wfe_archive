The high peaks of [i]Unom[/i]. Viewing the fighting of all from their lofty thrones. As the menfolk fight between themselves, vying for control of the richness of the mountains and low fertile valleys. Meanwhile, the rats scurry beneath the surface waiting for the gates of the world to break, to flow upon the world in [i]Vermintide[/i]. Those who control this land will have the greatest empire that has existed and will ever exist. There is no peace in this world. There is only war.
