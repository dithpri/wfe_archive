The Federation of Eastern Republics is a new formation of nations bent on prosperity, freedom, and the Christian way of life.These ideals are the bedrock of the federation. Nations that chose to apply and enter the federation must follow a set of few, but strict guidelines set by the Federation Congress. Nations are free to govern as they see fit as as long as these guidelines are followed. Major social, political,economic, and wartime decisions are made by the Federation Congress. Positions are granted on experience and success of a nation, and can be revoked accordingly. 
 

Glory To The Federation, Glory To The Motherland!
