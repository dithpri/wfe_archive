The Federation of Eastern Republics is a new formation of nations bent on prosperity and freedom. Christianity and conservatism are the bedrock of the federation. Nations that chose to apply and enter the federation must follow a set of few, but strict guidelines set by the Federal Congress. Nations are free to govern as they see fit as as long as these guidelines are followed. Major social, political, and economic decisions are made by the congress. Positions are granted on experience and success of a nation, and can be revoked accordingly. 

We shall take this step toward everlasting freedom, or condemn our children to one thousand years of darkness.   

Glory To The Federation, Glory To The Motherland!
