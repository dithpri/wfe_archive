[b]The Black Hawks, on a regular flight, suddenly got hit hard by *ahem* technical difficulties. After investigating what caused these troubles, we got to two conclusions:
1. Lag saved us, so they&#39;re obviously a raider.

3. The server is a protector of innocent natives. Who knew?
After these shocking revelations, the Hawks went back the [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]nest[/url] to do secret raider things*.

*Secret raider things may or may not involve watching anime, according to rumour.[/b]
