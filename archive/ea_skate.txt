In 2007, Electronic Arts (EA) came out with the legendary game, Skate.

Then, in 2009 blessed us with Skate 2

Finally but sadly EA blessed us with Skate 3 in 2010, the final game in the Skate franchise (as of Feb. 19, 2016).

However, rumors are that EA may release Skate 4 in the near future. Let&#39;s hope that&#39;s true.

This region is for people who are fans of the Skate franchise and who wish to see Skate 4 and also for skaters [b]PERIOD[/b].
