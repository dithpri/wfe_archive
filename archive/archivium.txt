A massive work-in-progress. We&#39;re seeking to create an extensive wiki detailing the government, policy, history, and foreign relations of every major region. Our end goal is a well-connected, well-designed, and accurate collection that&#39;s maintained by a dedicated group of nations from all over NS. If you&#39;d like to join this project, please contact Givi/llein#7480! We&#39;re willing to accept anyone, regardless of their regional affiliations, given that they&#39;re either able to provide useful information or are capable of writing at a college level.
