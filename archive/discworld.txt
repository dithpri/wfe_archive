[b]The Discworld is a flat planet - like a geological pizza, but without the anchovies.  It offers sights far more impressive than those found in universes built by Creators with less imagination but more mechanical aptitude.  It exists right on the edge of Reality; the least little things can break through from the other side.  It is allowed to exist either because of some impossible blip on the curve of probability, or because the gods enjoy a joke as much as anyone else.[/b] - [i]Extract from The Discworld Companion[/i]
