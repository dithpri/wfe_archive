It&amp;#39;s not the prettiest part of the world, but it&amp;#39;s one of the most functional.  A great deal is produced from there, and it seems to be expelled nearly everywhere at times.  These products can range from highest quality and consistency to glorified raw materials that haven&amp;#39;t been processed at all.  Citizens here are rather cheeky about where their region sits.  The sun doesn&amp;#39;t shine here half the year, but when it comes out, &amp;quot;The Bottom&amp;quot; gets plenty of attention.
