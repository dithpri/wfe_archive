Eulonith is an age-old religion with three main gods and a family of lesser gods. Their main teachings revolve around avoiding evil and mutual respect, and these teachings are often passed on through religious community events and readings by spiritual leaders. Eulonith&#39;s teachings come from antique publications told to have been given by all the gods to cleanse the world of sin and give mankind a new purpose. Most of their religious symbols are represented in the form of buildings, paintings and figurines.
Being an age-old religion, Eulonith has fractured into different variations, but they&#39;re relatively peaceful toward each other. Eulonith is often met with mutual respect by those not part of this religion.
