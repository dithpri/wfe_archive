[b]The nations comprising Reagan States pledge their support to fight modern conservative bigotry and support President Barack Obama.[/b]
Reagan States is an official colony of [region]the Halcyon Empire[/region].

This region will no longer act as refuge for &#145;the American Taliban&#146;, and thus supports President Barack Obama and the modern Democratic Party.

There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America - there&amp;#39;s the United States of America.&amp;quot; [b][i]President Barack Obama[/b][/i]
