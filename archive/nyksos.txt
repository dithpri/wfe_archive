Hello and greetings from[nation]Tholden[/nation], as some of you may have heard the silly rumors, our Region was recently &quot;Volunteered&quot; themselves to some small nations to make [region]Nyksos[/region] A military region. However, I would like to confirm that those rumors were and always will be false. As the New Delegate, I will insure that those rumors will not be spread about again. Thank you for choosing [region]Nyksos[/region]. Officers will be replaced and appointed soon based on best judgement.... But until then, &quot;Let the Peace Prevail&quot;
