We are not found of unnecessary international relations and affairs, and simply seek to band together relatively isolated nations so that they might have a garnered and secure way to avoid the prying and annoyance of another nation that may seek to join them. We will protect and stand for one another if it comes to it, but may that never have to be the case. As the affairs of each nation are best left to its own people, and to an extent its government, as it is them who pays the dearest price for actions. The only acceptable intervention is at the cost of defenseless and wrongfully persecuted human life.
