I do congratulate Black Riders with the conquest of our region. I am honored that you, my friends, planned and executed an operation to take over our region. I am convinced that your countries put both time and effort into this conquest, but now I, on a boring Sunday afternoon, will undo your most valiant efforts with a couple of clicks in just a few seconds. However since you did waste your time, I shall leave your names up, so that all future nations that shall visit our region could join me in act appreciation of your meaningless work.
