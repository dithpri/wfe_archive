Once a historical pan-Slavic region inhabited by fascists, now secured by [region]North Korea[/region] and The [region]Korean Peoples Army[/region].

This region stands as a monument to the oppressive, homophobic, and racist mentalities of the natives. Forever stopped from spreading their bigoted hate speech.
