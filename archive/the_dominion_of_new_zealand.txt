If you Tolerate This Then Your Children Will be Next - Manic Street Preachers
The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists

And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this
Then your children will be next.[/color]
