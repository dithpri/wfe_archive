You find a group of hawks from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] training a hawking! They decided that your region looked nice for a place for the hawks to land with their hawking. Unfortunately, hawks aren&amp;#8217;t the cleanest and left a mess behind in your region, hope you don&amp;#8217;t mind!
