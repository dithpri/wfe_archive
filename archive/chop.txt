The Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) is a group of misinformed and anarchist traitors, who are furthering treasonous actions and disruptive behavior. As quoted by one of the protestors; &quot;I&#39;m not here to peacefully protest. I&#39;m here to disrupt until my demands are met.&quot; Does that sound like peaceful and responsible demonstration behavior to you? Sounds like terrorism to me. This region has been preemptively founded by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation] to deny the anarchist traitors a platform to spew their harmful propaganda. &quot;NO PLATFORM&quot;, as you [b]ANTI[color=red]FA[/color][/b] folks used to scream. Remember that?
