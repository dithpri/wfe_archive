In this region, all are welcome, with only one main rule. Only Men can vote.... And only Women can hold political office. WOMEN make the day to day decisions of life... But MEN can override them with a vote. Women are Always Honored,  but feminism is not acceptable. Only female can hold any position of power in this region.... Only Men can determine which woman. All offices are decided on the 1st day of each month. Be honest about your gender. Gender liars are banned. Once elected... the elected woman has complete power over the region for one month. No one can say anything negative over the supreme ruler. Male or female. No female can campaign against the supreme delegate of this region until the 28th day of the month.
