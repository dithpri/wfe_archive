The Coalition of National Imperialist States (CNIS) is a political and economic alliance formed in the early 21st century, advocating for a doctrine of national imperialism. This ideology posits that every nation possesses the sovereign right to pursue its own interests and policies without external interference, particularly concerning issues of human rights, democracy, and governance. The CNIS serves as a refuge for states seeking to escape wrongful external judgments and pressures.

To be granted additional privileges such as executive authority by the Governor, a member must convince at least one nation to join the Coalition.
