[b]Welcome to our region![/b]
Here at the [b]CNIS[/b], or the [b][i]Botslan Alliance[/i][/b] as it is colloquially known among us, we strive to forge a futuristic region of like-minded lovers of [b]national sovereignty[/b] and the brightest [b]future[/b] the world can offer to its inhabitants!

Nations are free to be left to their own device; we want to create a [b]safe refuge[/b] for all who have faced criticism because of ideology or appearance. Let us build a region based on everlasting [b]mutual respect[/b]!

[i]Note: We are currently undergoing some regional revamping, so we are mostly communicating through telegram, but do not view it as anti-social behavior: if you need us, just ask![/i]
