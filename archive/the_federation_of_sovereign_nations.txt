The Federation of Sovereign Nations, sometimes referred to as the FSN, is an organization of international cooperation dedicated to its members&#39; sovereignty. The Federation recognizes all independent nations and acts simply as an alliance and a tool to protect national independence. To that end, the Federation supports policy and ideas that uphold independence of individual nations and therefore peace. Because war violates the sovereignty of one or more nations, the Federation is, on principle, opposed to it. However, in any given scenario, including war, the Federation staunchly supports its members&#39; sovereignty over that of other nations. The Federation is adamantly devoted to its&#39; members&#39; and the Federation&#39;s soverignity.
