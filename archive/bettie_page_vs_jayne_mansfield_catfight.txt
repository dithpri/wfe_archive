It probably never happened but we can dream, can&amp;#39;t we? Welcome to the One True Region dedicated to the eternal struggle between two of the most pulchritudinous hotties to ever grace a centerfold. Our forum is where we hold philosophical discussions on catfight strategy and tactics, speculate on the outcome and generally express appreciation for our favorite opponent. Scratching, slapping, biting and giant tubs of butterscotch pudding are not only permitted but encouraged. Who will be the first to cry uncle?
