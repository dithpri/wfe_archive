No longer bound the regime of the Old Legion, the New Legion serves to bring forth the true Third Rome. Many have tried to form the final successor to the mighty Roman Empire, but none have succeeded. Fascists like Benito Mussolini believed that they could bring forth a martial Rome by allying themselves with the very people who brought down the Western Empire centuries before. Fools such as the Blackshirts forgot what made Rome truly great: pre-Catholic Roman culture.

Under the rule of [B]Dictator Lucius Furius Valens Caesar[/B] of [nation]Tertia Roma[/nation], the [color=#721D00]New[/color] [region]Legion of Great Nations[/region] will bring forth a Third Roman Empire.

Glory to Rome!
