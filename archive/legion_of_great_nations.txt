Following a recent invasion and coup d&amp;#39;&eacute;tat, the abandoned region of [region=Legion of Great Nations] has been conquered by [nation=Shojaastan]. This invasion was supported by [nation=Solia-Sahem] and personally funded by [nation=Tertia Roma]. With relatively little resistance, the National Shojaastani Armed Forces, aided by Solian-Sahemite mercenaries, captured the remainder of the Old Legion of Great Nations&amp;#39; territory.

Currently, the Emir of [nation=Shojaastan] is the supreme ruler of the New Legion, and is expected to be treated as such. The Caesar of Third Rome ([nation=Tertia Roma]) will be honored with the title of Dictator of the Legion.
