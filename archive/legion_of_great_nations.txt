[color=red]&#147;[i]Oculus Novae Legionis communitatem spectat[/i].&#148;[/color] &#150; [color=red]&#147;The Eye of the New Legion watches the public.&#148;[/color]

No longer bound the regime of the Old Legion, the New Legion serves to bring forth the true Third Rome. Many have tried to form the final successor to the mighty Roman Empire, but none have succeeded. The New Legion will consist of powerful, yet dependent nations&#151;great nations&#151;who will revival even the might of the Old Roman Empire.

Under the rule of [B]Dictator Lucius Furius Valens Caesar[/B] of [nation]Tertia Roma[/nation], the [color=#721D00]New[/color] [region]Legion of Great Nations[/region] will bring forth the Third Roman Empire.

[region]DEN[/region] will never oppress the mighty Third Rome!
Glory to Rome!
