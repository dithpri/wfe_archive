The Orokin are a precursor race that ruled over the Solar System for a period of time. During what was known as the Orokin Era, they built technological masterpieces that rival even present day technology. Their descendants are the Tenno, beings of balance and control. They came to be when the Orokin sent their kin into the void. Although there is almost no information about the Orokin race, their technology, they play a crucial part in the universe.
During a war with what were known as the &amp;quot;Sentients&amp;quot; the Orokin created the Technocyte Virus [citation needed] as a way to combat them. Very little information remains on what their goals may have been, but this shows the Orokin had a mastery over organic and technological aspects
