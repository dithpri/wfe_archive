The great region of the Prusslivic Mainlands is home to strong bonds between nations. The region was formally created in 1948, one year after the end of the Great War by its founders, Morriah Coast and Yugosloveria.

If you are a nation that is interested in joining the region, or if you are interested in setting up an embassy, please feel free to address either:

Klemens D&ouml;r&szlig;el, Imperial Advisor to [nation]Morriah Coast[/nation]
Miroslav Karad&#158;ic, Ministerial Advisor to [nation]Yugosloveria[/nation]

If you are in need of military aid, submit a request for assistance to Geoffrey Kasyr of Morriah Coast.
