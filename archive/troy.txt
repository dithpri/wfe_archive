[b]Greetings &amp;amp; Welcome to the Grand Kingdom of Troy![/b]

[i]&amp;quot;If they ever tell my story, let them say I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat, but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of horses. Let them say I lived in the time of Achilles!&amp;quot;[/i]

Troy welcomes all nations, regardless of gender, ethnicity, political beliefs, sexual preference, and religion, with open arms.
Founded on the First of March, 2008 Anno Domini, Troy is a proud and growing community.
