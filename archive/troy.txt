[b]TERRITORY OF [region]THE BORDURIAN EMPIRE[/region][/b]

&amp;quot;If they ever tell my story, let them say I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat, but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector, tamer of horses. Let them say I lived in the time of Achilles!&amp;quot;

Greetings &amp;amp; Welcome to the Grand Kingdom of Troy!

Troy welcomes all nations, regardless of gender, ethnicity, political beliefs, sexual preference, and religion, with open arms.
Founded on the First of March, 2008 Anno Domini, Troy is a proud and growing community.
