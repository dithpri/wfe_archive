It is a time of civil war.

The valiant ORDER OF PALADINS
has been wiped out by
the sinister SORCERER LORDS,
and their powerful allies, the
TIME PROPHETS.

Starships of the REBELLION, 
striking from a hidden base, 
have won their first victory 
over the evil empire 
of CENTRALITY PRIME.

As chaos envelops the galaxy, 
amoral CRIME SYNDICATES
prey on the weak and defenseless. 
Dozens of worlds fall victim to
cruel pirates and vile slavers.
