New Caelondia is defined by an ongoing rivalry between two powers: [nation]Astoria[/nation] and [nation]The Yukons[/nation], both claiming the mantle of heir to the fallen Imperium of Columbia. Other minor powers attempt to navigate between these two giants, wary of being caught up in the Great Game.

New Caelondia is a multi-solar collection of worlds inhabited by an assortment of sapient species. The Federation united the &#39;Verse in a peaceful democratic union, but this was shattered by the aggressive conquests of the Yukon Empire. The Empire is locked in a simmering cold war with the Free Space Confederacy, a collection of worlds opposed to Yukon dominion who covertly support a variety of rebel groups operating in Yukon space.
