The Mid-Atlantic Defense Administration (MADA /MA-da; German: Mittelatlantische Verteidigungsverwaltung, MV) is an intergovernmental military alliance between numerous member states.

The organization serves as a system of collective security, whereby its independent member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party.
