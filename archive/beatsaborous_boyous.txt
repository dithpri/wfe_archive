In this region of Beatsaborous Boyous, we abide by no laws, no regulatory authority, and no specific executive rulers. We govern ourselves, with one being the founder of this land. If anyone outside of the fellowship of Boys of the Beats join, they will face immediate expulsion from this land and exile for the rest of their lands&#39; days.
