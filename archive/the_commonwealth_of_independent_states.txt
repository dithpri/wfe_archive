The CIS is a regional organization whose participating countries are former Soviet Republics, formed during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is aimed at being more than a purely symbolic organization, nominally possessing coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security.
