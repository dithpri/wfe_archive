Founded in the wake of the [i]420 Swaggeroony revolution[/i], [b]The United 420 Emirates of Swagonia[/b] is a host to a very wide variety of ideologies and an even wider variety of leaders. 

In the year 420 BC a secret society was formed, veiled in shadows and spoken of in whispers. It was known as [color=green]Fumus Viriditas Quotidiana[/color].

The society has evolved since then into the Region you see here.
