&quot;Some fight for warlords. We fought for an empire. Our might inspired generations of soldiers and struck fear in the heart of their enemies. We are Holy Knights. Our confidence radiates out to all those who follow them. With the gladius as an extension of our arms and our fist as strong as our conviction. Once the pride of a glorious dynasty, our legend is soon to be rewritten.&quot;
