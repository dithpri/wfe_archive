&quot;Some fight for warmongerers. Others fight for oppressors. We fight for the Senate and the Empire. We inspire generations of soldiers and strike fear in the hearts of their enemies. We are the Holy Knights, our confidence radiates out to all those who follow us. With the sword as an extension of our arms and our bodies as strong as our conviction. Our legend is soon to be rewritten. We once fought with sword and bow, but now we win with gun and tank. When the nations stand together all others will fall. The Silver coats of our soldiers will march into the ranks of enemies and we will be victorious. With the Flash of our guns and the sight of our men, all who defy the Knights and the Senate, will fall into the abyss of our nations.&quot;
