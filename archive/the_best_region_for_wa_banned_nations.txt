We are nations who are banned from the WA. (Other nations who are still in the WA are welcome as well, we accept everybody here :p)
But we love the game.
And who needs a WA to be perfectly happy? 
We don&amp;#39;t.

Once we reach 10 nations we will start doing a kind of &amp;#39;Nation Of The Week&amp;#39; thing. 
Feel free to join!
Every kind of player is welcome to share his opinion.
