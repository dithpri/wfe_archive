On 3 November 2020, the world has faced one of the most horrible injustices yet.
Justice Nicol had declared Johnny Depp guilty of Domestic Abuse and forced him to pay over $550k to The Sun.
The public had decided, after reading the evidence against Amber, that Amber is the abuser, and Justice Nicol is a corrupt imbecile.
We will not hold back in the fight against justice!
This group will disband once Amber Heard gets jailed.
