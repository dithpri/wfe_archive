The Federation is a political group characterized by a union of partially self-governing states under a one government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either nation, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is our regions form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent nations so that each nation retains some degree of control over its internal affairs.
