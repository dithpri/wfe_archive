[region=Green Legion] [color=darkgreen]values eco-friendliness, environmental conservation, and sustainable development.

We are also now an [b]anti-fascist raiding region [/b]and a proud founding member of the [/color][color=darkblue][b]TZC[/b][/color][color=darkgreen]!

We accept most embassy requests and are open to new alliance members for the [/color][color=darkblue][b]TZC[/b][/color] [color=darkgreen]which can be found below.

We are always looking for new members and if you join then feel free to apply for an officer position through the message board or through a telegram to [nation=Zarnath 2].

We are [b]a very environmentally focused region [/b]and would be considered to be a [b]center left group [/b]by most. However, if [region=Green Legion] is not liberal enough for you then feel free to join our more radical leftist allies in [region=The Deep Ecologist Party of Nationstates].[/color]
