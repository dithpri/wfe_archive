We are [color=red][b]The Lands[/b][/color] of [color=magenta][b]Peculiar Freedom![/b][/color]

We welcome [b]all[/b] nations to our region. Except for the Donald Trump ones, they can stay well away

Our leader is currently [b][nation]Jamerya[/nation][/b], but - in the name of democracy - you are allowed to endorse [b]whoever[/b] you want!

And yes, our freedom is [b][color=magenta]very[/color][/b] peculiar. If you&#39;re in this nation, do what you want. (Except chat spamming. Obvs. And raiding.)
