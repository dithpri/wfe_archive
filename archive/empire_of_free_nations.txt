The Empire of Free Nations, or EFN, is large and well organized. Only nations with strong militaries are allowed to join the EFN, and nobody that favors peace or the easy way out are allowed in. We are strong, and not to be und&egrave;restimated, or those that do will be gone tomorrow. We take threats seriously, and retaliate every time with everything we have. We favor a large and potent air force and Navy, with a strong army as well, but the air force and navy favored the most. Those that wish to be part of a proud and strong military region, you are welcomed with open arms.
