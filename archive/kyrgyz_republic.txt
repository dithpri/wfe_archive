Kyrgyzstan officially the Kyrgyz Republic, formerly known as Kirghizia, is a landlocked mountainous country located in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan&#39;s history spans over 2,000 years, encompassing a variety of cultures and empires. Kyrgyzstan has historically been at the crossroads of several great civilizations, mainly as part of the Silk Road and other commercial and cultural routes. Though long inhabited by a succession of independent tribes and clans, Kyrgyzstan has periodically come under foreign domination and attained sovereignty as a nation-state only after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
