[b][color=grey]The League of Dictatorships[/color] [color=brown]was originally founded in July 2006, by HEM. The region was based around the &amp;quot;Head of State&amp;quot; who ruled supremely, aided by several elected officials.

The region was internally chaotic. Due to increasingly inactive forums and HEM&amp;#39;s rising political career in the Land of Kings and Emperors, the region was shuttered in February of 2007.

Several attempts were made to revive the region, each with varied successes. The region eventually lapsed out of HEM&amp;#39;s hands through 2012, though he has since reclaimed it (obviously).[/color]
