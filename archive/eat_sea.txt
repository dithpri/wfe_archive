Not to be confused with the East Sea, the Eat Sea is a region where delicious foodstuff are manufactured and exported for all around the world. It&amp;#39;s somewhere near the Pacific. I didn&amp;#39;t make this up, just look at the GPS.

Welcome to Eat Sea! Feel free to share your food here! As the region founder, I welcome you!

You can also discuss anything here!
