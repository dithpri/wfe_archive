Not to be confused with the East Sea, the Eat Sea is a region where delicious foodstuff are manufactured and exported for all around the world. It&amp;#39;s somewhere near the Pacific. I didn&amp;#39;t make this up, just look at the GPS.

Welcome to Eat Sea! Feel free to share your food here! As the region founder, I welcome you!

You can also discuss anything here (follow the game rules though, or the mods will spank you.)

This is now an open region! Eat Sea welcomes you! (Not that there&amp;#39;s anything nice here for ya anyways...)

Come endorse, and we may have a delegate...soon!
