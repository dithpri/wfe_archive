[region]Scandinavium[/region] has been sacked in retribution for game crimes of collusion with [region]Palm Beach[/region]

We vanquish [nation]British Empire Strikes Back[/nation], [nation]Kelvinsi[/nation] and all criminal Palm Beach raiders.

You have been defeated! 

Bow to your new masters, scurvy dogs! Or there will be no walkies, no Alpo in your bowl and no place to lie except back in filthy Palm Beach where lies abound!
