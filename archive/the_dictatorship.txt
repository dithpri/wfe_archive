[b]A city, once strong and powerful, the center of international trade, has been leveled. 

[nation]Runlet[/nation]&#39;s powerful military arm has extended forward and as political tension rose, the military took power, and ended the tension by launching three nuclear warheads against the city. Now, [region]The Dictatorship[/region] has arisen and taken power, from sea to sea, troops are being mobilized for war. If it be with each other, or against other worlds, well, we&#39;ll just have to see.

&quot;Peace, peace don&#39;t solve nothin. Guns and the blood of men solve the problems of this world.&quot;
