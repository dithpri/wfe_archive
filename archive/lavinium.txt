Established in 2004, Lavinium was a region founded on the principles of peace, respect and dignity for all nations. Democracy, participation and diversity were among its principal values. Today, Lavinium is in a semi-retired state, maintained by its Founder and Delegate as a tribute to the unique values and principles that it presented to the NS world nearly a decade ago, and the home and inspiration it provided to many NS players over the years. It is also maintained so that, perhaps, it can be revived one day to once again shine its light on NS.
