[b][color=green]Welcome to Vesvin![/color][/b]

Here you can be free to roleplay and choose a side, engage in politics, and campaign for the leadership in the regional government to change the fate of Vesvin; in your own eyes! There is a huge variety of nations ranging from bureaucratic democracies who have endless debates with one and another, to revolutionary socialists who basically don&#39;t feed their own people. We don&#39;t discriminate and we don&#39;t segregate, despite the many conservatives here.

Have any questions? Contact our Executive Director [nation]Berukio Imperiuk[/nation], we also accept concerns and meaningless comments!

Don&#39;t forget to endorse our President [nation]Roguiguez[/nation] so we don&#39;t get raided by invaders!
