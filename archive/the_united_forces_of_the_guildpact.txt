The UFGP is a regions of friendly NationStates that was formed by the Lord Forest Rakdos, who did this because he had too much time, and the Tigers of West Liberty abandoned hope. Lord Rakdos kept holding strong, and rebuilt on the ruins of the fallen nations that held close in borders. Fellow NationState Voltitis helped begin the project when he was the first person to try and join the broken region, and sending word to Lord Rakdos of how he wanted to join the Alliance of nations. With the leader of that nation donating to the effort to rebuild, the unlikely duo rebuilt on the ruins of the Tigers, and made the United Forces of the Guildpact.
