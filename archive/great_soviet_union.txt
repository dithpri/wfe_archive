[i]What if nationalists &amp; separatists didn&#39;t subvert the Soviet Union? What if the communist party didn&#39;t give up during crisis? What if Glasnost worked, and projected USSR into the 21st century? What if Soviet Union found itself among Xi&#39;s China and Trump&#39;s United States? Among muslim and hispanic migrations, far-right extremism and AI?

What if Gorbachev realized his mistake, and made comrade Nazarbayev his successor? Now its 2025, Nazarbayev is getting old and looking for someone to succeed him.

Do you have what it takes to lead the Great Soviet Union?
