Following the defeat of Sauron;
the destruction of the One Ring;
the departures to Valinor;

Men in the west expands their reach;
The elves and the dwarves goes underground;
Westron, the common tongue, dominates;
Speakers of the olden languages surfaces sparingly;
Twas called the Fourth Age.
