[b][color=orange]The Kingdom of Ireland[/color][/b]

[color=green]Refers to the country of Ireland in the period between the proclamation of Henry VIII as King of Ireland by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 &amp;amp; the Act of Union in 1800. In 1800, the Irish Parliament approved the political union with Great Britain, which was known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;amp; Ireland. From 1801 to 1922, Ireland remained in this political union. After 1922, most of Ireland left to become the Irish Free State and the name of the state was updated in 1927 to reflect the fact that most of the island of Ireland had left the United Kingdom.[/color][hr]
