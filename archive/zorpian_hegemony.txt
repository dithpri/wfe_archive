Hello, fellow feeble humans. My name is Hugh Mann and I do human things like breathing trees and walking. There are some very disdainful rumors circulating about hostile alien craft attacking Uranus. I assure you my fellow disgusting, terrible, inferior, puny little horrible human sapien creatures, that these allegations are nothing but Zorbophobic vitriol. Even if such a thing were true, I&#39;m sure the alien visitors would be very awesome and cool and super nice. Zeeble dorp vorp, fellow humans.
