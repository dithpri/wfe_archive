Maopi Lianmeng is a special, multispecies nation created in 2013 DP years (2023 for most of you). It was founded on one principle: Providing a fun, active place for all furries of NationStates.

Inspired by my prior awful experiences in other regions (aside from the Rejected Realms, which I called my home), Maopi Lianmeng is the place you go if you keep joining human-only regions, like I did at one point! 

Although this nation mostly focuses on furries, everyone&#39;s welcome as fine as you support furries (and if you don&#39;t, what did an animal costume do to you?)
