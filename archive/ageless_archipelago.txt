Welcome, one and all, to the Ageless Archipelago! We are a chain of large islands in the North Atlantic, returned to the world at large after a thousand years enclosed in a spatiotemporal distortion that prevented entry or exit, a defense measure against Norman conquest that unfortunately lasted orders of magnitude longer than intended. Unintentionally, this has left us the last bastion of the arcane arts in all the world, and now, our leaders look to the outside world in both hope and trepidation. Perhaps this time will be different.
