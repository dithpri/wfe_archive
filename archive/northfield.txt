[color=darkgreen][b]Northfield is a region based on a hybrid realistic/fantasy roleplay. We also have a democratic government for everyone to take part in once we draft our constitution. We are working on getting our regional systems online currently, so if you wish to join and get something started feel free to contact the founder account or the nation of [nation]Averra[/nation]. Thank you![/b][/color]
