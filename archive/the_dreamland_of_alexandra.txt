&amp;#39;&amp;#39; From the ashes of my mother, I will emerge, and none may destroy her dying wish: To create the Empire of her dreams, in her memory. ,,

Alexandra&amp;#39;s Dreamland-Or Alexandria, as she baptised it, is a secluded Island far off from Civilization and named after Lissabeth&amp;#39;s mother, Alexandra Akida. Its shape resembles a Triangular Shield with lightly curved sides, a vast ocean separates it from the rest of the world and forests shroud the Akinseer&amp;#39;s overprotected Empire, which she rules with an Iron Fist. Upon arrival, every single person is interviewed and screened; Undesired people-with &amp;#39;Corrupt&amp;#39; morals or &amp;#39;Corrupt&amp;#39; mentalities, are sent back home without an apology.
