The Byzantine federation is a federative assembly of all regions centrally controlled by The Byzantine Emperor.
While all provinces retain autonomy to make/remove laws, they must still pay tribute to the central government in the form of a percentage of manpower and local revenue in the region.
Most Eparchy&#39;s send &amp;#8776;65% manpower and &amp;#8776;45% of revenue(Aegean Islands,Slovenia).
Highly populated Eparchy&#39;s however send &amp;#8776;90% of manpower and &amp;#8776;65% of revenue(Thrace,Umbria,Upper Egypt)
On the other hand Kleisoura&#39;s do not send any manpower and only 20% of the revenue(Crimea,Tripolitania,Assyria) .
This is due to most Kleisoura&#39;s having to deal with significant threats (Raids , Border wars and Common Famine).
