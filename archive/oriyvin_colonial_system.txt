Futuristic Planet in which Oriyvin species have taken over and created two seperate free nations under constant supervision, but nations make most laws. If the Oriyvins see any thing they don&amp;#39;t like they will make it known, and the nation better change it, or else. These two nations are Iwoyris and Reevun. Oriyvin civilazation is living on a spacecraft in orbit around this planet. The Oriyvins are one government, but are represented by two nationstate accounts; Oriyvin Overlords are how Oriyvins treat Iwoyris and Reevun, while Oriyvin Government represent how they treat they&amp;#39;re own peoples.
