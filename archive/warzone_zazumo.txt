[b]Having assembled their recipe and ingredients, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] set out to bake the fantastic [colour=orange]EGG CAKE[/colour]. They sifted and stirred all through the night, until finally their creation was complete. They tasted it, and it was so good that the Hawks invited a friend from [region]Lily[/region] to deliver it across NationStates!
