Novus Luna is a reigon based on the newly terraformed moon; coinciding with the history of Novus Terra, Novus Luna is a (dys/u)topian future in which the majority of modern-day country regions have been shifted about due to either policy evolution or civil war. We request that you read the Factbook entries of fellow region members and do not post history or geographical boundaries that contradict one another, but other than that this world is up for you to make!
