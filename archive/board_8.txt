[i]Hello and welcome to the Board 8 region. I am Andel on Gamefaqs and hope you will enjoy this region and Nationstates. Tell other Board 8&amp;#39;ers and this region will prosper.

Introduce yourself and join the WA if you like. Endorse all other members of the WA in the region, if its not too much trouble.[/i]

These words were spoken by our late founder, Andel, who perished shortly after founding our wonderful region in an accident involving matches and a lot of baked beans.

My name is [nation]Tenkistan[/nation], your WA Delegate.  I&amp;#39;d like to personally welcome you to Board 8.  Please make yourselves at home, and don&amp;#39;t mind the smell.
