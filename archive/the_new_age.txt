[i]The world had changed. World War 3 and World War 4 had just happened. World War 3 was a disaster. The nuclear war. It started out as a Russia vs. Finland problem, as Russia was looking to expand. Then Europe, North America and Africa came in, as well as most countries from Oceania and South America. Then the nukes came. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! was your daily wake up alarm. Many nations&#39; economy&#39;s crumbled. Then the treaty of Moscow was signed, where the war ended. Nothing happened, as the conflict could arise. The 4th World War were just threats, kind of like the Cold War. Now you come. Revolutions. Invasions. Treaties. The world lies on you.
