The dictatorship of the world is a confederation. If your a dictatorship tired of all the other regions telling you to reform then come to us. 

We are a region committed to keeping the people down and dictators in power. We do not care what kind of dictatorship you are as long as all political freedom is outlawed.

The individual states have more power that the council. With the individual nations law proceeding region law and nations not having to listen to the council.

The regional dictator as the executive is called I the founder will be permanent executive but will accept all advice.

You the council shall vote on all bills and change the content. The dictator may veto bills and accept bills.
