[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[color=red][b]The only slightly-misspelled journey this region is going on (the original Founder&#39;s mistake, not mine), is a journey towards leftism, after it was confiscated from the Fash when it fell out of existence, by [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region]![/b][/color]

--------------------------------------------------

[color=blue]Protected in memory of the [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] concept, whilst also highlighting the failure of then Nazi [nation]Captain Woodhouse[/nation]. His attempt to infiltrate the [region]Antifa[/region] network failed and over 50 regions were handed over to [region]The MT Army[/region].[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
