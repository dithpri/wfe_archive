The State Union of the Nationalist Order is a region founded for those nations who think of themselves highly. We are here to make a union so that we can survive and prosper off each other, and not need to abide by the WA. We still will have a WA delegate, but it does not need to happen, for we, as a region, will not subservient ourselves to oppressors. Our leader is and will be [nation]Shilondon[/nation]. We currently need a WA delegate.
