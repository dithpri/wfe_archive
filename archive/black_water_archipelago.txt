The Black Water Archipelago is a region mainly consisting in several hundreds of little and medium-sized islands on which several nations can establish their capitals and expand. It is big enough to prevent border conflicts, but political clashes are almost inevitable. The sea around the archipelago seems to be extremely deep, thus the name &amp;#39;Black Water&amp;#39;. An inhospitable place, for nations of hard working men and women to settle in.
