Founded in 2004, Europa is among one of the oldest regions within the game. At its height, Europa had over three hundred nations, making it one of the largest roleplay regions on Nationstates, with extremely high quality offsite forums that had dedicated leadership and moderation alongside extremely high quality Modern Tech roleplay. It was also active as a Defender region. But when Nationstates as a whole suffered a massive drop in user population between 2007-2008, Europa was severely hit by mass exoduses and went on life support in 2009, never to truly recover or return to what it had been in the past.

This region now stands as a memorial to what Europa was. Thank you for your time.
