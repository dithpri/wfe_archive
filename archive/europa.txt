[color=darkblue]Welcome to Europa. Established in January 2004, our region is based on the ideals of freedom and democracy. This diverse region is a real mosaic of duchies, republics, kingdoms,.. We are open to all types of governments. We ask that you do not spam our regional message board with recruitment ads, World Assembly, or Security Council issues. Embassies must be requested through our forum.
