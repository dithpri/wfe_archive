A safe haven for trans people, Traa is founded to oppose transphobia and bigotry or hate of any form. Other than that there&#39;s not really much to the region. Have fun, be nice, and don&#39;t be a transphobe, and we&#39;ll get along nicely.

We have multiple officer positions to help with the management of the region. If you feel a responsibility is not being fulfilled by any of the officers, lodge a complaint with the founder [nation]Danhela[/nation].
