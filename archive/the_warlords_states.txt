[b]&quot;Without blood, there is no peace.&quot;[/b]The first korvanira emperor said this. And now I see he is right. Take arms brethren, we gather. For the sake of our people combined, we gather. Please come to your battle brothers aid, and we shall seek our peace within this world! Alone, we are nothing, together! We are legion&#39;s! [b]&quot;Pacifism in your streets can only be created through thorough cleansing of crime, and delinquency!&quot;[/b] Gather now, and we may yet see hope for this world.
