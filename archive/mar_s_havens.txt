Welcome to Mar&#39;s Havens!

This region of the world is very secluded, very private, but very close knit. In our past, we were open with the world, but we became to good in our skills, and we went to war. Broken, and fallen, we put up barriers around ourselves, and the world has forgotten we exist.

As the name implies, we are a safe haven for people who feel broken, who have fallen, and introverts. We hope you feel safe in Mar&#39;s Havens.
