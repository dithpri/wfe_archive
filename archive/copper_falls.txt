[color=#61AC53]Copper Falls is a region based on one major principle: pro-tolerance. We allow anyone to make this region their home, and we are very open-minded. We are also allied with a region called [region=The Temple of Ra], and [region=The Oasis] You can sometimes find us communicating via embassy.

[color=#F5CB11]This region can be a fun place, but remember to respect your superiors, and follow the rules. If you do not comply, you will be punished depending on the rule broken.
