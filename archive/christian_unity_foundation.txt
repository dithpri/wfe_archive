A region for Christians of all backgrounds to come together for the same purpose.

The faith.

As a Lutheran with a background and studied with Anglicanism, Reformed/Presbyterian, Methodist, Orthodox, and Roman Catholic knowledge. There are still some things we all hold in common.

This region is for us to discuss and support our similarities against our differences. Those things that we all believe in become doctrine of our region.

My only requests is to not bully or denounce someone for their faith. Unless it is a heresy that can be referenced in the first 4 ecumenical councils.

&quot;Woke&quot; Christianity is not doctrine.
