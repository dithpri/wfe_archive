Egand, a continent occupied by several former GGMA Nations. After the Cataclysm in July, 2017, the GGFC was officially separated from the GGMA after all radio contact ceased from Northern Nations. In the months since the Nuclear Event, the GGFC has dissolved and fallen as a result of resource famines. After the bombs fell in the north, the north suffered tragic losses at the hands of a nuclear winter. All of the former GGFC nations have spent the following months adapting to such economic disparities. Crops burn, the skies are often dark and Egand has been plagued with growing populations of harmful viruses and creatures.
