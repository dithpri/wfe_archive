[b]Welcome to the Region of Bible Believing Christians![/b]

[u]Verse of the Day: Mark 2:17[/u]

[b]When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.[/b]

- We believe that the Bible is God&#39;s infallible, preserved word.

- We affirm that no man is righteous and so all are in need of salvation, which is the free gift of God, given by the grace of God, and not to be obtained through any merit or works of our own. We affirm that salvation is available only through faith in the shed blood and finished work of our risen LORD and saviour, Jesus Christ.

[b]Have a Blessed Day![/b]
