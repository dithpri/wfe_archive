The Living Word of God

One of the biggest misconceptions about the Bible is that it&#146;s just another book. 

In fact, many Christians treat Scripture as if it&#146;s just a collection of ancient letters and books that inform us about God and religious matters.

While the Bible is certainly a collection of ancient documents, it is also much more than that. It is the very word of God. The Bible is inspired by God, which means He spoke through humans to create these letters and books.

More than that though, God&#146;s Word is living and active. The Holy Spirit uses the Bible to speak to us even today. This is what makes Scripture distinct from any other book.
