[b]Welcome to the Region of Bible Believing Christians![/b]

[u]Verse of the Day:  Isaiah 6:8 

Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &#147;Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?&#148;
And I said, &#147;Here am I. Send me!&#148;

- We affirm that no man is righteous and so all are in need of salvation, which is the free gift of God, given by the grace of God, and not to be obtained through any merit or works of our own. We affirm that salvation is available only through faith in the shed blood and finished work of our risen LORD and saviour, Jesus Christ.

[b]Have a Blessed Day![/b]
