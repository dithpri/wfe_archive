Welcome 
[i]Because of His love for us, God the Father has given us His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross. The blood of Christ reconciles us to God. Because of Him, we are no longer enemies of God.[/i]


[b]In a non-Christian culture, your faith may be challenged. &#147;Do not worry&#148;&#151;the Holy Spirit is with you.
 
He who has the Holy Spirit in his heart and the Scriptures in his hands has all he needs.[/b]
