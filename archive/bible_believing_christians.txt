Depression is no match for the blood of Jesus.

Negative thoughts are no match for the blood of Jesus.

Addiction and bad habits are no match for the blood of Jesus.

The mistakes of my past and my future are no match for the blood of Jesus.

The enemy is no match for the blood of Jesus!

This is our testimony, our story of victory and healing. And it&#146;s for us to receive in Jesus today.
