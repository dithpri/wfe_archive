[i][color=purple]A Prayer Against Anger
Father in heaven, thank You for being slow to anger, even when I am not. Forgive me when I am quick to judge, gossip, and do other things that sadden You. Teach my tongue to speak with love, my ears to hear with compassion, and my heart to respond with grace. In Jesus&#39; name, Amen.[/i][/color]
