[b]Welcome to the Region of Bible Believing Christians![/b]

[u]Verse of the Day: 2 Corinthians 7:10[/u]

[b]For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.[/b]

- We believe that the Bible is God&#39;s infallible, preserved word.

- We affirm that no man is righteous and so all are in need of salvation, which is the free gift of God, given by the grace of God, and not to be obtained through any merit or works of our own. We affirm that salvation is available only through faith in the shed blood and finished work of our risen LORD and saviour, Jesus Christ.

[b]Have a Blessed Day![/b]
