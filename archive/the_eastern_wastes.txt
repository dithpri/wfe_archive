Situated in the Eastern desert Islands this part of the world is mainly what some might call inhospitable but the people of the Eastern Wastes have settled there anyway and have, over the course of history created a rich, cultured, industrialised and economically strong homeland. Because of the conditions, the military forces of this region are tough and are able not only to fight extremely effectively in the blistering heat of the desert but also are more than capable of surviving there out of the safety of the towns and cities and away from the water supplies. However, due to the harsh environments many wars have been and are fought, especially as populations increase, over areas of water supply to ensure the population survives.
