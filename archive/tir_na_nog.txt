Tir Na Nog is an island-continent surrounded by a seemingly unending ocean. Seemingly, because if it were unending, no-one would ever talk about it.
It has all the aspects of a paradise: exquisite scenery, abundant resources, no nasty dragons trying to have you for lunch...
The only down side is the inordinate amount of annual rainfall, well over the average with about  3500 mm per year.
