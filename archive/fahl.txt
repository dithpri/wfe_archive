Welcome to Fahl, the Divided World. The world has never been at peace, kingdoms are at war and the entirety of the world is divided. You king or queen have joined into this Chaos, will you fight to unite the rulers under your crown, or will you remain a passive force? The world is full of Magic, Dragons, and other creatures of medieval times, will you utilize them in your fight, or will they be the downfall of your kingdom? Only time will tell, the future of Fahl is in your hands.
