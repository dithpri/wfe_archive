The nations of The Veil value peace above all else, and will strive to meet any means necessary in order to preserve this peace. Nations of The Veil believe that conformity is necessary in order for society to function. If a singular person gets away with something without proper punishment, others will always follow in his footsteps. Punishment must be fair, strict, and severe. Nations of The Veil must be mindful that competition is the default of man, and this trait should not be rewarded through private industry among the people. We are nations that seek to avoid conflict, and capitalistic economy relies on conflict itself in order to survive.
