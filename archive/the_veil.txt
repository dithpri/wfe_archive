[b]The Veil[/b] is an asteroid belt located in [b][region]The Incipisphere[/region][/b]. It divides [b]The Medium[/b] from [b][region]The Furthest Ring[/region][/b], and separates [b][region]Derse[/region][/b] from [b][region]Prospit[/region][/b] and [b][region]Skaia[/region][/b]. During the final stages of the game [i]Sburb[/i], the Black King will summon asteroids from The Veil to Skaia, causing the asteroids to crash into and destroy it during an event known as [b]The Reckoning[/b].

Some of the asteroids host laboratories and other mysterious facilities that players may access, assuming that they travel to The Veil during their sessions. This may be achieved either by transportalizing directly into one of the facilities, or by more conventional methods such as flight.
