Justice is blind, but our defenses are not! Justus was founded on the idea that we have the right to fight for our freedom and for the good of humanity. We will not attack unless provoked, but in which case we will launch an attack against the aggressors. Our region will form pacts with as many nations as possible. We reserve the right to break pacts due to violation of human rights. We are NationStates&#39; defenders.
