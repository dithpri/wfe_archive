The Concordat of the Pacific is a faction consisting of Authoritarian, Socialist and Communist states however we hold nothing against any other ideology that may choose to join.

The only factions that we exclude from our region are people that are far too extreme with there ideology and those that are Breaking site rules. 


The premier of our Region has the final say in every decision but will consult with the officers first, Polls also may be used.

Our region is currently small and most of our members are still getting the hang of the game, We are not perfect and forgive any errors we may make.

Discord server and Region are currently a work in progress.
