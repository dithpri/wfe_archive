Welcome to Stachelimfleisch! A new roleplaying region spanning from frozen polar wastes to dense tropical forests. Founded by [nation]Greater Mackonia[/nation] out of the ashes of the Land of Power, Stachelimfleisch is seen by many to be a successor to the Land of Power, but is also an independent region in its own right.

Stachelimfleisch is home to nations of greatly contrasting species, cultures, governments and ideologies welcoming talented and aspiring roleplayers of varied beliefs while endorsing none.
