[i][b]ENA, a democratic region, a safe region, a trustworthy region.[/b][/i]
The ENA works around the clock to secure that the Political Freedoms, Civil Rights and Economy are working well in a nation. All ENA nations are advised to have at least [color=lime]Average[/color] scores in Political Freedoms, Civil Rights and the nation&amp;#39;s respective economy, whatever it chooses to be, as this can very much benefit the status of your nation within the ENA. Each week, the ENA will release updates on exchange rates, weekly weather, embassy changes/updates and officer appointment, etc.

[i]Enjoy your stay.[/i]
