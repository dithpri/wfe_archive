[color=darkcyan][b]Welcome to the [/color][color=gray]Elite National Assembly[/color][color=darkcyan] page![/b][/color]
[color=gray][i]Please endorse our delegate, [nation]Thyvor[/nation][/i].
[i][b]ENA, a democratic region, a safe region, a trustworthy region.[/b][/i]
The ENA works around the clock to secure that the Political Freedoms, Civil Rights and Economy are working well in a nation. If a nation is not meeting the set criteria to remain inside the assembly, we will be forced to intervene. All ENA nations must have at least [/color][color=lime]Average[/color][color=gray] scores in Political Freedoms, Civil Rights and the nation&amp;#39;s respective economy, whatever it chooses to be, within a month. Each week, the ENA will release updates on exchange rates, weekly weather, embassy changes/updates and officer appointment, etc.

[i]Enjoy your stay.[/i]
