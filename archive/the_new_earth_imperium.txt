Welcome, one and all, to the NEI. A couple ground rules:

1. This is a public board. No personal information. 
2. If you&amp;#39;re a friend of someone already here, send me a message with your name so I know who you are. This is a social group after all.
3. Do what Anvilonia does on the message board. That is, use diplomacy and official language.
[b]BAD[/b]: LOL UR ECOS A BASKET
[b]GOOD[/b]: Might I respectfully remind the Republic of Whoever that they perhaps should improve their own economic situation before criticising others.

That said, have fun.
