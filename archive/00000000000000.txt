[color=#334161][b]14 protons! This region is Silicon!

Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure free element in nature. It is most widely distributed in dusts, sands, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. Over 90% of the Earth&amp;#39;s crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the earth&amp;#39;s crust (about 28% by mass) after oxygen.[/b][/color]
