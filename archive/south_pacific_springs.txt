Nestled between towering, snow-capped mountains and a churning, opal sea lies the South Pacific Springs, a region shrouded in myth and veiled by perpetual mist. This untamed land defies categorization. Lush, emerald forests teeming with fantastical creatures give way to desolate plains of obsidian sand, haunted by the echoes of a forgotten civilization. The very air vibrates with a subtle magic, a constant hum felt more than heard, that imbues the land with an otherworldly quality.
