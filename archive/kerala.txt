Sublime enforcers of nothing, working towards something. As an elusive people we maintain strict controlled contact with the world around us. Designated by a real lack of foreign embassies both in Kerala and abroad. Mostly solitary we Keralans are determined to do nothing and maintain absolute neutrality in international affairs. Unless, of course, we feel like doing otherwise.

Hello and welcome to the apathetically wondrous region of Kerala. Feel free to do nothing or to do something! If you&amp;#39;re the ambitious type feel free to organize stuff and garner for the WA Delegate position. All actions in this region are voluntary so there&amp;#39;s no pressure.
