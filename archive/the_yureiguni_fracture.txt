The islands of Himurajima, Roslisea, Zeronida, and Erethis emerged from the Pacific Ring of Fire, born of volcanic activity along a submerged fracture zone where tectonic plates converge. Dramatic seamounts, hydrothermal vents, and frequent seismic tremors mark the region. Over millennia, erosion and coral growth shaped Himurajima&#146;s jagged peaks and Roslisea&#146;s ring-like atolls, creating a stark contrast between the four landforms.
