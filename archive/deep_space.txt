[b]In lieu of recent events, I have founded [region]Deep Space II[/region]. Deep Space was never a large or monumental region, we were mostly friends that bummed around together a bit before everyone went inactive leaving only myself out of the original group of people. Due to the fact that The Planar Gate does not seem intent on ever coming back, and the fact that I do not want to go through the hassle of vacating the region and risking having its name swiped, I humbly request that you all simply move to the new region. Thank you.[/b]
