Welcome to the West Jordan Middle School Treaty Organization, a collection of silly geese from West Jordan Middle School. This is a chill organization, but has a few requirements and rules that are as follows:

1. You must be respectful, and appropriate (This applies to your motto and stuff).
2. You must post your identity in the general chat, in at least 2 hours after joining the organization.
3. Do not abuse higher power if you possess it.
4. No spamming (multiple messages in quick succession) Common sense applies.
5. Currently, you can only have a maximum of two (2) Nations at a time.
6. You must (kind of obviously) be a part of WJMS, or be associated with it in some way (lol).
