A Region recently founded, and long forgotten. 
Welcome to the region of blank slates, where you can start from the ground and build a flourishing nation, kingdom, empire, whatever you want. 
All nations start here with a minimum of lore, and work together in roleplay to create a rich story embedded in the region itself.
think &quot;[color=darkgreen]high fantasy mixed in with a little epic fantasy[/color]&quot; and you&#39;ve hit our genre right on the head.
Our style is a mix between Game Of Thrones/ASOIAF and Tolkein/Middle Earth, with more of a lean towards GoT.
so welcome, Travellers, founders and hopefuls, to [B]The Forgotten Continent[/B].
