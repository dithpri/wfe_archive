&quot;High Kekthgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world.&quot;
&amp;#8213;Kekgruuf the Meme Lord

The act of climbing the Nine Thousand Steps holds a spiritual significance for many Kekians due to the belief that Men were created by Kek on this mountain when the sky breathed onto the land. This belief has led to pilgrims from all across Meme-Land traveling to the Throat of the World, and several may be encountered along the mountain path either meditating or studying the etched tablets.
The path leading to High Kekthgar begins in the village of Kekrstead&#151;across the main bridge in the northwest side of town.
