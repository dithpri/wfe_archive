This region is a drifting hulk, aimlessly floating on the currents of time. Although it appears that there are inhabitants a closer analysis will find most of the population is in exodus. They have migrated to other nations and regions. The major push factors causing the migration were cultural. There were perceived ideological difference, power shifting paranoia, and fear of the unknown. This region has no real power, only a janitor that walks the empty halls, still it navigates time and space continually.
