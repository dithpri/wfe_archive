Hemingway&#146;s piece about the old man at the bridge in For Whom the Bell Tolls was an inspiration... The old man is not going to make it across the bridge, or if he does it will be blown up; no one can possibly help him; sooner or later they are going to catch up with him and that will be the end of him. The way Hemingway handles all this&#151;in a page and a half&#151;is pretty amazing.
