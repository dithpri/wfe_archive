[b][color=red]~~ Welcome to the Archipelagic Confederation!!! ~~[/color][/b]

A small cluster of islands with vastly different climates, from freezing mountains to burning hot deserts, and with vastly different cultures, from bustling metropolis to calm forests. All of this in a united confederation of nations governed by a completely democratic elective government. Everyone is tolerated here! Welcome!
