Hello everyone welcome to Novus Auralois. The idea of this region was to have a RP where you can have your own culture, religion, techs and economy. Also in this region the idea is we&#39;ll make our own world(and maybe multiple worlds). We start from the caveman era and we can go as far as you want. So to start RPing just fill out an application get [nation]Cmzt[/nation] to approve it and your done then just post it in your factbook and we&#39;ll know how it will go.Right now we&#39;re in the caveman era. The timeframe is 1 day=1 millennia
