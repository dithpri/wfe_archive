Hello everyone welcome to Novus Auralois. We are running a PMT RP in which humanity conquered the solar system. The current era is 2300 and you can travel interplanetary but it&#39;ll be very slow a couple of months. We DON&#39;T use NS stats just put your economy in your founding post and I&#39;ll check if it&#39;s real. I&#39;ll TG you on changes and implent them but if you don&#39;t you will be voided. You can own lands on both Earth and Mars and have a city state on other bodies.
Time Frame
4 RL days=2 months
