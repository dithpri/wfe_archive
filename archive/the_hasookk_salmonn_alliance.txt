Greetings, my comrades. This is the Great Leader of the glorious nation of Salmonn speaking. My country is a quaint, friendly nation that prides itself on acceptance, love, and peace. Everyone is equal except for your&#39;s truly -- I alone must bear the burden of inequality. But it is a terrible burden that I bear with pride. We revere the mighty and graceful salmon, the most beautiful animal on this green earth. Our census has told us that my citizens are among the happiest in the world. Oh, but, uh, if you come visit this beautiful nation, make sure you drink our famous tap water. It&#39;s considered a delicacy.

I will now turn the microphone over to my esteemed ally and personal bank manager, the leader of the Kingdom of Hassook.
