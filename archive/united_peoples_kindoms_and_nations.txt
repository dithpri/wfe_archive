This is not just a region it is a binding, to a greater tommorow. We are not warmongering savages who blindly kill anything for no-reason however we are not afaid to march to war and face are foes on the feild of battle. We will only ever go to war if a better peace may become of it and we welcome those who respect each other and can learn to not like each other but accept that they exist and hat mass extermination of that race is not the answer. We welcome all as equal and say to you will you join us not just for a better tomorow but the chance to work for it and strive for it today. Of the people. For the people. By the People.
