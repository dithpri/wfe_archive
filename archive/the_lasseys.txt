The Lasseys is a mountain range and a region created for people who like to hike. Since hiking is hard and challenging, it must mean that they really like facing tough situations or to also be said as &quot;creative problem solving&quot;. Which means they probably solved most of their country&#39;s problems and the people that did can also join.
