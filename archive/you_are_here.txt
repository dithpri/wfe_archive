You are here.
Though all are welcome here, one must ask:
Why are you here?
How did you get here?
What will you do here?

For here, you are.


Rules are simple: there are none. Our founder came here, because they manage their own nation, alone. 
There are no forums, there are no controls except the control you have over you own nation. 
Basically, if you&#39;re looking for constant engagement and extensive roleplaying, you won&#39;t find it here.
If you&#39;re looking just to casually play and control your region, you may like it here.

Because, you are here.
Welcome.
