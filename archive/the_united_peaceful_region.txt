-Intro-
This region is a peaceful region, meaning that it does not want to get involved in wars, or start any. We try to be united, because when we&#39;re united, we won&#39;t fall. We&#39;ll also try to solve issues using diplomacy, over war.

-Delegate-
We&#39;d also vote for our delegate, although we&#39;re still working on that. You don&#39;t need to be Democratic to vote, and if you don&#39;t want  to vote you don&#39;t need to. 

-Rules-
As for rules, we&#39;ll update them when we come up with them. You should probably read them every week to check  if we updated them.

-Thanks for reading/joining-
But this place is still a good one to join! This region needs to grow, and hopefully you&#146;ll grow with us!
