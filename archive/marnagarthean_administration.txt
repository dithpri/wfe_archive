After Terra was conquered by the Marnagarthean Commonwealth, native Terrans were trained in Marnargarthea&#39;s humane and enlightened methods of government. Control of the 108 satrapies into which the planet was divided was returned to humans, though foreign policy continued to be under Marnagarthean control. A troika of Marnagarthean colonial specialists monitors the situation on the planet&#39;s surface from this outpost on Luna, and are prepared to intervene should this become necessary. Marnagarthea wishes its latest colony the success, peace and prosperity for which it has so long hungered!
