First of all, our region is an enigma. If you&#39;ve come here from an embassy region, feel free to chat! We&#39;ll downgrade embassy posting privileges if it gets out of hand, so don&#39;t worry about pleasing people in the chat.

We are an open and accepting region who accepts all! The only ones we won&#39;t accept are raiders and their ilk. We&#39;ve dealt with enough of that in the past in The United Pacific States and don&#39;t want it to be repeated on this humble moon of Jupiter, continent of Universalis, city of Pavala, and alternate dimension. We are also accepting of alien regions, alien civilizations, alien whatevers! So long as you don&#39;t bring death and destruction to our humble region.

We hold hands with the Darvincian nations of [region]Grecklandia[/region].
