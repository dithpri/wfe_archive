[spoiler=Old WFE]Darvincia is the one that started it all. New unicornia brought us back from the abyss after Lynting died those many years ago. Lynting carried us through several years when the Darvincian nations were unable to be present. Now Rannbows keeps us alive, into the future and beyond!

We are a Moon of Jupiter, a leading moon of one of its outer moon groups! We are also a continent of over 1 billion people with twenty nations with diverse ideologies, languages, and cultures.[/spoiler]
