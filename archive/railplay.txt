[b]Welcome to [region=Railplay][/b], [i]the Railway/Railroad Roleplay region.[/i]

We are made for train or railway/railroad enthusiasts, but anyone is welcome to join.

[hr]The idea is you are a rail company in the year 1900, and you must start expanding your network so you are the biggest and most profitable company out there! We have not started the roleplay yet, but it&#39;ll begin as soon as we have enough people to get involved.
