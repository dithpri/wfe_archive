A bit odd?  Never fit in?  Ne&#39;er&#39;do&#39;well?  Social outcast?  Troublemaker?  Hated by others?  Blacklisted?

Hello.  In Stigma, you need respect only your fellow stigmatized.  Outsiders, especially the arbiters of public opinion, are worthless at best.

Stigma will never knowingly issue a recruitment telegram to anyone, anywhere: they are useless for finding those who actually belong here.  The only recruitment methods accepted are word of mouth, and unsolicited entry.
