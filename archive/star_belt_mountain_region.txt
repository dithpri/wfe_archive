In a rocky and seemingly barren mountain range near the edge of a cliff, there is a valley. In that valley is a beautiful, Crystalline city that once thrived in beauty. There is a large desert inside this valley as well, full of burning sand and bitter people. The people of this Mountain, the Airktonians, rule the actual Mountain faces, living as a nomadic band of people with one ruler, King Airk, the Lord of the Borderlands of Airkton. Below him, in the valley, is Queen Lelliah, the Chaotic Queen of Petronia, the Crystalline city, and in the desert, The Sultanate of Marutopia dwells. Though they live in relative harmony with each other, they are by no means a welcoming band of people.
