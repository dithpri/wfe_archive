You walk among the peaches, 
Peaceful, happy, you walk through the endless trees
Orange dots a canvas of green,
and the sweet scent penetrates.

You pull down a peach,
Soft, fuzzy, perfectly colored
You can almost taste the flavor, 
feel the syrup run down your face,

You take a taste and the wonder swells,
a peach, perfectly sweet,
lost among rapture,
joy walks freely among the orchard,
and you are lost, as are all,
the virtue of another wonderful day
