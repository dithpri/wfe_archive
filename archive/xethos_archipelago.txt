After hundreds of years of peace, the Xethos Archipelago was ravaged by a terrible civil war. The under-represented Hui nationality revolted against the majority, the people of the Jordan Islands. After multiple bloodbaths, the Hui rebellion finally overthrew the Kingdom, and the region was thrown into chaos. By now, it has stabilized somewhat, with states far too sick of war to continue. The remnants of the archipelago now primarily keep to themselves during the region&#39;s recovery.
