The INSC (International Nuclear Science Committee), is a group of nations who are well versed in the science and mechanics behind nuclear energy and technology. The INSC was established to create regulations for countries arming themselves prematurely (without knowledge of the science behind nuclear energy). As a committee, we aim to keep the world from obliterating itself.
