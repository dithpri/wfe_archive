The Anglican Commonwealth hopes to provide a safe and active region for all Christian nations who wish to call it home. We may currently be very small, but given time we have the aspirations to become a respected union of states with a place on the global stage. In line with the Anglican tradition, the autonomy of [b]every[/b] state [b] will[/b] be respected.
