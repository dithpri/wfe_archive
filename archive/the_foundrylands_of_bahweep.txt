The Foundrylands, or Bahweep, depending on who you ask, pride themselves on being a widely diverse selection of countries from all over, with one thing in common: they would see an uprising of robotic overlords from space as, and I quote, &quot;cool&quot;. 
To each their own, as they wait for their mechanic messiahs. Even if your thoughts differ, as long as you like robots, you&#39;re in. If you think robots are lame, you&#39;ve got a war on your hands. Across the whole of the Foundrylands, there is a universal greeting said at every meeting, and at the start of every party -- oh, and there are parties. If the leader of a country in Bahweep won&#39;t throw a rager, they aren&#39;t a leader at all. Truly, it is a region of embracing stupidity.
