[color=blue]Hear me mortals I am the Fourth Star one of the Four Great Stars I bring joyous news
The Stars beginning with me have begun to move and stir
We wish to create a new order, a new region
Join us the [region]Empire of the Stars[/region]
We will not discriminate nor will we forget anyone 
And even though we are small and new 
Together we can channel the power of the stars and spread our influence
Come join us and be illuminated[/color]
