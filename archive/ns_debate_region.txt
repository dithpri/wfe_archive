Welcome one and all to the NS Debate Region! Here you will have a chance to discuss your views on many topics. Interested in Politics? We discuss that! Interested in Government? We discuss that! Interested in Religion? We discuss that!

This region has very few rules, no one will be kicked out for their political or religious beliefs, but they will be asked to defend them. We do however require that all discussions are polite, and that everyone is respected.
