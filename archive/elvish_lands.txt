Welcome to the Elvish Lands

As a relatively new region, one can only expand on his visions for this region. 

The region seeks to be a democratic region which will act as a unifying force for newer and veteran players as well as seeks to form alliances with smaller regions. 

I hope this region becomes a democratic and inclusive region having monthly elections, two houses which pass legislation, several other institutions such as News network, Court, and so on. 

As of now, the region is small, and So, not exactly democratic... But it will be once it grows and expands. 

As for now...
