&quot;Together, we can rise to hold power.&quot;  Join the empire, and you shall be protected by our magnificent military.  These soldiers are indoctrinated and exclusively loyal to the Western Empire as a whole.  Each member of the Empire will have a say on the council, however, not all members will be equal.  This is a proving grounds, and you have to be worthy of our protection.  We are not aggressive to other nations, but we will be defensive of our ideas and lands.  We believe in a powerful military, advancing humanity through science, and the absolute control of a region.
