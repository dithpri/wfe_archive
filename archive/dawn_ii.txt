[hr][color=darkred]History[/color]: Dawn was founded after an exodus from the Democratic Commonwealth led by Ex Patria, or Emperor [nation]Athean[/nation]. It thrived under a monarchic Conventist system but democratic reforms made it toxic and unstable. The region came under foreign occupation and was merged, and the shell sold to outsiders. The healthy part of the community survived and reunified in the [region]Union of Confederate Regions[/region]. This region shall serve as a memorial and symbol of hope.
