Therius Foederatus is a region on NationStates which aims to build a new theoretic unified peoples called the &quot;Organisations of New Theria&quot;, reimagining common theories in fantasy, astrology and, uhh, furry communities :), and combining it with real world politics and historical contexts, to create a fantastical region of imaginative and creative nations, where any type of nation based on anything is possible.
