&amp;quot;Cronnoth is a region built for me and anyone who I feel that I should have; don&amp;#39;t take what I am saying as degradation, or rather, putting myself above anyone, because I really want this region as particularily developed as possible.  I hope you understand, and if you are actually a member, don&amp;#39;t eff anything up...unless you had to.&amp;quot; -General-Secretary of Donnos Berenuhl Garnsley
