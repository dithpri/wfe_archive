After the great North Argentine War of Independence from the cruel country of Argentina, the people of this new nation thought of the idea of a union of democratic republics who are able to come to a agreement of what their government should be. The North Argentine government approved of this idea thus the Union of Argentine Democratic Republics was born! The UADR hopes to spread the idea of democracy through out the world and further and to further help make decisions to world powers to vote! UADR will rise!
