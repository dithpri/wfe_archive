[b]Attention Mount Nittany! We are moving our region to the new region of &quot;The Templar&quot;[/b]

This move is to promote activity in a new region focused on roleplay politics and Raiding/defending. We will have an executive founder for defence purposes, but all other members will be able to freely elect a WA Delegate and create any regional laws they wish. I hope to see you all there, and have a great summer.
