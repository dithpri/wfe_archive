LEVANTINE ROUM is a generic term used for the ethnocultural minority of former Greek-speaking Christians living in the Levant and their descendants. 

ROUM derives from the Greek [i]Romioi[/i] (Byzantines). The Arabs naturally called them [i]R&ucirc;m[/i], which literally means &#147;Eastern Romans&#148; or &#147;Asian Greeks&quot;&quot;.
