[b]The Smokin&#39; Bear-Hawks decided to welcome back Corporal [nation]Fysladia[/nation] by raiding some regions at update. Despite an initial hiccup it was like he never left, and he even managed to give General [nation]Jakker[/nation] a run for his money! Private First Class [nation]Antoine Jomini[/nation] &amp; [nation]Dyanderna[/nation] did well on their very first raid after completing training and made Sergeant [nation]Ursidae[/nation] (trigger) a very proud bear-boi.
