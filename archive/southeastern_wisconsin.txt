Things will resume to normality by Saturday.

WA Delegate elections are being held now to get the security aspects of our region settled. The candidates for Delegate are Austrombolia and Mein Kampf Gerfas (Zaldania has been banned from elections until April), and voting will take place on a poll below. Other elections will be delayed until the 2nd for repairs.

In addition to this, three new government positions will be added to our government: Recruitment Officer, Chief of Police, and Head of the Threat Detection Department.
