Founded recently, the Freelance Nations of Hamen is a region that is, as of this writing, new and minuscule. The founder of this region is Prime Minister Geiss Chutret, Prime Minister of the Republic of Hamen. The language most spoken is German, though there are some French and English-speaking residents of the region. We welcome new nations with open arms, no matter how big or small, benign or aggressive (though we prefer benign).

The Republic of Hamen website is soon to be up and running.
