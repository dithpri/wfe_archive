[b]Today, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to play some minecraft!

They all got together on a server and started building up their civilization fueled by rc cola and probably some other soda&#146;s. Unfortunately when the hawks began to set up farming one of them decided to embrace factory farming naturally leading to many protests
