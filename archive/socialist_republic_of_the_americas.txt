The revolution is over, and the Marxist-Leninist communist party has united the many nations of the Americas. Borders have been erased and all of one united Socialist nation, on the path to communism and the final victory of the working class. The enemies of the working class and the revolution have been defeated and any remainders have either joined the communists, been sent to the gulags, fled to capitalist nations across the oceans, or been executed. The people&#39;s army is massive, well equipped and ready to defend their freedom from those who wish to return and bring about another oppressive, capitalist regime.
