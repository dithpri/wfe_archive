Silent is a region that was made for laid back players who mostly intend to answer issues and possibly participate in occasional events. All types of nations are welcomed and may suggest ideas to improve the region.

[i]Presently there is no WA delegate nor any other administration but this will be developed when there are sufficient nations in the region. Those interested in this may suggest their names in the RMB.[/i]
