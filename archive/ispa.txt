The InterStellar-Planetary Authority is a region with a history of self governance that initially achieved space flight through magic-like energy and spatial manipulation. Many generations ago the independent alliance was conquered by the mandate, an autocratic, martial empire. Most planets in the ISPA now suffer from high levels of poverty with significant class divides, with the very rich, those in favor with mandate officials able to get away with nearly everything and the poor able to get away with little, if the officials catch them.
