[b]I sometimes fear that people might think that fascism arrives in fancy dress worn by grotesques and monsters as played out in endless re-runs of the Nazis. Fascism arrives as your friend. It will restore your honour, make you feel proud, protect your house, give you a job, clean up the neighbourhood, remind you of how great you once were, clear out the venal and the corrupt, remove anything you feel is unlike you...It doesn&amp;#39;t walk in saying, &amp;quot;Our programme means militias, mass imprisonments, transportations, war and persecution.&amp;quot;[/b]

Welcome to Grande Unione Fascista.
