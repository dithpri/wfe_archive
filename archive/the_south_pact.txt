Far beyond the familiar trade routes and imperial maps lies South Pact, a vast southern region often mistaken for a continent due to its sheer size and cultural weight. But South Pact is not merely a landmass, it is a covenant.

The surrounding southern territories; fractured kingdoms, wandering maritime republics, desert caravans, volcanic clans had long been isolated by geography and suspicion. The Sunken Lands sent envoys not with armies, but with engineers and tidal scholars. They shared knowledge of floating architecture, seismic stabilizers, and coral farming. They taught nations how to build with disaster rather than against it.
