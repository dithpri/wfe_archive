The Imperial Russian Empire was a state that existed from 1721 until overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917.[3] One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. It played a major role in 1812&#150;14 in defeating Napoleon&#39;s ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. It was often in conflict with the Ottoman Empire (which in turn was usually protected by the British).
