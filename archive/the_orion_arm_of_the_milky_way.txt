 The Orion Arm of the Milky Way (TOAOTMW) is the home of 
The Great and Bountiful Galactic Empire (TGABGE) 
and It&amp;#39;s Colonies, which are under direct authority of TGABGE.
As of now, no nations may enter TOAOTMW as
we are perfecting the art of being self-sustainable and not
having any connections with the outside world. 
Any Colonies going against TGABGE&amp;#39;s orders will be ejected
and banned from TOAOTMW and left fo fend for
themselves. All Nations and Colonies in TOAOTMW may post
official and public information and communications,
which will only be acknowledged if necessary and/or ordered.
