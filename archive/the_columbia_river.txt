The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river rises in the Rocky Mountains, flows northwest and then south across the 49th parallel, then turns west before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is 1,243 miles (2,000 km) long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France.
