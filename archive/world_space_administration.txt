[color=red]Welcome to the WSA. [/color]

We&#39;re a bunch of people who like space and everything in between. We enjoy a good chat every now and then, so feel free to join the discussions on the RMB. We hold by the principles of critical thinking and freedom of speech, and encourage an attitude of reasoning without presumptions. 

[hr][Nation]Canzer[/nation] is our Delegate, and [Nation]Horrolumangu[/nation] is the Vice-Delegate. [color=blue]Please endorse them both! [/color]Any questions about the region or suggestions to improve it can be directed at either of the two mentioned above, either through TG or via means of telepathy (your choice).[hr]
