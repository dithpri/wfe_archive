 - The Empire of Cerradium is the official initiator of the philosophy of Totalitarian Democracy. 
 - All States living under the courtship of the Empire are, to a federal level, influenced by the Cerradian Senate and effectively Emperor James the 1st. 
 - All nations who agree to become one with the Empires borders will effectively become a state of the Empire, their federal government being recognised as a state government, each with a                               representative in the Cerradian Senate. 
 - Each state will be subject to annual taxes and be adherents of Cerradian Law and will reap the benefits associated with Cerradian citizenship. 
 - Each aspect of a new states being will be assimilated into Cerradian society and culture.
