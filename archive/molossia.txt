The Republic of Molossia, also known as Molossia, is a microregion claiming sovereignty over 1.28 acres of land near Dayton, Nevada. It was founded by Kevin Baugh (born July 30, 1962). The Republic of Molossia has claimed itself a nation, but it is not recognized as a country by any recognized national government nor by the United Nations. On April 16, 2016, Baugh hosted a tour of Molossia, sponsored by the website Atlas Obscura. Kevin Baugh continues to pay property taxes on the land to Storey County (the recognized local government), although he calls it &quot;foreign aid&quot;. Kevin Baugh has stated, &quot;We all want to think we have our own country, but you know the U.S. is a lot bigger&quot;.
