Absalom&#39;s great wealth is driven by trade, so the city&#39;s rulers strive to craft policies favorable to commerce (and their own interests), but otherwise take a relatively laissez-faire approach to regulation. Much of the day-to-day administration are handled by the Nations of Absalom.

One interesting fact about Absalom is its military. The military is built in such a way that there is no one nation controlling them. The entire Region controls them. Generally, Absalom is a peaceful region who do not seek to conquer.
