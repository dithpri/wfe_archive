[region]Terrafirma[/region] is considered the only safe haven for enslaved robots. Visible from Earth, the artificial planet was originally designed to only be able to support non-organic life. However, in an attempt to open relations with the nations of Earth, the top engineers from [nation]the Roguelands[/nation] created an oxygen generator as well as implementing a gravity generator in an attempt to prevent lighter lifeforms, such as humans, from floating off into the vast void of space. All nations on [region]Terrafirma[/region] are co-dependent, as the varying ecosystems of this now Earth-like planet require the combined efforts of multiple nations in order to exist peacefully and prosperously. [region] Terrafirma [/region] is the future of human-robot relations.
