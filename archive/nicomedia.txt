It was founded in 712&#150;711 BC as a Megarian colony and was originally known as Astacus (/&amp;#712;&aelig;st&amp;#601;k&amp;#601;s/; Ancient Greek: &amp;#7944;&amp;#963;&amp;#964;&amp;#945;&amp;#954;&amp;#972;&amp;#962;, &#39;lobster&#39;).[2] After being destroyed by Lysimachus,[3] it was rebuilt by Nicomedes I of Bithynia in 264 BC under the name of Nicomedia, and has ever since been one of the most important cities in northwestern Asia Minor. The great military commander Hannibal Barca came to Nicomedia in his final years and committed suicide in nearby Libyssa (Diliskelesi, Gebze). The historian Arrian was born there.
