The now contested lands of Littopia. The Republic of Littopia was originally in control of the region, but has recently been outnumbered by newly rising nations outside it&amp;#39;s borders. Within it&amp;#39;s borders, a civil war against somebody from somewhere rages. We don&amp;#39;t know who they are yet, but we&amp;#39;re pretty sure they&amp;#39;re communist. 

Kipptechian citizens are allowed, but screened for communistic ideas before being allowed free roam of the country.
