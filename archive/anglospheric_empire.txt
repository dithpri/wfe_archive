We are the Anglospheric Empire. We stand for the encompassing values of the current Anglospheric nations such as New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Freedom, liberty, prosperity, safety and security, personal responsibility and capitalism are just some of the values we stand &#150; and fight for, every day. Other goals of the empire include preserving and advancing the European and Anglospheric culture, heritage, history, culture, customs, traditions and racial makeup.
