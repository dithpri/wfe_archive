Welcome to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela founded in 1999. All those who support Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution made by the popular classes of Venezuela are welcome. The wealthy bourgeoisie and anyone else who opposes the Bolivarian revolution shall be viewed with distrust and suspicion. We welcome constructive criticism of the government. Fascists who spread disinformation, misinformation, and who promote hatred and violence against the government shall be expelled.
