We resolve to do the right thing, to defend freedom and blaze a trail into the new frontier. 

&amp;quot;We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;Man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative adventures. Divided there is little we can do&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger&amp;quot;

So, &amp;quot;ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.&amp;quot;   John F. Kennedy, quotes from his inaugural address.
