[b][color=#0080FF]We resolve to do the right thing, to defend freedom and blaze a trail into the new frontier.

&quot;We choose to go to the  moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard&quot;

&quot;Man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life&quot;

&quot;If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich&quot;

&quot;United there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative adventures. Divided there is little we can do&quot;

&quot;In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger&quot;

So, &quot;ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.&quot; John F. Kennedy, quotes from his inaugural address.[/color][/b]
