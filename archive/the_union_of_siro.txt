
Welcome!, The Union of Siro (US) is a political community of law created to welcome the integration of participating nations. With it comes into force the Treaty of Siro (TS) and the Free Trade Agreement in Siro (TLCS). With this, support is promoted through common policies that cover different spheres of action, in their origin essentially economic and progressively extended to undoubtedly political areas.
We also have other Governing bodies with different functions and attributions, such as the &quot;Economic and Social Committee&quot;.
