The Mojave stands contested between the mightiest of nations seen since the horrific plight of nuclear fire. Caesar&amp;#39;s Legion stands strong and proud, the New California Republic at the ready, House scheming and sleuthing, and all the while the smaller factions just trying to stay alive. It is a dark and challenging time, full of war and fire and death. Throughout it all, New Vegas is still alive, and the Mojave is free.
