Through a majority vote, it has been decided that a regional government will be established in order to maintain peace amongst our governments. Currently we require several positions to be filled, as well as assistance in shaping what will become our governing body. If you want to fill a particular position, please state so within the Regional Board. Any votes must be sent to myself to be calculated. Please suggest any additional roles in the board.
