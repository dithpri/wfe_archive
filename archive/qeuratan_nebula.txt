Recently, [nation]Hofe[/nation] has proposed the institution of a dedicated government ruled by all of the empires within the Qeuratan Nebula (( establishment of a regional government ))
We need to know your thoughts and opinions of this. If you agree with this idea, please state below in the regional board or send a message to either myself or [nation]Hofe[/nation]. If the majority of you decide to go with it, we will begin production immediately.
