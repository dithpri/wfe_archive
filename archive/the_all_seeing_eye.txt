- All Countries in this region must swear eternal loyalty to the Central Fatherland, which includes the glorious nations of Khazikstania and ButtRapingSendLand, over which I had no control of naming, who rule together to represent how our peoples live.
- We have the sole authority to make any decisions We see fit to make and the right to overturn those we do not see fit to be made.
- Civil rights are not an issue for us because We always know the right decision that will make our people thrive and their lives easier. This leaves our citizens to enjoy a leisurely life of supporting the Fatherland without worrying about matters that are above the average comprehension.
- For a simple and luxurious life, join with us. But never betray us.
