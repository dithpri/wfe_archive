[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

Another region of the dead ally [region]IMPERIAL EARTH[/region] that I decided to save from the clutches of evil. We will not be having any Olympic Games hosted by the [region]MT Army[/region], [region]The Red Fleet[/region], or any other red menace. The J o Jian Olympics consists of refound aerobics, incognito raiding cardio tests, and a 1 mile dash of enraging 50% of the NationStates playerbase. Enjoy!
