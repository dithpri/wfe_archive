Hey, Roman Douchebags.

The Roman Empire[color=red][b] DIED [/b][/color] several centuries ago, get your heads out your asses long enough to see this is a dead region anyway, you [color=red]imbeciles[/color]. Can&#39;t believe you wasted resources taking this. Here have this picture of fine cuisine to shove down your accomplished feeling throats. Like Ajit Pai&#39;s fat one in a few days.

Keep it up and [i]maybe[/i] you&#39;ll have something to look forward to in your [b]real[/b] lives, losers.
