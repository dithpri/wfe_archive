Hello and welcome to the UCFS, we hope you enjoy taking part in our young region. 

This region is focused on the roleplay aspect of NS, I have created a region map and a discord (which the map is on) in order to do this. Government and other representatives will be chosen when we grow to 12 nations - 3 positions are available initially.
We can do any kind of diplomacy within these RPs, wars, alliances you name it, within this region all passionate world-builders are welcome!

Again, welcome to the brotherhood,

ND
