A barren landscape, the founding place of Tiplomecja. Join if you like but don&#39;t expect much. It should be a nice, peaceful region to develop your country, with no organization or overarching authority. The nation of Tiplomecja itself has absolute power, but I&#39;m not interested in playing dictator over others.

I guess I&#39;ll accept any embassy offers that come through, it&#39;s pretty lonely around here.
