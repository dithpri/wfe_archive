[i]Senatus Populusque Romanus[/i]

For over three thousand years, the Demi-God Praetors [b]Romulus[/b] and [b]Remus[/b] have ruled over the Galactic Empire of New Rome, a paradise of the ancient ways supplemented by advanced technology, all made in the image of their Ancient Roman architecture. They act as benevolent leaders, whose word is taken as direct orders from their Pantheon.

Their many Gods have blessed their culture with many gifts, such as the Jupiter Fusion-Cores, the Vulcan Alloy Forges, and the Minerva Combatant AI systems. With these blessings, they have conquered hundreds of worlds and dozens of systems, all ruled with the same fairness that the Praetorship entails.
