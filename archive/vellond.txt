Vellond is a dark elf populated region. However, for the first time in the region&amp;#39;s history, it is ruled by half- vampires. They are led by King Valdemar, the stronger vampire. Vellond is a growing super power in Bersia. Vellond is near Hexter, and may seek to annex it and it&amp;#39;s orc- ogre tribes.
