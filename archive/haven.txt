[b]Welcome to Haven[/b]

After many years of inactivity, our region is back. Telegram the delegate or post on the forum for applications or for general discussion. We&amp;#39;ll shortly have a map.

Haven is a map-based, roleplaying, founderless &amp;amp; democratic region that wants active and enthusiastic MT roleplayers, whether you&amp;#39;re really new or antiquity. We&amp;#39;ll take any friendly player with literacy skills. We&amp;#39;re especially looking for new blood.
