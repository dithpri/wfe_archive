Haven is an ancient map-based, roleplaying, founderless &amp;amp; democratic region ready to accept you whether you&amp;#39;re new or from antiquity. We RP in the MT and PMT time frames both on forum and off and welcome new players to interact with. 

Telegram the delegate or post on the RMB for applications or for general discussion, directions to the active WA, support and moderation threads or join us on IRC. 

[i][color=#FF0000][b]Applications for region entry are closed at the present time to non known Havenites due to siege conditions, we are still more than happy to RP with you on forum.[/b][/color][/i]
