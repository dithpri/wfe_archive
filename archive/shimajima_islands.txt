Welcome to the Shimajima Islands!

Formerly known as Bob&amp;#39;s Region, the nation&amp;#39;s of [nation]Miento[/nation] and [nation]Lnull[/nation] have decided to name it something a little less gay. Thus the name Shimajima Islands was cared in to mess with tourists. 

Recently, we have moved into the world of tomorrow, now known as the world of today! New advances are bringing our little region into the depths of space! And Please, don&amp;#39;t piss off [nation]Miento[/nation] they will obliterate you.
