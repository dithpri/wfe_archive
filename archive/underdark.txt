The Underdark was born from the dictatorial defection of nations from New Midgar. It is here in the Underdark that these iron-fisted rulers can continue to rule as they please, without meddling or attempts of liberation from the nations that look down on their empires and attempt to overthrow the supreme leaders of these nations. It has been established with a meeting of the rulers in the military city of Bloodlake with Mortica Omerta, that any attempts of liberation of any of the nations within will be met with a full, unified military response. Win or lose, leaders of the nations within the Underdark will do whatever it takes to keep their power in place.
