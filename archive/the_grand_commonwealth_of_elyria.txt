The Grand commonwealth Of Elyria is a collection of allied nations seeking to break from tradition and ally for the sake of protection and feeling like you belong in a place, the commonwealth is open to everyone but primarily other commonwealths and does not support the East Pacifics views but does support collaboration. The Commonwealth was formed as a place of political freedom from haters of fascism and socialism.
