[b]Welcome to the Arab League[/b]

The Arab League is a congregation of Arab Nations, serving as a superstate to coordinate the affairs of its member countries, promote democracy, equality and foster international cooperation. The Arab League seeks to bring together both Arab and non-Arab nations, so that they may govern themselves under a strong and united federal government.
