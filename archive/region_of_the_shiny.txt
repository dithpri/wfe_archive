This region is dedicated to comedic education on aspects of various political systems. 

Nations are encouraged to utilize the message board or telegrams for communication but recognize that 3rd party platforms are used. (see Google Hangouts)

The region has an ad-hoc government represented at the World Assembly by members and our Delegate. Anyone can join the world assembly but must comply by its rules upon doing so which supersede those of your individual nation and of our region as a whole. So consider the benefits and your style of play before joining. 

Our founder and WA Delegate have authority over the region. 

Initiatives, Proposals, Suggestions, Propositions  and Petitions can be made via the Message Board. 

Game on.
