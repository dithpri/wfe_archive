A region headed by The Grad Duchy of Prussic States that allows nations to control themselves as they please, but it always keeps a watchful eye for ANY and all threats both internal and external and responds with extreme prejudice. It also has a reputation for allowing human testing on prisoners and enemies of the state. However nations that join can have different laws regarding this and most of its laws are optional for joining nations.
