South Detroit was once a bustling, industrious region that took great pride in manufacturing automobiles of the highest calibre and excellence in America. Unfortunately, things have taken a turn for the worst in recent memory. The region&#39;s quality of life has deteriorated dramatically - comparable with Sierra Leone and Haiti. Corruption, murder, drugs, rape, unemployment, and AIDS run rampant among the populace.

The people are poor and downtrodden and visitors to this region will find nothing but villainy and misery - the perfect conditions for harbouring large, tax-dodging corporations.
