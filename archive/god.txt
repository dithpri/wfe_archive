[b]Hear: 

The Lord our God is ONE Lord. 
Baruch ata Adonai, Eloheynu melech ha-olam. 
Adoration to the Highest Self. Hari, Om! 
Allahu akbar!


May this be a region of Peace and Prosperity! 


God welcomes all whatever their beliefs, but we are believers in respect: for the great traditions and for each other.[/b]
