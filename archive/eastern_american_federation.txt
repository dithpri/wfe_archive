A democratic region founded on the principles of intellectual debate and equality. Elections are held weekly via a poll at 9am PST on Saturday. Whoever gets the most votes wins. A regional message is sent out to everyone to endorse them so our delegate has as much power as possible. If you fail to endorse the delegate within a few days, you will be punished. The punishment for noncompliance is a kick and repeated offenses will result in a semipermanent ban. If you continue, it might become permanent. Any and all debates are welcome on the RMB.
