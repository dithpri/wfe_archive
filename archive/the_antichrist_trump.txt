[color=red][b]EX-President Antichrist has been defeated, yet he continues his pernicious campaign of lies. He is a continuous danger.

This story may not be over. This region will stand as a warning about that man and his character, whether he still proves to be THE Antichrist, or just [i]an[/i] antichrist. It is a shocking indictment of peoples&#39; character that 70 million+ supported a person who contradicts Jesus Christ in [u]every way[/u].[/color]

Whatever happens, know these truths still: [u]God does not live in his heart[/u], and:[/b]

[b]&quot;Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.&quot; - St. Matthew 24:42[/b]
