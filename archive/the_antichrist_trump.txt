[color=red][b]President Antichrist has been vanquished at the polls. I praise God for that. However, this does [u]not[/u] preclude him from running again in 2024; this story may not be over, yet. This region will stand as a testimony and warning about that man and his character, whether he still proves to be THE Antichrist, or just [i]an[/i] antichrist. It is a shocking indictment of peoples&#39; character that 70 million+ still supported a person who contradicts the traits of Jesus Christ in every way.[/color]

[u]Whatever happens, know these truths still: God does not live in his heart[/u], and:[/b]

[b]&quot;Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.&quot; - St. Matthew 24:42[/b]
