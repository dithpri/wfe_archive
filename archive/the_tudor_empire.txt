[b]WE HAVE RE-ESTABLISHED THE HOMELAND ~ PREPARE TO LEAVE THIS REGION![/b][hr]This region is being replaced by [b]&amp;quot;The [color=darkred]Tudor[/color] Empire of [region]The Walbard Union[/region]&amp;quot;.[/b]

Since 2006, The Walbard Union has risen and fallen, carrying countless veterans and newcomers with it.

The time has come for [b]Tudor Imperialism[/b] to merge with [b]Walbardian Democracy[/b].

All members are invited to join us in [b][region]The Walbard Union[/region][/b] for the grand restoration!

Otherwise, this region is [b]closed for business[/b] ~ unless you are a current member.[hr][b]Many thanks to our Members and our NS Partners.[/b]
