In Greek mythology, [b]The Underworld[/b] was the domain of the Greek god Hades, and the realm, as well as the concept of the Afterlife, would often appear in stories, acting as a guide to how people should live their lives.

It is common to think of the Greek Underworld as simply a version of the Christian hell. Indeed, the term Hades has been used as a polite synonym for hell. The Greek Underworld encompassed the whole Afterlife, containing both heaven and hell, where the righteous could be lavished upon, and the unworthy punished. &#151;[url=http://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/the-underworld.html][color=996600]Greek Legends and Myths[/color][/url][hr]
