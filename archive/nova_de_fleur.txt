Nova de Fleur, a region based in an all season climate where anyone can come in and join! WE accept those who are new, been here for a long time or even here since the start, there are no limits as to how old your Nation is! IN fact, this Region is on;ly as old as the Nation that founded it, so it could be a while! I can basically say that when I was naming the region, I was thinking of a Fleur de Saints or some other stuff, and that I wanted something a little Latin in there. Hope you enjoy your stay here in Nova de Fleur! Enjoy the all season weather and all the fun that we have annually!
