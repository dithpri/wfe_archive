Your service, our performance. Welcome to the Uniform Armed Services.
[hr]Since the establishment of Laiveli in the 1900s, the majority of civilians agreed upon uniformed armed services to serve and protect Laiveli. The people of Laiveli have seen bloody battles since the 1800s, as they fought for freedom against the Spanish. The Spanish-American War rekindled the fire for freedom, and thus the people of Laiveli insurged.
