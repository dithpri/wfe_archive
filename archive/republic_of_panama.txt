[color=0080BF]Panama, officially the Republic of Panama, is the southernmost country of Central America and the whole of North America. 

Situated on the isthmus connecting North and South America, it is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The capital is Panama City.

With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the Panama Canal to be built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914.  Time passed.  Two generations came and went. Then along came Manuel Noriega. *sigh*[/color]
