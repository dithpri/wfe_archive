Doctor, oh doctor we heard what you said. You spoke out with wisdom Your message was spread. You told the tales that we often retell. You spoke the words That reminded us well. Free, free at last. Oh, free free at last. Thank God Almighty. We are free, free at last. Doctor, oh doctor You marched and you led. You spoke out with courage The words yet unsaid. You had a dream That our freedom would ring. You had a dream. We would join Hands and sing. Free, free at last. Oh, free, free at last. Thank God Almighty. We are free, free at last. Oh, free, free at last. Thank God Almighty. We are free. free at last. Thank God, Almighty. We are free. Free at last.
