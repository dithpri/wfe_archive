The Association of Free Humanity (AFH) is an international federation of anarchist and other libertarian socialist polities. We oppose all forms of exploitation and oppression, and stand united against counter-revolutionary forces which seek to re-impose capitalism and the state on those who have already tasted freedom, as well as in active solidarity with those still struggling for freedom.

&amp;quot;[i]I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. The freedom of others, far from negating or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation.[/i]&amp;quot;
