The Port Royal Society is a group of European monarchs who seek to liberate the world from the evils of capitalism and democracy, and bring back the reign of monarchs across Europe in an effort to rebuild the world and end the terrors of political correctness and terrorism. As an official union of countries, their major headquarters are located on 2 remote islands in the Mediterranean sea, on the privately owned island of Port Royal, where their Winter Headquarters are located, while in the Baltic sea, the island of Port Borealis serves as their Summer Headquarters, with individual headquarters located within members&#39; countries. Our goal is to end the globalization of capitalism, and help promote the globalization of monarchies.
