[color=#808080][b]A flat, two-dimensional, world where already has been, and will always be, forever.[/b][/color]

&#39;&#39;&amp;gt;[i]There is no breeze here. No birds singing. No motors revving in the distance, and no human voice to break the unnatural quiet. The air has no smell, no taste. It&#39;s utterly neutral. No, worse - canned. Your footfalls are pallid, somehow. Strengthless. Your beer is flat.[/i]&#39;&#39;

[color=#7B68EE]Welcome[/color] [color=#9370DB]to[/color] [color=#BA55D3][b][i]Yesterday[/i][/b][/color]. 

[color=#CD5C5C][b]Feel free to brood on the past as long as you like. Just be sure to leave before tomorrow....and watch for Langoliers.[/b][/color]
