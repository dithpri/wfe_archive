Consider Anarchy, consider freedom, consider chaos, consider peace. Consider being a Ausgestosene where you could live in tranquility, or take it from others. The term &quot;anything is possible&quot; is in fact true in a land with no rules. Whether you have been respected or shunned, accepted or exiled, a norm or an outcast, none of that matters when you have power. No one is watching over, you can do whatever you want, meaning if your the type to just expect a place where your welcome with opens arms, everyone respects one one another and there is constant support for every little thing and every and so nice to you, call a damn helpline. What do I have that other regions don&#39;t have? Not much. But I am being as honest as possible.
