Welcome to The North Alliance,

All sovereign nations are welcome here regardless of population or politics.
This is a neutral region, free from any political pressure.



The ONLY Regional Rule:
_______________________

 Only one nation residence per person. Duplicate nations will be ejected.
 This is to preserve the founder&#39;s sanity.


Regional Policies:
__________________

1). Outrageous or halfbaked posts to the regional message board will be suppressed.
2). No WA Delegate will ever be granted administrative power, so don&#39;t even ask.
3). Embassy proposals without stating why we should agree to them will be ignored.
4). Password not required for residency, move in &amp; out as you wish.

 (Policy suggestions via telegram are welcome anytime.)
