Welcome, stranger! [B]Peta Kozarska Brigada[/B] is a friendly, open-to-all PMT+mild FanT roleplaying group based around a completely fictional and original world with both the usual international politics of today&#39;s world and the troubles of those many name &#39;the paranormal&#39; who regularly spark greater political ripples than their own abnormality may suggest. If you want to join us, just TG the founder your nation concept and your map claim, and after a revision or two (quite unlikely), you&#39;ll get to join our madness!
