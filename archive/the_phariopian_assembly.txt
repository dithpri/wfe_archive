1/10/14 - King Pharius addresses the delegates of the Phariopian Assembly for the first time:

&amp;quot;Honoured Sultans, Great Kings, Holy Men, Republicans great and small, I welcome you to the Phariopian Assembly. We form the basis of Phariopian customs, religion and civilization. We are the sword that defends the freedom of all Phariopian men, women and children in times of darkness. I am humbled by your entrance to our great cause, and I swear my by dynasty that I shall uphold the rights of all members of our Assembled. Today a new era begins, an era of Phariopian supremacy!&amp;quot;

The speech is met by agreements all around the table, with many raising a glass and some even dropping to one knee before the King.
