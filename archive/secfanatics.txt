I think the previous WFE does a good job at telling its history:
[Spoiler=Old WFE]
SECFanatics was a region created for users of the SEC sports forum, but was later expanded to allow non-users to join the region.

SECFanatics started building embassies in other regions so the residents of those regions could participate in SEC sports discussions without needing to relocate.

They ended up getting into an embassy competition with The Embassy, and almost broke the world record for most embassies.

SECFanatics was later raided and destroyed by The Black Hawks after their founder, Rbbf, ceased to exist.
