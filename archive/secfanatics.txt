The land of [Region]SECFanatics[/Region] was originally founded by the mighty nation of 	[Nation]Boxvicland[/Nation] on 24 August 2016, with original constituent nations of [Nation]Boxvicland[/Nation], [Nation]Chomping Gators[/Nation], [Nation]Dare You to Come and Take It[/Nation], [Nation]DawgInDallas[/Nation], [Nation]Kashmirian Zeppels[/Nation], [Nation]Resinante[/Nation], [Nation]Texasfight[/Nation], and last but not least, [Nation]RBBF[/Nation]. However, the great Region ceased to exist. 

The SECFanatics Region was recreated by RBBF on 6 April 2017. Despite the past devastation, and abandonment of the region by the previous nations, the return of people is bringing a new hope and exuberance. As stated at the re-founding of SECFanatics by RBBF&#39;s Leader: &quot;Onward ever, backward never, in ourselves our future lies!&quot;
