The land of SECFanatics was originally founded by the mighty nation of 	Boxvicland, with original constituent nations of Boxvicland, 	Chomping Gators, Dare You to Come and Take It, DawgInDallas, Kashmirian Zeppels, Resinante, Texasfight, and last but not least, RBBF. However, the great Region ceased to exist. 

The SECFanatics Region was recreated by RBBF. Despite the past devastation, and abandonment of the region by the previous nations, the return of people is bringing a new hope and exuberance. As stated at the re-founding of SECFanatics by RBBF&#39;s Leader: &quot;Onward ever, backward never, in ourselves our future lies!&quot;
