To the wary wanderer: We have but one cause, to protect the environment. Will you join us?
We beg you to join in our never ceasing lament:


Indeed I cannot think
why my spirit does not darken
When I ponder on the whole
life of men throughout the world.
How they suddenly
left the floor, the proud thanes.
So this middle-earth, a bit each day,
droops and decays -
Therefore man 
cannot call himself wise, before he has
a share of years in the world.
A wise man must be patient. He must never be too impulsive
nor too hasty of speech, nor too weak a warrior, nor too reckless,
nor too greedy for goods, nor ever too eager for boasts,
before he sees clearly.
If you see the world as we do. Then you are implored to join our region and fight for the Eternal Blue Sky!
