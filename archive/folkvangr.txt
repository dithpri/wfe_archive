[b]Important:[/b] This is not a standard NS region, many members of the group reside in other regions. This region exists to coordinate links and other things. In addition all the nations on the map are locked into the lore. Should you join and write lore for one nation this lore stays should you leave.

We hope to welcome you!

Any questions can be sent to Sjealand on NS or The Great Dane#7431 on discord
