In Norse mythology, F&oacute;lkvangr (Old Norse &amp;quot;field of the host&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;people-field&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;army-field&amp;quot;) is a meadow or field ruled over by the goddess Freyja where half of those that die in combat go upon death, while the other half go to the god Odin in Valhalla.
