The Valleys are a huge mountain chain spread along the centre of the Chukala continent with rainforests,jungles and deserts dotted alongside and within the oppresive mountains which gives way to a natural protection for the nations that exist within the rocky walls of The Valley.

Inside The Valley any nation,empire or kingdom is respected as an equal by the others and through many unions and alliances an attack on The Region overules any internal wars as its a war on all of us inside The Valley.

However our forgien policies are not limited to military reactions as we are open to trade of any kind and as a Nation within The Valley is it legally binding to have a free trade zone with other Nations in The Valley
