Named after Sleepy Hollow, first incorporated as North Tarrytown in the late 19th century before changing to its current name in 1996. Washington Irving, who resided in Tarrytown and is interred in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, wrote &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; in 1820, a short fiction about the community and its fabled phantom, the Headless Horseman. This story made the village famous throughout the world. Some people believe Sleepy Hollow to be one of the &quot;most haunted places in the world&quot; as a result of this tale.
