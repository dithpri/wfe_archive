This region has forcibly ejected the &amp;quot;conquerors&amp;quot; from the region of Sicarius, Sapientia, and Ridersyl, as well as the nation of Aepneimd, whose origins are admittedly unknown.

The Community of Bloodied Ghosts regrets this action, as well as the closing of Kyrbainya&amp;#39;s borders, though it did not expect such measures would be necessary. Due care shall be taken in the future.
