&quot;The EMCS were invaded by democratic civil rights loving countries of the Lily region who have now been removed by The Amin. They changed the flag, world factbook entry and tags of the EMCS. They turned the EMCS into some horrible anti-capitalist region. The EMCS will rerise to glory after the deportation of the invading nations.&quot; - The Amin 10/31/2022 

&quot;Our good name was harmed by this unjustified attack! The EMCS suffered heavy losses both mentaly and physically. False information had been spread to our beloved civilians! This period will be remembered as a dark page on the EMCS&#39;s history.&quot; - Hehrgart 10/31/2022
