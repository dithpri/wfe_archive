Tired of fake so called Cthulhu worshipers that do nothing to advance the goals of the Priest of the Old Ones? These so called Regions are a farce...a slap in the face to the true believers and the work you have done my brothers! 

As a collective, we take a stand.  We fight against the oppressive regimes which contaminate our universe.  Everyone suffers. It is the one thing that binds us together in this world. But why do we suffer? It is not accidental, but part of a larger design. The entire human race is being drained of its energy by the lesser gods.  They feed upon our suffering.
