&#147;Working Together for Peace, Trade, and Storytelling&#148;

RPS stands for Regional Pact of Stability and Role Playing Server. It&#146;s both a diplomatic initiative and a creative community.

Founded by Conopia, RPS promotes peaceful cooperation, fair trade, and collaborative worldbuilding between nations. It&#146;s a space for diplomacy and storytelling&#151;whether you&#39;re here to sign treaties or write lore.
