Earth has fallen into despair and the people need new homes. Space shuttles are launched from the few countries that are left and they set out to find a new place of residency in the universe. Everyone inside of the ships are asleep in cryogenic labs to preserve their life force. The shuttles arrive in the nearby Andromeda galaxy in a few thousand years. The people inside of the rockets are woken up from cryosleep and all of the ships go to nearby stars. The people colonize these newfound planets, and all of them have their own wildlife and environments. Each planet had its own countries and landscape. All of the colonies decided to create the League of Planets as a way to keep a loose order over the hundreds upon hundreds of planets.
