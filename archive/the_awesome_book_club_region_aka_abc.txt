Hello, this region is a democracy which means everyone in the region gets to vote on the rules and stuff and if anyone gets 3 people who want to have a vote for something whether its adding a rule or changing a rule then I will host a vote for that. Though the main thing thats sets this region from all other regions that I have seen is that this is a book club. This means that every month (or however long everyone votes on) we will read a book which is voted on by you guys and the ideas are suggested by you too, anyway every set amount of time we will read a book and then discuss it...(PLEASE CONTINUE READING ON THE FIRST POST)
