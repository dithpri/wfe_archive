The Toukai, or &quot;eastern sea&quot;, region is notable for its abundance of densely-populated island chains which are inhabited by a variety of ethnic and cultural groups. For hundreds of years, the economic and political landscape of the region was dominated by the Empire of Shingo, which has since been reorganized into the Republic of Shingo. In recent years, nations such as the Republic of Tsukimoto and the Kingdom of Nangoku have pursued efforts to increase their regional influence, however, other nations, most of which are largely primitive and undeveloped, have only engaged in limited communications with the larger nations of the region and have remained economically and politically isolated.
