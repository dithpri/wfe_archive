[region]Still Undefeated[/region] started in Atlanta, Georgia as the United Fantasy Football League (UFFL). After a decade of life in the Trimble Third Province, the Managers decided to venture out and form their own nations. While all nations are unique in their own regard, the inhabitants of Still Undefeated are united by their love of single-stream recycling, Southern Hospitality, President Jimmy Carter, and their suspicion of middle-aged men who cook pasta and come to college parties. Every year, the nations come together to battle (mostly peacefully) for the illustrious Dalai Lama Trophy.

Through all of the ups and downs we are...[b]Still Undefeated[/b].
