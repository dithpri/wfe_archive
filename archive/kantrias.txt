Here lay the ruins of the once great Kingdom of Kantrias, wiped out in it&amp;#39;s prime by the inactivitous plague.  Kantrias was a region of order of strong government that boasted an active imperialist army.  It had many intellegent and active citizens, and an odd fascination with flowers and the poptart cat.

Before you stands a tall statue of the greatest Kantrian King, Cerian Quilor.  At the base of the statue is inscribed:
