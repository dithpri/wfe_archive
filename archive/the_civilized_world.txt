The last bastion of civilization.

At a time when the forces of egalitarianism and democracy threaten civilization itself, this region stands up to the challenge posed by bloodthirsty revolutionaries, hippies, and others who have decided that barbarism and savagery are better than civilization. We take a firm stand against the forces of lawlessness and revolution.

This region is not afraid to defend the things needed for civilization: a hierarchical society, a government that is actively involved in matters of religious faith, a deep respect for tradition and honor, a strong enforcement of law and order, and even institutions to keep the lowest quality people in their place such as serfdom or slavery.
