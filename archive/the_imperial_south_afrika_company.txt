The ISAC is an organization set on the dignified, prosperous and beneficial colonization of the land south of the Zambezi river, commonly known as South Afrika. Whoever decides to join will be able to partake in the division of these wonderful, resource-plenty (like gold!) lands for our colonial benefits. Anyone is allowed to join, and the land won&#39;t run out! Except the valuable ones though...
