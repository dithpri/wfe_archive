The Anarchist Communal Assembly is a region where only socialists, communists, anarchists, and other left-wing governments may join. We are founded on equality, justice, and revolutionary tactics. We reject the World Assembly&#39;s globalism. We will not participate in decisions within it and we will never give in. Together, we can make this world a utopia for everyone founded on solidarity, mutual-aid, and communal governments.
