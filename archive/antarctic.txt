 [b][color=blue]WELCOME TO EARTH&#39;S SOUTHERNMOST CONTINENT[/color][/b][hr][i][color=teal]Situated in the southern hemisphere largely south of the Antarctic Circle, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqnQo3DgEoo]Antarctica[/url] is the fifth-largest continent.   98% of Antarctica is covered by ice.
