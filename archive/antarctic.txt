[b][color=blue]WELCOME TO EARTH&amp;#39;S SOUTHERNMOST CONTINENT[/color][/b][hr][i][color=cc99ff]Situated in the southern hemisphere largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent.  Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice.

On average, Antarctica is the coldest, driest and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation.  Since there is little precipitation, except at the coasts, the interior is technically the largest desert in the world.[/color][/i][hr][color=teal]Now playing on Antarctic radio, KICY:  [url=http://caseybreves.com/]Casey Breves[/url] and [url=https://www.facebook.com/SamTsuiMusic?_rdr=p]Sam Tsui[/url] ~ [i][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAfDnCQLJCY]Time After Time[/url][/i][/color][hr]
