[b][color=blue]WELCOME TO EARTH&#39;S SOUTHERNMOST CONTINENT[/color][/b][hr][i][color=teal]Situated in the southern hemisphere largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent.  Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice.

On average, Antarctica is the coldest, driest and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation.
