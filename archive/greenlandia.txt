Often referred to as &amp;quot;The Jewel of The East&amp;quot; by its residents, Greenlandia is open to all, from the inevitable crazy dictator to the warmhearted everyman. We would request, however if you plan on griefing someone, please do it with decency, as this is a decent place.
Every Nation in Greenlandia is ready to initiate combat and perish in the name of this land. How come? We are the chosen. We are better. Leave.
And yes, while the occasional bioweapon does get &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot; launched into rival population centers occasionally, we&amp;#39;re a pretty good group.
We are always open for communication and have open arms to all regions. Mostly.
