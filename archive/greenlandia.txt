Often referred to as &amp;quot;The Jewel of The East&amp;quot; by its residents, Greenlandia is open to all, from the crazy dictator to the warmhearted everyman. We would request, however if you plan on griefing someone, please do it with decency.
Every Nation in Greenlandia is ready to initiate combat and perish in the name of this land. How come? We are the chosen.
And yes, while the occasional bioweapon does get &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot; launched into rival population centers occasionally, we&amp;#39;re a pretty good group.
The combined nations of Greenlandia are pleased to announce our elected council!
