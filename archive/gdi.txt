The [b]GDI[/b] is a coalition of several otherwise isolated parallel Universes (Multiverses). More and more Civilizations of different Multiverses came into contact with the [b]GDI [/b] and established diplomatic and trade contacts and eventually formed the [b]GDI Alliance[/b] - a free Alliance of Civilizations.

The [b]GDI Alliance[/b] is holding some low profile contacts with the [region]SICON[/region] Alliance as well as with [region]Kalaalit Nunaat[/region].
