This pact is anti-fascism.
And also our pact was founded in 18 August 2018 and say no to fascism or some kind. I&#146;m the founder of the pact and I&#146;m hate Fascism.
So, any Capitalists and Communists allowed.
And also one more thing I want you to do is after joining our pact,
STEP 1: Also apply for World Assembly
STEP 2: Endorse me for making the pact even stronger.
Now, we need more anti-fascism member so we will recruit more members for help me building a forum site and designing the roleplay.
When we&#146;re 100 members, we begin to elect for WA Delegate. So again, please join us for help us to get the things out.
(When our forum done, anyone that want to join will have to apply for citizenship to doing elections or do roleplay)
