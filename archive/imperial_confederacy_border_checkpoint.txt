A buffer zone for those wishing to enter the region of The [region]Imperial Confederacy[/region]. As part of new Imperial Confederacy security measures, potential member nations are required to spend sixty days in this region before proceeding to the [region]Imperial Confederacy[/region]. This process is meant to discourage raiders and inactive players. Your nation will be monitored to see how often you log in. Upon completion of this sixty day stay your nation will be provided with the password for the region. However, after your entry, the password to the Imperial Confederacy will be changed to prevent an attack. 

If The Serenity Military Corperation deems your nation unsuitable for Imperial Confederacy membership in any way, entrance will be denied.
