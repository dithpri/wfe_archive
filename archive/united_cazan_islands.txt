The Cazan Islands were once Spanish Colonies, but after each island underwent it&#39;s own respective uprising, the Islands became a collection of fledgling nations. These nations banded together in a coalition known as the Union of the Cazan Islands to defend themselves from Spanish retaliation. Eventually, the coalition was renamed to the United Cazan Islands, and it was decided that Caza Cruza would be the coalition&#39;s regional delegate in the World Assembly.
