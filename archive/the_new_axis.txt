The New Axis Coalition is a rising geopolitical and economic bloc formed in the mid-21st century by a group of forward-looking nations seeking stability, sovereignty, and a new global equilibrium. Emerging from the fractures of outdated international systems and weakened supranational institutions, the Coalition positions itself as a modern alternative to traditional Western alliances, advocating for order, strength, and technological progress in the face of increasing global uncertainty.
