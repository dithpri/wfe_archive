Welcome!
Here the normal restrictions on RolePlay present in Europe are no more so feel free to role as much as you want. But, don&#39;t forget to respect other and be civil. Also, for the same reason, keep chit-chat at the lowest, Europe&#39;s regular RMB is there for that.


Europe&#39;s laws and regulations apply here as well so be aware of those!
