[i][color=orange]Small little nation of often forgotten Pokemon nations![/color][/i]

Based in part from [nation=long]Drysso[/nation] region, the [region]Maybreak Region[/region]!

[hr]

[b][color=blue]We are a no-frills, very casual region. No offsite forums, no dedicated roleplay, and no discord (currently) or map. Feel free to do any of those, (except discord), however.[/color][/b]

[i](A Discord will be created when the need arises.)[/i]

[b]We do strive to recruit active Pokemon related nations. Not ones that are shells or puppets. If you see one, please let me know.
