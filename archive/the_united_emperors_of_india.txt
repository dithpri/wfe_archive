[Color=brown]The Grey Wolves[/color] occupied the Indian territory. They were met with no resistance.

The Pack:
[Color=green]Vagabond[/color] [nation]Idi na Hui[/nation]
[Color=green]Vagabond[/color]  [nation]Nightvamp[/nation]

[i]The majestic wolf hide, 
On ships broad and wide.
Descend upon the country India,
Swords, guns and what not,
Murder, deaths and groans all loud.
The scene was frightening,
Even the Sun saw the owl screaming.
Grey wolves on flags beside the skull bone flags,
Rose over the castle of India.
The whole country lay in ruins,
Not a single creature moving.
&#39;Victory for the pack&#39; were heard,
&#39;All Private Pirates First Class shall be made&#39;.[/i]
