[b] Welcome to the The Alternate World Roleplay Region! [/b] [color=orange] The Alternate World Roleplay Region, or TAWRR, is one of the newest regions on nationstates. It is dedicated to creating a free and open environment for nations of all ideologies to come together to create a realistic but alternate timeline of our real world, with different nations, history, etc. Member nations are encouraged to engage in roleplay between their nations on the regional message board frequently. Also it is preferable to apply for an area on the map so as to keep with the realistic setting of the region. TAWRR only has a few rules so be sure to check them out and abide by them.
