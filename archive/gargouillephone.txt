Gargouillephone, extending from 90 degrees north to 80 degrees south of the Equator, was originally sparse with people. There are some islands that are populated, but always room for people. The nations there believe in conservation of the world&#39;s plants and resources, but this is disputable. It does not include Aleutian islands or any other regions, but is very wet and occasionally includes a nation. It both is teeming with education of the arts and enthusiastic about them and suspicious of them, but anyone brave enough to come here is welcomed.
