Just like the United Nations (U.N.), League of Nations, and other regional alliances, International Committee Of Nations (I.C.O.N. or ICON) will provide aid for nations in need of assistance. Examples of a nation in the Committee would be during war events and/or coups. And, if we have to, we will either kick your nation out, sanction it, or in a serious case, let a neighboring state (nation in Committee or not) absorb some, if not all of your nation.
