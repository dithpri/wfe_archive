The IVth Holy Roman Empire is a place for nations who seek to free themselves from the turmoils of other regions and instead seek to establish a region focusing on universal principles of the Representative Republic form of government (representative democracy). The region will place personal liberties above all other aspects of society, including those of a free market. Human liberty must be championed above all else at all costs, with exceptions made for those regions governed by theocratic forms of government in which their gods have placed restrictions upon certain liberties.
