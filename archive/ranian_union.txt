[B][color=green]Background[/b][/color]
The Ranian Union first consisted of three nations, Pretorania, Proloteriat, and Prolorania. These three giants all had a sworn hatred for each other, until they learnt to trust in each other after the formation of the Ranian Union in 1994. The three nations are now some of the world&amp;#39;s most dangerous superpowers. With Pretorania&amp;#39;s industry, Proloteriat&amp;#39;s might and Prolorania&amp;#39;s something; the Ranian Union rules the world through well planned peace.
