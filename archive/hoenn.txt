Sorry, folks. While I was out, some group of fun-hating banditos called the Black Riders decided to screw up our message board, cancel our embassies, and delete the factbook entry. I&amp;#39;ll write another one when I can. In the meantime, I would appreciate if more of you would endorse Marsano Nova, as it makes our nation harder to invade and will allow me to bring up the condemnation of these dastardly riders to the Security Council.
