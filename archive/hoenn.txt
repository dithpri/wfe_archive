Welcome to the Hoenn Region, a brand new region planning to be an active and friendly region. 

Admire the scenic oceans of Hoenn, with dramatic biomes ranging from dry deserts to dense rainforests. Many cities can be found along the coastline, and towns can be found in the harsh mountainous environments. 
We plan to:
- Establish a friendly community where people can chat together
- Make smaller community that trades and sells trading cards
- Elect an Ambassador and Ministers for Border Control, Communications, and Embassies, and elect a WA Delegate

Current Government:
Grand Amazing Nation Tazya - Founder
