 [b][u]The Endorsement Cap is set at 1, meaning that every person(excluding the WA Delegate) can only get one WA endorsement. This is done so that we don&#39;t accidentally elect a new WA Delegate. If you are caught breaking this rule, you will be warned not to do it again and have 12 hours to change it(talk to either me or the president if you need more time). If you do it again, you will be banned for one week and if you try it a third time, you will be permanently banned from the region.[/b][/u]
