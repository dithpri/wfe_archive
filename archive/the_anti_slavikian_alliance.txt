The Anti-Slavikian alliance is a ragtag band of 5 large nations, 3 medium nation, and 9 small, but somewhat powerful nations. The small nations mostly keep to themselves, while the large nations make any decisions about the fate of the alliance. Though the region is plagued with war, the leading nations often collaborate together and share their ideas about their countries and the region as a whole. The regional sport is often described as a competition between the nations as a little &quot;skirmish.&quot; These competitions can often be seen taking place suspiciously before major wars. Many people have also compared The Anti Slavikian Alliance to Yugoslavia. This comparison is apt, as anti slavikia has devolved into many small countries.
