The Anti-Slavikian alliance is a ragtag band of 5 large nations, 3 medium nation, and 9 small, but somewhat powerful nations. The small nations mostly keep to themselves, while the large nations make any decisions about the fate of the alliance. Many people have also compared The Anti-Slavikian Alliance to Yugoslavia. This comparison is apt, as Anti-Slavikia has devolved into many small countries. The region has faced frequent wars with the majority of nations struggling for control over land, with Laktikia and Okawalka being the leading in military power and regional control. Few nations, however, have resorted to peace. These few nations have been pelted with small bombings from the lesser nations.
