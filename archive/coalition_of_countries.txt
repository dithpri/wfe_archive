The Coalition of Countries(CoC) is a world-wide peacekeeper alliance (similar to the UN and NATO) although they&#146;re are warring nations that battle each other that are in the CoC. It keeps the general state of authority before things get out of hand and also instills ground for reasonable peace talks and request at the end of wars, request for annexation and any other type of conference the other countries would like to hold.
