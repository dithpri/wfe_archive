The Isle of Ideological Disparities is home to various nations sharing only in their differences of opinions. This region&amp;#39;s goal is to celebrate the uniqueness and merits of many different forms of rule. Despite fundamental and irreconcilable differences in these ideologies the Isle is devoted to tolerance and pacifism with each other. Our goal is to become a successful and influential figure in the world by finding strength in the things that make us different.
