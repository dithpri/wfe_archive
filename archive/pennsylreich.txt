The Pennsylreich is a fascist state founded in March 1942 as a response to Germany&#39;s declaration of war on the United States of America. The state officially gained independence in January of 1944 due to America being overwhelmed from fighting a three front war against Japan, Mexico, and the German-backed Pennsylreich.
