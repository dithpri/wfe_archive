[colour=darkred][b][u]NEW REGIME OF GREAT CYAN[/u][/b][/colour]

[i][colour=navy]&quot;Oh, New Regime of Great Cyan the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer&#39;s gone, and all the roses falling,
It&#39;s you, it&#39;s you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer&#39;s in the meadow,
Or when the valley&#39;s hushed and white with snow,
It&#39;s I&#39;ll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, oh New Regime of Great Cyan, New Regime of Great Cyan, I love you so!&quot;[/colour][/i]
