[b]Welcome to the Aurorum Project![/b]
We are a modern-tech world-building and role-playing region founded by the former members of Gaia. As a young and dynamic region, we are actively looking for new members to join our ranks and contribute to our shared canon. Our goal is to become the gold-standard in quality world-building on NationStates and maintain an active and vibrant community of devoted members. If this appeals to you, please join our regional Discord server and take a look at our IIWiki portal, both of which are linked below.
