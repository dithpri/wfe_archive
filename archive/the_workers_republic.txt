The Workers Republic is a reference to an important part of Irish history, James Connolly. We are a Left-Wing group trying to support the struggle for Communism in Ireland and indeed the rest of the world. We like some serious Left-Wing politics, but we like to have some fun too once in a while. Being Left-Wing is compulsory to join but you don&amp;#39;t have to be Irish. Hold on to your rifles boys, don&amp;#39;t give up the dream. A Republic for the Working Class, economic liberty!
