[color=blue]The Commonwealth Of Australia is a healthy region, slowly growing in size. It was born out of an age old dispute between Liberal and Labor, which resulted subsequent divide and our region&#39;s founding.
we here focus on unity, Free choice and Liberalism We run a democratic region with an ever-changing government, and work hard to acknowledge what the people want.
We value self-worth and individuality over uniformity and conformity, and believe the only true path to equality is one that allows for people to have as many freedoms as possible, so that everyone may be happy.[/color][color=purple] AND YES IT&#39;S FOUNDER HAPPENS TO BE A WOMEN!!![/color]  [nation=short]Sarah Said[/nation]
