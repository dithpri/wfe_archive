[color=green]Sponsored by [nation=short]Eastern Dixie[/nation][/color][hr][b][color=red]This region is a federally protected reservation designed to maintain the indigenous 
population of the Dixon Commonwealth of Nations.  Those nations admitted are 
formally invited by the Dixon President and are legally approved for admittance
 by Congress.  Of the reservations established to date, the Grand Agrarian Warehouse 
is the only one to have so far avoided collapse at the hands of external pressure.[/color][/b][hr][b][u]Government[/b][/u]
