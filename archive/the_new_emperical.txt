Founded by the Colony of Easteca as a means to be separated and independent of the grip of other regions, The New Emperical is a lone region headed by the Governor of Easteca under the concurrent title of Emperical Overseer. The New Emperical is, in a sense, just a vehicle for Easteca to engage the rest of the world.
