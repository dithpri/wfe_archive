[region]Throne of Shadows[/region]
The [region]Throne of Shadows[/region] is an ancient, secretive coalition formed by leaders who rule through fear, control, and manipulation. Born from the ashes of a broken, chaotic world, these nations found unity in their shared ambition for unbreakable power and dominance over lesser, rebellious states. Here, only the cunning, the ruthless, and the unyielding survive and rise.
Legend speaks of a mysterious figure, the Shadow Sovereign, who united these nations under one banner. Whether the Sovereign still lives or if a hidden council now guides the region is unknown. Only whispers tell of the Sovereign&#39;s teachings.
