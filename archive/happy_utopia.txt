[b]&quot;life on the earth...

To what should I compare it?

Rising towards the empty sky.&quot;[/b]

A happy welcome from the Utopia! This is a warm place that welcomes systems, views and political, social and economic ideas very diverse and where you can talk about it and discuss it in an open, balanced, kind and respectful environment. We don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a fascist, communist, capitalist or otherwise. Your country is your happy utopia and this is the region to be for you!
