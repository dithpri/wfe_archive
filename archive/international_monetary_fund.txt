[i]The [b]International Monetary Fund[/b] is an alliance of states known for strong economies and a practice of fiscal responsibility.

Founded in 1945 following the devastations of the world&#39;s economies due to obscure and minor events, the IMF was established with a mandate to promote the creation of transnational corporations through campaigns of predatory lending to nations with severe shortages of multinational conglomerates. 

Since its founding, the IMF continues to pursue its goals of worldwide austerity, market liberalisation, and corporate bailouts. [/i]
