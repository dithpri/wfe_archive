We are a small region but we are bound to grow. Grow fast. Please endorse the regional delegate. I have temporarily banned the regional control by the delegate in order to ensure that we are not targeted by raiders. Our recruitment of newly created nations is producing splendid results and we are quickly growing in numbers. I urge you to send messages to newly created nations requesting them to join us. Thank you.
