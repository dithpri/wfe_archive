Baltam is a remote island in the Baltic sea, and it was expected that Peconi would be the entire island for the duration of its life -- after all, why would anybody even stumble upon the region, let alone want to move?

A survey came out saying Baltam was pretty awesome when it came to giving businesses rights. So nations started arriving... but they couldn&amp;#39;t adapt to the quiet monastic peace that is living in Baltam. Gradually, they faded away.

The fact that &amp;quot;Baltam&amp;quot; name is &amp;quot;matlaB&amp;quot; spelled backwards is COMPLETELY irrelevant.
