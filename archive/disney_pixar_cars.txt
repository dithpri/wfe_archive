Anxiety is way worse.... And hair loss? O hell no. That&#39;s horrible, are you blonde btw? It&#39;s not that bad. You wouldn&#39;t notice unless you looked carefully. And no, I&#39;m not blonde. Anyway, I&#39;m planning on starting role play in TGU. I came up with an idea called &quot;TGU Gossip&quot;. Do you have any plans for your region? Wait... you have Asperger&#39;s Syndrome? Is that severe?

The Syndrome isnt severe and I have not much ideas for roleplay. I&#39;m not the best at it at all. And Capra already is zealous at the moment. I grant you a passport. You can found things in it now :D Like what?
