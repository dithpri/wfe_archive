I agree on Capitalism and what you said about your regions. The foot fetish guy picked a poll option in [region]Transcendia[/region] that made it seem like he or she was me &amp;#128514;. I&#39;m sorry I deleted what you just said but it kept saying my World Factbook Entry was too long. Also, why don&#39;t you want to give [region]Egalidom[/region] independence?

sell honestly Egalidom seems better as a colony of yours. but it&#39;s a democratic poll so I respect if others say otherwise
