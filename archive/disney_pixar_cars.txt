Welcome to Disney Pixar Cars &amp;#128512;!
You may be misunderstanding Free Nations Region but honestly I dislike big regions very much anyways so I will not disagree with you. They raided [region]Boston[/region]. That&#39;s all the proof I need. Could you make a puppet and put it in [region]NO LILY[/region] please?
HUZZAH I made a new character model. How would I describe it... a female Hades. That&#39;s a compliment BTW. How much colonies do you plan on making? 22 maybe?

I am unsure. I will see once I see how many fallen regions ticked me off. I searched up &quot;Feminist&quot; and I found 4 results. 4 more is what I&#39;m guessing. Are you interested in Polandball?

I LOVE POLANDBALLS AND COUNTRYBALLS. WHAT KINDA QUESTION IS THAT? :D Hi. A good one is when USA gets a world map thats really a map of the US &amp;#128514;.
