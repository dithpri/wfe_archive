I heard them on the radio yesterday.
They&#39;re poetic and have good-sounding music, even tho they&#39;re.... questionable in character. How did you find about them?
my grandma plays a lot of music. You talk about your Mom and grandma a lot. What about your Grandpa and Dad?
my step grandpa is an idiot and my dad should be in jail. That pretty much is it. What did your Dad do?

unspeakable thingsssss
