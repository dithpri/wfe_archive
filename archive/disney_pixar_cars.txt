Here its freezing during the second half of fall and all of winter, and there is nothing to do here besides normal stuff because no one wants to build anything here but Cedar Point which is still 2 hours and 30 minutes away.

I try to stay inside doors at all times. Okay, nice. So why are you always at work with your mom? She wants to spend time with me.
