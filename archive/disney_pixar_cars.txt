y to stay inside doors at all times. Okay, nice. So why are you always at work with your mom? She wants to spend time with me. Oh okay! I have a question, what is your name in real life?! I am Anastasia. I go by the stage name Skullyna. Anastasia. I love that, it is very pretty, upbeat name! Mine is Jacob, by the way. Oohhhh! I looooooove that name. Good!
