[color=purple][color=purple][/purple][/color] I&#39;ll fix it Thank you. When did you learn Italian?

I learnt Italian from listening to my great grandma complain. LOL &amp;#128514;! Do you prefer Italian over English?

I prefer to speak silence which is why I write instead of talk I love both. [region]The Free Nations Region[/region] isn&#39;t gonna get TGU. PASSWORDS ROCK! So when do you get out of school? I prefer English BTW.
