Also, I usually give the WA Delegate all authorities in my regions other than TGU, but I&#39;ll give it just WA for this region. Thanks. Do you plan on continuing your puppet show? Nice job on your colonies BTW.

Hheeeheheheheheee. I might keep up the puppet show, I dunno. I&#39;ll hold a vote in Capra to see if you should continue it. Would you be okay with that?
