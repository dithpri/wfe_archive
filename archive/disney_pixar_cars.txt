I think I gave him an officer position which is why that happened. SCHOOL IS OUT! Anyway, how do you like your newspaper? I think it&#39;s nice *gives a small kiss &amp;#128537;*.
The newspaper is great so far! As for Bismuth Tribune, I was looking up newspaper names and I was thinking of the gem &quot;Bismuth&quot; and I was like &quot;BISMUTH TRIBUNE... YESSS QUEEEEEN&quot;. Awwwww theynk u for the kiss ^.^ &amp;lt;3
I am going to try to run for Deputy or Culture officer in Rejected Realms if Glac wins. Does Bismuth mean anything? And your welcome for the kiss. Kisses... short and sweet.

Bismuth is just a gem. &amp;lt;3 You must have named it after yourself. You are a gem after all &amp;#128525;.
