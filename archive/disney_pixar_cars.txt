Your lucky, having a birthday is great way to end the summer. Mine isn&#39;t until November 16th.
Yeah I guess :D :D So why don&#39;t you like Taylor Swift or Katy Perry?!
Modern pop. Yuck. What about Rap? Rap is my second favorite genre, behind Pop. I like Will Smith. Cool. *Gets out ring* Will you marry me?!
