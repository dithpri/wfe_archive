ever since I was... born. I always have had insomnia and I need Benadryl to sleep. I&#39;m sorry about that. Insomnia and anxiety combined sounds awful. Does Benadryl make you feel weird? I have nerve meet someone won&#39;t insomnia. Also, I had my ELA AIR Test today.

Well Benadryl doesnt make me feel weird. And I slept well last night but Insomnia is TERRIBLE.
