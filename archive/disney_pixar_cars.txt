&quot;and by that I mean he isn&#39;t posting which is awesome&quot;

I am still against raiding seeing how it&#39;s redundant compared to annexation. Although annexation spams NationStates with a bunch of useless identical colonies that couldve been left for dead, so I make sure my colonies all look different and have different messages. I got rid of Executive. I think I gave him an officer position which is why that happened. SCHOOL IS OUT! Anyway, how do you like your newspaper? I think it&#39;s nice *gives a small kiss &amp;#128537;*.
