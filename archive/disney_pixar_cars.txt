I agree on Capitalism and what you said about your regions. The foot fetish guy picked a poll option in [region]Transcendia[/region] that made it seem like he or she was me &amp;#128514;. I&#39;m sorry I deleted what you just said but it kept saying my World Factbook Entry was too long. Also, why don&#39;t you want to give [region]Egalidom[/region] independence?
sell honestly Egalidom seems better as a colony of yours. but it&#39;s a democratic poll so I respect if others say otherwise. Ya your probably right. The region didn&#39;t have anyone but me when it died off anyway. How are things with Rol Geo Dia? I know he can sometimes be mean to you.

Rol is mean to everything. But he knows now I have anxiety so he&#39;ll be gentler. You have insomnia? When were you diagnosed with it?
