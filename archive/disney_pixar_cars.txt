Same here! I&#39;m meeting lots of teens here my age who arent complete jokes. A lot of my friends are all adults tho. Mine is a mix of teens and adults, which is funny because im a kid. Speaking of which, guess my age.

I&#39;m 15 actually. You seem a lot more intelligent and mature than most 8 year olds I&#39;ve seen. Thank you. Im that rare mix of smart and social. Do you care that im that young by any chance?! That depends on what u mean by &quot;care&quot;. Does it effect you at all is what I mean.
