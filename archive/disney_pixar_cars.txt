Welcome to Disney Pixar Cars! Good day Please Understand! Sorry about my inactivity for a couple of months. My Samsung IPad broke which was my main source for anything NS-related. So what&#39;s been going on with you? Nice! I have a new tablet now. So how much did the new house cost?
and The Great Universe is obviously the best region. *Blushes* Well I&#39;m glad you like your new home! That&#39;s a beautiful flag! I get a Fall vibe from it.

*gives you abouqet of flowers* &amp;#128144; *Gives you a portal*. [b]A portaaallll???? O.O[/b] Yes. It was either that or a DVD copy of The Notebook.
