Nevermind I came back to it.... But I&#39;m not gonna put as much effort in the region anymore. If a tough decision comes up, it&#39;s for someone else. I&#39;m a loser founder. Loser founder?! Your a great founder! Most founders never do anything for there region, and look at what you do! You created a glorious region, and yes I know I sound like I&#39;m helping an underdog baseball team LOL!

Ehhh everything keeps dieing but the embassy posting keeps it alive. And a couple devouted members are still there. I miss my Disqus friends too, but honestly I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be a good idea to go back.
