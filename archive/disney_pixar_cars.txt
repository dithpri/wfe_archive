Welcome to Disney Pixar Cars! Good day Please Understand! Sorry about my inactivity for a couple of months. My Samsung IPad broke which was my main source for anything NS-related.

yay! two flower kingdoms!! I actually decided to live back in Capra because I missed it alot. I missed it too. I have so much memories from there. I still remember that day when we met. I found your region and decided to propose for an embassy. I know we are married, but it feels different now. I think it is because I am becoming a Tween, which is a weird stage in life.
