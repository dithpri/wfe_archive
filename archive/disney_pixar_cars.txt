The RMB post is a spider xD and u gotta be a longtime friend of mine to be a part of it, which you already are a part of it. Nice! Also, I don&#39;t like spiders XD. Can you tell me why you like/love Depeche Mode? I heard them on the radio yesterday.
They&#39;re poetic and have good-sounding music, even tho they&#39;re.... questionable in character. How did you find about them?

my grandma plays a lot of music. You talk about your Mom and grandma a lot. What about your Grandpa and Dad?
