You may be misunderstanding Free Nations Region but honestly I dislike big regions very much anyways so I will not disagree with you. They raided [region]Boston[/region]. That&#39;s all the proof I need. Could you make a puppet and put it in [region]NO LILY[/region] please?
HUZZAH I made a new character model. How would I describe it... a female Hades. That&#39;s a compliment BTW. How much colonies do you plan on making? 22 maybe?

I am unsure. I will see once I see how many fallen regions ticked me off.
