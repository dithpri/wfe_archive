Welcome to Disney Pixar Cars!
~when I was a tween, I was a heavily left-winged idiot who had an identity crisis.
and Pagan Rose was a mistake. it has a name that makes it easier for people to snub me. I&#39;m locking it down and let it die or live on its own. Capra just needed to be fixed up and it&#39;s good as new. I made a list of names abd I showed it to Ava, and she picked Pagan Rose. I knew very little about Paganism. I&#39;m not going to close any of either region&#39;s embassies. Agreed. Pagan Rose felt off, especially to me because being Catholic and living in a region with &quot;Pagan&quot; in it felt a bit weird and off. But what about Heidengarde? You haven&#39;t said much about that place.
