You keep getting raided because you leave the WA DELEGATE position with all the authorities. If you were to remove those from all of the regions you own, you would never get raided.

I am still against raiding seeing how it&#39;s redundant compared to annexation. Although annexation spams NationStates with a bunch of useless identical colonies that couldve been left for dead, so I make sure my colonies all look different and have different messages.
