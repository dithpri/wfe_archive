Yep I&#39;m a girl! &amp;#9827;&amp;#9830;&amp;#9829;&amp;#9824;  I have a fever &amp;#128557;.
Oh no &amp;#128546; Have chicken soup, it should help. I don&#39;t have chicken soup &amp;#128557;!
Oh dear... Well don&#39;t drink dairy products and make sure to have a hot dinner. You should be able to break your fever if you sweat by wearing warm clothes and getting enough sleep. I will try to get good sleep, but I have to eat a small dinner or I might throw up if I eat to much. Also, I don&#39;t have the ingredients to make a hot dinner, so ya. awwwwww ): I hope u get better! What may have caused your fever? Thank you! Also, im 99.9 % sure its because I hugged my girlfriend/friend ( I&#39;m not sure what she thinks) because I haven&#39;t touched anyone else.

Oh! U have a GF? I thought u were a kid &amp;#128513;
