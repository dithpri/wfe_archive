I&#39;m sick &amp;#128557;.
who got you sick? ): My mom. We ate out and I&#39;m 99.9 percent sure it&#39;s because of that. I didn&#39;t get sick from it, but my mom did and therefore I got sick yesterday.
I hate colds ): they suck. O btw, how many puppets do you have? [region]C A R N I V A L[/region] and [region]Earope[/region] are about to CTE. 48 I think. I could be wrong. I&#39;ll remake those regions and turn them into TGU colonies like usual. Why did you give up on those 2 regions?

because I don&#39;t want spiteful peoples to Refound them. Plus I don&#39;t need them. I guess your right. How exactly do I join The Sea Urchin Squad? I don&#39;t get it. What is that RMB post supposed to mean?
