I heard them on the radio yesterday.
They&#39;re poetic and have good-sounding music, even tho they&#39;re.... questionable in character. How did you find about them?
my grandma plays a lot of music. You talk about your Mom and Grandma a lot. What about your Grandpa and Dad?
my step grandpa is an idiot and my dad should be in jail. That pretty much is it. What did your Dad do?
unspeakable thingsssss. And what about your Step Grandpa? Why is he below average when it comes to intelligence?

I would rather not talk about it, but grandma is worse than him. She likes to manipulate him. Do you have any other family members? Uncle&#39;s, aunt&#39;s, cousins, etc.
