I guess I leave school in two months. Well I could see them raiding us.... somehow... mainly because me, [nation]Casanic[/nation] and [nation]Opstan[/nation] exposed them. I get out of school on May 25th 2018. Are there any big regions you like? Why did you ban [nation]Worse than main deleted[/nation]?

I banned WorseThanMain because I believed they snubbed us. And as for big regions, I prefer [region]Christmas[/region], [region]The Dank Meme Alliance[/region] and [region]The North Pacific[/region]. I&#39;m a TNP native. I love the place. Why do you think he/she snubbed us? That makes sense. Also, Libcord is used by [region]The Free Nations Region[/region]. In other words, Libcord is actually a Raider database.
