A somewhat tropical land, near a giant ocean. The land is limited and selected very slim, so joining isn&amp;#39;t like walking in the park. [Owner mainly keeps it&amp;#39;s friends and other nations here. Also, the name is inspired by One Piece.]
So far there are not many living within the territory, but that doesn&amp;#39;t slow them down.
