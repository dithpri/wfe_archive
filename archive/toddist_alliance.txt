This is a group for those who follow Toddism. 

Toddism is a religion based around a Minecraft Cod named Todd the Cod God. To join, you must agree not to fish or eat Cod, swear to eat pork every Monday, and have a cod in an item frame in your house.
(This &#39;religion&#39; is purely a joke amongst some friends. Toddism isn&#39;t meant to disrespect any real religions.)
