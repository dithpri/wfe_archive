We are, simply put, isolationists who desire a region to call home without having to associate with fascists and capitalists. There is no requirement to join this region as we are happy to expand the reach of our power however we can not guarantee equal representation to those of wildly differing political views. We will consider any arguments directed to the Grand Exarch of Foreign Affairs of the Glorious Nation of Angrakngdur. Thank you for your time.
