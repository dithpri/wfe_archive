The Koridai Korta
The Original 4 Points of Koridai
1. the Faces of Evil consists of the two founders of Koridai (Ganon Lair and Crapuad), and two other nations elected by other Koridai nations, with another one chosen by the founders. The Faces of Evil are even in power, though King Ganon is the overall leader and Crapaud leads the military of Koridai and in charge of foreign relations.
2. No off site forums, we have all debates and votes on our NS board.
3. All amendments to the Koridai Korta can be proposed by a Face of Evil, and all nations may vote for it (The Faces of Evil&amp;#39;s votes are worth 10 non Face nation votes.
4. No ponies of any kind are allowed, all found will be ate by King Ganon.
