welcome to some islands off the coast of Australia (somewhere in the Tasman sea) The islands were found during WW1 when a squadron of Australian destroyers became stranded. help was sent out to find them, and on the way they found these islands. the first 3 people to find these islands were Jim Ferrain, Smolan Qwaim and John Smith, although John Smith was later sighted escaping the region via a blue box marked &quot;POLICE public call&quot;
