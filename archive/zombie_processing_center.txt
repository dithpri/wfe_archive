A Zombie-Apocalypse themed protectorate of [region]The Allied States of the Campbell Nation[/region]

Founded preemptively for the next zombie apocalypse, this region is to act as a clearing ground for nations before being allowed to move on. 
In theory, this should allow refugees to be cleared faster and in greater numbers than before. We&amp;#39;ll see how this works out in practice when Halloween rolls around.

As we are constantly on guard for the apocalypse, we are under a constant state of martial law. Military juntas and iron-fisted dictatorships are encouraged.
