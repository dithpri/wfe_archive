The [color=red]Red[/color] [color=blue]Warband[/color] [color=yellow]Corps[/color], or RWC, is an organization that not only supports the true socialist doctrine, but also raids all unfree Fascist regions, regardless of popularity amongst the region. However, for disliked regions, such as Capitalists, the raid shall be put to vote. Occasionally, we will attack hardline-leftist regions.

[color=red]The Red Warband Corps is back! We have officially re-ignited the flame of the NS Left! We are now pushing for a united NS Left, and have stopped our raiding and defending activities after the fall of DEN. We thank our associate regions for their support in our raiding, but that is no longer for us.

Uraa!
