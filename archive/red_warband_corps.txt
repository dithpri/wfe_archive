The [color=red]Red[/color] [color=blue]Warband[/color] [color=yellow]Corps[/color], or RWC, is an organization that not only supports the true socialist doctrine, but also raids all unfree Fascist regions, regardless of popularity amongst the region. However, for disliked regions, such as Capitalists, the raid shall be put to vote. Occasionally, we will attack hardline-leftist regions.

We both do tag raids and permanent, aka &quot;residential&quot; raid. Any Corps member, regardless of rank, if caught giving raid or otherwise crucial information to a target or enemy, will be tried for treason.
