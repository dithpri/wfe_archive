The [color=red]Red[/color] [color=blue]Warband[/color] [color=yellow]Corps[/color], or RWC, is an organization that not only supports the true socialist doctrine, but also raids all unfree Fascist regions, regardless of popularity amongst the region. However, for disliked regions, such as Capitalists, the raid shall be put to vote. Occasionally, we will attack hardline-leftist regions.

[color=red]The Red Warband Corps is dismantled until further notice due to troubles not involving our group on the Gameplay forum. We officially condemn the use of Predator by DOS player Cora, who we urge you to look out for. Our raiding system is thus temporarily shut down, but our warning system is still in place.

Uraa!
