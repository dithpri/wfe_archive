&quot;Welcome everyone, and thank you all for being here today as we share in this service of love for our beloved friends.

For those of us who knew them, we will never forget the way they made us feel. They had that warm, welcoming RMB post that radiated peace and comfort and said &#147;I accept and love you for who you are.&#148; 

Let&#146;s stop for a minute and remember. What was your happiest memory with them?

I know that even in their last days, they felt all of your love for them, carrying it in their heart.

Let us carry that love with us today, and every day, in their memory.&quot;
