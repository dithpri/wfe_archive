 Atria is a Future Tech nationstates region largely hosted on our forum, which may be found here Atrians.enjin.com It is designed around a single galaxy, which allows for room enough for a large number of nations, or for those empires that wish to expand far beyone any and every dilemna set before them, be it an asteroid belt or other nations. Remember, however, this is FT and not Fantasy Tech, and as such some tech rules shall be set in place, but will remain largely free depending on your choices. We aspire to become a nation full of RP, kindness, wars, diplomacy, and every possible RP inbetween..Join us, we have cookies.
