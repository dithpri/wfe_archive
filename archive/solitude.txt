[color=blue]Solitude[/color] is a place for the [color=green]peaceful[/color], the [color=gray]tired[/color], the [color=purple]lost[/color], and the [color=gold]confused[/color]. 

[i]A beautiful, [color=white]snow capped mountain[/color] in the faraway distance, outlining the blue skies. A calming, rushing river with perfectly clear water crashing against the rocky shore. Your toes wiggle through the [color=orange]sand[/color], and you feel relief wash over your body. There is no one else in sight, and everything is completely quiet, with the exception of the sound of [color=blue]water[/color] pound against [color=brown]rock[/color], the [color=pink]birds[/color] singing songs of [color=magenta]peace[/color], and the wind brushing against the delicate [color=green]leaves[/color] of the [color=green]forest[/color] that lies behind you.[/i]
