[region]Solitude[/region] is a cold region inhabited by native animals such as the Snowy Owl (Hooticus Freezupicus) and the common Troll (Trollus Useneticus). 
The entire population (except for some sceptics) is convinced that the world is flat and balanced on the backs of four elephants, which are in turn balanced on the back of a giant turtle. 
We welcome all nations, including you.
