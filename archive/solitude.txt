[color=blue][b]Welcome to the quietest region in the world![/b][/color]
This is the place where nations go to find peace and
solitude from the troubles of other nations, though
don&#39;t expect much interaction here (hence the name).

[color=blue][b]We have only one expectation![/b][/color]
We expect that all nations shall keep he tranquility of
our region, no matter the situation. Doing so will not
only keep the region from boiling to its melting point
but also keeps the universe from dying an early heat
death due to the lack of entropy (since we are saving
our energy by avoiding interaction within the region).

named &quot;The Region of Solitude&quot; for more information. [/i][/b][/color]
