Founded in the midst of a trade war amongst European and Asian corporations, several Fortune 500 corporations and smaller businesses and enterprises broke rank and founded Solitude, a free trade region with the opportunity for endless economic growth.

Over 1100 corporations united under two separate banners to form the Federation of Trading Corporations (Commonly referred to as the Trade Federation) and the Alliance of Corporate Entities, which favored individual corporate freedoms and thus became the region&amp;#39;s first confederacy.

Solitude is governed by both the Trade Federation and the Confederation, and is a strict free-trade region.
