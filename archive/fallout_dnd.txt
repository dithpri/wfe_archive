[i]Set in the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout, Fallout DnD is a roleplaying region centered around character roleplay and quests that borrow from the mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons (adapted for easier use and greater relevance to the Fallout Franchise).[/i]

This region is set in West Virginia in the year 2276. Create your own character and participate in engaging character rps on the RMB, and join the Discord to play in elaborate and exciting DnD-styled Fallout quests!
