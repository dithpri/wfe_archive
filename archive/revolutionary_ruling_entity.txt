Our Mission Statement: For we do not cease to be a economic Revolution. For we are a region of government formation, with revolutionary ideas for the bindings of such. We are tired of the &quot;status-quo&quot; revolutions based on either minor political pushes, or perhaps economic systematic pushes. We are for the revolution of how we run government, no longer shall we settle for poorly ran dictatorships, republics, democracys, monarchies, or any other sort of previously formed government types. We as of now have no regulation for how such shall be done, but, in equivocacy.
