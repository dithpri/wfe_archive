With a hiss of steam and the screeching of brakes, an elaborately decorated steam train pulls into the central station of the region, wholly unannounced. Despite its surprising entry, the station employees take it in stride at first, porters swarming the craft in hopes of a lucrative tip. What they get, however, is a flurry of feathers and talons, as birds erupt from the train&#39;s every orifice. Before long, the station is deserted to a man, the only remaining motion coming from several hawks fighting over the contents of a food stand.
