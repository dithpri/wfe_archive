Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Fourteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;At that time Jesus exclaimed:
&#39;...Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened,
and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart;
and you will find rest for yourselves.
For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.&#39;&quot;
