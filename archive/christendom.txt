Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord.

&quot;...And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them,
conversing with him.
Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,
&#39;Lord, it is good that we are here.
If you wish, I will make three tents here,
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.&#39;
While he was still speaking, behold,
a bright cloud cast a shadow over them,
then from the cloud came a voice that said,
&#39;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased;
listen to him.&#39;...&quot;
