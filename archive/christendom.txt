Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Twenty-ninth Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;The Pharisees went off
and plotted how they might entrap Jesus in speech...
They sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying,
&#39;...Tell us, then, what is your opinion:
Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not?&#39;
Knowing their malice, Jesus said,
&#39;Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
Show me the coin that pays the census tax.&#39;
Then they handed him the Roman coin.
He said to them, &#39;Whose image is this and whose inscription?&#39;
They replied, &#39;Caesar&#39;s.&#39;
At that he said to them,
&#39;Then repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar
and to God what belongs to God.&#39;&quot;
