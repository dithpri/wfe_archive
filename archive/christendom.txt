Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Solemnity of the Body and Blood of Christ.

&quot;Jesus said to them,
&#39;Amen, amen, I say to you,
unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,
you do not have life within you.
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
has eternal life,
and I will raise him on the last day.
For my flesh is true food,
and my blood is true drink.
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood
remains in me and I in him.&#39;&quot;
