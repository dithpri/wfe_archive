Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Eleventh Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;Then he summoned his twelve disciples
and gave them authority over unclean spirits
to drive them out and to cure every disease and every illness...

Jesus sent out [the] twelve after instructing them thus,
&#147;Do not go into pagan territory or enter a Samaritan town.
Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, make this proclamation: &#145;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&#146;
Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons.
Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give.&quot;
