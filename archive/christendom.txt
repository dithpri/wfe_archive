Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Twenty-second Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;...&#39;Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself,
take up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?
Or what can one give in exchange for his life?
For the Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father&#39;s glory,
and then he will repay all according to his conduct.&#39;&quot;
