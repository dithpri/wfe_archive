Christendom,
The throne of Godhead we do see,
above thy meadows green.
The pastures of the blessed are
decked in divine sheen!
The power of Her Empire,
the glory of her height!
My Christendom, our Christendom
the home of God&amp;#39;s pure light.

Christendom was the historic mother-region of the ancient Church of England and the expansive British Empire which it served. The Virtual Anglican Church, for a short space of time.
