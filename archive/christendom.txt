Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the sixth Sunday of Easter. 
He is risen, alleluia, alleluia!

&quot;Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said,
&#147;Father, the hour has come.
Give glory to your son, so that your son may glorify you,
just as you gave him authority over all people,
so that your son may give eternal life to all you gave him.
Now this is eternal life,
that they should know you, the only true God,
and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.
I glorified you on earth
by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do.
Now glorify me, Father, with you,
with the glory that I had with you before the world began.&quot;
