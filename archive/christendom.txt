Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Seventeenth Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;Jesus said to his disciples:
&#39;The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field,
which a person finds and hides again,
and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant
searching for fine pearls.
When he finds a pearl of great price,
he goes and sells all that he has and buys it.&#39;&quot;
