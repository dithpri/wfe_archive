Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Sixteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;Jesus proposed another parable to the crowds, saying:
&#39;The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a man
who sowed good seed in his field.
While everyone was asleep his enemy came
and sowed weeds all through the wheat, and then went off.
When the crop grew and bore fruit, the weeds appeared as well.
... His slaves said to him, &#39;Do you want us to go and pull them up?&#39;
He replied, &#39;No, if you pull up the weeds
you might uproot the wheat along with them.
Let them grow together until harvest;
then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters,
&#39;First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning;
but gather the wheat into my barn.&#39;&quot;
