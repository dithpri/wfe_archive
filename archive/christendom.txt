Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the sixth Sunday of Easter. 
He is risen, alleluia, alleluia!

&quot;Jesus said to his disciples:
&quot;If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
And I will ask the Father,
and he will give you another Advocate to be with you always,
the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept,
because it neither sees nor knows him.
But you know him, because he remains with you,
and will be in you.&quot;
