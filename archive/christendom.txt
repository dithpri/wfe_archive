Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Twentieth Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;...But the woman came and did Jesus homage, saying, &#39;Lord, help me.&#39;
He said in reply,
&#39;It is not right to take the food of the children
and throw it to the dogs.&#39;
She said, &#39;Please, Lord, for even the dogs eat the scraps
that fall from the table of their masters.&#39;
Then Jesus said to her in reply,
&#39;O woman, great is your faith!
Let it be done for you as you wish.&#39;
And the woman&#39;s daughter was healed from that hour.&quot;
