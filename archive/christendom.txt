Welcome to Christendom!

This week is Pentecost Sunday, or Ascension Sunday. 
He is risen, alleluia, alleluia!

&quot;

On the last and greatest day of the feast,
Jesus stood up and exclaimed,
&quot;Let anyone who thirsts come to me and drink.
As Scripture says:
Rivers of living water will flow from within him who believes in me.&quot;

He said this in reference to the Spirit
that those who came to believe in him were to receive.
There was, of course, no Spirit yet,
because Jesus had not yet been glorified.&quot;
