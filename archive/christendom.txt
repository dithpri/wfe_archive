Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Thirteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;Jesus said to his apostles:
&quot;Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,
and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;
and whoever does not take up his cross
and follow after me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds his life will lose it,
and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.&quot;
