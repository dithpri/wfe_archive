Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Nineteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;...When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified.
&#39;It is a ghost,&#39; they said, and they cried out in fear.
At once Jesus spoke to them, &#39;Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.&#39;
Peter said to him in reply,
&#39;Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.&#39;
He said, &#39;Come.&#39;
Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus.
But when he saw how strong the wind was he became frightened;
and, beginning to sink, he cried out, &#39;Lord, save me!&#39;
Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught Peter,
and said to him, &#39;O you of little faith, why did you doubt?&#39;...&quot;
