Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the Twenty-first Sunday in Ordinary Time.

&quot;...&#39;And so I say to you, you are Peter,
and upon this rock I will build my church,
and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.
Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;
and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&#39;
Then he strictly ordered his disciples
to tell no one that he was the Christ.&quot;
