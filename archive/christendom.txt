Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the fifth Sunday of Easter. 
He is risen, alleluia, alleluia!

&quot;Jesus said to his disciples:
&quot;Do not let your hearts be troubled.
You have faith in God; have faith also in me.
In my Father&#39;s house there are many dwelling places.
If there were not,
would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?
And if I go and prepare a place for you,
I will come back again and take you to myself,
so that where I am you also may be.
Where I am going you know the way.&quot;
Thomas said to him,
&quot;Master, we do not know where you are going;
how can we know the way?&quot;
Jesus said to him, I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot;
