Welcome to Christendom!

This week is the fourth Sunday of Easter. 
He is risen, alleluia, alleluia!

&quot;Jesus said again, &quot;Amen, amen, I say to you,
I am the gate for the sheep.
All who came before me are thieves and robbers,
but the sheep did not listen to them.
I am the gate.
Whoever enters through me will be saved,
and will come in and go out and find pasture.
A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy;
I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly.&quot;
