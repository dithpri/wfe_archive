[b]In a quest to help resident deranged otaku [nation]Lucklife[/nation] regain his sanity, we accompanied him and studied his behaviour as he watched japanese cartoons in his mother&#39;s basement. Given the gravity of the situation, an entire team of hawks ([url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]go join them![/url]) and EPSAns were necessary to intervene for the sake of our young friend. We are happy to announce that Luck is already feeling better, and more importantly, lots of natives aren&#39;t &amp;gt;:)[/b]
