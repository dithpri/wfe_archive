The [color=blue]SPECTACULAR TRIAL OF DEMOCRACY THE SECOND[/color] has now been activated. Please cast your votes in the poll below, and remember not to vote for [nation=short]Dishwashia[/nation]. It will remain active until 10pm on April 6, at which point it will self-destruct and the winner shall rise from the ashes like a [color=orange]MIGHTY PHOENIX[/color]. As far as you know, anyway. 

We have enacted a new [color=red]NO PHYSICS JOKES[/color] policy. No exceptions.

[color=red][nation=short]TWONK[/nation] has been dismissed as Bureaucrat Supreme for breaking the NO STUPID RULE. To maintain order, [nation=short]Goodfunjoyself[/nation] has assumed control of the region until a new Bureaucrat Supreme can be elected. So mote it be.[/color]
