Right. It&#39;s time for the third monthly [color=red]SPECTACULAR TRIAL OF DEMOCRACY[/color]

There were only two entries in this month&#39;s election, so I&#39;ve extended the voting period to two days in the hope of possible late entries. Or perhaps Nifty Neenah was always destined to be a two-party society. Beats me, I just update the factbook.

Sorry for the slight delay.
