It&#39;s time for an [color=green][b]OBLIGATORY FACTBOOK UPDATE[/b][/color]. [i]*scripted applause*[/i]
[nation=short]Goodfunjoyself[/nation] remains the WA delegate (really good call there, people) and the [nation=short]Magical Computers of the Bone Zone[/nation] still haven&#39;t done anything productive, as the prophesy foretold (I would recommend changing the flag, but who am I to complain).
Oh, we&#39;re constructing embassies with [region]The Passive States of Aggression[/region], so I guess we&#39;re moving out of our isolationist phase. So that&#39;s cool.
The [color=red]NO STUPID[/color] and [color=red]NO PHYSICS JOKES[/color] policies remain in effect. 

And that&#39;s about it, I suppose. 

&amp;lt;3, [nation]Goodfunjoyself[/nation]

[i]+1 competent leadership points[/i]
