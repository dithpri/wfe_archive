Just for future reference (or past reference, for you non-linear-time rascals), the next [color=red]SPECTACULAR TRIAL OF DEMOCRACY[/color] will be held next Monday, May 9th. However, due to the nature of the coming week applications for the election are being accepted now. Sounds good, no?

I think so.

Enjoy your extra week in office [nation=short]magical computers of the bone zone[/nation] (like you were really planning to do anything anyway).
