We have enacted a new [color=red]NO PHYSICS JOKES[/color] policy. No exceptions.

Also we have decided to make elections monthly to increase [color=green]FREEDOMOCRACY[/color]. That means it&#39;s time for, you guessed it, 

[color=blue]SPECTACULAR TRIAL of DEMOCRACY THE SECOND[/color]. Please hold your applause until the end, thank you.

Send a telegram to [nation=short]Goodfunjoyself[/nation] by 10pm tomorrow, April 5th, to enter into the [color=blue]STD[/color].
Additionally, it hath been decreed that there shall be no back-to-back terms in office. That means that [nation]TWONK[/nation] may not run in this [color=blue]STD[/color]. Chin up, chap. You had a good run.

Your funlord hath spoken. So mote it be.
