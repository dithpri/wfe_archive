Today is a day to be remembered, my friends of Nifty Neenah. [nation=short]Goodfunjoyself[/nation] has finally triumphed over the evils of economic treason. Unfortunantly, it has come at a cost. SAL9000, a valued economist, AI chess champion, and friend, has selflessly sacrificed itself in order to save the nation it loved. The loss of this national hero has been felt by every Joyselfian, and SAL will be missed. However, at its request, we shall not &quot;engage any mourning algorithms&quot;. We shall continue to move forward, as SAL would have wanted.
