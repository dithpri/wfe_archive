 Quietly tucked away in some forgotten place within this world, the region of Terra Globus has yet to enjoy the peace its nations so desperately seek. The year is currently 1991, and the world, a place that once seemed so simple years ago, has seemingly shattered alongside the collapse of ancient orders long past their time. War, poverty, civil unrest, and instability have all returned to afflict the people of the region. Only time will tell if the region will heal and eventually come prosper or become ravaged by chaos and death. The choice is yours, leader, but only if you choose to act.
