[b]Meillur[/b] is a medium-sized role-play region inhabited by a small group of enthusiastic and active role-players. Over a timespan of more than seven years, we have created a unique role-play canon to which all of our players are actively contributing. Some members prefer to post the occasional news update to progress their nation, while others prefer to engage in role-plays to let us know about specific events.
