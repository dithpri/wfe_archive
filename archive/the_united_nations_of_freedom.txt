Welcome:) Here is a link to our constitution https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sBoxc9LJnjFdOL6zqEmqUBbzRqLawJkxxXK6M26bCsc/edit   Please, you could suggest new ideas and ways to run the region!

Our new website for laws and acts for the nation http://theunitednationsoffreedom.webs.com The military website /militaryofunf.webs.com/ The Enviormental group website. http://katagonianenviroment.webs.com/
 

Check the website daily and look at the news, calender and video presentations. We love nations voting:) 

A new party from the Lorax has formed and will be working with the original: The Enviormental Party.

 I suggest voting on the future acts.  We love newcomers and are always active!
