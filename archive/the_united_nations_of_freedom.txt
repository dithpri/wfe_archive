In 2013, we will use a new tool to give presentations on our website. Its called UDRAW on the PS3. It is good for me to share my ideas in visual.

Our new website for laws and acts for the nation http://theunitednationsoffreedom.webs.com The military website /militaryofunf.webs.com/

Check the website daily and look at the news, calender and video presentations. Voting for delegate starts on Jan. 7th

 I suggest voting on the future acts. Nations can nominee for delegate until the 7th:-)
