Welcome:) In 2013, we will use a new tool to give presentations on our website. Its called UDRAW on the PS3. It is good for me to share my ideas in visual. Please, you could suggest new ideas and ways to run the region!

Our new website for laws and acts for the nation http://theunitednationsoffreedom.webs.com The military website /militaryofunf.webs.com/

Check the website daily and look at the news, calender and video presentations. Polls for voting the delegate are on the website and message board. If you want you can telegram me your vote.

 I suggest voting on the future acts.  We love newcomers and are always active!
