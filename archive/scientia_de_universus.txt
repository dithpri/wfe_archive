Scientia de Universus is a region hidden in time. 
A place for discovery, and a place for learning. 
All religions are accepted because all religions profess the same profound faith in regards to divine energy.
Everyone is treated equally, for everybody is the same underneath all of the many layers of society.
This region is a place of compassion, common sense, and curiosity.
It is a spiritual place.
All who enter find something that they never knew they were looking for.
Because here, what you seek is seeking you.
