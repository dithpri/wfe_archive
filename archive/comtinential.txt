Comtinential is a region located in the North-Western Hemisphere. It is comprised of several subcontinents and were originally used as colony sites for other nations. Over time it has developed into several nations that change their alliance statuses regularly. At the moment, the region is dominated by Danustar, as it owns the most territory, although its economy is going through a rough period.
