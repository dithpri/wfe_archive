[region]The Black Hawks[/region] love to cook. That&#39;s why we swang by your region, as we saw a whole host of scrumptious ingredients just waiting to be cooked into the most delicious tag raid pie. We searched high and low, and eventually found your secret stash, hidden in a cupboard at the back. It has some sort of message on it, saying... &quot;raiders keep out&quot;? who knows what that could mean. Anyway, if you want to come have a piece of the pie, [url=https://discord.gg/YudSM5B8]come join us![/url].
