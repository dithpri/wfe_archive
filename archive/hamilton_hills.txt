Anyone is welcome. I&#39;m not encouraging anyone to join nor discouraging. We are a very laid-back community that is run by The Republic of Weghorst, but decisions are made by everyone. I am making a region that is run by everyone, not only The Republic of Weghorst. Go ahead and send over a Telegram if you have any concerns and I&#39;ll go ahead and change the stuff you want me to change.
