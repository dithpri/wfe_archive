Naggaroth is the westerly homeland of the Dark Elves, who have colonized it since they were exiled from their homeland in Ulthuan and is located in the continent known as the New World. The region was settled by the Dark Elves thousands of years ago following their defeat in the Elven civil war, and was established as their realm under Malekith the Witchking.
