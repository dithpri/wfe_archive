Due to a war that nearly destroyed Delia, the New Corenean government and the survivors entered the shuttle and settled into a life supporting planet and called it Mannyvin and set up colonies and protectorate nations into the Commonwealth. New Corenea will dominate the Commonwealth in Mannyvin. Mannyvin had set up alliances with Eos and Brutus (formerly known as Delia) and is in lukewarm, but friendly terms with Aiur.

Mannyvin have five continents:  Indar, Esamir, Amerish, Searhus, and Oshur.
