Atlantia Islands is a vibrant, active roleplaying region. No matter your seniority, you can apply for an officer position, run for executive officer, draft laws and constitutions, take part in our many polls and elections, create histories and alternate histories, enjoy chat with the regions in our community, be a staff or contributor to the regional newspaper, fight battles, defend against invaders, and of course, role play on the regional message boards. Any new player in our region is welcome to become an important member of the community. Hope to see you in Atlantia.
