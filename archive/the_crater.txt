Founded by the nation of Shmeckstaine when they released dozens of nuclear warheads to clear territory for expansion, it and its other crappy neighbors now inhabit the gigantic crevice created by the blast. It is the perfect environment for making bank, due to the valuable uranium deposits that are practically everywhere. To its rulers, it is a paradise, to its other, less fortunate inhabitants, it is... something else.
