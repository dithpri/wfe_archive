After &#147;Phase One&#148; of Shmeckstaine&#146;s plot for world domination was completed, the nation released some of the most powerful weaponry ever seen, simultaneously acting as a warning to all those who dare oppose it and clearing the way for expansion. It and several of its allies flooded into this new territory, creating the region of the Crater. At first it seemed like just any other horrific capitalist dystopia, but then, The Machine was created. It transformed Shmeckstaine into what is now recognized as the most eminent threat to humanity&#146;s survival: The Apparatus. Now, after liberating several nations from their meaty shackles, they have set their sights higher&#133; and Phase Three is now underway.
