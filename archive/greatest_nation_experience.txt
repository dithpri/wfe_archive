Welcome to the Greatest Nation Experience, a region only for students in the Greatest Learning Experience on Edmodo!

If you would like to join, but are not part of the Edmodo class directly tied to this region, please contact either the founder or WA delegate for negotiations. 

Also, in order to defend ourselves from raider regions, I would kindly ask any new members to telegram me personally with their true identity. This is to be sure we aren&amp;#39;t slowly and stealthily invaded. 

With the implementation of the new economic marketplace known as bytecoins, I would like to encourage all nations to join and take part. My nation is an exchange, but you do not need to use it. There are many others, mine is not required.

Once again, welcome!
