Thing&#146;s have taken a turn for the worst here in Eastern Europe. God is dead and Nuzozya killed her. Celtastica, of the Far East, and easily the strongest Nation in all of Europe, has been bested in combat by Nuzozya and her puppets. All that remained is small pockets of Promaya, Ratian, and Clarington. After years of hard labor, Promaya has abandoned her allies in an attempt to escape to the forgotten lands of Northern Merrica. This reckless decision resulted in the annexation of Clarington by Nuzozya. Now with Ratian the sole remaining opponent of Nuzozya, things look bleak for Eastern Europe.
