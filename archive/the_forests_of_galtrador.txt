This neverending flatland of great oaks, bogs, and grassy meadows is home to the Free Folk, organized into great clans and families that largely govern themselves. They are sworn to fight with others in the Confederacy of Free Clans for the common defense, but they resuming warring with each other over petty insults and boundary disputes the instant the realm&amp;#39;s common enemies are vanquished. Other peoples are welcome to join the Free Folk in the Forests of Galtrador, but if they do, they will be treated as a free family, with the same amount of power as any other family or clan in the Great Assembly.
