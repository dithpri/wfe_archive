Pan-Islamism is a political movement advocating the unity of Muslims under one Islamic state &#150; often a Caliphate &#150; or an international organization  with Islamic principles. As a form of internationalism and anti-nationalism, Pan-Islamism differentiates itself from pan-nationalistic ideologies, for example Pan-Arabism, by seeing the ummah (Islamic community) as the focus of allegiance and mobilization, excluding ethnicity as primary factors towards unification.
