Ravelia (also known as Bol&eacute;ro) is a region populated by countries whom are noted for their citizens&amp;#39; interest in the arts, particularly music, and who prefer to use clean and efficient negotiation to achieve their goals as opposed to brute military force (though if driven to call in the armed forces, these nations will show no mercy.) Base freedoms such as choice of religion and a non-censored press are held dear to these countries. They tend to distance themselves from dictatorships, military police states, and other nations whose methods they deem to be unsuitable for governing a peoples. To rid the world of these corrupt countries is the ultimate goal of this region.
