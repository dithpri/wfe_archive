[color=#0f5263][b]Welcome to the WA Defense Force[/b][/color]
The Defense Force&#39;s main objective is to counteract any raiding groups who try to seize power through a hostile takeover. We operate under the command of the high-power delegates of the [B][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url][/B]. Each delegate of one of the Pacific Regions has a permanent vote in the operations of the WA Defense Force. In addition, the three highest endorsed delegates, excluding the Pacifics, also have a vote. These nations will determine the operations of the defense force on a day to day basis.
For more information on the operations of the WA DF, view our [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1055433]code of conduct[/url][/b].
