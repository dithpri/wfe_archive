[color=red][b] RENAISSANCE WILL REBUILD AND BECOME THE STRONG DEMOCRATIC REGION WE WERE BUILT TO BE [/b][/color]
We will invite new nations. We will define this region as a [b] liberal and democratic hub [/b] where new ideas are applauded and constructive feedback is welcomed. We will become a raid-proof region by building a strong sense of oneness.
Renaissance will be once again glorious, we&amp;#39;ve learnt our mistakes as a region, we will learn from those mistakes and make our region better than ever.
