[color=red][b] RENAISSANCE WILL REBUILD AND BECOME THE STRONG DEMOCRATIC REGION WE WERE BUILT TO BE [/b][/color]

In order to do so, we must have new nations.

We will invite new nations. We will define this region as a [b] liberal and democratic hub [/b] where new ideas are applauded and constructive feedback is welcomed. We will become a raid-proof region by building a strong sense of oneness.

Renaissance will be once again glorious, we&amp;#39;ve learnt our mistakes as a region, we will learn from those mistakes and make our region better than ever.

[b] [color=red] AND IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE ACTIONS EACH AND EVERY NATION HERE DOES[/b] [/color]
[b] [color=gold]We will:
1) Invite new nations
2) Tell them the freedom they will enjoy in this region
3) Develop identity and social construct of region [/b][/color]
