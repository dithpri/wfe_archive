[b][color=darkblue]Renaissance is not dead. Once again we face the daunting challenge of rebuilding a beat down region. We can only do this collectively! It&amp;#39;s not about what one nation wants, it&amp;#39;s about what we can achieve together. I propose we start with a steering committee to have these conversations, debates, and ultimately reach compromise on how to build a fair and strong democracy.
