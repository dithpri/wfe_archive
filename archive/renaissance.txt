[color=red][b]Let&amp;#39;s rebuild Renaissance in to a strong and active one![/b][/color]
[color=darkblue]Our region is a [b] liberal and democratic hub [/b] where new ideas are applauded and constructive feedback is always welcomed.

Renaissance will be once again glorious! We&amp;#39;ve learnt from our mistakes as a region, and we aim to make a better go of things this time.[/color]
