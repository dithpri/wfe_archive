[b][color=scarlet]This region has been liberated from Defender control by the Knights of [region]Auralia[/region] on August 27th, 2015![/color]

[color=#bab516]Founded in 2003-2004, before founders, founding dates, and factbook entries were recorded, this region was one of the first Invader organizations to take up arms against Defenders, declaring war on [region]10000 Islands[/region]. The region later went inactive and eventually lost the conflict, and remained a colony of 10000 Islands for 5 years.[/color]

As there is no community left to assume control, this region is now a protectorate of [region]Auralia[/region].
