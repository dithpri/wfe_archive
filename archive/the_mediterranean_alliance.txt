In the year 2023, against the backdrop of a rapidly changing world, the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea came together to form an unprecedented alliance known as the Mediterranean Alliance. Driven by a shared vision of cooperation, integration, and collective progress, these nations set out to shape the future of the region.

The Mediterranean Alliance emerged as a response to the growing recognition of the interconnected challenges faced by its member countries. Rising sea levels, environmental degradation, economic disparities, and migration pressures compelled the Mediterranean nations to forge a united front, transcending borders and working together for the greater good.

Officially founded on 5/8/23
