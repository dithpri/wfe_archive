&amp;#129452;&amp;#127913; [b]The Loyal Order of Water Buffalo[/b] is a boisterous Bedrock lodge region devoted to [i]brotherhood, ritual, and extremely important meetings[/i] that mostly exist to justify oversized fezzes and mysterious lodge business. Governed by tradition, secret handshakes, and the unquestioned authority of the [b]Grand Poobah[/b], the region values loyalty, camaraderie, and the fine art of avoiding domestic responsibilities in favor of bowling &amp;#127923; and chanting in unison. [i]Yabba-dabba-doo![/i]
