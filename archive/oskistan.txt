Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. Just as a candle cannot burn without fire, men cannot live without a spiritual life. Health is the greatest gift, but to enjoy good health, to bring true happiness to one&#39;s family, to bring peace to all, one must first discipline and control one&#39;s own mind. If a man can control his mind he can find the way to Enlightenment, and all wisdom and virtue will naturally come to him. We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.
