Welcome to the Eurasia Centrist Coalition,

The Eurasian Centrist Coalition (ECC) is a loosely joined alliance of nations with European, and Asian descent that have broken off from their respective homelands to find their own brand of glory.

The ECC stands by Centrist political beliefs, extending to all branches of their citizens lives.

The most honourable founder, [Nation]Zhenmay[/Nation] sees fit that the nations who inhabit the borders of the Eurasia Centrist Coalition, should ultimately be led by the most influential nation in our ranks, adhering to a loose democratic process where all decisions are put to a vote.
