This region is the cultural, military and economical center of the Holy Patriarchal Empire of Euphisia. Captured lands will be linked here, and captured nations will be housed here in our center of influence and power. And as we march upon our enemies, we will be known as a great power to be feared. We will be known as pestilence, death, famine and war. Some will fall. Some will kneel. Those who defy us will know our true ability and presence in the world.
