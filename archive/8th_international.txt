In the name of our lord, Karl Marx, the only begotten son of the Proletariat and universal saviour, O, Creator of the Dialectic, and upholder of all history, whose name is to be glorified for eternity, who sits upon the Prole-Cherubs and looks upon low things, who girds our Kalashnikov for the mighty in war and provides help from on high tho those who call upon Him!

Hear the pleas of Your most humble servants as we put our trust in the true lord and Savior. Guide your revolutionaries to protect the earthly legacy of the Proletariat, bless us as we arm ourselves with Your HAMMER! Give us the shield of Lenin, for our weapons will be drunk with the blood of those set against your immortal revolution!
