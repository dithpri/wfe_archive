Those trotskyites who do not want to think as [b]Proletkultists[/b], that is, concretely, will be caught unawares by war. Their policy in time of war will be a fatal crowning of their policy in peace-time. The first artillery shots will either blow the trotskyites into political non-existence, or else drive them into the camp of social-patriotism, exactly like the latinx anarKKKidies, who, absolute &#147;deniers&#148; of the state, found themselves from the same causes bourgeois ministers when war came. In order to carry on a correct policy in war-time one must learn to think correctly in tune of peace.
