[b]The [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy went on one hell of a ride today, setting out to capture many regions, we were unexpectedly hit by a storm that rocked our fleet. Our sailors stood steadfastly though, and we were able to capture some of our plunder, before we were thoroughly knocked off our feet. Thanks for letting us dock here for safety!
