It is 2062, Not much more than a banner to fall under in times of crisis, the CyberNet Conglomerate security forces drift through the net to fight hackers who fight for the Megacorporations. There is little resemblance of government outside of the Megacorporations influence and slums extending miles into the sky house much of the region&amp;#39;s population. The rich are incredibly rich and the poor have nothing except compulsory cybernetic implants and the computers that are linked to their brains. It is a dark world plagued by climate catastrophe and it almost always rains. A thick shroud of darkness encircles the globe and the Earth is a very different place.
