  We are a fearless yet careful people who stands for itself and the others in the Alliance.
Although we are quick to change we are mostly conservative and tend to shift issues in are favor. 
We are proud members of the Alliance and will hold the line against enemy&#39;s that attack us.

We are nations based off the freewill of a leader to make a difference in his or her nation.
The Alliance being composed of nations who are willing to work has made a strong force. With hard work and devotion any nation-state can get in a rather powerful seat in the Alliance of Free Nations.
