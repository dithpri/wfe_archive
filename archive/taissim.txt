The region of Taissim is located to the North of the world. The climate is generally between 44 and 65F. The region is mostly one single landmass but has a few islands close by.

I hope we can make this an active place for roleplay between region members, including establishing history and relationships between nations. Once you join, if you&amp;#39;d like to position yourself on the map, feel free to do it yourself and then post it in the region thread (it&amp;#39;ll be made soon) or telegram the founder.

I would also love to see any Hetalia-style personifications of people&amp;#39;s nations (that&amp;#39;s original ones, not the ones who are actually found in the series).
