East Har is a mighty land for those who understand that freedom is not necessary to successfully rule a country. We do not like human or political rights, and they are only acceptable in the land of close friends. We all follow a religion named Seanism and we all use the currency of Har Bucks.

This is our land. 

This is the mighty East Har!
