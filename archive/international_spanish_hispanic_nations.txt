The International Spanish &amp; Hispanic Nations is about the culture from the Mediterranean Sea. You can speak freely with no language barrier. Any nation that is described as Spanish, Portuguese, French, or Romanian can join this region. We allow English and the Romantic languages. We discuss about unique topics like soccer, birds, colors, and more. I hope you could be interested to join our region. Goodbye!

Note: There is a blank space where the &quot;and&quot; should be, this is required for submission.
