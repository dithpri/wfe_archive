This is the headquarters of the United Empire of Islam Liberation Front. This region and this organization has one purpose and one purpose alone: [b]To bring down [region]United Empire of Islam[/region][/b] (UEI), one of the most tyrannical regions in NationStates.

UEI has been systematically purging its members for some time now, and offering poor or no explanations for doing so, so this region will be a home both for those who&amp;#39;ve been victimized by UEI&amp;#39;s leadership, as well as people who sympathize with them.

Nations of all faiths and ideologies are welcome here. The only requirement for membership is a committment to bringing down [region]United Empire of Islam[/region]. All embassy proposals from regions that don&amp;#39;t have an embassy with United Empire of Islam will be accepted.
