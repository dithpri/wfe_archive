[i]Why do people like you create these fake little duplicate accounts and create these fake communist regions, and then just use them to talk bad about communism in this case you said that maoism was bad, well why call your region &quot;Maoist Communist Collective&quot;? If you&#39;re really against it why not just state it in the name, are ou trying to lure us communists in so then after you trick us you can show us your message, you don&#39;t even use proper grammar you just said &quot;Maoism bad&quot;, nor do you explain how it is bad.You sounded pretty childish with that grammar.I think it is bad to have a socialist revolution and then force the people to work with the bourgeoisie.[/i]

Er- Maoism still bad.
