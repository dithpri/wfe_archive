[color=blue]Welcome to the Free Region of Minecraftia![/color]

We are a friendly and helpful also loyal Region! We have weekly (hopefully) newspapers mostly by: [nation]The_United_Cities_of_Minecraft[/nation]
We have a Draft of the Constitution, so we are a young-ish region.
(Not considering our staff is young, the region is. ITS A EXPRESSION.)
We have no harassing staff.
