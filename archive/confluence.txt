Countless realities persist simultaneously right alongside eachother. Blinking in and out of existence trillions of times every second. But something about this chamber at the bottom of the world, deep below Dnoristan, distorts the frequencies. This empty space, carved over millenia by the patient hand of nature, clutches the parallel strings of separate realities in a single hand and brings them together.

A gateway. A merger. A confluence.
