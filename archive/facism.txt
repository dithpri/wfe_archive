[b][color=#009ddc]Facism is a very common typo for Fascism, the ideology that has no place anywhere on NationStates.[/color][/b]

Facism has been taken by [region=Minoa] since 10/10/12 to help keep racism and extremism out of NationStates, and make it harder for hate speech to thrive on this site.

Everyone is encouraged to use this region to help kick racism out of NationStates and real life.
