[i]Alright, I&#39;ve been thinking. When life gives you lemons, don&#39;t make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don&#39;t want your damn lemons; what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life&#39;s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I&#39;m the man who&#39;s gonna burn your house down... with the lemons! I&#39;m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down![/i]
