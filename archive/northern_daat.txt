The Region of Da&#39;at was originally colonized by right wing separatists from the Great Nation of Boletus. The Region was chosen to be  inhabited due to it&#39;s fertile soil, clean water, and relatively few predatory animals such as Grus or Mantacores. Due to recent government spending cuts and recent investigations conducted by the World Assembly communists and libertarians have had few helicopter related incidents and as such all nations in the region are in a state of peace with each other.
