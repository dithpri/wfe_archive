[b][i]&amp;quot;It is difficult to cast my mind&amp;#39;s eye back to the Caprivi, where I see rows and rows of white crosses, many of them marking the graves of men I had known intimately. There are hundreds of them, all identical, at the heads of little heaps of earth on which wives, children, and friends used to lay bunches of indigenous flowers and personal relics from the daily lives of the fallen heroes.&amp;quot;[/i][/b] [color=#0C1C8C][b]- Jan Breytenbach[/b][/color]
