The area of Obersalzberg was purchased by the Nazis in the 1920s for their senior leaders to enjoy. Hitler&#39;s mountain residence, the Berghof, was located here. Berchtesgaden and its environs (Stanggass) were fitted to serve as an outpost of the German Reichskanzlei office (Imperial Chancellery), which sealed the area&#39;s fate as a strategic objective for Allied forces in World War II.
