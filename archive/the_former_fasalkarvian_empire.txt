The Fasalkarvian Empire was a totalitarian state ran by a dynasty of incompetent monarchs known for their inability to care for their subjects as anything more than inconvenient cattle, so it was only a matter of time before its citizens reached their breaking point. The region consists of the northern island Lavaralskan, the central island Balorvosikan, and the southern island Salduriskan.
