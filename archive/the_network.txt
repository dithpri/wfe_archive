The Time is the near future, resources are dwindling, the seas are rising and around the world nations are trying to find a way to survive the future.

It is the 2030s, technology has advanced, and solutions need to be found to replace oil, monoculture and wasteful manufacturing.

This region is dedicated to PMT players, who have an interest in future technology and society. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you are peaceful or warlike, dictators, monarchs, anarchists or elected senates. You may have lunar colonies, powered armor, stealth suits, underwater cities and anything  short of a fleet of spaceships.

I expect those who join to keep up some kind of dialog via telegrams, region message board posts or forum posts.
