The Network; A bustling hub of trains, people and Hive Monks.
Spread across many worlds, many planets.
From Cleave to Desdemor, Golden Junction to Ambersai.
[i]Quod fieri necesse est, ut mille luminaribus caeli lucere super! March diluculo impetu et avaritia et flamma de terris et inducam misericordia est necesse! Et venite, et quasi in multis sed vivamus.[/i]

[b]OUR LAW:[/b]
1. The Network is Free! We have no sort of Dictatorship-ish rulership!
2. We Accept ANYONE! and we mean [b]ANYONE[/b]
3. Politics is [b]GOOD[/b], Why else do we play this game?
4. Elections! Unless changed by the leading house then we have elections every once in a while, moderated by the Guardians
