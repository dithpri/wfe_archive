The United ATTP (Adversaries of the Thought Police) is a region founded on the principles of sophisticated free thinking. This is not a place that is disorganised and lacks purpose, a common side effect of too much freedom. While we are philosophers, we don&amp;#39;t wander in the deserts and badlands of the mind such as biggotry, fanaticism, and extremism. We don&amp;#39;t waste time on issues that are not worthy of advanced human minds, rather we are the spear tip of elite thinkers. We balance freedom and government in a way that quickly stomps out nonsense in our region before it is set ablaze, while immediately adopting a radical principle if it proves itself useful to the advancement of our region, no matter what the masses think of it.
