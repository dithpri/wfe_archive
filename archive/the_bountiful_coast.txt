The Bountiful Coast weaves gently down from the temperate mountains to the north to the lush rainforests and arid plateaus of the south. Scattered throughout the tranquil nearby sea are thousands of islands and archipelagos, sporting all manner of unique flora and fauna - and all manner of wild and undiscovered polities.
