[i]In the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany, Germany renounced all claims to territory east the Oder-Neisse line. Germany&#39;s recognition of the border was repeated in the German-Polish Border Treaty on November 14, 1990. The treaties were made by both German states and ratified in 1991 by a united Germany. These restrictive treaties are now dissolved by order of the Reichspr&auml;sident, and Germany will again rise.
