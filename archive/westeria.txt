Founded on 08/16/2016, Westeria is a politically hands off community based on anarcho-communism. 
The rules of the region are simple;
Treat each other with respect.
Remember this community is about fun, if you&#39;re not having fun, you don&#39;t need to be in the community. 
We welcome all people; regardless of political, gameplay, or personal beliefs. 
We do not welcome anyone that seeks to harm another person, through; bullying, terrorism, bigotry, or hatred.  

Have Fun,
