[region=The Atlantic] is an independent safe haven originally founded in 2003 as a refuge for nations from our sister region, the then much-invaded [region=Atlantic], refounded in 2010 and open to all who seek shelter from raiders in any region or just a quiet life. If you need any help or have any questions, feel free to ask [nation=Galterama] or [nation=Nurdia], either on the regional message board below or by telegram.
