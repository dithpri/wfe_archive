[color=red][region=The Atlantic]&amp;#39;s borders are currently closed in advance of the Zombie Apocalypse event and will reopen after it ends. Please bear in mind that if you leave the region before the end of the event you will not be able to re-enter until the Apocalypse is over.[/color]
(We realise the closure was a little early and apologise for that; both regional admins may be away closer to when the event starts.)

[color=blue]As in previous years&amp;#39; zombie events nations are advised to research a cure.[/color]
