The Assembly of Rising Countries is a home for nations that are still finding their footing, yet determined to grow stronger. Founded by the Federal Republic of Merane, the region serves as a gathering place for emerging states seeking stability, cooperation, and a voice in the wider world of NationStates.

Our goal is simple: to unite rising nations under one banner, offering a supportive environment for growth while building the foundations of future influence. Through diplomacy, shared knowledge, and collective ambition, the Assembly aims to transform from a small community into a recognized presence on the world stage.
