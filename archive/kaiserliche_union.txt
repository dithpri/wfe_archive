The Kaiserliche Union is the union which replaced the EU in 2047 after the Third World War. It cemented German power for years to come, and all countries in Europe were required to join. In 2056, Germany re-introduced the Euro which would unite all Europe&#39;s currencies and spread German economic prosperity to all of Europe.
Today, the Kaiserliche Union is powerful and ready to fight on for the glory of Warnerism and Germany.
