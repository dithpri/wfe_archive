[i]Under a one hour flight from the island of Tahiti or Moorea, the island of [b]Bora Bora[/b], with a lagoon resembling an artist&#39;s palette of blues and greens, is love at first sight. Romantics from around the world have laid claim to this island where the castle-like Mount Otemanu pierces the sky. Lush tropical slopes and valleys blossom with hibiscus, while palm-covered motu circle the illuminated lagoon like a delicate necklace. Perfect white-sand beaches give way to emerald waters where colored fish animate the coral gardens as they greet the giant manta rays. Simply said, Bora Bora is the most beautiful island in the world.[/i] [url=http://www.tahiti-tourisme.com][color=336699]Bora Bora[/color][/url][hr]
