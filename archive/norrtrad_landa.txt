Nestled deep within the cool, dense forests of the North, Norrtrad Landa is a fertile valley of extraordinary natural beauty. Its many diverse peoples are required to live their lives by an ancient moral code known simply as &quot;Da Wae&quot;, and those who fail to do so are never seen or heard from again. Citizens are held accountable for their own actions and are expected to remain productive and courteous at all times regardless of the circumstances. Health, education, and welfare are also considered core elements of life in Norrtrad Landa, while personal privacy is viewed as unnecessary and obstructive.
