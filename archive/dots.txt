I can drink my Starbucks
I can have a Toby Chip
But even if I don&#146;t
I still can have a good day, have a good day

[Verse]
I love the Toby Chip, it&#39;s so delicious
Oh&amp;#8287;my&amp;#8287;goodness,&amp;#8287;it&#39;s so good
I&#39;m&amp;#8287;on a diet,&amp;#8287;I felt good
[?][Chorus]

I can have a Toby Chip
But even if I don&#146;t
I still can have a good day, have a good day
