[Color=#2266D6]The Ring offers [/color][color=seablue] two [i]very[/i] long beaches[/color][Color=#2266D6], the [/color][color=seablue]best cocktails[/color][Color=#2266D6] this side of the South Pacific, a very convenient [/color][color=seablue]circular layout[/color][Color=#2266D6] (how quaint!) and some of the [/color][color=seablue]best snorkeling[/color][Color=#2266D6] you&#39;ll find anywhere.
