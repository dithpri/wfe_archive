Rules:
1) No discriminatory comments/statements.
2) Don&#39;t be toxic (that doesn&#39;t mean that cussing is banned).
3) Don&#39;t use your real names, as strangers can spectate our message boards.
4) If you want to raid a certain region, give a reason and we&#39;ll create a poll
5) Discord will be plugged later. Rules 1-4 will apply there as well.
