The - scientifically proven! - roundest region in NationStates! This is none other than [i]THE RING[/i]!
[i]Est. Sept. 17, 2017[/i]

Home to two [i]very[/i] long beaches, the best cocktails served in perfectly round coconuts this side of the South Pacific, and a convenient and quaint circular layout - the Ring.

As the region is still very new, there is no sort of government or system or somesuch nonesense. For now, getting to know new people and making new friends is all the fun required :)
