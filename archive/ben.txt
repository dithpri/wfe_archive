[b][color=#169ed9]The humble namesake abode of[/color][/b][color=red] [b]Ben de Hamster[/b]![/color]

[B][color=#30c591]Ben[/color][/B][color=#169ed9] is a raider for many organizations. That doesn&#39;t mean Ben is a big mean hamster. More or less, Ben just feels that taking regions and [b][u]writing his name on them[/u][/b] is very therapeutic! If you happen to see Ben, [b]please don&#39;t poke him. Ben&#39;s fur is very sensitive.[/b][/color]

[B][color=#30c591]Ben[/color][/B] [color=#7e3ff2][b][u]does not want fights[/b][/u]. Keep your slandering and libelling, be it IC or OOC away from his ears. Ben also does not understand and will never understand politics, let alone NS politics and the drama that it carries. Ben is here to just vibe and learn from other people and share experiences. Deal with it punk! [/color]

[color=#763a7a]Last of all.[/color][b] [color=#30c591]Ben[/color] [color=#763a7a][u]is not perfect[/u][/color][/b]. 

[color=#00b300][b]If you managed to reach this far down the WFE, Ben hopes you know him much better now (^_^)[/b][/color][b][/b]
