Richard Mulhouse &quot;Not A Crook&quot; Nixon was an American President, statesman, hero, and victim. This region is dedicated in his memory, and for anyone curious about this American icon, and the conspiracy by the media, liberals, hippies, commies, Republicans, Democrats, and beatniks. 

If you look at the actual sources, you will discover that nothing really happened at the Watergate Hotel on June 17, 1972. 
And if it did, no one tried to cover it up. 
And if they did, Nixon didn&#39;t know about it. 
And if he did, he didn&#39;t order it. 
And if he did, the tapes that may or may not show that are protected by executive privilege. 
And if they aren&#39;t, then SHUT 
THE HELL 
UP 
YOU
