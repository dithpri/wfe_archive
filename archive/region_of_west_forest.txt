The Region of West Forest is a little know region of the world. It is a island region located in between Greenland and Svalbard. It is an island over run by forest even though the cold climate. The wildlife is impeccable and the islands are roamed by wolf packs, though they do not attack the human civilisation. The islands are big enough for both the humans and the animals and they live peacefully side by side.
