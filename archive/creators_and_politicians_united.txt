We are a (very) new region striving to create a thriving community for those who enjoy artistry and swimming in issues. My goal, as the founder of CPU, is to create an environment where everyone can participate in the creation of a fully fleshed-out world, complete with maps, roleplaying complex diplomacy between member countries, and maybe even languages (for all those conlangers out there)! 

I, Profugia, will always be available through the regional message board and telegrams, so feel free to contact me! Once we have enough members, at least 5 or so, we&#39;ll put together a constitution.

Create, Debate, and Prosper!
