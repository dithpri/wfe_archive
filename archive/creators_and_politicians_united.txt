We are a (very) new region striving to create a thriving community for those who enjoy artistry and swimming in issues. My goal, as the founder of CPU, is to create an environment where everyone can participate in the creation of a fully fleshed-out world, complete with maps, roleplaying complex diplomacy between member countries, and maybe even languages (for all those conlangers out there)! 

Here&#39;s [url=https://discord.gg/3RfpG8K]the link to the Discord[/url]. [u][b]You must have your nation&#39;s name somewhere in the name you use to join.[/b][/u] The regional message board on NationStates itself will be used for inter-regional politics, pretty much everything else is on there.

Once we have enough members, at least 5-10 or so, we&#39;ll put together a constitution.

Create, Debate, and Prosper!
