We are a (very) new region striving to create a thriving community for those who enjoy artistry and swimming in issues. My goal, as the founder of CPU, is to create an environment where everyone can participate in the creation of a fully fleshed-out world, complete with maps, roleplaying complex diplomacy between member countries, and maybe even languages (for all those conlangers out there)! 

So that we can have more than one message board for creation and roleplaying, I&#39;ve created a Discord server at https://discord.gg/aZRrwn . [b]You must use you nation&#39;s name to join.[/b] The regional message board on NationStates itself will be used for inter-regional politics.

Create, Debate, and Prosper!
