After several years of conflict, the territories of an unstable region have banded together to become the Mind Empire. We use economic and influential means to participate in world affairs, and we have heavy say due to our control of the Middle Canal. The Lotrabme Capital city of Central city is the meeting place of the Regional Senate. 

This is the current Map: When a new state emerges they may request a portion of territory or be given one if they don&amp;#39;t mind where they stay. Each nation is independent to govern Itself, but it must defer to the guidelines of the region, which are to be decided in our Next Constitutional Convention.
