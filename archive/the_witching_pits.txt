[b][i]Welcome to [region]The Witching Pits[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

This dark and infernal dungeon is the lair of [nation=short]Sargon the Death Teller[/nation], a vile, wicked sorcerer of the Rat Clan. Nearly as mad as the [nation=short]King of Armello[/nation], Sargon too is being twisted by the Rot as it devours his soul. However, the Rat does not care, believing he has found a way to extend his life permanently.

Within the pages of an ancient tome, he has found the instructions for a forgotten ritual to summon a Bane and use its life force to sustain his own. However, he also will require a way to restrain the demonic creature and he&#39;s lost his spellbook containing a ritual of binding somewhere in the dungeon! Whichever Clan scores the most points will help him find it and become his ally, winning the region!
