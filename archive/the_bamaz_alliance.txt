BAMAZ (sometimes known as BARAZ) was founded during the so-called, &amp;quot;war of the dawn,&amp;quot; where Brigid Nation and PrincessAshleyLand united to push the invaders from the North out of MercedesLand and Amylonia. The military forces of Brigid Nation and Amylonia were virtually non-existant, these countries aiding through taking refugees and transporting supplies, and soon the PrincessAshleyLand and MercedesLand militaries had become overwhelmed. The Most Holy Empire ZO was called upon for nuclear aid, and the war was won. The BAMAZ Alliance is often divided by their extremely opposing political views, and often other countries will join the region to help resolve internal conflicts, but this is traditionally a five-country region.
