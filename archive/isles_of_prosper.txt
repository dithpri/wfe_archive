Derived from the Region SmorgasLands, The country Edulus was sick of the treatment they were getting from the &amp;quot;superior&amp;quot; countries, and voted on leaving them. It took a few years to deintegrate their country from the SmorgasLands, but eventually they created their own turf. Welcoming any countries looking for a new region!
