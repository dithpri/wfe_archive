The Coalition of the Independent, Glorious, and Grand Ole Dictatorships is dedicated to maintaining an conservative foothold in the world and rebelling against the WA with noncompliant dictatorship states. The region can participate in votes (polls) to decide rules. Poll results can be overridden by the high Chancellor, but he could be overridden by a unanimous vote. The lower Chancellor deals with day to day issues and writes new membership letters. As the region grows more positions can be added. If you have an idea for an office contact the High Chancellor.
