Welcome to Meat Rack, a land of literal filth.

Here we live in anarchy. We literally do not care what you do or say. You have a right to free speech and you will not be punished for what you express. We also believe strongly in democracy, and once we have more nations part of our anarchist union, we will have a bi-weekly election of a WA delegate. The details of this process will be detailed in the Meat Rack Constitution, which has not yet been written.

It is encouraged to have WA membership but it is not required.

Come join us today to chop some meat and put it on the meat rack!
