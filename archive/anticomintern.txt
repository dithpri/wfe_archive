[b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b]

[i]Taken: 01/03/13[/i]

[i]Fascists kicked: [color=red]8[/color][/i]

[color=red]Captured from [region]The Greater German Reich[/region], it now serves as a living museum against hate.[/color]

[color=blue]This region was founded by right wing fascists in an attempt to create a fascist [region]Antifa[/region][/color].

We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.
