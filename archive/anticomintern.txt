The Anti-Communist International was founded on December 19th, 2012, in order to combat the growing influence of communist nations and regions within NationStates.

Any anti-communist nation may join, and leaders of anti-communist regions are advised to make a puppet nation to represent their region here. Representatives from these member regions form the interregional General Assembly.
