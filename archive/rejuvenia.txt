Regional elections are every 4 months (April, August, December) and the delegate is determined by endorsements. Nations become a member by joining the map and only members can participate in region rp. Only one member nation per player. Telegram [nation=noflag]Radical Republic[/nation] to become a member, and [nation=noflag]Duechland[/nation] to get on the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1292779]map[/url].


I regret to inform that this region and its predecessor region have decided to draw everything to a conclusion. The rp and all of it&#39;s canon have concluded and the game is over. Thank you to all who participated.
