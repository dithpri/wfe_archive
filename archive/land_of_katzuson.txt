After years of forced separation, the alive remnants of the now destroyed [region]Legion of the Shadow Stag[/region], finally reunited under a new banner, this time more fierce and brutal and without mercy. Led primarily by the [i]Grand Masters[/i] [nation=long]BioTeckar[/nation] and [nation=long]Papere[/nation], this thriving coalition tends to resolve problems via hard and cynical ways. Still, all types of nations are welcome, except anarchists.
