[b][color=crimson]Communist China has endured the two invasions of threat to this region, and has emerged still in one piece. Because of the recent threats towards this Great Socialist Region, the hammer of Maoism is brought to both destroy and rebuild. 

The days of yesterday are past us, all we can do now is look towards the Leading Light of the Future and rebuild this region under Mao Tse Tung thought, and enhance the Revolution brought out to us, and crush the enemy beneath our hammer. 

Together with our comrade regions, we shall form a bond forged by fire and destroy the demons of the past[/b][/color]
