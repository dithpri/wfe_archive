I solemnly, and lovingly, dedicate this Region to the memories of Savitri Devi Mukherji and Asit Krishna Mukherji: Axis espionage agents, writers, devoted National Socialists, and staunch supporters of Hindu Nationalism. They had their faults, we all do, but in the end they were (and are) the pinnacle of what it means to be a National Socialist. May they, truly, rest in peace.
