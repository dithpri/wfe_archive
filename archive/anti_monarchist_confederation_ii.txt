[b]Welcome to the Anti-Monarchist Confederation II[/b] (because the first one died).

This region is a [b]complete democracy[/b], anything (except those declared not allowed in the constitution) can be polled on if requested.

There have been 0 polls so far, so you have the option to request the first poll in this region (preferably when there&#39;s more than 3 people (including me)).
