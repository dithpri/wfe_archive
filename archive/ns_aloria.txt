Aloria is a region based on the minecraft server &quot;MassiveCraft&quot; and it&#39;s lore. The various nations here are run by people who are active on MassiveCraft and also enjoy NationStates. We&#39;re a small but tight-knit group, and only people from MassiveCraft are welcome here (with exceptions for people who are friends of people who play MassiveCraft). Nations here do not need to have MassiveCraft&#39;s lore in mind, as this is an alternate universe to MassiveCraft&#39;s &quot;Aloria&quot; planet.

The original [region]Aloria[/region], as well as it&#39;s second incarnation were founded by Al&#39;Darub (Mecharic). This region is the third reboot, founded by several nations from the old Aloria.
