Welcome to Anderria! We are a region set in the middle ages, with tons of religions maps and cultures to follow. We are a roleplay focused region but there is also lots of space for dicussion and friendly talk. The only rules are to be active in the region and to be nice towards eachother because we all want to be here! We are looking for new members, so [i]please join[/i]
