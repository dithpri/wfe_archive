Welcome to Anderria! The year is 1905 at the height of the european empires. Africa is almost covered in colonies, and the empires are creeping into asia. Will you take control of the europeans and make an empire on which the sun never sets or will you resist the europeans and their empires as an american nation or an asian? Its all up to you...

Remember we are in 1905, tech from the 1st world war is okay, but no further.
Try to be a bit historical or alternate historical
and of course, be nice!
