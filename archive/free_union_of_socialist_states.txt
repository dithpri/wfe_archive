Established in 2014 by [nation]Sociotopia[/nation] and [nation]Biscaia[/nation], the Free Union of Socialist States (F.U.S.S.) is a political, economical and military alliance of socialist states and republics devoted to the proletarian revolution and the establishment of the classless society postulated by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

Based on democratic principles, the F.U.S.S. doesn&#39;t undermine, in any way, the sovereignty of its&#39; member states. All decisions are made collectively by the representatives of each state.
