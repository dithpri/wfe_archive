Due to the historical connection between both regions, Warwick is claimed under the Imperial Crown of Clindea. Clindea is occupied and held by the foreign forces of [region=The Dominion of Markarth] who have no right to the territory. One thinks that after they lost their region, [region=Markarth], they would be sympathetic to someone claiming their region, but it appears they are no better than Raxus. We shall endeavour to reclaim our Kingdom. 

His Imperial and Royal Majesty, [nation=Gavin Novawk], by the Grace of God, King of [region=Clindea] &amp;amp; Emperor of [region=Warwick]
His Imperial Highness, Gavin, by the gift of His Supreme Majesty, Prince Imperial of [region=The Land of Kings and Emperors] &amp;amp; Archduke of [region=Ilum]
Archduke of the Regal Realm of [region=The Kingdom of Denmark]
