Originally founded in 1/28/12 by Vultopia, Foxtopia was a region of fox nations that endured much throughout the course of its eventful two year life span, seeing multiple owners and invasions until it was finally reestablished by its original owner in 2015 [strike](who still currently owns it)[/strike].

Regional factbook is under WIP construction, please standby for the resurgence of vulpine shenanigans.
