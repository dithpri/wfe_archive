Originally founded in 1/28/12 by Vultopia, Foxtopia was a region of fox nations that endured much throughout the course of its eventful two year life span, seeing multiple owners and invasions until it was finally reestablished by its original owner in 2015 (who still currently owns it). What this region is now shall serve as a resting place, a tribute to the wonderful memories that were had here so many years ago.

We are still friends with Benevolent Capitalism, and you will be greatly missed, Macosky.
