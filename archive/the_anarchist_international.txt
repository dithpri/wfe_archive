The [b][color=red]Anarchist International[/color][/b] is an organisation dedicated towards the achievement of a truly just society. We oppose all forms of oppression, as embodied by capitalism, the state, patriarchy, racism, imperialism, etc. and stand for a world of freedom, equality and universal solidarity, as embodied by anarchist communism.

&amp;quot;[i]I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. The freedom of others, far from negating or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation.[/i]&amp;quot;
