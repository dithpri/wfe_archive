Devotion. Learning. Worship. Salvation.

You need to believe in what you can see. If you see me as your God, I&#39;ll be your God. Paul said, &#147;I was a man born out of due season.&#148; I&#146;ve been born out of due season Just like all we are and the best testimony we can make is to leave this forsaken world.

Can&#39;t you hear it, children? Hurry my children, hurry.
You better rejoice.
