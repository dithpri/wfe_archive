The[b] Peoples Temple Agricultural Project[/b], better known by its informal name [b]&quot;Jonestown&quot;[/b], was a remote settlement in Guyana, established by the Peoples Temple, a San Francisco-based cult under the leadership of [nation]Jim Jones[/nation].

The settlement became internationally known when, on November 18, 1978, a total of 918 people died at the settlement, at the nearby airstrip in Port Kaituma, and at a Temple-run building in Georgetown, Guyana&#39;s capital city. The name of the settlement became synonymous with the incidents at those locations.
