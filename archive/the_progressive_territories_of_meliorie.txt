Any territory to join the PT&amp;#39;s of Meliorie, voluntarily or not, can expect to be part of a proud, forward-thinking community. The PTM puts great importance on social welfare, but we do not believe in sustaining those who will not work towards the betterment of our society. When such an individual is recognized, he/she is treated as a liability to society and is dealt with in such a way that he/she either becomes a productive member of the community or he/she no longer drains the resources of the PTM. This method of dealing with social loafers even extends to territories within the PTM. In the PTM, we work towards progress and the betterment of our society through the shedding of blood, sweat and tears.
