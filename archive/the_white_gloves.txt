Baby baby, close your eyes
Go back into your endless dream

Just believe someday you&#39;ll find your hard times gone
Try not too look back on your yesterday

So keep on dreaming for tomorrow
Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re lonely
Don&#39;t give up the loving&amp;#65279;

Song : Tanuki baby baby
