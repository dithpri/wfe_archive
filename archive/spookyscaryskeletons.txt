Spooky scary skeletons
Send shivers down your spine
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
Seal your doom tonight
Spooky scary skeletons
Speak with such a screech
You&#39;ll shake and shudder in surprise
When you hear these zombies shriek
We&#39;re so sorry skeletons
You&#39;re so misunderstood
You only want to socialize
But I don&#39;t think we should
Cause spooky scary skeletons
Shout startling shrilly screams
They&#39;ll sneak from their sarcophagus
And just won&#39;t leave you be
