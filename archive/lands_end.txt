[b]Land&#39;s End is an independent, neutral region, centered around the unrestricted exchange of goods and ideas.[/b] It is intended as a home for capitalist-leaning nations, although all are welcome.

We are organized as a public corporation, run by a CEO and Board of Directors, most of whom are elected by our [url=page=dispatch/id=1308027#shareholders][u][color=black]shareholders[/color][/u][/url]. Sound interesting? We recommend you join the [url=page=un][b][color=black]World Assembly[/color][/b][/url] and our [url=https://discord.gg/rNY5vcJ][b][color=black]Discord chat[/color][/b][/url] to get started!

[i]Proudly serving you since March 17th, 2017.[/i] [b]Do NOT use this region as puppet storage.[/b]
