[b]Land&#39;s End is an independent, neutral region, centered around the unrestricted exchange of goods and ideas.[/b] It is intended as a home for capitalist-leaning nations, although all are welcome. We believe in quality over quantity, not getting offended, and the idea that nobody has ever received a free lunch.

Our highly unique structure sets us apart from other regions. We are organized as a public corporation, run by a CEO and Board of Directors, most of whom are elected by our shareholders. Sound interesting? We recommend you join the [b][url=http://nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url][/b] and our [b][url=https://discord.gg/EXya3sw]Discord chat[/url][/b] to get started!

[i]Proudly serving you since October 19th, 2016.[/i]
