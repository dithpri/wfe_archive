Land&#39;s End is an independent, neutral region, centered around the unrestricted exchange of goods and ideas. It is intended as a home for capitalist-leaning nations, although all are welcome. We believe in quality over quantity, not getting offended, and the idea that nobody has ever received a free lunch.

Construction on this region, as well as the first recruitment drive, is expected to commence in August. Please check back later.
