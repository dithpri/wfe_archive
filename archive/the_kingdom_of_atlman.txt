Wet, windy and home to many different nations ranging from dictatorships to utopias, the Kingdom of ATLMAN is welcome to all. A tight and iron fisted dictatorship himself, the Grand General Governor Sardon of The Kingdom of ATLMAN knows very well the darkness and corruption of governments. 





We are a very large emerging region and will build embassies to bridge peace. We hold elections every six months, but Sardon will appoint you if he deems fit for such position. S Sells Cookies is second in command at the minute. Welcome one and all! Have fun! And remember if you are a WA member, endorse Sardon.
