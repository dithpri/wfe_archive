We are a quiet region. We do not ask much, only that you do not butt into our business. Pose no threat to us, and we shall pose none to you. Our philosophy is simple: Sometimes you just want to play quietly. No raiding, no World Assembly, no international politics. Just a chance to play, enjoy the game, and maybe make a few friends.
