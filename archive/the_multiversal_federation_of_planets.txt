 the Multiversal federation is a peaceful group of allied planets that tries to explore the multiverse and set up diplomatic relations with other planets and dimensions. We support all who enter. Our headquarters is located in Magnaria Tower, a building made of polished durasteel and aerogel-glass. Magnaria Tower is 900 stories tall, and has a launch pad, an imagination nexus, and a hologram of the Maelstrom Event.
