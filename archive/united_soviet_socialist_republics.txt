[b]Our Helix
Who art in &amp;quot;ITEM&amp;quot;
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
In PC as it is in &amp;quot;ITEM&amp;quot;
Give us this day our daily struggle
And forgive us our &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; votes
As we forgive those who vote &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; against us
And lead us not over ledges
But deliver us from Eevee
For thine is the kingdom and the power
And the glory for ever and ever
Now is not the time to use that[/b]
