The Southern Hills is a small, secluded region in the Southeastern quadrant of the world. The hills are characterized by their relative isolation to other regions, albeit still with travelable roads when it is needed to venture beyond the hills. They&#146;re filled with pleasant green meadows and boast a moderate, temperate climate year-round.
