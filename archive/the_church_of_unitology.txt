Brothers and sisters. The age of man is at an end. We have became too many, too little to go around. Corporations that we once trusted with our money have squandered it. The governments that we once trusted with our future have sabotaged it. To their eternal credit we are dying&#133; Fear not, there is a future. As promised by the prophet Michael Altman The Black Marker has a plan, for all of you&#133; It will lift us up from our miserable existence and we will become one; united in body and united in spirit. Our unity will be our salvation. We&amp;#39;ll live on, not as man, as God. The Church of Unitology is waiting for you my friends. Throw off the chains of this life and join us as the new one begins.
