[i]&amp;#39;Freetown is an ungoverned settlement situated in the no-man&amp;#39;s land between the Rejected Realms and the Pacific. Due to its unclaimed status, it has historically acted as a safe-haven for those fleeing legal or political persecution, as well as those seeking a nearly unlimited degree of personal and creative freedom. 

Recent reports by several prominent NGOs have called it a prime destination for people in the larger regions seeking unlicensed medical procedures, untraceable weapons, prostitutes, and recreational drugs of all stripes. 90% of all businesses in Freetown pay protection to slumlords people here call the &amp;quot;Snakes&amp;quot;.

For the innocent who are trapped here, however, this is truly a hell on Earth.&amp;#39;[/i][/b]
