Phlego is a coastal region close to the west pacific. Golden beaches, dense jungles, and towering mountains (and volcanos) are the most common terrain. Tourists flock to this gorgeous paradise to see the diverse marine life that inhabits the local reefs. Another famous wonder of Phlego is the skilled native Wa&amp;#39;hai bongo drummers. This region is perfect in every way (small though, and privately owned, so space is limited).
