The region of Terrasen is a small, but close community of fantasy lovers (anyone get the region name reference?) who commonly discuss books and anything else that might be nagging them. We enjoy a good argument from time to time and are welcoming of all, regardless of age and experience! At this point in time, we STILL have officer positions open! This is a great way to gain some influence and to try something new! Reach out either through the message board or wire a telegram to [nation]Kinisiri[/nation] and explain your interest, we&#39;d be more than happy to have you!
