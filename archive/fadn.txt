The Free Alliance of Democratic Nations (FADN) was founded by the Armed Republic of Saldon on March 3rd, 2018. The FADN was founded in hopes to unite all democratic nations in order to bring freedom and democracy to the entirety of the world. The FADN is an entirely democratic region, this means that officials, like the World Assembly Delegate, will be elected insead of appointed. The door is open for any and all nations to hold office. Whether you are a casual player or a die-hard role player there is a place for you in FADN. As of right now this is a small region looking for new members to help it and it&#146;s citizens grow. Whether you are a new nation or you have an abundance of experience, you are welcome.
