Ud&ucirc;n, also known as Utumno, was the first and most ancient fortress of Melkor (later known as Morgoth) in the north of Middle-earth, constructed during the Years of the Lamps before the First Age. It was a massive, subterranean stronghold, described as a place of darkness, terror, and suffering, and was meant to be a counterpart to the Valar&#39;s realm in Aman.
