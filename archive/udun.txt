[i]I am the Elder King: Melkor, first and mightiest of all the Valar, who was before the world, and made it. The shadow of my purpose lies upon Arda, and all that is in it bends slowly and surely to my will.[/i]

Ud&ucirc;n, also known as Utumno, was the first and most ancient fortress of Melkor (later known as Morgoth) in the north of Middle-earth, constructed during the Years of the Lamps before the First Age. It was a massive, subterranean stronghold, described as a place of darkness, terror, and suffering, and was meant to be a counterpart to the Valar&#39;s realm in Aman.
