Welcome to the region that celebrates leadership! Whatever your style may be, you have the right to lead because your people have given it to you, and who is anyone else to criticize that? Are you tanking your economy? Good. Poor people are easier to manipulate. No civil rights? That&#39;s fine. You&#39;re the only one who needs them anyways. Political freedoms absent? That just means you keep your seat. Of course, we assume your people are fine with this, or they&#39;d change it. So, pull up a seat, and make your nation right at home.
