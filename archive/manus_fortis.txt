Welcome to Manus Fortis. Whether your dictatorship is vile and insidious or whether it is, like mine, a benevolent force of service for its people, your form of leadership is welcome here. No one will ever tell you that your methods are wrong. They clearly aren&#39;t, or you wouldn&#39;t be doing them! Bad economy? Who cares! You&#39;re rich, and the people can suck it. No civil rights? You&#39;re a bastard, and good for you! No political freedoms? It&#39;s okay &#151; we both know how stupid the citizenry is.
