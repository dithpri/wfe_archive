[B]The Nayaencole Arm[/B]

The Nayaencole Arm is an arm of a small galaxy whose name is long forgotten. The Nayaencole Protection Administration, based on a small star system, manages the affairs of and maintains the peace in the Nayaencole Arm. The NPA is also the central communications office of the region, and updates the residents about any impending disasters.
