A desperate attempt to escape the foreigners taking over Tsuaru&#39;s Government has lead to the discovery of a more favorable region. Incredibly diverse terrain including deserts, rain forests, mountains, hills, you name it. A large landmass is home to a diverse terrain and climate as stated before and many large island chains and archipelagos surround the landmass, forming New Tsuaru.

As you can tell, I&#39;m new to the whole running a region thing and could always use a helping hand with it. This region welcomes anyone and everyone and promotes diversity,
