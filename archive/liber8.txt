You were born into crushing debt to parents without hope, and your only right is to work for the corporation until you pay it off. Except that can never happen, because everything you need, they provide. Your shelter, your food, your water. And it all sends you deeper into the abyss of slavery. But all that can change. We have the power to free ourselves. To take back what we&#39;ve lost - our independence, our dignity, our very souls. To take back our liberty. -- Edouard Kagame
