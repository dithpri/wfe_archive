The Arabian Peninsula, located in south-western Asia, is a great peninsula where the Arabian ethnicity comes from. It stands out by its rich deposits of oil and advanced cities. This region welcomes any new nation which wants to move to an Arabian region, and we hope to get this region very crowded. We guarantee cooperation and foreign aid (check our factbook dispatches). Long live the Arabic people!
