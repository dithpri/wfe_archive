The [b]Dardanelles[/b] is a narrow strait in northwestern Turkey connecting the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara. It is one of the Turkish Straits, along with its counterpart, the Bosphorus. It is located at approximately 40&deg;13&amp;#8242;N 26&deg;26&amp;#8242;E. The strait is 38 miles long but only 0.75 to 3.73 miles wide, averaging 180 feet deep with a maximum depth of 338 feet. 

Like the Bosphorus, it separates Europe (the Gallipoli peninsula) from the mainland of Asia (Anatolia). The strait is an international waterway, and together with the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus, the Dardanelles connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
