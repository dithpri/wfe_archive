The Dreamed Realm is an alternate reality that can temporarily intersect with the physical plane should the nations in the Realm so choose.

The earliest version of the Realm (called the &amp;#39;Dreamed Realm Beyond&amp;#39;) was founded by and home to the Holy Empire (of Alasdair I Frosticus).

The current version was founded by the Archregimancy, which is rumoured to be little more than a front for the Holy Empire.
