An interesting, but small, region. The region was uncreatively named by founder [nation]Notelia[/nation] and currently holds [nation]Doemokria[/nation], a mostly-independent part of [nation]Notelia[/nation]. Major exports include Notelian cheese - especially the renowned Purplish Notil&aelig; and &micro;cheese snacks - and software products. Because of the regional BOOST (BOOSTing Our Own Success Tally) subsidization program sponsoring Information Technology, computer programmers can often be seen roaming the streets. The region is actually situated on a ringworld of unknown origin around the star Epsilon Eridani. Ostriches and geckos can generally be seen frolicking throughout the ringworld&#39;s vast plains.
