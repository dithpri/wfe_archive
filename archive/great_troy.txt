***[b][color=green]ATTENTION[/color][/B]***
Currently, we have three inactive nations, (who will remain nameless) that are part of this alliance. 
While I try to have sympathy for them, there is no excuse for being inactive for over 3 weeks, (unless an emergency arises). This will not be tolerated in Great Troy. If you have to leave the game for over 3 weeks, please let me know. Also, I need all of you to give me interesting ideas for the region if you have any. I can&amp;#39;t single handedly keep this region interesting, that is something we&amp;#39;ll all have to do. I encourage those of you that have forgotten the laws of Great Troy to read the constitution, which is located in my factbook. Other than that, have a wonderful day.

Most Resepectfully,
HRH, KING BRYANT II
