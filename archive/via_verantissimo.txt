Hail and well met!

Welcome to Via Verantissimo , a region dedicated to progress, whatever the cost! We will treat whoever joins as family, until which point you betray us or try to raid or destroy other regions. We are cold pacifists by nature, and it is expected by each nation that joins to also adhere to this. Progress creates power, and power brings unity to those under its influence. We hope you join us.
-PM Jo of Merishrom
