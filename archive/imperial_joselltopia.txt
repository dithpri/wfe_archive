Joselltopia is a place for all, where all are respected and have equal rights.

Nations of Imperial Joselltopia must universally apply the virtues of freedom, unity, equality and peace.

The Kingdom of Joselltopia leads only as the first among equals. Nations may request advice on policy, debate policy, and decide policy. Those failing to uphold regional virtues will face temporary banishment. No permanent banishment will occur. The region is willing to aid any nation in reform, regardless of its past.
