Nevalic Universe is a RPG region set on earth in an alternative universe.
In the alternative universe humans, all animals and plants we know exist on the earth, exist on the earth in this region.
However, the landscape and climate of the planet is different that what we know from our own planet.

The Regions story will develop as the RPG continue and more nations join.
Much is still Work in Progress.
