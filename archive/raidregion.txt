Feel free to raid/defend here. Also feel free to use this as a transition region or whatever.
 
P.S: The Founder will not interfere with raids/defense, apart from the following base rules:
1) Ban list may be emptied at any time
2) Bios may be reverted to this one
3) Flags may be reset

This will not happen when a raid or defense is in progress, and will happen randomly when the Founder wills it. The rest is up to you to decide.
