Feel free to raid here.

P.S: The Founder promises not to interfere with raids/defense, apart from the following base guidelines:
1) Ban list may be emptied at any time. The Founder does not have to but can
2) Bios may be reverted to this one
3) Flags may be reset

The stuff above will only happen occasionally. The rest is up to you (a raider/defender). The founder does not intend to use Executive power for any reason.
