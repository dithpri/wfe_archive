The continent of Ainealeth is 8.9 million square miles in area.
The white area depicts Glacial climates which make it 
uninhabitable while the brown area is Tundra which is 2% of the ideal
Habitability range but 2% is still at least habitable.
the habitable area is only 5,100 square miles.

The white Glacial, Arctic zone is most of the continent and 
is only habitable due to the modern technology used to colonize it.
Most of the colonization is only in the south and west due to slightly less harsh temperatures.
Further inland is colder and is uninhabited because would require more expensive and 
high tech solutions to maintain, not to mention the miles of Ice is a fresh water source for the population.
