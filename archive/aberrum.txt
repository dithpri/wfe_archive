South-east by north-west lies the region of Aberrum, cut of from neighbouring regions by scorching desert, sky-stretching mountains and an ocean stretching far past the horizon. Aberrum was for the previous 11 years in brutal inner and outer conflict resulting in several new leaders taking charge over wide areas of the now split region. 

The new nations in charge of the people of Aberrum might be led by a wide array of different minded people, but at least the torch of civilisation has been rekindled.
