We are a group of Spanish who are tired of Communist Bloc revisionism (there are even social democrats) and infiltrated capitalists (or even Nazis). Anarchist (not anarcho-capitalists, for obvious reasons) and communists (not Trotskysts, for obvious reasons) are welcome. If you want to join, send Bloque Asturies a message.
