Around 100,000 years ago the first humans entered Phalonia via a land bridge, however eventually sea levels  rose and separated the islands and their people for thousands of years. Although later than much of the world, 4,000 years ago the first civilizations would arise in Phalonia primarily on the fertile southern coasts, although the lack of domesticated animals meant they were unable to progress much past the iron age before colonizers from the continent of Prostantius arrived in the 15th century. What would happen after is still unclear and disputed, though I am sure this will change. What is certain is this, the year is 1920, and it is an era of uncertainty and upheaval as old empires crumble, and new orders rise from the ashes.
