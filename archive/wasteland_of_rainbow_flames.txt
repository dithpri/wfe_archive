After the great Nyan war 100 years ago this land was rendered  for any kind of life.

It took help from amny nations to restore this Land enough to make it survivable most nation&#39;s gave up not Rainbowfire land they stuck around. After a lot of work this land was made habitable once more.

The landscape is still very inhospitable however water has started to return and so has many plants and animals.
Strangely after the fire went away the rainbows stayed were they were staining the ground with many bright colors.
The pigment in the ground has effected the plants and animals giving them a wonderful rainbow tint.
There&#39;s often random fires popping up in the distince don&#39;t worry about that the fire is to shy to go near any nations.
