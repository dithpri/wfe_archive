[b][color=blue][i]&#147;We have been to the moon, we have charted the depths of the ocean and the heart of the atom, but we have 
a fear of looking inward to ourselves because we sense that there is where all the contradictions flow together. 
If the words &amp;#39;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&amp;#39; don&amp;#39;t include the right to experiment with your own 
consciousness, then the Declaration of Independence isn&amp;#39;t worth the hemp it was written on. Reclaim your mind. 
Get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming garbage 
that&amp;#39;s being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world.&#148;[/color][/i][/b]
