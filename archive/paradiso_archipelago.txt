A realm of lush islands surrounding a large landmass filled partially with stunning mountain ranges and beautiful plains, but mostly covered in millions of square miles of rainforest. There is also lots of water, and even ancient ruins of underwater cities. It is mostly undeveloped, and was discovered only 30 years ago by the explorers who founded The Most Serene Republic of Exclusive Paradise. So come. You can stay here, just don&#39;t destroy the forests.
