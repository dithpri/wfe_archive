Many decades ago 6 stars fell from the sky. They crashed into earth forever changing it. Six zones where created. Six areas where the laws of reality, physics, and common sense no longer exist. These visit zones were as follows:

Harmont, Canada
West Siberia, Russia
Forbidden city, China
Laurie, Missouri, America
Antarctica
Pacific ocean

The Visit zone Harmont is the most contained and studied visit Zone out of the 6 and is headed by the Research Institute of Extraterrestrial cultures.
