Fire fills our lungs and our hearts as heaven&amp;#39;s light shines down on us all to welcome us into this alien world we call home. We pray for forgiveness, we pray for luck, we pray to survive. But the truth strength comes from the fire within that our father, our shining mother has given. All humans are born with this fire no one man is left without it we accept all our brothers and all of our sisters with open arms and open minds.
