&amp;quot;You are MINE, new inmates. Let me introduce myself. I am Professor Hugo Strange and I am in charge of the Arkham City facility. Up until this point, you have shown a total disregard for the law, for society, and yourself. From this moment on you are no longer a part of the society you have shown no respect for. You have been separated from the good people of Gotham. By committing the actions that have resulted in your being sent here, you have given up the rights to a so-called normal life.&amp;quot;

NOTE: Do not attempt to escape from this facility. TYGER Operatives will pacify any attempted escape with....extreme prejudice.
