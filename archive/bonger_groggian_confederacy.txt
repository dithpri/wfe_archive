Bonger Groggians originate from the Land of Grog, a far-off distant kingdom ruled by a usurper to the crown of Grog. The ex-king of Grog was forced to flee into exile, where he founded the new Libertarian Free State of Grog, and soon a new heritage and culture developed, with the settlers being known as Bonger Groggians, instead of just Groggians, similar to how Australia &amp; Canada have developed their own unique identities despite being former colonies of Great Britain.
