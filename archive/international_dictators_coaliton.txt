[color=blue] [b] OVERVIEW [/b] [/color]
The International Dictators Coalition is a relatively new region founded for dictators, by dictators. Located in a small, as yet unnamed archipelago, the IDC provides a *safe* haven for oppressive maniacs such as ourselves willing to follow our loose set of rules (see below). Please note that this does not mean instant entry for any power-hungry maniac off the street. On the contrary, applicants will be subject to a long, rigorous background check, and upon failing it will be denied access and possibly added to the banlist for good measure.

We are NOT currently accepting applications.
