This region was first led by the leader Don of the Phillipine Mafia. Now it is home to many Semitic peoples vying for dominance. The greatest of these nations is the very democration nation of Mohamadiya, whose ruler recently won the election with 99.8% majority. Johandi people also live in this region, but they are very smelly.
