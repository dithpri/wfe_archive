The Continent of Ylerga is a new continent discovered by the Elves millions of years ago, but was untouched by any colonists, beside the locals.

In this region, you can start your new Nation or colony on this new continent, or pretend to be a nation that was there since the dawn of time.

The setting of this region is Medieval Fantasy, a bit like LOTR (Lord Of the Rings) Steampunk nations welcome but have to be colonies.

Members can also do &quot;pretend&quot; wars, or commerce. Members can even make a whole story out of the region! Adventures, clashes between good and evil.
