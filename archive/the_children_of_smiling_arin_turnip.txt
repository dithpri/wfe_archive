[b][u]Welcome to the Congregation of the Children of Smiling Arin Turnip[/b][/u]

I wouldn&#39;t consider us a church, despite the fact that many follow me religiously. I see my teachings as some views to consider and perhaps integrate into your everyday life. This region serves as a place where nations may take refuge, and may also discuss whatever they please. Make yourself at home, however there are some rules as to not upset anyone. This may seem weak to some, but it&#39;s rather so that we all respect each other. Respect is very important here, and I ask that you use it with everyone you encounter here.
