The Union of Exoplanet Nations (UEN) is the political organization representing the New Nations of humanity, founded after the revolution in space travel and subsequent founding of new sovereign and autonomous lands beyond Earth. A partner of the United Nations, the supranational organization representing Earth&#39;s sovereign nations, the UEN is an open Region of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Member Nations mutually recognize each other, settle conflicts and disputes, and unite to tackle interplanetary challenges.

The UEN&#39;s three Founder Nations are: 
-- Hunitalitar
-- Eshmun
-- United Par-Ukor
