The UNFS is a new and growing loose confederacy of Darwinistic states. The Federation respects the rights of all member nations, but we do require that your nation denounce all forms of religion and accept the truth that is science.

All member states will be required to provide an adequate public education for all citizens and to further scientific reasearch to the best of their abilities.
