Calypsus is a continent that has risen and fallen through the ages.  Its most recent collapse was due to an event called the Corporate Ecocide.  Corruption that rendered the environment inhospitable.  As a result, only a handful of nations survived the collapse and the rest of the region fell to criminal syndicates.  The nation of Saurice managed to obtain intercontinental recognition and trade in order to survive while it&#39;s special forces units neutralized many nearby syndicate organizations.  Meanwhile Freedom took the opportunity to create an Empire.  The revival of the continent is ongoing.
