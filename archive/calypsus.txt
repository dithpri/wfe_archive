A largely uninhabited land formerly fallen to ecocide.  Built atop the rubble are the few nations that survived in this rather cold, rainy and inhospitable landscape.  Old facilities, factories, refineries, nuclear powerplants and more lurk within the rubble of the past.  

Nothing more to it.  We are a large continent full of the ruins of modern architecture.
