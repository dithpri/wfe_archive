[b]Welcome dear traveler, you have stumbled upon a group of new lands, new nations in one place.[/b]

[color=orange]Why hello there!, thank you for for joining this &quot;Region&quot;. . .I guess?[/color] 

[color=blue]My apologies fellow leader, but this so called region right here is[/color] [color=red][b]not a region[/b][/color] [color=blue]but the name of a[/color] [color=green][b]continent[/b][/color] 

[color=purple][b]So if you did joined this continent, it means that you are now located in the continent of 7NOC [&amp;lt;- That over there is the full acronym].[/b] The name suggest it as &quot;7 Nations of Chaotic Wonderers&quot; that is because, this continent is a lore for 7 countries made by the same person only. In short, [b]those 7 countries that you see in here are all made by one person because of a specific lore expansion.[/b][/color]

[b][nation]Crewx[/nation] and [nation]Crewx0Chaotic Wonderers0[/nation] are both of my two main accounts that I will frequently switch onto.[/b]
