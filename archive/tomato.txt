[i]This is a region that is completely safe. We will talk and RP if we feel the desire to. 

There are just a few simple rules that should be quite easy to follow. 

1. Avoid public bullying, or in simpler terms, be polite on the RMB and take drama to the TGs.

2. Keep the RPs PG-13, no sensual activity.

3. No poop.

4. Have fun!

There are three steps that will be taken when a member of this region offends the rules.

1. Verbal and public warning.

2. Ejection from the region.

3. Banjection from the region.

If anyone from a visiting region offends these rules only numbers 1 and 3 will apply.

Have fun all hand welcome to Tomato, home of the tomatoes.[/i]
