The Timena region was once a peaceful and friendly nation. When a mad man came to power over Central Timenan, a civil war broke out. Northern and Eastern Timena emerged victorious however the war cost the lives of most of the population.
Now, the people of Timena try to rebuild their region under the control of three very different governments, each with their own ideas and aspirations for Timena.
