The Outstanding Trinity is a new region, and sometimes this is better. Older regions tend to have many many nations, and it is difficult to get involved. Newer regions offer more opportunities for nations entering them. That is why I created The Outstanding Trinity, to create positions for people wanting to get more out of Nationstates.
