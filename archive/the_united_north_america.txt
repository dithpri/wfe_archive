[i]The Queendom of Mata Tuna Hari is a tiny, socially progressive nation, remarkable for its absence of drug laws. They are ruled with an iron fist by the socialist government, which grants its people the freedom to do whatever they like so long as it doesn&amp;#39;t involve getting richer than anybody else or challenging the government.

Elections have been outlawed, tourists from around the world come to visit the country&amp;#39;s famous rainforests, the nation is ravaged by daily union strikes, and cars are banned. Crime is a problem, probably because of the country&amp;#39;s utter lack of prisons. Mata Tuna Hari&amp;#39;s national animal is the Albertan Weasel, which frolics freely in the nation&amp;#39;s many lush forests, and its currency is the Tuna.[/i]
