George Orwell depicted our fair nation in a very rude way. Big Brother has no intentions of ever harming, hurting, or depriving our loyal citizens of what they require and want. Big Brother indorses freedom to all those who welcome The Party&#39;s good intentions, Big Brother (and subsequently INGSOC) will protect all our citizens.
Remember:
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS POWER
