[color=blue][b]Will you fight to end dictatorship?[/b][/color]

Take the battle directly to dictatorships and tyrants across the world! The region, Democratic Revolutionaries, is a casual raid/defense gameplay region open to all who would combat the enemies of freedom-loving people across NationStates. Right-wing, center, or left-wing, your country is welcome if it has high political freedom irrespective of the political views of its voters.

[color=red][b]DICTATORSHIPS[/b][/color] attempting to enter this bastion of liberty will be overthrown in fiery righteous justice and we will spread subversive literature to any soldiers we capture alive.

To do: vote in an official regional flag (quorum required of at least 5 members, to make it not just the founder&#39;s decision alone).
