
Our Socialist region subjugates the whole world
Like a gigantic bear from the East.
The sheep wander aimlessly, without any cause,
Yet the Socialist bear&#39;s on the hunt.

Our brotherhood&#39;s a good life, Our generosity is without compare.
All those with us are strong,
All those against us, beware.
It&#39;d be a shame if we had hardships.

To all those around us, it&#39;s not worth your while
If we were to turn you to ashes.
We thank you profoundly, and bow to you deeply,
From the mightiest region in all the world
