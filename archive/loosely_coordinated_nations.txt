The Loosely Coordinated Nations (LCN) exist as what some critics, and even more proponents, call a &quot;Liberal Valhalla&quot;. As the founding nation DankLitistan is quoted as coining, &quot;Not my business what goes on in the bedroom. You know, consenting parties and whatnot.&quot; This level of involvement is what guides the LCN. While members strive to coordinate efforts to proliferate tolerance and a severe lack of social engagement, they look fondly on their community members as all worth their while, provided they fux.
