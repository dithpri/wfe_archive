The several different regions of Torenta each divided into multiple districts which are countrolled by a Trenchdek which is the equivelant to a representative. And each region is controlled by a Jarl, and Torenta is controlled by King Volkar I. These threee levels of government make up the decision making body in Torent.  Keep these things in mind a you live in such a functional society because in lands such as this playing your cards right and knowing the right people may get you far but not if you do not work for it.
