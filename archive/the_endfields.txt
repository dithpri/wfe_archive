Destroyed by a war centuries ago, this region contains nations most unstable, psychotic, violent and dangerous, who were hard enough to survive in a radioactive, poisonous wasteland.
The goal is STRENGTH.
The desire is BLOOD.
The sin is WRATH.
Are you hard enough? Weaklings and Cowards do not have a place here.
