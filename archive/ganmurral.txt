[color=blue][b]Greetings fair traveler, and welcome to our galaxy: Ganmurral![/b][/color]

Long ago, [nation]Imperial Warlords[/nation], and its many puppets, invaded our original region in an attempt to replace the democratically elected governments with puppet regimes.

The war lasted four long and bloody years, devolving in a stalemate. Finally, a daring counteroffensive beat the warlords and resulted in the death of their emperor. While peace has been declared, many expect the warlords and their puppets to make another attempt at gaining control of our galaxy.

Now, the nations of [region]Ganmurral[/region] are united and committed to defending our way of life against all invaders.
