A region by any other name would still be just as sweet to raid &amp;lt;3

Euro and TNP sitting in a tree... T-O-O-T
We were strolling through the park one day, and we saw this charming little place that we just had to visit

This has been a joint operation Europeia and The North Pacific, to see what regionlessness is like, we all decided we&#39;ll sit and chill for a bit. Stop by and say hi if you want to try out a region-ness again!

We are enjoying ourselves so much we decided to invite our friends from Albion and the Kingdom of Alexandria!
