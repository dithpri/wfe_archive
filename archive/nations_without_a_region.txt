[color=#008000]Hello. My name is Syg Ian. I have been given the great honor of showing the Natives around NWR. And you must be [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]Firehelm[/region], [region]The Mafia[/region], and [region]Arda en Estel[/region]. Welcome to our wonderful region. Shall we get started?[/color]

NWR has many walls. There are the ones outside protecting us, and the ones inside that help maintain order. [B]Endorsing the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=free_apps]delegate[/url] and [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=region_control/region=nations_without_a_region#officers]regional officers[/url] also helps us with this matter.[/B]

[color=#008000][i]In silencing talk of conflict, NWR remains a peaceful, orderly utopia. [u]The last one on NationStates.[/u][/i][/color]

[B]Do not resist...unless you&#39;d like the Raid King to invite you to Lake Hawk-guy?[/B]

[color=crimson][u]Remember: There is no Raid in NWR.[/u][/color]

[i]Only once every hundred updates can a raider experience [b]this[/b] kind of power![/i]
