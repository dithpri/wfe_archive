Welcome to a new and improved Democratic Canada.[hr]
We stand in opposition to the royal crown.
Against the racist colonizers and imperialists of republics the world over.
We stand for a people&amp;#39;s Canada, one that recognizes its colonial past.
We stand for a Democratic Canada and we welcome all who stand with us.[hr]
Royalist and imperialist sympathizers to be hung up by the banjection rope.
