During the 2020s, climate change caused flooding in the US and neighboring areas, with a subsequent freezing of the water. This directed water toward the west causing the long-lost continent of IAKA to reappear.

The people of this long-lost continent were threatened long ago with flooding from just before the previous ice age, so they went into cryogenic sleep in hopes their land would be uncovered yet again. 

Due to the land being underwater for several centuries, these nations must now rebuild their nations and technology. With the onset of the next ice age, it is imperative that they reach higher than they have in the past in order to thrive within the very same threats that destroyed their lands in the first place.
