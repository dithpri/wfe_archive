Lamp oil, rope, bombs! You want it? It&#39;s yours, my friend, along with anything you desire in The Great and Mighty Region of Morshu! That is, as long as you have enough rubies.
[spoiler=Notes about raiding]
This region, contrary to what Lily says, did not volunteer itself up as a advertisement board for Lily. So please don&#39;t use it as such. Otherwise [region]Alnobia[/region] is going to have to come back and clean up this mess again. (Mess cleaned up June 20, 5:22 UTC)
