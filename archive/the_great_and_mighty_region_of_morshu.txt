Lamp oil, rope, bombs! You want it? It&#39;s yours, my friend, along with anything you desire in The Great and Mighty Region of Morshu! That is, as long as you have enough rubies.
[spoiler=Notes about raiding]
This place got raided at least twice, and various nations from [region]Alnobia[/region] (namely [nation]Hfhbsd[/nation]) had to clean this place up, as contrary to what Lily says, this region didn&#39;t volunteer itself up as an advertisement board. So please don&#39;t use it as such. 
Also, the second nation listed below really really sucks, but Hfhbsd was too lazy to come over and get delegate status just to dismiss them.
