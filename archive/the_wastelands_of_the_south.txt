The South was refounded in the trashed and utter wastelands of Southern America. It was that about 300 years ago a war raged her. The War was between the southern Rebels and the union troops. After so many decades of war that was about Segregation and Slavery, the south ended up being destroyed by nuclear weapons. From then on it was basically deserted, and the people living there moved to Mexico or South America However, we decided to go back, and take back our land that is rightfully ours!! We are the only ones who will ever be able to live here. Nobody else.
