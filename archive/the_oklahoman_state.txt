The State of Oklahoma is a place where hard work is rewarded and where honest folk make a living. Sure it might not be the most well-known place but hey at least we try our best. Besides unlike most people believe Oklahoma isn&#39;t just a place of plains and Native Americans there is a lot of charm in the Sooner State. A land of friends and opportunities Oklahoma could be the place for you or maybe not it&#39;s your choice. If you&#39;re from another place like Kansas or Arkansas you&#39;re welcome in Oklahoma. So relax and do whatever you do and listen to &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; the song if ya want to. Labor omnia vincit!
