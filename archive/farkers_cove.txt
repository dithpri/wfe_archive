&amp;quot;The Farkers&amp;quot; were comprised of a group of rabble-rousing, trouble-making ne&amp;#39;er do wells that came to the NS world to wreak havoc and report back to their home site about all the trouble they caused.  They are, of course, The Grandfathers of Raiding.  

In their name and spirit, this bar is open to all warriors true to the spirit of raiding and its history.  Pull up a chair, grab a cold one and remember that the only trouble in Nationstates is the trouble we bring.
