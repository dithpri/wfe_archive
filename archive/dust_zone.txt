&quot;In the deserts of life, you can simply sprout like a flower or remain in the illusion of an Oasis created by your imagination. After all, anyone who walks through dry land in one way or another discovers in himself and in his own steps , that there really is beauty. &quot;

With this phrase of Rosa de Avalon, I want to welcome the Dust Zone, a place that exists to serve as a home to those who want to explore new air, who is allowed to dream, and for those who wish to pass the time. The goal is to be a place to form friendships, to discuss what happens in the real world and in the game world, it&#39;s a place to enjoy. Welcome.
