The Core Worlds (also known as the Galactic Core and, during the Imperial Period, the Imperial Core) were some of the most prestigious, well-developed, well-known, least politically restrictive and heavily populated planets in the galaxy.[1][2] The Core was the hub of galactic culture, finance, technology, education, and fine arts.[2] Noble houses held a great deal of influence in this region and almost every interstellar company had offices or were headquartered in the Core Worlds.[2] In astrophysical terms, the Core denoted the central area of the galaxy, and in broad terms this was true enough, but the precise usage of the term was sometimes more complex.
