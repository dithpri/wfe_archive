We respect most democracies we don&amp;#39;t want any governments that severely oppress their people, or I&amp;#39;ll send them to the Rejected Realms . We don&amp;#39;t care about economies and how powerful they are. I welcome democracies, this is a haven for freedom. you can make your own rules that won&amp;#39;t oppress your people. If you accept this rule we won&amp;#39;t bother you. we wont bother you if i personally invited you.We hold a strong Air Force which we will not hesitate to use if you threaten our interest. But will first try to negotiate, but if this fails we will launch our Air Force to wage total war on your population.No real religion,anybody can practice what they want as long as it is not offensive to anyone else.
