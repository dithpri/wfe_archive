[b][color=black]The western part of Eurasia is separated from Asia and the Asians by the Ural Mountains in Russia, from the Islamic Turks by the Bosporus strait, and from Africa and the Africans by the Mediterranean Sea.  To the west of the British Isles is the Atlantic Ocean. To the north is the Arctic Ocean.

Europa&#39;s outer borders are those of Christendom as established or defended against Islam, as in the [region]Reconquista[/region] and the Ottoman Turk wars in Europe, or the communist hordes of the East.

Our European Nations have settled many lands, but all stand in National Socialist Solidarity
