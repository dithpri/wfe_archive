Lively souls are a rare sight, it is the undead that by majority, rule these lands, immortal titans, skeletal warriors, zombie raiders, rogue deities.

This realm is filled with the stench of death and the darkness of the blocked sun, abandon your hope puny mortals that enter these acursed lands, only the brave or the foolish would dare walk into the realm of the undead.

You will find no solice or freedom here, mortals.
