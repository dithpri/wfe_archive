[b]How do I join?[/b]

Sorry, but the registration for this contest is over! Come back next time!

[b]Why is this region locked?[/b]

Because this region was specifically created for the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1492905]Owlograd-Durrnilian Vexillology Contest[/url] judges. Again, you can&#39;t register for this status anymore.

[b]How are flags judged?[/b]

Here is an excerpt from the contest dispatch:
The flags will be graded on 3 factors: How well the flag matches the theme, how visually appealing the flag is, and the vexillological rules broken by the flag. The panel of judges will debate on how well the flag matches these factors and will find a consensus.

[color=#FF0000][b]Futuristic flags are going to be judged until January 25, 11:00 AM PST[/color][/b]
