This region is for flag judging and flag judging only.

[b]Flag judging protocol:[/b]
The flags will be graded on 3 factors: How well the flag matches the theme, how visually appealing the flag is, and the vexillological rules broken by the flag. The panel of judges will debate on how well the flag matches these factors and will find a consensus.

We are judging futuristic flags until Monday 11:00 PST

Disagreements in the scoring will result in a poll

All judges get instant admin status
