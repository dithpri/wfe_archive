Hello my brothers. This is Acro, your founder. Despite the early promise of a reborn Fratum, it was not to be. Therefore, we begin to move to Aysling tonight, at 6 PM est. Thank you.
So many grammatical errors :P -Corn

Ythereum, I am letting you lead this region. But i will not allow you to banject people unless they pose a immediate and real threat to Fratum.
