The (CIN) is a group of Nations who don&amp;#39;t want to get involved with the rest of the worlds problems. They just want to focus on their own progress. Forming a coalition allows Nations to grow peacefully and undisturbed. There is no laws, or a constitution, but your own. You don&amp;#39;t have to worry about any other nation but your own. Welcome to CIN! Don&amp;#39;t be shy and please interact socially with other members. You don&amp;#39;t have to, but I don&amp;#39;t want this region to become a trash can of forgotten nations. I encourage social interaction, but I will never enforce it. Do what you want!
