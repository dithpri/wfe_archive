Welcome to The Free Land of Food! All nations are welcome, whether they are brand new, or a veteran nation. We see every nation as an important aspect and asset to the growth of this region, and we believe that a region should value its individual nations as well as itself as a whole.

We very much encourage you to let yourself be heard throughout the region, whether that might be a suggestion or comment. However, on a kind note, please do not make rude comments that may hurt the reputation of this region and yourself. The Founder personally wishes that all our nations will live in peace, and feel safe and comfortable in this close community.
