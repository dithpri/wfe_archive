The United Council of East Frontier is a Council that binds the lands that the Great Empire of Frontier one time owned.

The Council only accepts anti-right democracies. We greetly accept new members.

Our Council is built on the ground that the great empire of Frontier layed for us. Our united history will increase the civil rights around the world and save dying democracies. We help fund freedoms fighters and anti-right rebels.
