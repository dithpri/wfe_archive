Good tidings, and welcome to fair Laifera!

We have open borders for the first time, our isolation is at an end. We welcome all new comers as long as you mind your P&#39;s and Q&#39;s. My hope is for this region to focus on RP in a unique setting, when we have at least 10 nations participating. 

Your benevolent leader,
Courellia
