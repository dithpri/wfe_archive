The Bureaucratic Expanse is a sprawling and meticulously organized region where paperwork flows as freely as ideology. Founded by the Imperium of Thalorax, the region was established to bring order, unity, and extremely thorough documentation to the surrounding territories. What began as a modest administrative zone quickly grew into a vast collective of states bound together by shared governance, mutual taxation, and an unwavering respect for proper filing procedures.
