[color=navy][b]Welcome to the United Islands![/b][/color]

[color=gray]Founded March 7th, 2017[/color]

We are a newly refounded and welcoming region centred around roleplaying. 

This is a region where every nation&#146;s wishes are respected and taken care of, unlike many other bigger regions which prioritise quantity over quality. Our region will protect you from any threats from other nations and regions, ensuring your safety and guaranteeing your well-being as a member of our community.

[color=Blue]We are a proud member of the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_itda_hq]International Trade and Defense Association[/url]![/color]

[color=gold]As a newly founded region, you have the chance of being elected as our World Assembly delegate![/color]
