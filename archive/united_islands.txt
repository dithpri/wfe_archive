We are a newly re-founded and welcoming region centered around roleplaying. 

This is a region where every nation&#146;s wishes are respected and taken care of, unlike many other bigger regions which prioritize quantity over quality. Our region will protect you from any threats from other nations and regions, ensuring your safety and guaranteeing your well-being as a member of our community.
