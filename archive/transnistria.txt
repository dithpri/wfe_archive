This region was refounded by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] to prevent occupation by fascists. It was handed over to [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=antifascist_allstars][b][color=red]Anti[/color][color=black]fascist[/color] [color=red]All[/color][color=black]stars[/color][/b][/url] as part of [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=blackgreenwhite/detail=factbook/id=54439]Operation &amp;quot;Get Organized Down There!&amp;quot;[/url].

[b]FJA has kindly given this region to the AntiFascists and AntiCommunists of [region]Alliance of Bearded Men[/region] and [region]Libertatem[/region].[/b]
