Transnistria is a de-facto independent state on the easter border of Moldova, from which it broke away during the War of Transnistria from 1990-1992. Since its declaration of independence in 1990, and especially after the War of Transnistria in 1992, it has been governed as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. It is only recognized by three other mostly unrecognized states: Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno Karabakh.
