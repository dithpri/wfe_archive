The Catholic Church is a denomination of Christianity. It is the largest denomination of Christians, with roughly 1 billion people. It is the world&amp;#39;s second-largest religious group after Sunni Islam. The Catholic Church is based in the Vatican City.

The word catholic comes from the Greek word &amp;quot;katholicos&amp;quot;, which means &amp;quot;universal.&amp;quot; It was first used in the Nicene Creed. Often, the word Roman is added - incorrectly - to the Church as a whole, due to its headquarters in Vatican City, which is in the city of Rome, Italy. Typically, people who call themselves &amp;#39;Catholic&amp;#39; mean that they are a member of the Catholic Church. It also means that they follow the teachings of the Church.
