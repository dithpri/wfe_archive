[color=turquoise]Welcome to the Icy Realms (TIR). Watch your step. The floor might be slippery...[/color]

[color=turquoise]This region was founded for those to ponder the Evanescence of Ice and Life, the two elements that have so much in common. They both somehow manage to fade away before we decide what exactly to do with it, and they both are fragile, very fragile. They both can break under extreme pressure. So, all that come to this region, please pay your respects for those that somehow managed to get themselves killed with pieces of ice. Thank you.[/color]

[color=zaffre]And, please don&amp;#39;t kill other people with this frozen water. Thank you. Again.[/color]

[color=electricblue]I just like to experiment with the different colors. :D[/color]

[color=sapphire]How is this Sapphire?[/color]

[color=multicolor]Soon, it&amp;#39;s going to be telling me that my Factbook entry is too long. Screw you.[/color]
