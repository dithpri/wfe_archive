[i][color=teal]A vast continent on the magic-rich planet of [b][region]Zeion[/region][/b], Encantadia was once vibrant&#151;its skies streaked with light, its lands blessed by the celestial deities of old. Magic danced freely among its people, echoing in the rivers, forests, and mountains of the realm.

Now, a deep frost has settled across its heart. By sword and sorcery, the [b][/color][color=green]Empire of[/color] [nation=noflag]Mine-a-ve[/nation][/b], [color=teal]led by the cold-blooded conqueror [b]Kera Mitena[/b], claimed Encantadia in a sweeping conquest. Her dominion was not won by force alone, but by harnessing the cruel beauty of frost magic&#151;freezing entire cities and subduing kingdoms beneath glacial silence.

Though frozen and subdued, the land still whispers of its former glory. Beneath the ice, old magic sleeps.

[b]Encantadia belongs to [nation]Mine-a-ve[/nation]&#151;for now.[/b][/i][/color]
