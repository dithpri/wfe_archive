[i][color=teal]Encantadia is a radiant continent on the mystical planet [b][region]Zyeune[/region][/b]&#151;its skies streaked with light, its lands steeped in elemental magic and raw beauty. Forged from the divine essence of the exiled celestial beings, Encantadia flourished as a cradle of ancient powers and diverse civilizations, where encantados and various races thrive in harmony alongside human societies enriched by mystics, scholars, and travelers from Earth.

Once isolated by arcane boundaries, Encantadia has in recent eras become a nexus of interdimensional contact&#151;welcoming explorers, settlers, and sovereigns from across realms. While the pulse of magic still hums beneath its soil, new energies stir: of diplomacy, innovation, and emerging alliances that echo through the stars.[/i][/color]
