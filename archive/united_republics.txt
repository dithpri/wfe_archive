[color=red][b]United Republics | Est. 2/22/24[/b][/color]
[hr][b][region]United Republics[/region][/b] is a [color=Green]casual[/color], [color=blue]laid-back[/color], [color=red]neutral[/color] region. 

[hr] We are a casual region with nations of many different backgrounds and ideologies, which seeks to be a home to those not particularly interested in regional politics or the drama which comes with it, but who seek a place of refuge and community, free to do as much or as little as they desire. 
[hr] [color=Green][b]For the sake of independence and national sovereignty, membership in the World Assembly is not encouraged.[/b][/color]
[hr] We are a [color=blue]Union of Equality[/color], meaning there is no overarching power, we are voluntary united with each other, yet free to run our nations as we see fit.
[hr] [color=red]Telegram [b][nation]Vendellamoore[/nation][/b] to be added to the map. [/color]
