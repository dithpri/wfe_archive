 It has golden spas, anti-gravity restaurants, sapphire waterfalls, and a landscape of diamonds. The planet&amp;#39;s sun emits x-tonic radiation, which vaporises organic matter and can only be viewed safely through sufficiently thick finito glass. The radiation poisons the diamonds, so the planet&amp;#39;s surface can never be touched. However, there is some form of native life, which possesses tourists.
