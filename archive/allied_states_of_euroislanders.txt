[b]The ASE was founded in March 2003; it grew to be the largest and most significant participatory democracy of its time, with over three hundred members and a large Defender army, influencing socialist and democratic thought in NationStates for years.

This region stands for peace, freedom and equality, forever.

In 2004, the ASE founded the [color=red]Red Liberty Alliance[/color], defending socialist regions against invasion. After the decline of the ADN, the RLA led the Defender world. May the memories of our deeds, and those of our sister regions, live on.[/b]
