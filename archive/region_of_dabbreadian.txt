History of bread
We lived a long civalasation. We adapted to eating bread first. We even created it. Now we have crumbs spilled on enemy&#39;s lands as they eat our very life long creation. We must act now brothers and sisters as we must destroy everything that disagrees with what we stand and die for. We are not elitest, we are truly more demanding because we deserve more. We serve mercy only to those who surrender first. Death is neither a disgrace or a ending but a beginning for us. This is the end for people who disagree, this is justice
