 The Drazhoan-Daedric Imperium is without a doubt the most grandiose endeavor ever undertaken by sentient species. We are led by Highest Emperor Augustus Drazos, Grandson of Our Lord Phillippus Ignis, Daedric Prince of Conquest and the Great Founder of the Autocracy of Concordus (Also known as ConcordusCorp LLC), and His Royal Divine Magnificence of the West Robertus Drazos of the Nation of Drazohan, two great nations now blended to encompass all of Existence.
