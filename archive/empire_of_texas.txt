Hello, and welcome to the Empire of Texas!

Currently, we are hoping that Hurricane Harvey does not damage too much, join us to help up pray for the families down there.

We will be setting up our government soon, any nation that joins during set up has the ability to Help with Set-up, and assist our Founder in making the Texas Empire great and glorious, as it says in the Texas National Anthem.

This region is basically a Imperial version of Texas, the Founder will be considered the Emperor, but probably won&#39;t be much of a dictator like some Mexican President we know of.
