A land of people who worship the manga gods of ancient Rome and the anime gods of Contemporary Kentucky. We shall rise to be the very best, like no region ever was. To convert the world is our quest, to rule it is our cause. We shall rise up and bring the world together with the magic of anime. We also have a distinct love for the Buffyverse and all things Whedon, but I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to include that in the name because the leader of Hullo is no fun. So, praise be unto you, Venus, Goddess of the Kawaii, and Angelus, demon of the Apocalypse. We live only to serve.






also Doctor Who. We like Doctor Who.
