[spoiler=Regional History]The Region was founded on January 31, 2018 by [nation]C0nstantinople[/nation]. It fell to inactivity and was stolen by [region]Lone Wolves United[/region]. The government fled to Italy, which had barely survived, but Italy fell soon after. On the 24th of June, the region was reconquered by the Byzantine legions, and refounded by her old Emperor.
