New Jaromiria, named after it&#146;s liberator Jaromir Jagr, is a relatively new region of sovereignty. For decades the Imperialist dictator Mario Lemiuex held power over the region, making commercial use of the region&#146;s oil reserves and diverse soil for unprecedentated agricultural production. This changed when Jaromir Jagr led a bloody rebellion against the Mario Imperialists and liberated the region. After the war, Jagr formed the region&#146;s founding sovereign nation, Jagesta and spent the last ten years of his life codifying law and building infrastructure. Two years after the death of Jagr, the republic was overthrown in favor of a Sultanate ruled by Henrik Lundqvist.
