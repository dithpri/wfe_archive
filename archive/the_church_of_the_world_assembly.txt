[i]World Assemblism[/i] is defined as the worship and study of The World Assembly.

Come and engage in silent admiration of The World Assembly and its eternal laws or spread The World Assembly&#39;s glorious name by engaging in missionaries (embassy requests or recruitment telegrams).

Non-World Assembly members may join; however, you will be looked down on for your sinful state.
