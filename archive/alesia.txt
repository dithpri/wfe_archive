[b][color=green]Welcome to Alesia![/color][/b]

||[color=orange] Alesia is a cozy and small region with a vivid community that often discusses political topics (as you do in NationStates) and some other misc topics.[/color]
||[color=orange] Almost all types of ideological beliefs are welcomed in our Region because we look for diversity and acceptance for others! We already have a bunch of differing views![/color]
||[color=orange] Please come along and stop for a visit, or join in. If you are a member of the World Assembly, endorse our current delegate.[/color]

 We hope your stay here in our home in the corner of the internet is pleasant!
