[b][color=teal]Welcome to Alesia![/color][/b]

[i][color=teal]Established Tuesday, May 10th, 2022[/color][/i]

[color=teal]Alesia is a new, small, emerging region founded on May 10th, searching and aspiring to be a new type of community in NationStates, full of roleplays, discussions, politics, pop culture, and more. We want to be more than just a community - we want to be a family, and we invite you into our home! Please come along and stop for a visit. If you are a member of the World Assembly, endorse our current delegate, and if not, you should join!

We hope your stay here in our home is a pleasant one![/color]
