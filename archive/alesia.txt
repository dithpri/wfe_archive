[color=#16537e][b]Welcome to Alesia![/b][/color]

[color=#16537e][i]We are a small, close-knit region founded in May 2022 with one vision - to create a region where all nations can work together as friends, can discuss freely, and to express themselves. Though we started small, we have a big vision - to stand out from the rest of the regions as a unique, family-friendly place. Here in Alesia, we accept all people regardless of your background and beliefs and we welcome any discussion so long as it is allowed by NationStates moderators.[/i][/color]

[color=#16537e][i]Be sure to visit, have fun, and enjoy your stay![/i][/color]
