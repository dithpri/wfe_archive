As [region]Greater Wetlands[/region] is now in possession of a Founder once again, all nations are requested to move back. You can continue to use this region as a puppet dump, if you&amp;#39;d like, but main nations should return to [region]Greater Wetlands[/region].

Thank you,

Lord Protector Reginald Front-de-boeuf
