chess keeps me sane or maybe it makes me crazy. it may be safer to keep playing. Feel free to vent your own crazy ramblings here. I won&amp;#39;t judge you, I don&amp;#39;t have the hammer needed.

Rules
-don&amp;#39;t be crazy
-the voices are always wrong
-except when they say you should be kind
-Follow the rules if you feel like it
-shhhhhh

(ANy and all of this is for my own amusement)(judge me once you talked to me, you&amp;#39;ll find i&amp;#39;m very polite.)
