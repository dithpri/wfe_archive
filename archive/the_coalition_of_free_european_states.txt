This is a union of European states tired of being ravaged by war. This organisation was set up in 1962 by the European nations, both socialist and capitalist to follow a policy of disarmament, despite opposition from world powers. Nevertheless, the Coalition still to this day enjoys a mutual friendship and alliance, and despite political differences, we have been able to work together on projects concerning free trade, protecting the environment and providing funding for the arts. All ideologies are welcome in this region, and we maintain an ethic of being independent whilst co-operating together for a better future in Europe.
