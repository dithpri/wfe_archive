The Marxist Utopia are for people who follow the true ways of Karl Marx. They believe that all people are equal, and are willing to follow the true path that Karl Marx layed out in his Manifesto. We are accepting of all who are willing to share the wealth of their hard work with his/her brothers and sisters.
