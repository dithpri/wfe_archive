Welcome, weary traveller, to The Noodle Shop At The Edge Of Reality. You&#39;ve come some way off the beaten track to find us here, friend.

From Ramen and Soba to Udon and Somen, we serve it all. Fresh cooked to order, of course! We serve ice cold soda and piping hot tea too, if you need something to wash it down with.

So please, sit down, take a deep breath and order a bowl of fresh hot noodles. Here at the edge of reality, there&#39;s really nothing else but peace, the view and a bowl of noodles. Relax and enjoy.
