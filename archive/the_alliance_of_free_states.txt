Seriously, though, there are only three nations here and if you telegram me, Commandin Pillotus, and you&amp;#39;re not a dictator, I&amp;#39;ll probably let you in. We even have a flag. But it&amp;#39;s getting boring and hard, because Umonja keeps doing apocalypse stuff on the forum, well not him, but his alter-ego nation Dalgrin, and to speed things up, I made and alter-ego nation called Sutollip Nidnammoc, but that&amp;#39;s not going to last very long.
