Welcome to the Alliance of Free States. Anyone is welcome to join the region regardless of weather they are a free nation. For prospective nations we will list our main interests below. 
1)We are an active Region and do make frequent invasions. 
2)We value having an illustrious economy over civil rights
3)We believe in democracy and so the WA delegate will always have equal or greater power than the founder. 

Revolution against the Founder or WA Delegate by means other than re-election will not be tolerated.

The Alliance of Rree States reserves the right to discreetly infiltrate or to directly invade other regions to gather intelligence or overthrow the leader.
