Welcome to the Dictatorship of Free States. Anyone is welcome to join the region if they are a Free Nation. For prospective nations we will list our main interests below. 
1)We are an active Region and do make frequent invasions. 
2)We value having an illustrious economy over Civil/Political Rights as the latter are to be shunned
3)We believe in Dictators and so the WA delegate will always have no power than the founder. 

Revolution against the Founder or WA Delegate by means other than re-election will not be tolerate
The Dictatorship of Free States reserves the right to discreetly infiltrate or to directly invade other regions to gather intelligence or overthrow the leader.
