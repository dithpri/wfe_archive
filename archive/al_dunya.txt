[b]Out of the 200 billion galaxies in the universe, only one really matters. Out of the 400 billion stars in that one galaxy, only one really matters. Out of the eight planets that orbit that one star, only one planet really matters. That one tiny planet, insignificant though it might seem, is home to some 7.4 billion inhabitants. They call their tiny blue dot in the universe [color=navy]Al Dunya[/color].[/b]

[b]Here in Al Dunya these 7.4 billion humans strive to eke out a living on the one planet they all share. Some form communities that grow into nations. Will they coexist in peace or be constantly at war? This is a question that remains unanswered.[/b]

[b]The fate of the world hangs in the balance...[/b]
