Namitea is a relatively small island group located in the Atlantic Ocean. Member nations are free to do as they like, but can take part in several treaty organizations. Other than that, every nation is free to do whatever they want, no exceptions. 

The Namitean council administers regional law and standards in all member nations. The elected officers act as ministers.
