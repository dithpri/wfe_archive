This is meant to be an RP community where we may all roleplay as the fictional nations of fallout, whether original or already existing in the games and lore. 

To further the RP experience we make use of the site NSTracker to allow us to manage our nations to match up to the fallout universe as best we can. 

Please do not set your population above 70,000 and try to make sure that your population is realistic to the size of your territory as well as your nation&amp;#39;s culture. 

The current RP year is 2281
