War, War Never Changes...
Welcome to [b]Fallout: The Southern Wastes[/b]
Here our goal is to create a unique and enjoyable roleplay environment for fans of the fallout franchise. We welcome the presence of custom factions as well as ones already existing in the fallout universe as long as the reasoning for existing factions to be this far south. The borders set for this region are as far north as Virginia and as far south as Mexico. Please note that if it is found that your Lore does not fit well with existing factions as well as the fallout franchise, you will be suggested to look for a region that better fits your nation.
