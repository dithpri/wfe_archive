The Intelligent Reznian Alliance was founded upon the couch of Brandt Hall when the three leaders, Satihr BaRathri, Shuraan BaRathri, Anamar Barnes formed a small band of united countries all unified for one common goal: to educate the masses.

We are a small band of tiny nations, with the exceptions of East and West Reznia, with a lot of political freedom and diversity in political thought. Nonetheless, we all desire nothing more than to have a fun time.
