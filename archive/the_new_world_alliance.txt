[b][color=navy] The New World[/color] [color=red]Alliance[/color][/b]

[b]Back to the raiding business. These puppet nations can be put to rest. We have bigger fish to fry. Shift all activity to the forums and I will email each of you if we decide to reactivate this front. Until then, carry on with your real nations as we prepare to take our 26th region. I&#39;ll be back in DC until February;so, email my personal account if you need anything! Let these nations die until further action is required, if any, against the NWU (unlikely). If any of you want to meet back up at the Alliance convention in Alexandria, I&#39;ll be available. As you know, 2016 will be a big year for my firm! Don&#39;t forget to vote! You vote, I get paid. I get paid, you get paid!

Best &amp; onward,
