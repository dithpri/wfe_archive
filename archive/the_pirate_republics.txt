The nature of man is that of freedom. No one should be held beneath the control of a single King or Clergy, humanity should be free to choose their own leaders and codes of conduct. It is this truth that has led to the foundation of the Pirate Republics, where you may live freely. Our only true code of conduct is to ensure you don&#39;t block any other from indulging in our freedoms.

The Pirate Republics have been founded by those under Captain Benjamin Hornigold, now know as the Republic of Hornigold. Any are welcome to join our free world, though be wary: we will accept you as our companion in piracy, regardless of whether you participate in the practice or not.
