The Valencian Community, or the Valencian Country, is an autonomous community of Spain. It is the fourth most populated after Andalusia, Catalonia and Madrid with more than 4.9 million inhabitants. It is often homonymously identified with its capital Valencia, which is Spain&#39;s third largest city. It is located along the Mediterranean coast in the south-east of the Iberian peninsula. It borders with Catalonia to the north, Aragon and Castile&#150;La Mancha to the west, and Murcia to the south. It is formed by the provinces of Castell&oacute;n, Valencia and Alicante.
