Gleshcenstein is a relatively large country found on the ocean coastline. Ruled with an iron fist by the Gleshcen Dynasty, it was toppled some 350 years back by a group of rebels. Those rebels liberated the populace, but were afraid of causing havoc and anarchy; eventually, they decided to branch the nation off into three counties, linked only by the name Gleshcenstein. As the years passed, those counties split further and further, eventually becoming nothing more than several nations trapped under the title of an ancient empire.
