The Democratic States of Arjunlandia is a tiny, safe nation, notable for its  inhospitable landscape, compulsory military service, and strictly enforced bedtime. The hard-nosed, democratic, devout population of 10 million Arjunlandians have some civil rights, but not too many, enjoy the freedom to spend their money however they like, to a point, and take part in free and open elections, although not too often.
