Welcome. We appreciate your thoughts of supporting the Maxxi Sea. We make sure these international waters don&#39;t get too national. That&#39;s why it is called international waters in the first place. So look out for votes where we will take nation proposals and make them resolutions if they are legal. Thank you for joining and I hope you have a good time.-Maxxi Sea, founder of The World Assembly of the Maxxi Sea.
