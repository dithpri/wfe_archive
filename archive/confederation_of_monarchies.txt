[color=green]Reeling after the deadly War of Altlands, the Confederation of Monarchies has fallen. As nations turned on each other, order had been eradicated. Peace was compromised. Remaining nations fell one by one. Now, only a carcass of the former glory of the Confederation remains.
The final war, the endgame is approaching. For the rebirth of the Confederation, or its complete destruction.[/color]
[color=purple]From the ashes, into the flames.[/color]
[color=red]Long live the Confederation[/color]
