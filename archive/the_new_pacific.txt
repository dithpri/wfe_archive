[b]Welcome to the New Pacific![/b]

This region has the potential for becoming the best place to live!

One day the event called &amp;quot;the Destruction&amp;quot; is when Earth was shaken by a shatter bomb made by the Japanese-Nazi Alliance that caused geological catastrophes and also broke apart many continents to form the New Pacific and the World regions were damaged. More that 45% of the population of the world were killed. But new countries emerged.
