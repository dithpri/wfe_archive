Tybrageoria was founded when members of the Tybanti, Shipry, and Coletti ethnic groups left North Kevrea because they were tired of Kevin&amp;#39;s crap. The three groups had intentions of forming one country, but fell into a civil war when they could not agree upon the national animal. Thus, the three groups formed their own countries, resulting in Georgoplis, Bradlantis, and Tybantium. The three countries remained at odds for some time, until North Kevrea tried to re-dominate the region.  The three countries then had to unite against the common enemy, resulting in the region of Tybrageoria that thrives to this day.
