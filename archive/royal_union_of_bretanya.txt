Basically the renaming of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Why? United Kingdom, why not Royal Union of Bretanya, you have the Royal Mail, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, only thing with British is the British Army, not Royal Army?

The Free Land of Bretanya is Cymru; there be Dragons here!
