Greetings!

The Presidential Dictator Union is a region of like-minded dictators.  We acknowledge the validity of democracy, but recognize the supremacy of a nation ruled by one skilled ruler instead of multiple unskilled rulers. 

As dictators we do not strive to make life for our people as uncomfortable as possible. On the contrary PDU founder - [nation]Wilpanzer[/nation] - shows that seek adequate civil rights for our people.  Our presidents are humble servants of the people.
