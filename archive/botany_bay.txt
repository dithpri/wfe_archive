For fourteen long years I have ser-vi-ed,
And for fourteen long years and a day,
For meeting a bloke in the area,
And sneaking his ticker away.
And sneaking his ticker away.

Oh had I the wings of a turtle-dove,
I&#39;d soar on my pinions so high,
Slap bang to the arms of my Polly love,
And in her sweet presence I&#39;d die
And in her sweet presence I&#39;d die.

Now all my young Dook-ies and Duch-ess-es,
Take warning from what I&#39;ve to say:
Mind all is your own as you touch-es-es,
Or you&#39;ll find us in Botany Bay,
Or you&#39;ll find us in Botany Bay.
