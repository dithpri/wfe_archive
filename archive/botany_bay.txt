By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling
Nothing matters, Mary, when you&#39;re free
Against the famine and the crown,
I rebelled, they cut me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity
By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star fall
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
For she lived to hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay
It&#39;s so lonely round the fields of Athenry

A British Penal colony in Australia, this Bay has a plethora of sea and plant life that caused its name to be established.
