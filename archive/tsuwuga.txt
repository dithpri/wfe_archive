It was on a lonely journey on a hot winter night. We were riding along on our rocks when the promised land presented itself before our very eyes. As we crawled forwards the entity was revealed. At 4 feet tall, and quite pear-shaped, it was a sight to behold. Raw power emanated from its cartilaginous facial protrusion, making us question if we should continue forwards. That&#39;s when we heard it. A sound that told us the entity meant us no harm. A sound that told us we would be safe here. That sound, such a glorious sound, still lives on in our culture all these years later. It&#39;s become something more. A greeting, a goodbye, a sound of welcome. It is a sound that means whatever it needs to, but always comforting and sincere. Noot. Noot.
