Welcome to the great region of Horus region. A recently created region that searches the support of other regions. I guarantee a good game and good vibes between all members. Here are some rules:

-A member can&acute;t be insulted. If a member insultes you, you must tell it to me and I&acute;ll punish him depending in the importance of the insult

-You can talk about any theme 

-You can expose your ideology without being discriminated by anyone

-You can also expose your religion without being discriminated by anyone

With this rules I hope we all can get on well. The incompletion of anyone of this rules will be punished with expulsion of the member that break the rule
