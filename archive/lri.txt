[url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=19074645#p19074645]This is a quote from a known raider, Mall[/url]:
[i][color=blue]This isn&amp;#39;t a war between invaders and defenders. This is an extermination of natives (while defenders sometimes get in the way) across all of nationstates. You don&amp;#39;t get to be neutral if we can get into your region. ~Mall[/color][/i]

If you don&amp;#39;t believe your region needs a defense system after reading that, no one may be able to help you.
