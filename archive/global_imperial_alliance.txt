The Global Imperial Alliance (GIA) is an alliance of Empires and Kingdoms alike; any hereditary monarchies (absolute, figurehead, or constitutional) are allowed to join the GIA. Delegates will be elected, but me, the founder, The Supreme Leader of the Empire of Slovenia Croatia Italy and Serbia (SCIS) has permanent executive authority. Our goal is to build an army of hereditary monarchies so powerful that the WA will not ignore us, and with your help, we will accomplish our goal. I welcome all Kings, Queens, Emperors, Sultans, and Emirs to join this region. Any member nations who want a position are likely to get one, just send me a telegram at &quot;The Empire of Slovenia Croatia Italy and Serbia&quot; and let me know what position you want.
