The Global Imperial Alliance is an alliance of Empires and Kingdoms alike; any hereditary monarchies (absolute, figurehead, or constitutional) are allowed to join the GIA, and any other nation who tries to join will be ejected. Delegates will be elected, but me, the founder, The Supreme Leader of the Empire of Slovenia Croatia Italy and Serbia (SCIS) has permanent executive authority. I hope you will join us to become the most powerful region in the world. I don&#39;t care what you do in your country, as long as there is a royal family in power.
