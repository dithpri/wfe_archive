This Region is currently working on a Regional Government, and the Founder&amp;#39;s Council is working on a draft of the Constitution. The draft will be made publishable to the Region, available to have discussion put upon it. I am also working on a Welcome TG and Regional Newspaper possibility.
Please be patient with us, and work with us to create a great Region.
