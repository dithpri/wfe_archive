This Region is currently working on a Regional Government, and the Founder&amp;#39;s Council is working on a draft of the Constitution. The draft will be made publishable to the Region, available to have discussion put upon it. Thanks to the Regional Newspaper vote, I will request a newspaper soon.
Please be patient with us, and work with us to create a great Region.
RMB Question:
[u][B]Now that we have agreement on the desire for a Regional Paper, what should it be called?[/B][/u]
