Located in Darkmoon Forest and the Deathwood, the Kingdom of the Necromancers holds the last remnants of the once mighty Necrotic Empire. Faced with threats on all sides, a line of canny Archnecromancers have used magic, military might and political intrigue to keep the neighboring realms at bay. 

Under Archnecromancer Lyrus Serriados, the Kingdom has made alliances with some the northern goblinoids and established semi-autonomous counties in the northlands, allowing the Kingdom to stand better against its foes.
