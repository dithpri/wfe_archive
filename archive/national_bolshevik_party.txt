[b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b]

[i]Taken: 10/11/12[/i]

This region was allied to The MT Army back in 2005.

After ceasing to exist naturally and peacefully; the region was refounded in 2012 by famous Nazi Shira Bell, in an effort to spite [region]The MT Army[/region].

The region shall be liberated from its Nazi oppressors so it can remain a region for peace and prosperity, a basin of strength against the remaining Nazi&amp;#39;s on NationStates.
