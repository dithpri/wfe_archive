The [color=#836953][b]Gaza Strip[/b][/color] is the smaller of the two Palestinian territories (the other being the West Bank). On the eastern coast of the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=mediterranean_sea][b][color=#836953]Mediterranean Sea[/b][/url][/color], Gaza is bordered by Egypt on the southwest and Israel on the east and north.
