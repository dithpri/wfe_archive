A world with a significant southern ocean and swamps that cover the planet&#39;s surface including the Endless Swamp, a semi-solid area filled with massive, overgrown trees. The planet also had a unique connection to the Force being balanced between the light and dark sides of the Force, similar to Odessen. Zakuul was home to an immigrated Human population along with the native Iknayid but other creatures were present also and even adapted to their environment such as the swamp rancor. The planet also possessed advanced technology with several cities spread throughout the world branching off from the Spire and being the resting place of the Eternal Throne.
