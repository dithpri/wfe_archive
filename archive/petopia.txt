Courage. Honor. Respect. A few things the enemy dose not get from us. Death. Hell. Destruction. A few of the things that we will happily give those who think themselves better. As a famous General in WWII said after receving a letter from the German comander to surrender and they will be spared death, &amp;quot;NUTS!!&amp;quot; There battle cry: take no prisoners. Are battle cry: make them wish they was our prisoners. Hail to war. And all the perks of victory over the heathen bastards.
