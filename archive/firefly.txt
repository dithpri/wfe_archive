[b][color=red]Firefly[/color] isn&#39;t just some canceled show. [color=red]Firefly[/color] is the [color=blue]Serenity Valley[/color] of canceled shows, the place where hundreds if not thousands of people in the verse stood and said, not this time. This time we will not accept another stupid cancellation. Firefly is too good to die like all those that went before!
