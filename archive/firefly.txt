[color=scarlet]Firefly[/color] isn&#39;t just some canceled show. [color=scarlet]Firefly[/color] is the [color=cyan]Serenity Valley[/color] of canceled shows, the place where hundreds if not thousands of people in the verse stood and said, not this time. This time we will not accept another stupid cancelation. [color=scarlert]Firefly[/color] is too good to die like all those that went before!
