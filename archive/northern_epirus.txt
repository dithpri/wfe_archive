[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were sitting around in The Nest when the good General Jakker told them that there was a BIG EVENT coming up and that the word needed to get out. So a bunch decided to get together and do what Hawks do best. Drop a bunch of flyers around! So they made a mad dash around many a region to try and invite others to have fun with them. After getting the word out, they went back to The Nest to max and relax.
