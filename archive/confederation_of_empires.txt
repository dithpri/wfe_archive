The Confederation is here to help nations that are less developed become more filmier to the world. People will leave but the ones who leave will make the Confederation week if they stay, we all do are part. A constitution will be made for the entire Region to follow and it will be able to be amended if there&amp;#39;s something needing to be changed. So Comrades unite as one and be one!
