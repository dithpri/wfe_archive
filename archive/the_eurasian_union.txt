[b]Precursor to the establishment of [region]Slavya[/region] and [region]Slavia[/region][/b], [b][region]The Eurasian Union[/region][/b] was one of the many centres of the Slavic Nations on NationStates. Whereupon the Supranational Organisation&amp;#39;s recent demise, the Government of the Republic of Belarus has seen fit to designate a Mandate on behalf of the above said regions over its once-mighty, hallow chambers to prevent its subjugation under foreign powers. Should nations wish to refine and reinvent this region, [b]please contact the Secretary General of Slavic Affairs, Republic of Belarus by telegramming us.[/b] We are more than happy to see the rise of this region once again with adept and intelligent partners!
