Allies:
We know who they are. [i]we-ell so Ive been informed[/i]

URGENT: Following a freak accident which in absolutely no way had anything to do with FC or any of his friends in the Celtic Warrior Combatatitive Bowling League, all records of our actual allies have been destroyed. So, in short, we actually have no idea who you are.

[color=red]THE GOOD OLD DAYS ARE BACK[/color]
[i]Yup. You read that right. The good old days. And every bit of blinding stupidity, juvenile behavior, psychotic breakdowns, and hangovers came back with them. Brace yourself, world. God knows we are.[/i]

Also in regional news... Zombies are now officially recognised as an endangered species.
