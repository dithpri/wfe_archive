Until December 10th 2013, Weltzentrum was thought as the only place in the entire universe. Because of that, nobody had ever composed a description of the place (for whom would it be?). Upon discovering the existence of other nations and regions, the various countries that form [region]Weltzentrum[/region] started to work jointly on a description for it. Please, be patient.
