This outstanding, superlative and remarkable  region is nicknamed &#145;Paradise&#146; for its amazing, alluring and perplexing greenery. The name Quauhtemallan itself means &#145;land of many trees&#146;! This region requests only the equality, liberty and autonomy for all of its residentiaries for the only quality our people shall possess should be kindness and compassion.
