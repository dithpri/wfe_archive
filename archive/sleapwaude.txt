A large landmass, comprised mainly of forested hills. There are some plains and steppes, as well as e relatively large peninsula. One of its main features is a large mountain range that cuts straight through this sub-continent.
The landmass&#39; name is archa&iuml;c Thassiphoran for &quot;sleeping woods&quot;, a reference to how the once silent woodlands turned into a warzone during the war with a once powerful theological empire that is now lost to the ages.
