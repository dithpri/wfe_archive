[b][u][color=blue]The League of Defensive Realist Nations [/b][/u][/color]

Ten years ago, our great founder [url=http://nationstates.net/halvination/]Halvination[/url] rebelled from the oppressive regions that dominated the world stage to found our own league, characterized by security dilemmas and our desire to maximize power to preserve security and sovereignty. Our League is in the process of expansion, and will accept any nation not fundamentally opposed to our values. Why in tarnation wouldn&#39;t you want to join?
