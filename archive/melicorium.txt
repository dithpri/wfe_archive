[i][b]Fight for freedom or die doing so![/b][/i]

[i]Arise, all you people against their abuse
Their despicable ruse shall not hinder our call
It shakes our forests and pampas and hills
And in us it instills our will to rescue all.

Defenders of freedom, re-echo her cry
And fight for the homeland to win or to die![/i]
