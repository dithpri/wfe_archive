A deep pit is formed in the ground. The entranceway to this pit is wide enough so people can walk through without having to run across, but narrow enough that when they walk around they only have space to pass through the entry way. The entranceway looks like a doorway from outside, but its walls are lined with holes for your walking shoes to pass through and a grate, inside which you can pour water.

The entranceway is in the center of the cave entranceway, opposite of the tunnel entranceway, right next to the bridge in the cave area; however, the other entrances (including the water tank and the two ladder entrances) are not there. You must ascend the ladder to get to the other part of the cave.
