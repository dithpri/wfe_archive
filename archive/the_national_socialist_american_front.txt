This region, known previously as The National Socialist American Legion (NSAL), stands as a testament to the [color=red]corrupt[/color] and [color=red]biased[/color] nature of the World Assembly, the screeching hordes of [color=red]Marxists[/color] they let run free, and the [color=red]suppression[/color] and [color=red]censoring[/color] of the 3rd position on Nationstates.

It is to be known that the National Socialist struggle will never die, no matter how many nations are deleted, regions raided, and abuses of power carried out. You can never truly get rid of us, because we have that will, that faith, and above all that belief, which will lead the generations to come! They will look back upon the pages of history and call out &quot;They were true!&quot;
