[b]PAN-SLAVISM: UNITY, BROTHERHOOD, AND FAITH[/b]

We are a Slavic Region dedicated to unity and peace among Slavic nations and regions. We accept all peoples of ethnic backgrounds, races, and creeds (faiths).

Better yet, [b]NO[/b] communism! You can have a say in the government, because elections will happen every three months! 

Come down and join us, and if you feel like this is the place you belong in, then [b]WELCOME HOME![/b]
