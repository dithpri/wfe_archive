Welcome to [color=darkblue][b]Freedom Union[/b][/color], founded on 17 June 2016, by [nation]Dublin 4[/nation].

[hr]
[color=darkblue][b]FU[/b][/color] is a place where free speech is allowed, and region members are encouraged to debate, chat and just have fun in our RMB. Discussion does not mean spamming! We are in the progress of building a great region, I hope you will join us on the journey.

We envisage to have a running regional government in the coming days and week ahead. 

[spoiler=Quote of the Day][i]Honest discussions - even and perhaps especially on topics about which we disagree - can help us resist hypocrisy and arrogance. They can also help us live up to the basic ideals, such as liberty and justice for all[/i]. - David Price[/spoiler]
