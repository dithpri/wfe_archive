The nations of the World Assembly have been compelled to create a tyrannical bureaucracy of vast proportions. Added to this, 27 000 nations controlled by 1800 delegates are directly involved in the oversight of the elitist institution. The total influence, economic, political, even spiritual, is felt in every city, every state house, every office of federal governments. In the council of governments, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the General Assembly or Security Council. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. 

For our struggle, lead us on!
