An ancient forest basked in perpetual night, any citizen that is unfortunate enough to reside in this region lives in constant fear of being stalked and/or abducted by the Slenderman.

Of course, there&amp;#39;s also a wealth of unclaimed land, natural resources, and unimpeded freedom, so perhaps the risk is worth it.

Any nation is free to chance it, just be careful to never, never look directly at the Slenderman. That leads to death.
