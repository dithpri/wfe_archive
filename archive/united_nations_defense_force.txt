[b]Together We Stand, Divided We Fall[/b]
[b]Under the flag, we go to war[/b]
[b]Citizen Soldiers, who want to become more than themselfs[/b]
[b]All die, all live, all fight, all win[/b]
[b]Help all, save none[/b]
[b]War, is not the answer, but it is the way[/b]
[b]Many shout their battle-cry, others pray for God to save them[/b]
[b]But the rule remains the same as before[/b]
[b]Together We Stand, Divided We Fall[/b]
[b]Hollow heroes separate[/b]
[b]They wonder, while we die[/b]
[b]Our souls damned to Hell, but we accept it and send our enemies to be damned in it[/b]
[b]But we learned, This...is...War[/b]
