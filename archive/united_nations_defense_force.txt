The United Defense Force is sworn to protect from its enemies. We, do not care if foreign or domestic. We wish for peace, but that&#146;s a lie filled with promise. It&#146;s a lie we believe. It&#146;s a lie that we will make the truth. We attempt to understand and care for all. We stand forever on guard, ready to protect.
We want to make to make sure to tell you The strongest among men do not wear a crown. On that day when you have no hope or lost the strength to fight, you will see our flag. Our brothers are ready to attack or defend. No war is unpatriotic. There is always a reason.  We will not let you down, we walk beside you though you may not see us. If you do not have the strength for the burden you bare put it on our shoulders.
