Welcome! All nations are welcome, regardless of ideology and government style! We currently run a democratic government but don&#146;t expect that to stay, as the leader can choose how to use their new power and can make all the decisions themselves if they want or they can give the community a voice. Have fun, keep it cool, we got metal, you don&#146;t want static&amp;#9996;&amp;#65039;
