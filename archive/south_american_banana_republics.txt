Banana republic is a political science term for a politically unstable country whose economy is largely dependent on the export of a single limited-resource product, such as fruits or minerals. It typically has stratified social classes, including a large, impoverished working class and a ruling plutocracy that comprises the elites of business, politics, and the military. This politico-economic oligarchy controls the primary-sector productions and thereby exploit the country&amp;#39;s economy.
