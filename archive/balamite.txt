Balamite is a very large planet in the solar system of Michronite, located within the Adromeda Galaxy. The only known continent of Balamica consists solely of the Balamican Empire, which mainly focuses on interplanetary and even intergalactic travel, so it is most likely that more continents could exist within the large planet.
