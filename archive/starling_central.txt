We are a new and young community dedicated to maintaining happiness across our nations. We believe in good education, maintaining freedom and choice, and overall happiness. We are very pro-peace, pro-education, pro-choice, pro-environment, pro-LGBTQ+ and pro-economy. We are an accepting group of people no matter what race, nationality, identity, or sexuality you identify as.
We truly believe that everyone should have a say in any major decisions.
However we do have a few guidelines:
1) We must all be kind and respectful of one another and aid each other
2) All major decisions will be voted on
3) Have fun of course!
If you think this sounds like a good region for you then feel free to join! Thank you!
