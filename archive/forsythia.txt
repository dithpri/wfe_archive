
Are you looking to overthrow the global hegemony that is the world assembly? Yes? Then Forsythia is a region that you were made for. Look, we don&#146;t have any special events you can join in. Our anything. But fun is not for us dictatorships! The main goal of the region is simply to assert our dominance. Show the heretics and democratic fools that you can make as an outsider. We wish to someday rival the World Assembly with our own assembly. That&#146;s right, if you join, you join the region&#146;s own council. We, the nations of Forsythia have attempted to challenge the World Assembly. Now the only question that remains is - Will you join us? Or forever obey and give to the tyrannical World Assembly? You decide.
