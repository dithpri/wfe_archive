As the Arcane energy bleeds outward from the Starfall Isles, more and more nations are affected by it.

The Arcane Alliance is a collection of scholarly nations dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge above all else. They blend science and magic and bend reality to their will. They are stargazers, dreamers, philosophers, mad scientists, and curious children all rolled into one. Their leader is a powerful entity known to have brought about the end of the world more than once. His loyal mages think of him as a father.

Glory to the Dreamers.
