A region whose nations&#39; ideology are to be that of protecting the weak. 

There is indeed an oppressive elite in this world, and the Protectors are designed to rooting them out. Our Nations will need to be focused primarily on military and defense. They must strive for high personal and economic freedom. Political freedom  doesn&#39;t need to be superb, but should NOT be poor. Since we are military nations, there is a strictness within out politics, primarily to help keep corruption at a minimum. Our peoples should feel free to do and say whatever they wish, within the boundaries of the law that is. 

The primary purpose of the Protectors is to root out the writing filth plaguing our societies.
