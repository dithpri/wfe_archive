The Northern Lands
The Jewel of the North
Motto 
De nordlige landene vil leve for alltid
(The northern lands will live forever)

     Here in Scandinavia we value our freedom and our regional identity to create a community of the northern lands. We started in 2015 to unite similar nations to our own nations together to form a region with an identity. We may start out small but we will get bigger!
