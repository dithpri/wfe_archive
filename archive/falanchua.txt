[b]Elections for the Regional Delegate position are held every 4 weeks![/b]

Falanchua is one of the poorest and weakest regions in the world, characterised by poor economic management at the highest levels, although bearing host to some pretty above average human rights record. 

The two largest superpowers of the region are Ynnam and Yeetsralia, both bringing innumberable benefits to the region.

The word of the year is: Cuh

Please do not forget to endorse our regional delegate!
