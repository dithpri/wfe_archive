[B] Falanchua is a barren and desperate highway, devoid of all life except for those who wander through the shadow of night [/B]

[i] they wander aimlessly through the forests of azure, wandering, wandering, lost
Out here they speak of the heartache and scatterings on the highway[/i]

Indians scattered on dawn&#39;s highway bleeding

[i] Out here in the perimeter there are no stars[/i]
