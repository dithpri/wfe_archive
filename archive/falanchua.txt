[b]Elections for the Regional Delegate are held at the founders leisure[/b]

Falanchua is an incredibly diverse region, characterised by its many different levels of civil rights and political freedoms across the political spectrum. The region bears host to a massive economy, with different nations contributing to various degrees, the Socialist States of Ynnam and The God-Fearing Islands of Yeetsralia by far contributing the largest.
