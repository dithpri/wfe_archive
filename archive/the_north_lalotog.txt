[region]The North Lalotog[/region] welcomes any peaceful nation to our region.

We value curiosity and a desire to learn, so any nation that supports these values will easily find a place in The North Lalotog.

However, any nation that invades or changes our region without permission from the founder, [nation]Saranla de Jaic Eron[/nation] will be immediately ejected and banned if deemed necessary. Permission to alter anything may be requested on the regional message board.

That said, as long as you follow the rules, I can guarantee that you will have a good time here in [region]The North Lalotog[/region].

We are currently looking for a WA Delegate. If you&#39;re interested, please post on the regional message board.
