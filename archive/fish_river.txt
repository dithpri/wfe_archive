The Fish River is a river in Namibia that joins the Orange River into the Atlantic. The flow of the river varies widely. In the winter months, the river may dry up completely. The river is also the site of the Fish River Canyon. We have chosen this unique river as a jump point due to its strategic location, overlooking the vast desert, and the spectacular views that it has to offer.
