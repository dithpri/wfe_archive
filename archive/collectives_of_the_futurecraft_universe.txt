This region is used to organize and govern the nations of the Futurecraft Universe, a tightly-knit, diverse and friendly group of political / sci-fi RPers hailing from our offsite forum, &amp;#39;fc-mod.com&amp;#39;. Membership requires that your faction / nation be active for at least 2 weeks on said offsite forum, at which point you may join. Additionally, membership in said forum requires that you be a Minecraft player, since the forum is built around the development of a particular MC mod.

If you DO choose to join the Collectives, I suggest that you exercise caution; most of our community probably has some sort of mental disorder. For example, ACH0225 probably has multiple personality disorder, and the infamous Cool-3303 is mentally retarded.
