This region is used to organize and govern the nations of the Futurecraft Universe, a tightly-knit, diverse and friendly group of political / sci-fi RPers hailing from our offsite forum, &amp;#39;fc-mod.com&amp;#39;. Membership requires that your faction / nation be active for at least 2 weeks on said offsite forum, at which point you may join the Collective.

[sarcasm] If you DO choose to join the Collectives, I suggest that you exercise caution; the majority of our community probably has some sort of mental disorder. For example, ACH0225 probably has multiple personality disorder, Hyperlite is likely to suffer from OCD, and the infamous Cool-3303 is mentally retarded. [/sarcasm]
