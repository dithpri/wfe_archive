My soul is shipwrecked in the night
Upon a black and vacant shore;
A flood of murky air before,
Of surging air to left and right.

The waves roll in, the waves roll in,
And each a sombre spectre bears,
The writhing forms of many cares,
The coiling forms of many a sin;

Neglected tasks that frown austere,
Glimpses of old friends angry, gleams
Of dead delights and drifting dreams
And gibbering ghosts of empty fear

Out on the flood, the faces pale
Of drowning hopes, so fair, so fair;
Or, tossing here and floating there,
The tattered rags of fortune&#39;s sail;

And, wrenched from out that midnight grave,
The white corpse of a passion sweet,
Rolled by the darkness to my feet,
And then snatched back into the wave.
