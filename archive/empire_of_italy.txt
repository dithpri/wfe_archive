Once a haven for Italian Fascists, no more! Now we Communists of the [color=red]Red Fleet[/color] and the partisans of [b]Ant[/b][color=red]ifa[/color] have struck and freed Italy from the repugnant forces of [i]Fascismo[/i]!

Long Live the [color=red]Red Fleet[/color], Long live the Rivoluzione!!
