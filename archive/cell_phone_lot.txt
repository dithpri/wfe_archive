A [b]cell phone lot[/b] is a parking lot, typically located at airports, where people can wait before picking up passengers. The purpose of these lots is to reduce congestion at arrival sections by preventing cars from continuously circling around the airport or waiting on the sides of highways to avoid paying fees at the airport parking lots. Once the passenger&#39;s flight lands, after they collect their luggage and are ready to be picked up, they call the person waiting in the cell phone lot. These lots are usually free and only minutes away from the terminals.
