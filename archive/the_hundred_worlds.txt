This region&#39;s name was inspired by the Hundred Worlds from the Ender Trilogy.

Invented by Orson Scott Card (The author of [i]Ender&#39;s Game, Speaker of the Dead[/i], and numerous other books), it is a united federation of human star systems controlled by a government called Starpower Congress. Many of the member systems were previously Formic/bugger colonies, until the supposed &quot;Xenocide&quot; committed by Ender/Andrew Wiggin.
