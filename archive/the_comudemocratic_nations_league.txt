We have one motto &amp;quot;Strength in numbers&amp;quot; we will have votes within our region to decide what everyone shall vote for in the World Assembly. This is a great region for those who want a bigger vote in the WA, or who think that regions are useless, because we will actually do things, other than other regions. In fact, this is the perfect region for everyone! Please Join! Thank you!
