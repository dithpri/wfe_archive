Hogsmeade Village, or simply [b]Hogsmeade[/b], is the only settlement in Britain inhabited solely by wizards, witches, and other magical beings, and is located to the northwest of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Much of Hogsmeade&#39;s architecture reflects its medieval origin; the village is known for its leaning medieval houses, the most famous of which is an ancient inn, The Three Broomsticks. &#151;Wikipedia
