Welcome to Meridon, a region with diversity that stretches from ethnicities to ideologies to the climate itself.

Please endorse your Interim Regional Delegate to the World Assembly, [nation=short]Capisaria[/nation]. And enjoy your stay.

[B]Message from the Delegate[/b]
The region we have currently is small and vulnerable. We need to recruit more nations, preferably one&amp;#39;s that hold membership in the WA, not that we should limit ourselves to that. I&amp;#39;m also looking to get together some form of a government after I make an offsite forum.
