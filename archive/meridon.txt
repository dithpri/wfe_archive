Sign up for the regional forum [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Meridon/index/]here[/url]. We&amp;#39;ve got some great stuff going over there. 

Secondly, we have a regional constitution going on, telegram [nation=short]Capisaria[/nation] for more info.

Finally, our regional founder, [nation=short]Setith[/nation] has been fully resurrected, and will be active enough to protect the region from threats. Please note that this is note a hostile takeover of the WA Delegate, as the constitution will be completed and put to vote before Christmas.
