[b]The Europeian Republican Navy has claimed this region in the name of [region]Europeia[/region]. Isn&amp;#39;t that lovely?

I&amp;#39;ve been out of the raiding game for a year, and I still have it. 

Our sacrifices to the Trinity of Raiding have paid off, and this region is ours!

With special thanks to our friends in the [region]United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] for their help.
