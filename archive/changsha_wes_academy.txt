The first people arrived in CWA late in the 6th century B.C., probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced circa 250 B.C., and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in northern CWA. The Portuguese controlled the coastal areas of the island in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th century. Its name was changed to CWA in 1972.
