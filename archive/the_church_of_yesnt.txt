The Church of Yesn&#39;t is a region dedicated to people who use &quot;yesn&#39;t&quot; instead of &quot;no&quot;.

It also promotes the usage of &quot;yesn&#39;t&quot; in Forum 7, as a replacement for the obviously outdated &quot;no&quot; and the usage of &quot;non&#39;t&quot;, as a replacement for the obviously outdated &quot;yes&#39;.

[strike]Also totally not FSS&#39; puppet hole. Wait, damn, there actually ARE people in here who aren&#39;t FSS![/strike]
