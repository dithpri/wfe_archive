The Union of Mediterranean Arab Republics is a small but large force in the Mediterranean, pushing power throughout the region. Each day nations within the Union collaborate towards the goal of the union: To keep the peace, teach those the way of Allah, and protecting the holy land. We span from the Middle East to Eastern Africa. Our Central and founding nation is the Iraq Emirates, a small but strong federation which it&amp;#39;s mission is to spread the way of Allah.
