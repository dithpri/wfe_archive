[b][color=teal]Hello, Welcome to Athiris![/color][/b]
[hr]Looking for people join and do lots of role playing.
There will be a map, and lots of fun stuff as soon as some nations join the region.
Get some friends as well!
Completely open to ideas on how to run as long as nations are at least somewhat serious about playing.

[nation]Noviria[/nation] will enable WA delgate controls (if we want them on) after a stable population has been reached.
