[b][color=teal]Hello, Welcome to Athiris![/color][/b]
[hr]Looking for people join and do lots of role playing.
There can be a map, NS++, IRC, and lots of fun stuff [color=blue][i]as soon as some nations join the region.[/i][/color]
[color=teal]Get some friends as well![/color]
Completely open to ideas on how to run as long as nations are at least somewhat serious about playing.

[nation]Noviria[/nation] will enable WA delgate controls (if we want them on) after a stable population has been reached.
