[b]Welcome to [color=teal]Athiris[/color]![/b]
We were offline for a while, but have restructured and are back up and running. If this is your first time here, Athiris is a roleplaying region based around the idea of a non-consistent canon. Please read the attached dispatch, &quot;How Athiris Works&quot;, to get an understanding of how roleplaying will function in this region.
