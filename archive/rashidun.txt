The Rashidun Caliphate was the first of the four major caliphates established after the death of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. It was ruled by the first four successive caliphs of Muhammad after his death in 632 CE. These caliphs are collectively known in Sunni Islam as the Rashidun, or &quot;Rightly Guided&quot; caliphs. All Islamic nations are welcome in our Ummah.
