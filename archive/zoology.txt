[b][color=blue]Zoology is the branch of biology that studies the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. The term is derived from Ancient Greek &amp;#950;&amp;#8183;&amp;#959;&amp;#957;, z&amp;#333;ion, i.e. &quot;animal&quot; and &amp;#955;&amp;#972;&amp;#947;&amp;#959;&amp;#962;, logos, i.e. &quot;knowledge, study&quot;.

The history of zoology traces the study of the animal kingdom from ancient to modern times. Although the concept of zoology as a single coherent field arose much later, the zoological sciences emerged from natural history reaching back to the biological works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world.[/b][/color]
