Erilia is an Earth sized class M planet, see it as an alternate universe to our own earth.
The region is modern tech and allows no &quot;superpowers&quot;.
All nations are subject to limitations based on the issues system of nationstates. Your NS stats and spending focus form the basis your strength in the region. Population will also be capped at 10% in order to keep it reqlistic. You can override this stats if you whish to play with lower stats than you actually have a claim to(for isntance: to simulate internal turmoil or an economic downturn) but never higher. This is what makes this region one of a kind.

Welcome and have fun!
