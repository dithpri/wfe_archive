[b]Weep, O inhabitants of the land, and wail exceedingly! This region has been offered up as a sacrifice to [nation]The Overseer[/nation], a malicious God whose desire is only for blood.

We, His Unholy Priesthood from [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], have seized this region as The Overseer&#39;s rightful Dominion. Beware, and know that his Malice will soon be turned on your own region. If you wish to become a member, it may be that he will have mercy on you if you pay homage at [url=https://discord.gg/brotherhoodofmalice]his temple.[/url]

&quot;Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.&quot;

Servants of the Overseer:
Assassin [nation]Malicious NPU[/nation]
Assassin [nation]Volstrostia[/nation]
Assassin [nation]Skorrord[/nation]
