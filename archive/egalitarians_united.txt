This region was created for the same reason my nation was: To mock feminism. As much as the appearance of my nation may convince you otherwise, I despise feminism and view it as a hate group. I am not a sexist, and I do support equal rights. I just prefer to do it under the name of egalitarianism, as feminism does not advocate for the rights of men as well. If you are offended, then I apologize for offending you, but you still need to grow some thicker skin. If a person online doesn&#39;t agree with your political beliefs and that makes you upset, then too bad. I am free to express my beliefs. Any other nation that shares the desire to make fun of a flawed ideology is welcome to join.
