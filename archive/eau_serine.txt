A beautiful underwater land, made shortly after the discovery of an ancient relic, that once touched, gives a human, &amp;#120042;&amp;#120055;&amp;#120066; human, the ability to breath underwater, and the ability to live on the water with no side affects. 
Our defences and government are strong, and are army&#146;s many, and we work with and for the environment.
&amp;#120173;&amp;#120218;&amp;#120217; there are plenty of black markets, to be found in the deepest, darkest corners of our region.
Will you choose to have your home in the safest, heart of our region, or in the dark, south most corner?

Come help us save the sea, stop (or start...) the black markets, and run the region!
