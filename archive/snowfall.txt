Snowfall is a magical region where it is always snowing. Surprisingly, it is not too cold. it&amp;#39;s temperatures range from 4 degrees to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (because it doesn&amp;#39;t have seasons). Snowfall is known for it&amp;#39;s beautiful beaches blanketed with snow. Here, you can actually build a snowman at the beach! The people of Snowfall welcomes every nation into it&amp;#39;s small region. We allow you to come temporarily until you find a region you like better, but we would love if you stayed permanently. Thanks for reading this, and thanks for looking at Snowfall!
