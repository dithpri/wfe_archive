&quot;Reality? That&#39;s not the way the world really works anymore. We&#39;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#39;re studying that reality&#151;judiciously, as you will&#151;we&#39;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#39;s how things will sort out. We&#39;re history&#39;s actors &#133; and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&quot;[/b]
