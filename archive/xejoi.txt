Xe&amp;#39;joi is a barren life-supporting desert-like plant home to the indigenous population of the Xe&amp;#39;Joi&amp;#39;as. The planet consists of mainly archipelagos of desert. It&amp;#39;s a very hot and undesirable environment; however, the Xe&amp;#39;joi&amp;#39;as have grown used to it and love it.
