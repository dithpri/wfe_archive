A refounded colony of [region]Andarios[/region]. A small cluster near the Andarian Galaxy composed of five planets and a sun, colonized after the total conquest of the Andarian galaxy. The name of the first planet is TOL because in him were found ruins of a ancient galactic civilization unknown to mankind and thus the name of the cluster was given due to this discovery. Also the natives decided to submit peacefully and become andarian citizens.
