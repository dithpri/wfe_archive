The region is in an endless war for dominance between nations and sub-nations.  The covenant and the UNSC have been killing one another and dividing themselves into smaller nations since day one.  The region is currently in an endless state of war between the old-party of New Soivica and the new-party controlled Soivica.  Both countries compete and oppose each other in an insurrectionist planet away from the weakened UNSC.  Omega Lands is the current space orbiting superpower and supports both sides for profit and political experimentation.
