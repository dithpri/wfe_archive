Upper Fessenylia, formerly Fessenylia, is a small, isolated region formed out of a largely unknown and uncharted continent. Disasters rocked the area for centuries until a cataclysmic earthquake and multiple volcanic eruptions destroyed much of the land that formed the southern half of the continent four hundred years ago.
