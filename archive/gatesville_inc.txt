Gatesvillians,

It saddens me to announce that Gates has requested this region to be shuttered. Gatesville has stood the test of time as the beacon for sovereignty. In short, we won the game. National and regional sovereignty are now touted across multiple regions and flaunted as a recruiting tool in all areas. I have not the heart to eject or ban anyone, so this region will continue to stand for as long as a nation resides here. I have password-protected it, and will not share the password, so it is immune to attack. 

[region]Unknown[/region] and [region]Gilgamesh[/region] have agreed to take in any nations that wish to join.

I have never been so proud as I am now, to still be here with you all.
