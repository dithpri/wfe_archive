It has been a dark time.  The World Assembly has run roughshod with no one to match their numbers.  

And yet, out of the darkness comes a glimmer of hope. Gatesville has returned bearing the torch of sovereignty to save the innocent, the naive, the young, from the tyranny of the WA.  Under the rule of Queen [nation=short]Nevadar[/nation] and [nation=short]Gates the God[/nation], Gatesville has stood the test of time as the beacon for sovereignty. United once again, we will bring down the WA once and for all!

If you choose to join the World Assembly, endorse our delegate [nation=short]Noctaurus[/nation]. In order to fight the beast we must get close to him.
