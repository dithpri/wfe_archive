Puppets of [nation]The Pacific Northwest[/nation], main nation resides in [region]Refugia[/region]. I used TPN instead of TPNW to differentiate it a bit from the real world initialism of PNW. 

The unnumbered nations were originally created so I could experiment with answering issues in different ways, but also doubles as a mini card farm and they come in handy for N-day. The rest are just purely for farming. 

Since this is just a puppet storage region I&#146;m not going to be doing embassies.
