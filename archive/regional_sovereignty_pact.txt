[b]A region designed as an Alliance of regions looking to keep their people safe from invaders, under [nation]Regional Sovereignty Pact[/nation]&#39;s management
[/b]

Intended to be a meeting place between member regions for communication purposes.

Rules are simple here, [u]follow site guidelines[/u], use English, and avoid spamming. I will manage this region with an iron fist so don&#39;t even think about it.

There is a password, which is only to be given out by myself. Anyone found violating that rule will be banned and the password changed.
