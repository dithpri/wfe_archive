After ten years of waiting the terraforming bots finally finished making the atmosphere,then started melting the southern icecap.Two years after the bots finished, the first ship came with various plants and animals.After five years the first humans arrived and built &amp;quot;The City&amp;quot; and started mining, farming,and exploring.And finally after ten years after the terraforming was finished,trade and travel opened up with Earth and its many regions.Mars is a tourist hotspot and know for its rare but delicious and sweet Jimmbia fruit and its batlike creatures that eat the Jimmbia fruit earning them the name Jimmbia Bats.So far we have not met any other Martian colonys or Native Martians
