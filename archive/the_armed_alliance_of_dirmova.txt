Founded in the first days of 2013, the Armed Alliance of Dirmova was founded with the sole intention of creating a region that fights to protect itself and its members&amp;#39; opinions. To try and achieve this without destroying itself all allied nations are encouraged to try living in peace with one another and working together like one large nation.

We would love to have [nation] join the Armed Alliance of Dirmova as one of its founding fathers or mothers and [nation] to go down in HISTORY becoming a beacon of wisdom and an important adviser to the region.
