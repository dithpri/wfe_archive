[url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=boneyard]the Boneyard[/url] isn&#39;t a region but [region]the Boneyard[/region] is.

Your nation might be here because it didn&#39;t survive the [region]Nationstates Hospital[/region] or [Region]The Bar on the Corner of Every Region[/region] (while its bones more likely got eaten in the latter).

But maybe your dead nation went instead to [region]The Graveyard[/region], [region]The Mausoleum[/region], [region]The Cemetery[/region], [region]The Graveyard[/region], [region]Graveyard[/region], [region]Boneyard[/region], or [region]Cemetery[/region] or a similar region because being dead is more lively there.
