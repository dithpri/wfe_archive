[color=green]Welcome to Ninuar![/color] Here we encourage [color=red]Ancient Roman[/color] and [color=brown]Medieval[/color] [b]Role Playing[/b] as a whole with more on the side! The region of Ninuar seeks a good and active political society with plenty of good entertainment in which everyone can participate.

As a completely new region we are currently constructing our whole homeland from scratch with a Constitution that will share ideas of the ancient Roman Republic and Old Greece but this alone cannot be completed without the ideas of others. So if you are interested in an RP community and always love having your voice heard in big political debates then join us here [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Ninuar/topic/8261991/2/#new]Link[/url] as we build upon a new world.
