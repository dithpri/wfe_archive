[b][color=navy]Attention everyone. I have come to realize that this region is filled with much inactivity. If we were to get rid of the inactive nations, there would be very few of us. We are so corrupt. I am closing down the region. There is no way we can make a successful recovery. The website and forums will be shut down. However, I am creating a new region for us. It is called [region]Knyghtaria[/region]. If you want to move away from this inactive waste land, feel free to move there. I will now resign from my position as founder. Thank you to all those who came here. We had a good run. In our new region, I can promise we will keep an active basis. Until next time, your ex-founder, [nation]Xcenanonia[/nation].[/b][/color]
