[b]General Information:[/b]
[color=green]Bacon[/color] is founded first and foremost for those who love [color=red][b]BACON!!![/b][/color] (Canadian bacon counts as well.)  However, all those who do not love the most delicious of all meats will still be accepted.  We are currently living under the [color=blue][i]Pax Baconia[/i][/color].  The [color=blue][i]Easter Treaty[/i][/color] has recently restored order to Bacon, ushering a new era of peace.

Needless to say, the meatpacking industry flourishes here, but for some strange reason our regional obesity figures are astonishingly high.
