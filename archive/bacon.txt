Welcome to the glorious region of Bacon. We are a region hungry for new nations and fresh crispy ideas. While we do enjoy the most exulted of fried meat products those who do not subscribe to this belief are also welcome. 

Current events: We are currently in the process of the creation of an inter-regional currency based on bacon grease. Ideas for how to regulate the purity of this proposed currency are welcome.

For a brief history of our region see the Factbook entry in Bacon Major.
