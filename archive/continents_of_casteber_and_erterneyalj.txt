WORK IN PROGRESS!

The Continents of Casteber and Erterneyalj are a realistic, Modern Tech, realistic (or semi-realistic, let&#39;s not take ourselves too seriously here...) region. We, admittedly, drew some minor inspiration from [region]Tiandi[/region], although, for starters, we acknowledge the wider NS world, for the most part; that is why the region is called the CONTINENTS of Casteber and Erterneyalj, there&#39;s an entire world out there.

We are currently looking for talented, interested players who&#39;d be willing to help with world building, lore, map creation and such.
