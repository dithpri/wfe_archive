[i]Work in progress[/i][hr][B]Eldreth[/B] is a modern-tech roleplay region that is centered around the collapse of the Eldrethi Empire. The stability it had created suddenly vanished, replaced by the presence jingoistic states and tentative kingdoms. The region is set at a time when competing successors claw over its former possessions, revolutionary sentiment bubbles beneath the surface, and a new regional order struggles to be formed from the remains of the late empire.
