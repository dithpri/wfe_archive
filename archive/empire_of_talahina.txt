[color=red]Hello![/color]

Welcome to [region]Talahina[/region]

A nation that strives for the good of its people!

[color=red][b]THE EMPIRE NEEDS YOU![/b][/color]

The empire needs more recruits to hold officer positions. Anyone is welcomed to our region and to hold public office!

If the empire is to be strong we must have many delegates who want a public office position. 
The Empire will hold elections for public officers.

Remember. Our region is young and rapidly growing. It can and will be powerful once we get things settled. 

Once again I, Tahalina,  
Thank you for choosing to join and serve our region.
