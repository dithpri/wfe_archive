[b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b]

[i]Taken on 25/08/12[/i]

Once the centre of a [url=http://www.nswiki.net/index.php?title=Project_Ragnarok]Nazi campaign[/url], instigated by the notorious Nazi &amp;quot;Shira Bell&amp;quot; ([region]The Aryan Army[/region]), to reclaim the lands stripped from them by [region]The MT Army[/region].

[color=red]Project Ragnarok was doomed to fail, much like countless others over the past 9 years, history will repeat, [region]The MT Army[/region] will always be the victor.[/color]

This region is now a living museum against hate. It was targeted due to its representation of a hateful ideology, we cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.

[nation]Vippertooth33[/nation]&amp;#39;s vision is to see the Nazi/fascists gone from NationStates forever.
