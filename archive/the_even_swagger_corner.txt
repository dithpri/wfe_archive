Gentlemen, this is a time of great struggle. Men like Cedar banks have attempted to keep us down for to long. We must end his reign of terror. We take no more crap from nations that don&amp;#39;t respect our fine sense of humor. Let us rock and roll all night and party everyday. Cedar is a PHONY and is also pretty bunk. 
Tomorrow we go to war! So tonight we party!
