Crovathan is a large region with all manner of environments, both mild and extreme. The north is home to the&nbsp;Wolfsnow Federation&nbsp;and the growing nation ofPheoix. The south holds both the&nbsp;Empire of Wolf Initiative&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Sultanate of Ekoridge. Recently, a reptilian alien race dubbed&nbsp;&#145;the Crod&#146;&nbsp;have invaded or destroyed many of the eastern nations, ultimately making their home in the swamps formerly owned by Blackwater. The region is strong but divided and it&amp;#39;s long history is rich with breath-taking moments, high-jinks and conflict fueled by nationalism.&nbsp;
Welcome to Crovathan, enjoy your stay.
