Crovathan is a large region with mountains, tundras, plains, swamps, jungles and cave systems. The north is home to; the Wolfsnow Federation, who forges the finest equipment, the growing nation of Pheoix, and Garcortiero is separated from Blackwater by a nuclear wasteland. The south holds; Wolf Initiative, with military prejudice unsurpassed, the Sultanate of Ekoridge, thriving off culture/tourism, and the tribal camps of Noenoe. In the center stands the cult nation, H.V.E. The region is strong but divided and it&amp;#39;s long history is rich with breath-taking moments, high-jinks and conflict fueled by nationalism.
Welcome to Crovathan, enjoy your stay.
