History is written by the victor.

History is filled with liars.

All you need to change the world is one good lie and a river of blood.

They say truth is the first casualty of war. But who defines what&#39;s true?

Truth is just a matter of perspective.

The world we live in is a giant tinderbox. All it takes, is someone to light the match.
