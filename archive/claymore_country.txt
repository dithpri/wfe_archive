Claymore Country is a small region formed from the alliance of two clans who occupied the land, &#39;Claymore Country&#39; is the nickname given to the land that these clans live. Recently a new nation joined &#39;Claymore Country&#39; and has taken up the role of international delegate of the region, as the two clans were never seen by the international community, the new nation saw an opportunity to help them become a more recognised region and to get them more involved in international politics.
