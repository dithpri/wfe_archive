[b]Welcome to the National Revolutionary Army Headquarters![/b]

The National Revolutionary Army is a new organization dedicated to defending regions that have been invaded maliciously. We do [b]not[/b] seek to invade other regions just for the heck of it. If you are interested in joining, please telegram [nation=short]The National Revolutionary Army Founder[/nation] for the password. You will be added to the army roster and be expected to update your flag (see the dispatches below).

Don&#39;t know how to defend or are new to NationStates? Don&#39;t worry, everything&#39;s easier than it seems. We&#39;ll personally teach you all of the defending basics.

Upon entering (and if you are in the World Assembly), immediately endorse [nation]Arbitrary Humans[/nation] or face banjection.
