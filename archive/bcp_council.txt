[b][color=purple]Welcome to BCP Council[/color][/b]
[b]Founded: December 2019[/b]

[b]Who are we?[/b]
BCP Council is a community-based meta-region focusing on creating a union between regions on nationstates. BCP Council does not directly own regions, which is a benefit because no representatives will be sent to your regions if your region were to become a member. BCP Council is governed by Galskia.

Well, currently a regional website is under construction. Soon a forum will be made there.
