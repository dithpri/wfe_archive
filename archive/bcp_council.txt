[b][color=purple]Welcome to BCP Council[/color][/b]
[b]Founded: December 2019[/b]

[b]Who are we?[/b]
BCP Council is a community-based meta-region focusing on creating a union between regions on nationstates. BCP Council does not directly own regions, which is a benefit because no representatives will be sent to your regions if your region were to become a member. BCP Council is governed by Galskia.

[b]What do we do?[/b]
We focus on recruiting minor and newer regions to our union through diplomacy. We can also focus on larger regions, however it&#39;s important to bring together smaller regions and to put down the biased actions of bias regions like feeders etc. etc.

[b]Where do I learn more?[/b]
Well, currently a regional website is under construction. Soon a forum will be made there.
