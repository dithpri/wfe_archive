A civilized realm in the third dimension.
What we have to offer:
A peaceful place to begin, and chat.
Just note that any offensive comments, or bullying will result in an eject as soon as someone alerts Conmanada.
Basic protection from invasions and such.
If you wish for anyone to join, alert Conmanada, and I may or may not give you the password to allow them to join. If you spread this password, I will eject you.
Everyone, I would like for everyone to join the WA (World Assembly) so endorsements can happen. And voting for the Region Delegate can happen
