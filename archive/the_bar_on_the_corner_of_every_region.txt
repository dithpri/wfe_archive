[b]Welcome to the Bar on the corner![/b]

The Bar on the corner of every region is the Bar on the corner of every region. It is a place for all kind of folks to hang out, to chat, flirt, drink, hit on girls, get rejected, get drunken, try again,  get again rejected,  get seriously drunken, try again,  completely fail,  fall, start a brawl,  get beaten up, kicked out, get an order to stay away from the house,  just to come again after a terrible next day for a beer or two. 

You can also just enjoy a glass of wine and go to bed early. Secretly we anyway want to gain the world supremacy.
