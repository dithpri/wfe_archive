[b]Welcome to the Bar on the corner![/b]

[i][b][color=red]bartenders wanted[/color][/b]! from here or via embassies[/i] 

The Bar on the corner of every region is the Bar IN YOUR region. Amazingly convenient to reach (via embassy).

 It is a place for all kind of folks to hang out, to chat, flirt, drink, hit on girls, get rejected, get drunken, try again,  get again rejected,  get seriously drunken, try again,  completely fail,  fall, start a brawl,  get beaten up, kicked out, get an order to stay away from the house,  just to come again after a terrible next day for a beer or two. 

Alternatively, you can also just enjoy a glass of wine and go to bed early.
