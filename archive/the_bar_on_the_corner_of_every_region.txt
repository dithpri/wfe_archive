[b]Congrats to [nation=short]The Irish Bartender[/nation] for Employee of the Month![/b]

[b][u]Welcome to the interdimensional Bar on the Corner IN YOUR Region[/u][/b].

Don&#39;t read [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=621274]What this bar is actually about[/url] and the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=621263]rules[/url] because this [b]interregional hub[/b] is for all kind of folks to hang out, chat, flirt, drink, hit on your crush, get rejected, get drunken, try again, get again rejected, get seriously drunken, go again, fail, fall, start a brawl, get beaten up, kicked out, get ordered to stay away, just to come again after a terrible next day for a beer or two. 

Or you could just enjoy a glass of wine and go to bed early.
