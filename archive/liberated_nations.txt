These rights are the rights in my opinion, that we are born with and earn when we hit that &amp;quot;Create A Nation&amp;quot; button.

1. Freedom of Speech
2. Freedom of Human Life
3. Freedom of Property

Freedom of speech grants unedited, uncensored freedom of what you say, believe, or type, without fear of being reprimanded by people who supposedly have more power than you. Freedom of human life grants the individual the right to choose for their bodies whatever they so choose and no human may interfere with this right. With freedom of property, a person may do with what they own as they want without being taxed for it.
