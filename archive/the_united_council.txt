Welcome to the United Council!
We are a diplomatic region which, you guessed it, means we don&#39;t solve problems with raiding!
Your region was raided? Looking for a new home after the evil eagles in the Black Hawks kicked you out? Then come to your new home and make it great!
To become a regional officer, show activity and loyalty in the region for a consecutive minimum of 2 weeks. You may not be inactive for more than three weeks as a regional officer without stating why beforehand.
