The Endymion region is a group of three large islands situated in the Atlantic ocean. Originally the Kingdom of Badgopotamia had held sole sovereignty of this area, but after a recent coup it now welcomes new nations.

For now, the Endymion Coalition has no interest in foreign interventions, and intends to stay a diverse and stable region, however, depending on the decision of future Lord Protectors this may change.
