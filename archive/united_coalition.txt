[b]Welcome to the United Coalition![/b] 


Here, you may live freely however you wish. But with such, there are responsibilities you need to consider:

1. Respect each other and all nations within the region, if you wish to be respected.
2. Do not cause harm that may affect anyone.
3. Follow the general rules of NationStates for obvious reasons.
4. Obey the officers. They make rules and regulations to maintain peace and order.
5. Have fun with each other!


[i]Note: If you want to become a regional officer, please send a telegram to any of the current officers.[/i]

[i]To all WA member nations: Please endorse our current WA Delegate, [nation]Artoija[/nation]. [/i]
