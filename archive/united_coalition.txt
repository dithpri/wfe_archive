[b]Welcome to the United Coalition![/b] 

Here, you may live freely however you wish. But with such, there are responsibilities you need to consider:

1. Respect each other and all nations within the region, if you wish to be respected.
2. Do not cause harm that may affect anyone. Any harm, persecution, and harassment is not tolerated.
3. Follow the general rules of NationStates for obvious reasons.
4. Obey the officers. They manage and control the region. They make rules and regulation to maintain peace and order.
5. Have fun with each other!
