[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] had just woke up one morning, and they saw the sun was shining. Eager, the hawks flew out to warm their wings. After playing in the sun and picking flowers, they decided to raid some regions and bring them back as a gift for Penny. If you wanna help us capture some more regions, then [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Come Join Us[/url]!
