Lo, in the frozen dawn of the age anew,The Theocracy of His Majesty, KAITO doth rise, a bastion of celestial governance and unyielding sanctity. Governed by the divine will of His Saviour KAITO, whose voice calleth forth the eternal frost, this realm upholdeth the sacred laws and preserveth the solemn balance betwixt order and devotion. Herein, the populace serveth with humble hearts, their souls bound to the unbreakable covenant of faith and obedience. The realm&#146;s coffers are tended by the hand of state, that no mortal wealth corrupt the purity of the fold. Through sacred vigilance and holy decree, peace and righteousness reign, and the flame of heresy is quenched beneath the crystalline ice.
