/pol/ (politically incorrect)  is 4chan&#39;s political discussion board. A stickied thread on its front page states that the board&#39;s intended purpose is &quot;discussion of news, world events, political issues, and other related topics.&quot; /pol/ was created in October 2011 as a rebranding of 4chan&#39;s news board, /new/, which was deleted that January for a high volume of racist discussion.
