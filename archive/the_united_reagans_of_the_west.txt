The URW is as confederation of free states. We promote political Freedom, Civil rights, and Reaganomics. Our founders were very impressed with the economic growth, influence in foreign affairs, and national pride that Ronald Reagan brought to The United States. Although our founders lean more towards capitalism, we accept nations of all kinds as long as they treat their citizens fairly. We support legal immigration but prioritize the safety of current citizens. We believe in basic human rights and will not stand for racism of any kind. Please join us we aim to increase and defend democracy and make the world a better place.
