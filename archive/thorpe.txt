This is a non-serious region where nations can have a casual and relaxed time playing the game. If you do join, you are promised a custom position that either you request or I give you. If you would like to leave after a deal of time then go ahead and if you do, then you will be able to keep your position here in Thorpe and will be welcomed back anytime. As long as you aren&#39;t a jerk feel free to stay.

We worship Danny Devito as our lordly father, Neil as his son, and Piggy as the holy spirit.
