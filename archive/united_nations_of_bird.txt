[b]Quote of the Week:[/b] [color=#00bfff]&#147;The chief beauty about time is that you cannot waste it in advance.  The next year, the next day, the next hour are lying ready for you, as perfect, as unspoiled, as if you had never wasted or misapplied a single moment in all your life.  You can turn over a new leaf every hour if you choose.&#148;[/color] [i]~ Arnold Bennett[/i]
