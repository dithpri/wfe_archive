Greetings and welcome to The Grand Commonwealth of Free Systems! As the leader of this interplanetary Commonwealth, it brings me great joy to extend my warmest welcome to all the member planets and their inhabitants. We are a community of free systems, united by a common purpose to explore, thrive and prosper together. I invite you to explore our vast expanse of space, discover new frontiers, and share your experiences with the rest of the Commonwealth. Let us work together towards a brighter future, and make our Commonwealth a shining example of peace, progress, and prosperity. Thank you for being a part of this great journey.
