[b]Hello and welcome to the isolationist region that is not eager to help others. We are never here to help you, even in your darkest hour, for God knows that this realm is no longer of his image. We are the bastion of NationStates. Feel free to explore the path of God, receive the fruits of your prayers, and much more. However, know that your path will be taken alone.

Welcome to Baymonia.[/b]

[i]&quot;I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines. I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lord.&quot;

- Ezekiel 35:8-9[/i]
