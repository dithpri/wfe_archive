The Greater Alliance is a region based on Extreme right-wing beliefs such as fascism and nationalism. This doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean we&amp;#39;re violent or racist. Here we can exclude all negative opinions held against our ideology. Unlike other extremist regions that lose their temper at the slightest insult, The Greater Alliance Is not aggressive to other regions it disagrees with. Our region also has embassies and regional government that give you the true experience of fascist politics.
