The Greater Alliance is a region that is inspired by fascism. It has embassies and regional government that express our true beliefs. Unlike other fascists who enforce their policy on other regions, The Greater Alliance prevents conflict by illustrating and resolving the negative opinion held against fascism. Right-wing nationalists who fought in battle or in politics to unite their nation are also the kind of people we admire. Our goal is to inspire the rest of the world by showing what fascism can do for them.
