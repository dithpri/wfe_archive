The Greater Alliance is a region that is inspired by fascism. It has embassies and regional government that express the true beliefs of our ideology. Unlike other fascist regions who force others to follow their ideology , The Greater Alliance prevents conflict by containing all negative opinion held against fascism. Right-wing nationalists who fought in battle or in politics to unite their nation are also the kind of people we admire. The purpose of The Greater Alliance is to inspire others on what fascism can do for them.
