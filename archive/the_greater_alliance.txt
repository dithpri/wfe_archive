Welcome to &amp;quot;The Greater Alliance.&amp;quot;

Right now we&amp;#39;re just getting things organized. If you like being in a newly developed region, then this is the place to start. Here we can socialize, make friends, and make policy. The Great Alliance gives you the chance to find the people you&amp;#39;re looking for without moving from region to region. After we know each other a lot better, there will be some disagreements. This your chance to construct the region of your dreams.
