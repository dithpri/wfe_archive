1. Alternate Nations may not vote or hold office, as long as their primaries are in the region also.

2. Although voting is not mandatory, it is reccomended. We have plenty of votes and elections, and
participation in the democratic process is the best way to be an active member.

3. Votes and elections only last two weeks, so all nations within our region will receive a telegram when a vote or election begins. The vote or election can be found at the bottom of the region&#39;s page.
