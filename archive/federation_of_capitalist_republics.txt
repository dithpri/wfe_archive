Welcome to the Federation of Capitalist Republics. We hold that while a socialist republic is a &amp;quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&amp;quot;, a capitalist republic embraces the freedom, of the common man, to succeed on his own. 

The Federation exists to give those people who are libertarian, conservative, moderate, anti-socialist or opposed to excessive government spending and regulation; the opportunity to create their own future.
