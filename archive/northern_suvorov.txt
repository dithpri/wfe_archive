Northern Suvorov encompasses the scattered nations that lie beyond the Great Suvorov Mountains. In ages past Suvorov was the site of a once great empire founded by the legendary Triumvirate of Abraham, Martel and Theodore. Following the collapse of the Empire of Suvorov, the people splintered into many tribal groups. Only in recent years has the region begun consolidating through the influence of the industrial nation of Dorn.
