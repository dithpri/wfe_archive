We are a defending region who will do stuff and other things, but we actually will do our best to be nice, help people, and we have a respect for raiders. If you talk crap about raiders on our forums and/or chat, you will receive one warning, next time you will be kicked, then the next time you will be banned. (Mainly because I have a friend who is a raider and I respect that.)
