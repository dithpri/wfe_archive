Welcome to Chimeras!

Region Guidelines:
1. Any trolls who are let in to Chimeras will be kicked. No exceptions. We take Nationstates seriously. This does not mean you can&amp;#39;t joke around, we just don&amp;#39;t want people who half-heartedly play mixing into any affairs.

2. Correct grammar is a must when telegramming or conversing with our nations. We need a mature crowd of allies who understand basic grammatical rules.

3. Be supportive of our newer nations. Show the newer members of NS the tricks of the trade. Lend a hand if a resident of Chimeras gets into a war. Aid in the expansion and growth of your fellow nations.

4. RP is advised when speaking about official matters. You are free to speak as you will in otherwise personal conversations.
