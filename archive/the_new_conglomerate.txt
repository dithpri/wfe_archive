The New Conglomerate is a region devoted to defending capitalism, conservatism, and right-wing ideals across NationStates. This region in particular is interested in promoting and protecting the ideals of capitalism and lassiez-faire policies. Anarcho-capitalists and fascists are welcome. Any socialists or communists will be banned. Please join the WA and endorse the WA delegate to prevent an invasion, though you do not have to do this. Thank you and enjoy what we have to offer. Long live Konstantinovka!
