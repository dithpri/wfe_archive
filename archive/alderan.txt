Our region was founded with the same principle as a mug of beer.  Full is good, but empty is better (presuming it&#39;s empty because you just drank it, otherwise it&#39;s not as good as full).  Our motto you ask?  &quot;B!tch, don&#39;t harsh my buzz with that sh!t.  Seriously.&quot;  A slogan we not only live by, but often speak it when someone is being a downer.  And as always, free imaginary hats to the first 5 nations to join.
