[u][b]The Unteilbar Protectorate[/b][/u]
We are a pan-Germanic region, whose core ideology is to achieve a harmony between 
historic Germanic identity and a variety of manifestations of modern Monarchies.
All monarchist nations welcome - particularly those with German roots. We are a 
millitaristic yet peacefull region intent on keeping peace via war or diplomatic discussions.
