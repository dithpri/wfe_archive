[b]Z-Day5
Attention[/b]: As of 6:20pm UTC+08 this Z-Day5, we&#39;re officially infection free. There was no casualties. Everyone is urged to stay indoors. Stay tuned to all announcements from your local authorities and news for further information.

[b]Other announcements[/b]: Our region&#39;s population is not big enough to make it to the Z-Day5 Tally Board for &#39;Most Survivors + No Infected&#39;.
I would like to commend [nation]Penelope and Phoebe[/nation] for helping 2 regions deal with the undead. Wow, how could you possibly do that for 4 hours and go back without a single zombie in your nation? Terrific!
