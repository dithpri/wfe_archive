[b]Hi there, welcome to the Lands of Milk and Honey!
The Lands Of Cheese and Molasses can be found here, and the ruins of the Lands of Yogurt and Syrup. It just didnt work out..[/b]

[i]A beautiful island archipelago surrounded by pristine aquamarine waters. Incidentally home to some excellent organic dairy products, and a bustling sugarcane industry. Come and stay awhile! We&#39;d love for you to enjoy the lands of cheese and molasses. Though we have lactaid, we have very few vegan options, and earnestly apologize for the inconvenience to any vegans. We see you, we respect you, but we are a cheesy region through and through, but our cows really live excellent lives. Is this mic still on?[/i]
