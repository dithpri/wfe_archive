The Pilgrim&#146;s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come

For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed&#151;a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: &#147;The righteous will live by faith.&#148;
Romans 1:17 NIV

But cowardly, unfaithful, and detestable people, murderers, sexual sinners, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars will find themselves in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.&#148; Revelation 21:8 GW

Jesus is Lord &amp; God. It&#146;s the truth, whether or not people acknowledge the fact. He is more than the Messiah, more than the Savior; He is the Lord of all. Someday, all will submit to that truth.
