This is a roleplay region. We desire to integrate NS stats and general ns nation into a roleplay. 
Basis of your nation roleplay will be our ns stats and your ns state. However, it can be changed by event. Essentially it doesnt need to be 100% strict, for example i dont want my contamination zone to have 8 million pop and growing, cause its litterally a jail. So instead i say it has rp population of 1,500,000. So one should make a factbook explaining all this stuff. However one cannot try to claim population greater than his original ns population. Only way to hasten the growth is threw event.

How to RP:

1. Make a Factbook designed for this RP

2. In that factbook use following [url=https://www.nationstates.net/nation=othrodox_empire/detail=factbook/id=1272094]template[/url]
