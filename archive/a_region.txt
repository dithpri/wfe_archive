Anyway, we are a small region who is continually trying to get people to join us... so join us!

There are a lot of opportunities to actually be active here, as officer roles are granted for WA members, you can be added to the map, and much much more!

All embassies are accepted and we encourage you to post on our board. For regional security please endorse our WA delegate. You can join the WA [url=nationstates.net/page-un]here[/url]

This region might as well be an anarchy. Do whatever you want, whether that is chilling in the back or debating on the RMB! Have fun!

Based on a recent poll, we need a flag! Flag designers/creators are wanted!
Upcoming WA legislation:
