The Orange Sea is a pleasant and private corner of the world made up of mainly island nations. Though isolated from the rest of the world throughout most of its history most of the countries in the Orange Sea have become modernised, wealthy and often forward thinking places. The Orange Sea Council (OSC), established in 1950, has been the main body for political discussion, co-operation, trade, cultural exchanges and disputes to be discussed in the region. Recent OSC initiatives have included attempts at negotiating a political settlement in Creckon. Membership is voluntary.
