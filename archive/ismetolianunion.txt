The Ismetolian Union is located in the north, full of mountains, steppes, lakes and forests, providing a picturesque view for all to enjoy, diverse animals from cod to bear. Now, we use more sustainable and enviornmentally-friendly methods like wind and solar power, providing resources for both human and animal, while preserving the natural environment we so vitally need and live in peace with the animals and nature. Here in the IU, we value ideas of tolerance, equality and justice. From socialist to liberal to monarchist. As a region, we are very open to people, ready to welcome you all with open arms. You matter, and so does your nation. We want peace and protect from harms that come with conflict, violence and war.
