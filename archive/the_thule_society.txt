An initiatory esoteric order concerning Occidental affairs, championing elitist principles and seeking to usher in a new Western Renaissance. The Thule-Gesellschaft principal mission is to spearhead research and facilitate constructive discourse of Western (with particular emphasis on Germanic Antiquity) esotericism, Hermetic principles, Pagan mysticism, the usage of PSYOP and applied psychology, occultism, and other related subject matter. We will also secondarily serve as an intelligence-gathering faction for the assistance of our Volkisch allies. 

Warning: Marxists, uppity detractors, and hipsters will be sacrificed to the Vrilya on sight.
