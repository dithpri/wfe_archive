A long time ago there was colonial Empire that controlled a huge number of colonies. One of these colonies was the Arbiter Archipelago, which was home to several indigenous peoples. Archipelago was a source of slaves for the Empire. However, the Empire fell. At the same time, wars for independence and many internecine wars mixed with civil wars began on the Arbiter Archipelago. In the end, the most powerful nations in the archipelago were able to unite and, at the cost of many lives, established peace on the Arbiter Archipelago. At the same time, the Organization of Coexistence of Independent Nations(OCIN) was founded. OCIN was created to guarantee the independence of each nation in the Archipelago and maintain peace.
