[color=green]Welcome to the Green Land, founded on November Nineteenth of Two Thousand Thirteen.

Make no mistake, this is not Greenland, as in ice, rock, &amp;amp; water too cold to swim in. This is Green Land, as in the place where you can relax with greenery and chat with green friends in a green environment. 

Looking for something to do? Well... so are we. Feel free to chat up the Message Board as you listen to the sounds of Green Day in a Green Room. As long as you use proper grammar, of course.

A Delegate no longer needs electing! Please feel free to endorse the first WA Delegate of Green Land, [nation]Those Cows[/nation]!

Attention! We like green. You should too.[/color]
