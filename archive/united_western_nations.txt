The United Western Conglomerates was founded by James Benjamin, the primary founding position of The Democratic Republic of Jamestria, followed by Bacobithan Gerard, the founding position of The United Capitalist Capitals. This was a call for independence from the mainstream western governmental body due to the lack of liberty or qualities desired by these two nations. In strive for their independence they had accidentally started a feud between themselves and the conglomerate, which was settled peacefully by The Treaty of the West (1967) that gave the two nations land claims in excess land following the birth of the mainstream western conglomerate.
