Do you like the world assembly? Do you like peace and justice? If you do go away and join the world assembly this is the anti-world assembly and we stand for the opposite. This is a cluster of oppressive nations that do not value the WA in any way (even though we have a delegate.) Join our unendorsement program where it is a race to endorse all WA nations then it is a race to see who can loose the most endorsements other features in the Anti World Assembly is debates on everything anyone wishes. Remember all the WA can do is slap a condemnation on this region so do not fear the livelihood of your nation.
