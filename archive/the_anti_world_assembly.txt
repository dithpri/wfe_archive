Do you like the world assembly? Do you like peace and justice? If you do go away and join the world assembly this is the anti-world assembly and we stand for the opposite. This is a cluster of oppressive nations that do not value the WA in any way (even though we have a delicate.) We offer weekly dispatches. If you do join be warned of our rival Kyle-ville and what they may have in stall for your nation upon joining but if you like conflict and having a truly awful nation please consider moving your nation to the Anti-world assembly.
