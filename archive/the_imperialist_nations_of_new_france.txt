Welcome to the Imperialist Nations of New France!

This quiet, small, and sleepy region of Colonial nations believes in the principles of Capitalism, free-trade, small government, big military, and anything but communism. 

We exist in all of the territories conquered by the great French Empire, and oppose British intervention. Or any foreign intervention for that matter.

Please endorse the government, post on the RMB, and participate freely in the World Assembly.

Please abide by the laws of the Constitution, and communicate any discrepancies on the RMB.
