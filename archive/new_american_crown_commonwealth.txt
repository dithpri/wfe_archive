The [b]New American Crown Commonwealth[/b] or [b]NACC[/b] is an intergovernmental organization of five member states that were mostly territories of the former Holy New Ayitian Empire. The Crown Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of member states, organized through the Crown Secretariat. The NACC dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonization of the Holy New Ayitian Empire through increased self-governance of its territories. It was formally constituted by the Alexandrian Declaration in 1949, which established member states as &quot;free and equal.&quot; The symbol of free association is King Alexander II who is the Head of the Crown Commonwealth. He is also ruler over two members of the Crown Commonwealth, also known as [i]Crown realms.[/i]
