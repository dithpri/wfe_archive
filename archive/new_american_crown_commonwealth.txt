The [b]New American Crown Commonwealth[/b], also known as the [b]Crown Commonwealth[/b] or [b]NACC[/b], is an intergovernmental organization of four member states that were mostly territories of the former Holy Empire of New Ayiti. The Crown Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states, organized through the NACC Secretariat and non-governmental organizations.

Member states of the NACC are independent sovereign states united under the New Ayitian Prime Minister who also serves as Head of the Crown Commonwealth. The Prime Minister is also the monarch of two members of the Crown Commonwealth, known as Commonwealth realms. Other members of the Crown Commonwealth have different persons as head of state.
