Government

Officially, Muzhevina operates as a &#147;Democratic Chaocracy&#148; (where democracy meets chaotic decision-making). Every citizen is required to vote on major decisions&#133; but only after participating in a karaoke contest to &#147;earn their say.&#148;

Presidents are elected based on their ability to juggle flaming pineapples and recite poetry at the same time.
