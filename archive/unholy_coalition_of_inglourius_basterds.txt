&amp;quot;You probably heard we ain&amp;#39;t in the prisoner-takin&amp;#39; business; we in the killin&amp;#39; Nazi business. And cousin, business is a-boomin&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;  -Lt. Aldo Raine 

We here at the Unholy Coalition of Inglourius Basterds really hate Nazis, from their lame armbands to their tiny mustaches. That includes grammar Nazis hence our complete disregard for spelling. So if you hate Nazis and love ninjas, pirates, samurais, knights, vikings, dragons, goats, robot-cowboys, lasers, battle axes, dinosaurs, narwhals, unicorn warriors, George Takei, or other similar glorious things the Unholy Coalition is right for you.
