[b]Welcome to The United Aliance of Wolcott![/b] 

Here nations may come for protection and true sovereignty. Many nations situated in this region are associated by geographical locations, but that does not limit outsiders. We welcome all so long as they are tolerant of others. However, as previously stated, sovereignty is a priority of this region. We encourage all nations to participate in the World Assembly and be aware of ongoing events, however they are not required to. What your nation does is up to you and you alone. Embassies may be opened if the regional delegate and the people approve.
