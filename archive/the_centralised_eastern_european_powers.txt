Welcome to the most glorious Centralised Eastern European Powers!

This is a primarily anti-capitalist region, and as such, capitalist nations, fascist nations, etc. are not welcome within.
Communist and Socialist states are welcome, and we still recognise diplomatic relations with non-communist/non-socialist regions/nations.
