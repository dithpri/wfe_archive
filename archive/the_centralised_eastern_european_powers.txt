Welcome to the most glorious Centralised Eastern European Powers!

This is a primarily anti-capitalist region, and as such, capitalist nations, fascist nations, etc. are not welcome within.
Communist, Socialist, Anarchist states, etc. are welcome, and we will still formally recognise diplomatic relations with nations and regions that do not conform to the beliefs that allow entry into the region.
