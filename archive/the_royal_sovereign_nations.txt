The WA Delegate position is unfortunately closed, but the WA Delegate will hold polls on every vote to see what they will vote for. Council Member positions are always up for the taking though, with one member put up for re election every month. The re-election process works in two polls: A Yes/No to re-electing and if the public says NO, A poll to see who will replace them.
