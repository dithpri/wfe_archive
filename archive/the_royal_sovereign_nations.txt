The WA Delegate position is always open for the taking, with the nation who gains the most support (endorsements) becoming the lawfully elected WA Delegate. World Assembly nations may lobby other WA nations (privately send telegrams) for as many WA endorsements as they like. They may also publicly advertise for WA endorsements on the Regional Message Board.
