It is divided into two main parts: the mainland of the same name, and the island of Vvardenfell, which are separated by the Inner Sea. Solstheim is also considered to be part of the province as of 4E 16, before which it was a part of Skyrim.

Morrowind was formerly the homeland of the Dwemer and Chimer, and now of the Dunmer, also known as Dark Elves. Morrowind is ruled by the Tribunal, who are in charge of law, politics, and the flow of magicka throughout the region.
