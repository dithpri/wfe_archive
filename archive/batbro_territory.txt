The Dictatorship of Seychelles has one ruler and encourages others to do the same. Our political policy has remained the same for around 150 years and has remained steady for the duration of this time frame. We were once a great nation, region, and ally. We are constantly rebuilding this nation and region. Let our leader know if you have any questions. He is an open minded and listening leader. That is why we hope he is never so &quot;down-for-the-count.&quot;
