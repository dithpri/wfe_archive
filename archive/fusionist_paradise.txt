Fusionism is a combo of libertarian and conservative ideology. The creator, is fair and even minded, but while I support very far reaching ideas on freedom of speech, I want the board to be classy, so please, not so much swearing, typing in all caps. I want this to be for people who support constitutionally limited republican government (or similar ideas), Laissez-faire free trade capitalism, standing against the tyranny of supernational bodies, and are against giant welfare states that cripple economies. Also tends to be politically incorrect, since political correctness is horrible and stifle freedom of speech and expression, and leads to reverse racism and such.
