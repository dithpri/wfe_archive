Ichovor was officially settled and claimed by the religious zealots in 1908 by several monastic brothers led by Abbot Raithon Ballamore. The abbey that was constructed and used by the first generations of religious settlers no longer exists but was believed to be located at the heart of the modern nation of [nation]Metarius[/nation].

Having established a successful nation, the monarch of [nation]Metarius[/nation] sought allies in the surrounding lands.The regional government was established, and the Confederation was born shortly after. Every nation is sovereign, and the regional government exists mainly as a loose coalition that safeguards the lands of Ichovor.

Any nations joining the Confederation shall endorse [nation]Tannenzapfle[/nation] as our WA delegate.
