Ichovor was officially settled and claimed by the Imperium in 282.M38 by several Ecclesiarchy Brothers led by Abbot Raithon Ballamore. The abbey that was constructed and used by the first generations of religious settlers no longer exists but was believed to be located near the modern nation of Metarius.
