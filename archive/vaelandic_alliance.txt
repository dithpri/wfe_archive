The Vaelandic alliance is a military alliance of like-minded nations headed by the Empire of Great Vaeland, and Empress Freyja El&aelig;na &Oslash;riana in particular. Any nations are welcomed here, as long as they are not wholly evil or malevolent in their dealings with other or their citizens. We stand for unity, compassion and advancement in all things, and only as an alliance can these goals be realised.
