Dedicated to technological, intellectual, and civil advancement, The UNH is a non-geographical region that seeks their nations to uphold these values. All who do so are welcome. Founded in the first year of the Orisounian Calendar, the underlying principals of the collective are outlined in the Orisounian motto: &quot;To each their own for one another,&quot; which basically means that each person or nation should be able to govern themselves according to their own principles, and therefore in an assembly of the UNH, have ideas to bear for the co consideration of the other nations. It is almost a think-tank of national diplomacy, and the progression of creating a better group of nations with these individual ideas is top priority.
