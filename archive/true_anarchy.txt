[i]You hear a loud scream echo through the woods...[/i]

[i][b]This is anarchy![/b][/i] 

Not that whoever is screaming that is lying though, this is [region]True Anarchy[/region]!

There is no rules, so you can do anything you want! Which includes excessively screaming &quot;This is anarchy!&quot; if you&#39;re into that.

You can raid this region, or defend, I don&#39;t really care! [b]No bans or ejections! They suck![/b] 

RMB is [b]always[/b] open for chatting

All sexual orientations, all races, are allowed! We welcome people of all different political ideologies and religion!

While [region]True Anarchy[/region] may not have any rules, the NationStates admins may punish you for breaking the site rules. We can&#39;t do much about that, sorry.

Enjoy your time here, and please send embassy requests!
