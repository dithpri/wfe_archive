Hellespont is a region based on despotism and the divine guidance of the holy empire. While I don&amp;#39;t care what holiness that empire entails, we fully agree that we are guided by greater powers better than those of others that are yet to be denied. If you&amp;#39;re looking to join a feel-good, cooperative region, this is not it. If you&amp;#39;re looking for dominance or violent resistance in the face of overwhelming opposition, this is definitely the region for you.
