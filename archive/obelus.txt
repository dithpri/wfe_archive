[b]Obelus - The Region of Gods, Leaders, and Ice[/b]

Obelus is a region set in the colder parts of the NSWorld, and is also a haven for leaders leaning on the more genocidal, insane, and dictatorial side of things - we&#39;ve got a defence pact to facilitate that outsiders don&#39;t interfere. Obelus is home to a few &#39;normal&#39; democracies trying to live a life in the cold, but it&#39;s primarily oppression up here.
