This region was founded on 7 August 2017 by a group of good friends: [nation]Arthropol[/nation], [nation]Fyodorians[/nation] (now [nation]La Repubblica Cisalpina[/nation]), [nation]Arab North Africa[/nation], [nation]Turkic Republic[/nation] and [nation]Unified Korean Lands[/nation]. Since then, we have welcomed new members. Originally based on a realistic alternate scenario Earth, this region, since January of 2019, is now largely inactive both on the board and the forum, as our operations have mostly switched to real life and on our [url=https://discord.gg/SVUeXyd]Discord[/url]. To view some of our unused puppet nations, see [region]Puppet Storage Region[/region]. [B]This region is not canon IC, meaning that it is not an entity IC like the United Nations or the European Union. This region is only OOC, so that the members can be grouped together and have a RMB for communication[/B]
