The [New] Empire of Ezaekia is the 3rd largest empire located in Central America. It consists of three massive islands: the island of Ezaekia (which is the main land), the island of Ivuna (which is known for it&#39;s tourist attraction-like culture, lands, and music) and the island of Ravukhagoa (this island more likely serves as the empire&#39;s defensive borders as it is highly guarded). The empire&#39;s flag consists of three colors: turquoise (defense/defender &amp; war/warrior(s)), white (peace) and blue (honor &amp; loyalty) and the empire&#39;s coat of arms is white, blue and silver.
