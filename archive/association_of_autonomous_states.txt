The [colour=royalblue][b]Association of Autonomous States (AAS)[/b][/colour] is a sub-region of the [region]Association of Liberal Democratic States[/region] that is home to the various autonomous units of its members. We also welcome any other disputed territories that are dedicated to the rule of law, democracy, egalitarianism and respect for each other&#39;s state sovereignty and affairs. Like our sister organisation, we promote mutual co-operation between member states in all areas of interest, particularly in cultural exchange, economic diplomacy &amp; development and peacekeeping. 

We Declare our Neutrality and will accept most embassy request, as long as they adhere to our own democratic and egalitarian values.
