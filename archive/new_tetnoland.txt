Tetnoland is an ancient territory, somewhat similar to Atlantis, and destroyed at the same time. Previously, Tetnoland was not only a huge territory, but also a huge city that made up 100% of the entire territory. Today, scientists from Kirillan and Khaikrovas, direct descendants of the ancient Tetnoland, have raised it from the water and restored it from the ashes and are looking for new countries that will want to become part of the New Tetnoland!
