Glacies was once a great nation contained by  it&amp;#39;s own biosphere in subglacial Antartica. As the leaders of Glacies realized how untenable their position in the slowly, yet ever advancing ice, they chose to begin the GCEF, a fleet designed to carry Glaciens and their descendants into the far reaches of the galaxy. Due to a worldwide economic catastrophe, the GCEF was unable to continue construction on it&amp;#39;s two ships: The Glacien Dawn, and The Oracle. Following the loss of both nation and exploratory space fleet, Glaciens spread to other nations around the globe, where they continued Glacies&amp;#39; scientific and cultural heritage in an enlightened society.
