Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! The [color=red]Europeian[/color] [color=blue]Republican[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color] ([color=red]E[/color][color=blue]R[/color][color=green]N[/color]) was playing a question game when we came across the question: What is a Glacie? Sadly, none of us knew, with the closest answer being, &amp;quot;Did you mean a glac- (the last part could not be transmitted due to a poor WiFi signal).&amp;quot; So, we thought it would be a great idea if we could get your help in solving this question which we could not wrap our heads around.
