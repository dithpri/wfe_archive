[b]Welcome to The Colonial Lands, one of NationStates&amp;#39; premier puppet storage regions. I have decided to set out on my own as a puppetmaster again after a successful project in [region]True North[/region]. 

No, you may not join. Sorry, but that&amp;#39;s the definition of a puppet region. If you have questions, concerns, or comments, please telegram the regional founder nation [nation=short]The Colony Master[/nation]. Telegrams to other nations in this region probably will not be answered for at least thirty days.

Thanks for visiting.[/b]
