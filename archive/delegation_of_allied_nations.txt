The [b][u][region]Delegation of Allied Nations[/region][/u][/b] is a region of peace, to be shared [u]equally[/u], by all embassy nations; as a private region to resolve their differences, debate their issues and provide for a common defense.

There shall forever be one standing rule: [color=red][b]All nations shall be treated with dignity and respect![/b][/color]

Our Banner is a field of light blue to represent a symbol of peace between all embassy regions, upon which individual regions cross the divide to become a single united power.
