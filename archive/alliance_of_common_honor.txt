[b]The Alliance of Common Honor[/b] allows conforming nations to enjoy the benefits of common interests, equality and a governance method that makes sense. We only ask that those who join be civil and just to their citizens, else be ejected. This is a free region.

The ACH was founded initially by [nation]The Omega Cluster[/nation], formerly residing in the [region]South Pacific[/region]. It&amp;#39;s culture is welcome to anybody who wishes to embrace it, though with the ACH, The Omega Cluster wishes to promote a free set of ideals to those who wish to inhabit the same region.

May knowledge guide you along your path.
