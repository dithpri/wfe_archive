Greetings Friends, 

NA is a place to fellowship in the Bible, (Kings James Bible.) As North America once did before the new versions. 
It is a place to run our nations and strive to live by the word of God.
We believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God died on the cross for our sins, was buried and rose again on the third day. 

All Nations are welcome to stop in and join but we mostly for fellowship.

This region is still undecided about being apart of the WA.
