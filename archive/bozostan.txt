[b][color=#B0171F] Tonight, [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=valle_de_arena]The Sekhmet Legion[/url] went out to inspect the dune sea of Maat. Unfortunately, they ended up getting lost, and stumbled into your region! Finding much relief in this Oasis, the noble legionnaires set up camp here, hoping to find their way in the morning.
