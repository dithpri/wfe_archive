The Hexlands, or Hexland, are historically associated with both bloody wars and great scenic beauty. Comprising of a large continent, along with their associated islands, they cover 7% of the world&amp;#39;s total surface area. The topography is dominated by the Hexlandish Cordillera, a long chain of mountains that run the length of the west coast. The flatter eastern side of the Hexlands is dominated by large river basins, such as the Styx, Horelish, and Bougeto. The climate and ecology varies strongly across the Hexlands, from arctic tundra to the tropical rain forests. Many species inhabit the Hexlands, such as the bears, giant cobras, mammoths, thunderbirds and albino tigers.
