[b][colour=#977400][i]Welcome to Salamandia![/i][/colour][/b]

Our region comes from an online community that formed back in 2020. We focus on [b][colour=#977400]offsite &amp; onsite roleplay[/colour][/b] (via our Discord, [url=https://discord.gg/GENuMXj384]click here[/url] to join!) along with participating in events such as [b][colour=#977400]N-Day and Z-Day[/colour][/b]. Members looking for a casual community are encouraged to join! Read our guidelines before participating. If you have any questions, please telegram an officer or ping a member of staff in our Discord. 

WA members are encouraged to endorse our current WA Delegate, [nation]Archasia[/nation]. Please note that to join our regional government (the United Nations of Salamandia), you must be a WA member endorsing the current delegate.
