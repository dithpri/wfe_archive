Welcome to The Imperial Federacy. We&#39;re a small and a new region that is open for anyone and everyone to join. Our region serves to defend four fundamental values: Democracy; the Rule of Law; Individual Liberty and Mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. We&#39;re a constitutional monarchy with a semi-parliamentary system of government.[hr][b]Founded:[/b] 17 December 2016 | [b]Forum:[/b] [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Imperial_Federacy/index/]Here[/url][hr][b][color=brown]Monarch: [/color][/b] [nation]Rumna[/nation]
