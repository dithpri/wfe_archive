take 3 because I didn&#39;t save the 1st 2:
[spoiler=About the Region!]It&#39;s a place for ND people to hang out, meet other ND people, vent about whatever, and- oh NOT AGAIN- well anyway. Or if you&#39;re NT, you can meet ND people and learn how that works so you don&#39;t have to believe stereotypes or make assumptions. Either is welcome and accepted.[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Are there rules?]Yup. Just a few. The main ones are:
1) Don&#39;t tell anybody they aren&#39;t welcome (there are exceptions to this, keep on reading)
2) If you are ableist, racist, fascist, or anti-LGBTQ+, you aren&#39;t welcome here and never will be.
3) Do things in whatever way works best for you. Don&#39;t EVER let anybody tell you otherwise
4) Please don&#39;t post the same thing 3+ times in a row
5) dispatch has more, this was too long
