[u][b]Welcome to The Republic of Northern Nations[/b][/u] 

A region that I hope becomes a social, fun place for nations to debate, roleplay, chill out and most of all have a good time. So why not join this new region and help us with its development and shaping regional policy or simply telling us how the weather is where you are. Should you have any questions please do ask away. But Remember that the most important thing to remember is to [u]Have fun![/u]

[u]No harassment of any kind will be tolerated [/u]

[i]All suggestions are welcome!
Hope you settle in here and make this your home region[/i]

This region can also be used as an alternant RMB hub for numerous regions
