[u][b]Welcome to The Republic of Northern [strike]Powers[/strike] Nations[/b][/u]  [sub] Boogaloo addition...[/sub]

[b]A region that I hope becomes a social, fun place for nations to debate, roleplay, chill out and most of all have a good time. So why not join this new region and help us with its development from helping build political parties in the Imperial Senate, shaping regional policy, or simply telling us how the weather is where you are. Should you have any questions please do ask away. But remember that the most important thing to remember is to [u]Have fun![/u][/b]
