The region of [b]Perlliam[/b] has a [i]somewhat[/i] tropical climate and is home to a few nations. There are some rival dictatorships and market competition, however, peace is a key feature in this region. The Federation of [nation]Phraunuz[/nation] was the pioneer on this region, but today it is governed by the conservative Republic of [nation]Kizaria[/nation], with a couple of Officers appointed and no WA Delegate, so far.

(This region is primaly a personal &quot;sandbox&quot; of mine, since all nations are controlled by me. But, [i]perhaps[/i] one day, in the [i]far future[/i], I might open it up for everyone.)
