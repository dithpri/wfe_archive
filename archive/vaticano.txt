Dominus vobiscum and welcome to [region]Vaticano[/region]!

We are a largely peaceful region, and are an entirely Papacy-themed region. Our government is quite decentralized, with all approved members having the ability to vote on issues. 

We are a community specifically focused on those who are loyal to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.

Our Patron Saint is St. Michael. Sancte Michael Archangele, Defende Nos In Proelio
