Hello there, we are the UM army. A prosperous, up-and-coming region dedicated to protecting the peace of nations, we are strong willed, loyal, and most importantly, fair. The UM Army strongly believes in democracy and a just government. While we may have had past complications with our kindred [region]UM Congregation[/region], we have put these problems behind us, to look towards a brighter future for both regions. So as they say, &amp;quot;c&amp;#39;mon in&amp;quot; and take a look around the UM Army.
