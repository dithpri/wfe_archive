In the beginning Majikku To Ken was a region created by its founder so he could have freedom but days later the black riders appeared and stuck him down all power lost in a few hours so I, darkhowl joined phoenix heart to regain him homeland though right timing we managed to overcome these attackers this is the short version of why we chose to fight the black riders

With the Phoenix Hearts guiding our light freedom will once again be ours,
let the magic show you the way and let the sword guild u in that direction
