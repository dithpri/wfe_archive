The Arcturous Ocean region is a newly established region, having its borders defined by a previously unknown range of Submerged mountains in the mid-South Indian Ocean. Numerous island chains and land masses are found within the region, and are the ancient remnants of volcanic protrusions.

The Arcturus Ocean was named for the Procession of the Star Arcturous that was predominantly overhead on the date of boundary establishment.
