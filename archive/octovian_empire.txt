The Octovian Empire is loosely based on the real life ancient Roman Empire. we are a beginning faction hoping to claim our place among the best of the best. we may be weak now but we intend to become strong because as our founding nation&amp;#39;s motto says &amp;quot;Conquest is the Lifeblood of an Empire&amp;quot;. we hope to see people join this nation and enjoy it.
