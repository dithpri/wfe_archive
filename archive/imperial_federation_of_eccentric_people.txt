Let morning shine on the silver and gold of this land,

Three thousand leagues packed with natural wealth.

My beautiful fatherland.

The glory of a wise people

Brought up in a culture brilliant

With a history five millennia long.

Let us devote our bodies and minds

To supporting these Sloth embracing lands forever.


The firm will, bonded with his imperial majesty,

Nest for the spirit of empire,

Embracing the atmosphere of Mount Lesbian,

Will go forth to all the world.

The country established by the will of the people,

Breasting the raging waves with soaring strength.

Let us glorify forever this land,

Limitlessly rich and strong.
