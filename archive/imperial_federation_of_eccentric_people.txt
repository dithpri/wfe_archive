Sick and tired of trying to type some sort of descriptive entry into this box because every time it tells me i wrote too much and deletes it all. The entry was brilliant it had it all, Generalissimo Bennett was in there, sloths on fire charging out of plantations towards the palace of a former dictator, lesbian bears leading protests in Dewsbury and forcing their way through riot police lines. But instead you get this short summary. 
DEAL WITH IT.
