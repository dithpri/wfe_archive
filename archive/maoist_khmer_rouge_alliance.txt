This region was &amp;quot;committed to spreading the influence&amp;quot; of Mao Zedong and Pol Pot. It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b], [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b], and [b]opponents of [color=orange]genocide[/color][/b].

&amp;quot;Maoist Khmer Rouge Alliance&amp;quot; is now dedicated to the (at least) 2 million victims of the Cambodian Genocide under Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge regime. Pot&amp;#39;s ideology was a blend of Maoism, nationalism, and agrarianism - with just a hint of maniacal murderouness.

Also dedicated to the millions of all nationalities who died in Southeast Asia as a result of Soviet, Chinese, and Western foreign policy.
