The Oak Tree, sits nesseled on the cliff with its branches growing outwards leaning towards the vast wilderness below! The Dwarves, they are snuggled below the tree supplying its roots with love, and the birds they sing happily at the top, then the leaves the dance on the ground. Its all a cycle of nature, its what the tree represents. Life &amp;amp; Liberty! for all, Its a sanctuary in which they can come together in that one tree and all live peacefully among each other. (:
