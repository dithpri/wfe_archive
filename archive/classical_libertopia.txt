Founded on the principles of Life, Liberty, Property, and Peace, Classical Libertopia is a non-interventionist region ruled by no one. This region was created when the Constitutional Republic of Jefferson Goldwater Paul escaped a region dominated by liberal and socialist nations that overthrew the regions constitution. While Classical Libertopia might never have a constitution, this is because it respects the sovereignty of the individual nations that make it up. Additionally, this region refuses to easily cooperate with the illegitimate World Assembly and thus hope to have no such delegate.
