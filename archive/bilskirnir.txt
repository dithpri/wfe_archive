[b]Welcome to [region]Bilskirnir[/region]![/b]
Bilskirnir is a small, idyllic region that pursues international co-operation regardless of their political views. Bilskirnir stands in favour of the World Assembly but takes a stance [u]against[/u] the Security Council, believing it is a mere popularity contest below the ideal standards of the WA. Bilskirnir stands amongst National Sovereigntists in the sense that the World Assembly should intervene in a nation&amp;#39;s policy as little as possible.
