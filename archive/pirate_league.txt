Come all you sailors near and far
You honest men know who you are
All of you who&#39;d dare be free
Combine with us upon the sea
Together we will drink a toast
Ride the wind on down the coast
See the merchant ship to board
Raise a jar and swing a sword
Watch to see the merchant captain crying
When they see the black flag flying
