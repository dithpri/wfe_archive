In Greek mythology the Hyperborea was supposed to be perfect, with the sun shining twenty-four hours a day, which to modern ears suggests a possible location within the Arctic Circle. 

Thule, also spelled Thula, Thila, or Thy&iuml;lea, is, in classical European literature and maps, a region in the far north. 

Strabo in his Geography (c. 30), Book I, Chapter 4, mentions Thule in describing Eratosthenes&amp;#39; calculation of &amp;quot;the breadth of the inhabited world&amp;quot; and notes that Pytheas says it &amp;quot;is a six days&amp;#39; sail north of Britain, and is near the frozen sea.&amp;quot;
