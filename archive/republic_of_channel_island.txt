This is the Republic of Channel Island region! To get you started and comfy we start now.
What is the Republic of Channel Island?
  Well, the ROCI(The common acronym for the Republic of Channel Island) is a half region, half micronational experiance! Which means we might have som interesting things going on.......
How will we communicate?
   My young Padawan, we use an offsite forum for Rading/Defending missions, Roleplay, and general chit-chat. We also use the RMB to chat as well.
Military?
  The ROCI offers the RCIA(pronounced Ricka) for all of our Military needs.
Government?
   We have the Secretary-General, the founder, the Whip(like the vice president) and the Parliment(our own WA)

Well, thats all you need to know! Enjoy your stay!
