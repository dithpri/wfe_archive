Settlers began to arrive on Mars in 2063. The societies on Mars consisted only of the rich, who could afford the luxury of escaping the destroyed world they left behind. However, the new settlements faced dispute after dispute, and eventually Mars was ravaged by a massive war that extinguished all human life on the planet. The people left on Earth consisted of the poor and the marginalized, who had not had the privilege to escape to Mars. 

However, Earth&#39;s residents worked together to create technology capable of bringing them to Mars. They inherited the ruins of the First Civilization, and built a new world. The political system consists of many highly decentralized communes.
