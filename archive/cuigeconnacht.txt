Connacht or Connaught is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the west of the Ireland. In Ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a &amp;quot;king of over-kings&amp;quot; (in Irish: r&iacute; ruirech).

Following the Norman invasion of Ireland, the ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. Along with counties from other provinces, Connacht lies in the North-West constituency for elections to the European Parliament.
