You might be saying &quot;Well, cats can&#39;t fly, why are you giving them an aerie?&quot; It&#39;s because these cats are metaphorical cats. Because nations are like cats! They knead you when they snuggle, they are really loud when they want something, and then disappear off into oblivion. But cats and nations are both very rewarding when you work together. So we invite you to the Aerie of Felids, where together we can rise to new heights of civilization, flying high in this aerie of ours! Enjoy this nonsensical madness, for it is one-of-a-kind.
