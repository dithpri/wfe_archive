The Union of Social Anarchists was founded after a short war with their previous rulers, whose government consisted of Fascists. The Union attempts to serve as a bastion for those who hold social anarchic, socialist, and all enemies to injustice. In most cases, nations are generally anarcho-syndicalist, collectivist, or communist, although all nations of any kind are free to join! All nations in the Union are encouraged an egalitarian view for it&#39;s people, as well as placing the people in the highest regard, with civil rights paramount.
