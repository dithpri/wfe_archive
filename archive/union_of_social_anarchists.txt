[b]Welcome to the [color=red]Union of Social Anarchists![/color][/b]

[b]Social anarchism[/b] is a blanket term for non-state forms of socialism and includes anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, and anarcho-syndicalism. Social anarchism places high importance on the worker&#39;s power over themselves, as well securing the welfare for the populace. Socialists or anarchists are the main population of the region, however we are not hostile to anyone expressing outside views! If you stay, enjoy it!

[i]All this was queer and moving. There was much in it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for. [/i]  -George Orwell on anarchist Barcelona
