Hidden amongst the denizens of every region, every nation, every city of this massive, ever-growing world, there are wolves, vampires, giants, fairies, elves, imps, shape-shifters, and various other Mystical Beings. Most do not realize who they are. The ones that do report to some kind of Lord, Chieftain, King, or other form of Royalty. This land is where the top links of the Hierarchial chain gather to discuss peace and war, treaties and trades, laws and ideas. Welcome to the world of the Arcane. Welcome to HellWood.
