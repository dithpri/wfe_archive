The history of Caraga can be traced back to the 15th century when explorers discovered the existence of &#147;Kalagans&#148;, believed to be of Visayan Origin in one of the three districts in Mindanao. The word Caraga originated from the Visayan word &#147;Kalagan&#148;: &#147;Kalag&#148; meaning soul or people and &#147;An&#148; meaning land. The &#147;Kalagans have a long history of being brave and fearless. Thus, the region was called by early chroniclers as the &#147;Land of the Brave and Fierce People&#148;.
