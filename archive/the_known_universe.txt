The known universe consists of the galaxies and other matter that can, in principle, be observed by Mankind. The best estimate of the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years and that the diameter is about 93 billion light-years, putting the edge of the known universe at about 46&#150;47 billion light-years away. It seems really nice so far.
