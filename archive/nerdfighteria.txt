[color=#990000][i]Hey... Sorry to intrude, but we here in the North Pacific Army noticed that you&#146;d stocked up on snacks recently. Bluie said we should ask you guys to share some, but we decided it&#146;d be better to just [b]raid[/b] it from you instead! I know, sad case, but I&#146;m happy to offer you a cutesy cutesy rice omelet for your troubles. Here&#146;s who sends you their condolences for your lost food:[/i][/color]
