In the post-apocalyptic world, we stand together as a brotherhood, creating new laws and protecting our people. After recently preventing the start of the 4th Reich by crippling the Enclave, a shadow organization within the government who planned to take over once the bombs fell, also the ones who worked with Vault Tec to turn the majority of vaults, Americas best hope of survival, into bizarre experiments, most of which failed horribly and killed most of the people in them, the Capitol Wasteland now has a promising future underneath the Brotherhood of Steel. With purified water, decreasing numbers of Super Mutants in the area, and a crippled Enclave, America finally has a chance to rebuild, the right way this time!
