[Hr]We respect the traditions, the torches, we shed from our ancestors.
From the spear and bow, to agriculture, to the atom and gene. 

Our conflict is not against man itsel, or Our own citizens. 
But to quell the drives, fears and blunt barbarism that push one against another.
Power has its place, always second to diplomacy and reason.

From the tales we tell today, to the lessons we must educate the children of tomorrow. 
Those of wisdom, fact, science and rationality. Civilization. 

If you stand and believe this Ideals, then you have found your new Home.
We must Light our own path, as we head forth, A Brave New World. 


[Hr]
