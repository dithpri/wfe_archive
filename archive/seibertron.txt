Seibertron/Cybertron is the home planet of the Transformers and (usually) the body of their creator, Primus. Seibertron/Cybertron is a shining metal, technological world; a planet of towering future cities without end and vast metallic plains, spiraling metal mountains and bottomless neon-lit chasms. Battling over control of Cybertron and its resources is frequently the motivation for, or origin of, the Cybertronians&#39; epic wars.
