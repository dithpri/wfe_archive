Somewhere in the universe there is a galaxy,named hdf548 but is normally called imval, however the ordangen union made a little tiny mistake, you see there was this space shuttle from the ordangen union that uhhhhhhhh crashed in one of the planets in this galaxy, but as the pilot left he found a gigantic amount of valuable ores and reported such a thing to the ordangen union leader and they made a small mining operation and it became bigger and bigger and bigger and even bigger to the point that the entire ordangen union was there and they decided that they wouldn&#39;t even use all of it and they would love to have YOU in the great galaxy of imval
