Hello!
Welcome to our newly-founded region!

Have you been kicked out of a region , or just stumbled by then this is the place for you!

As the founder , our group is aimed on fairness and compassion and democracy.

Even if you happen to have a different ideology , still! It is a wonderful place to hang out and roleplay anything! 
Politics , war , economy , or even share your favourite hobbies or food! , I promise that our region will be an excellent place to hang out and discuss important , funny and random matters.
If there happens to be someone who is hurting your feelings , spamming , griefing , hacking etc.
We should sort it out as quick as possible.
 

Meanwhile have a great time in our region!



Also, please endorse [nation]Neu Lagonda[/nation] as WA Delegate!
