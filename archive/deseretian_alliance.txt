The Deseretian Alliance is a strong, indivisible union of states sharing one common goal: economic and social progress, along with a strict Mormon agenda. Here, you shall find a plethora of political leanings, sizes, populations and economic theories between our member nations; however in pacifism and common interest we have cast aside the arbitrary quarrels that would otherwise be expected. Any nation of any type is welcome, however under the stipulation of complete submission to Mormonism.
