Altearth is Earth in an alternate timeline. Ever wanted to know what would&amp;#39;ve happened if Mark Antony had WON the Battle of Actium? What if the Mongols reached the Rhine in the 1240s? What if Napoleon had won at Waterloo? Altearth is a place where those who have alternate nations can live out their dream of rewriting history.

OOC: As this is an alternate history Earth, everyone will have conflicting histories, as is the case with Earth OTL. This region [b]WILL NOT[/b] be the home of disputes and petty arguments over who&amp;#39;s ATL is correct. That&amp;#39;s why its called [i]&amp;#39;alternate history&amp;#39;[/i], after all...because NO ONE is correct or incorrect.
