Altearth is Earth in an alternate timeline. Ever wanted to know what would&amp;#39;ve happened if Mark Antony had WON the Battle of Actium? What if the Mongols reached the Rhine in the 1240s? What if Napoleon had won at Waterloo? Altearth is a place where those who have alternate nations can live out their dream of rewriting history.

Wanting ideas on a special Coat-of-Arms for Altearth. Post your ideas in the region forum.
Also need a WA delegate to represent Altearth.
