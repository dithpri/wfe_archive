We&#39;re a new region, and haven&#39;t quite finished unpacking yet.
Coffee?  I&#39;ll get the kettle on.  I know we&#39;ve some sugar and milk around somewhere...

While you wait, check out the &#39;Wild Rumpus Book of Records&#39;, or the &#39;All Wild Things&#39; factbook for some light entertainment.  (We like to have quality coffee-table books)!
