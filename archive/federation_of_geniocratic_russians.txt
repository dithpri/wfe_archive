After some time, the UGIP decided it had had enough teasing from its citizens for not playing a strong part in its regional government. Far away, the new Armed Republic of Fierce Russians was, for the most part, unprotected. With both Presidents knowing each other, a deal was made, where the UGIP and ARFR would protect each other, but the UGIP would be the WA Delegate and Overseer of Inter-regional Relations. And so, the FGR was founded, being an outlet of greatness, intelligence, and patriotism.
