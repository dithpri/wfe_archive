[b]Welcome to the Summer Paradise of Alola![/b]


Regional History: Founded in late 2024, Alola served as a summer retreat for the folks over at [region]Aspen[/region]. However after it&#39;s fall, this region has been left to be forgotten to the sands of time.


[nation]Yangchenia[/nation] founded and currently owns this region. Both URUP and Warlord Yuan Bao are my puppets. Thank you.
