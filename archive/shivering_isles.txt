[u][color=purple][b]Welcome[/b], esteemed madmen, poets, artists and arsonists, to the [b]Madhouse of Lord Sheogorath[/b], the Madgod&#39;s blessed realm of Two Parts, [b]the Shivering Isles![/b][/color][/u]

May all who walk with the Madgod find what they seek beyond the door to His realm! If you are so inclined (and like cheese), feel free to remain here as long as you like. The Lord Sheogorath requires assistance with setting up the region from all who are willing.
