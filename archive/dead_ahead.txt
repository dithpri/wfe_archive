Based on the ROBLOX experience &quot;Dead Ahead.&quot;

The year is 1948. The Empire of Antares has just bombed a port belonging to the Republic of Orion with a light carrier battle group, following decades of turmoil internationally and on the Centauran continent. Columba, Yishen, Corvus, Cetus... all have fallen to the Antarean Empire. As it stands, the world is divided primarily between two factions: Antares and Ursa in the west and north, boasting incredible naval experience from the constant wars, and the Orion Republic and Hydrus Commonwealth in the east, with fresh industrial gains and a military at the ready. Only time will tell what happens, but only one side will remain.
