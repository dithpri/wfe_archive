[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], along with their friends from [color=#B0171F]The Sekhmet Legion[/color] of [region]Osiris[/region] and [color=purple]The Sparkling Hussars[/color] of [region]Sparkalia[/region] went out to settle some of life&#146;s biggest questions once and for all. 

[color=#eec322]They decided that pineapples [i]do[/i], in fact, belong on pizza, NFTs [i]are[/i] a good investment strategy, and that the meaning of life is actually [i]43[/i] (not 42 as had been previously believed).[/color]
