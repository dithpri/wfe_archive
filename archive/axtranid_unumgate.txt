We, the subjects of the House of Asanori, hereby pledge our undying allegiance to them. We will forever serve under them until the end of the earth. Starting with your steps of perpetual glory through the Unumgate, will you live under these words? Join the Axtranid Corps right now, and assert your nation&#39;s position as a patron of a glorious state!  This is what our region is for. And with our armies, it always shall be.
