When the nations of the PEEL region began to outgrow their borders, several countries took it upon themselves to find new ways to house their population. PR Zedoljev, a small country with a large population, sent out a few teams of explorers to chart claims of nearby landmasses with little or no indigenous inhabitants. What they found were plentiful lands and a chance to make a fresh start.
Soon many PEEL nations&#39; colonists were flocking to the new islands, and the PEEL Colonial Territories was born.
