&quot;In the streets of New Denver, a rumor has been spreading among the locals like wildfire, about the mythic isles of the east. The isles are a land far from the Great North American Continent, where the Old American folk, the survivors of the disaster, hold on to the remnants of their culture in a drastically changed world. These men live in cold, misty green forests on peaceful seaside homesteads, upon a string of islands known as Appalachia.

No one who has attempted to find these lands has come back. Some say it&#39;s because they were lost at sea, tricked by a fake land, others say the angry Appalachians murdered them in cold blood, and even more claim that after encountering the islands, they never wanted to go home again.&quot;
