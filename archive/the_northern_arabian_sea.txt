The Northern Arabian Sea is a region of the Indian Ocean bounded by the coastlines of Pakistan, India, Iran, and the Arabian Peninsula. The region experiences a tropical and arid climate. Monsoon seasons greatly influence the region, particularly the southwest monsoon (June to September) bringing heavy rainfall and the northeast monsoon (December to February) usually being dry. This region is a vital international shipping route for world oil transport. Major ports along this sea include Karachi (Pakistan), Chabahar (Iran), and various ports in the UAE, Oman, and Malaadh. The sea&#146;s strategic location makes it a focal point for maritime security and naval operations to ensure safe passage for commercial shipping.
