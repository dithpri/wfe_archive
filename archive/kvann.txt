Kvann is a region located in the far northeast. To the north lies the massive domain of the King of Gaerevar, this domain is the oldest and most powerful in the region. To the southeast of Gaerevar is it&#39;s mightiest vassal, the dukedom of Kvon and its sister state of Fravan these two dukedoms take their name after the regional name as the two lands were founded by powerful sons of the late king of Gaerevar who after years of squabbling and attempted assassinations of each other in a bid to secure the throne for themselves were exiled by their father to the outskirts of the kingdom.
