The [b]Ctan IsoSphere[/b] are an area located deep inside the subspace, where (through natural quantum-tensor-effects) the otherwise completely isolated extra-dimensional civilization of the [nation=short+noflag]the Ctan Culture[/nation] is existing in it&#39;s own space-time reality. Therefor the [b]Ctan Culture[/b] is among the most remote and isolated civilizations ever existed. 

There are some very limited contacts to the &#39;[region]SICON[/region]-Alliance&#39; and &#39;[nation=short+noflag]the Tkon Sphere[/nation]&#39;.
