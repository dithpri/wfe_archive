[b][color=red]Founding Nature of War Weary[/color][/b]
War Weary is a home for puppets that have seen stealth raiding action in the field, but are now retired from active duty; however, their owners would still like to keep them for old times&amp;#39; sake!


[b][color=green]Region Entry Conditions[/color][/b]
Nations seeking entry into War Weary on a more-or-less permanent basis should telegram the Founder and provide brief details of past operations. In addition, nations will be expected to have a respectable, well-manicured flag, and have a motto that is in good taste :)

[b][color=blue]WA Delegate[/color][/b]
War Weary does not have a WA Delegate, but nations with WA status are most welcome.
