[b][color=red]Founding Nature of War Weary[/color][/b]
War Weary is primarily a home for puppets that have seen stealth raiding action in the field, but are now retired from active duty. However, their masters would like to keep them for old times&amp;#39; sake!  Naturally, our Regional Motto is: [b][i][color=purple]Old Soldiers Never Die&amp;quot;[/color][/i][/b]


[b][color=green]Region Entry Conditions[/color][/b]
Nations seeking entry into War Weary on a more-or-less permanent basis should telegram the Founder and provide brief details of past operations. In addition, nations will be expected to have a respectable, well-manicured, non-default flag, and have a motto that is in good taste! :)

[b][color=blue]WA Delegate[/color][/b]
War Weary does not have a WA Delegate, but nations with WA status are most welcome.
