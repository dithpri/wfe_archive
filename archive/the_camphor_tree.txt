The Totoroistic Region. Totoroism is a religion and a state of mind that centers around Our Neighbor, Totoro, from the movie Tonari no Totoro. Totoro is not a deity but he is a spiritual icon and a guiding light for those who believe. Totoroism centers around peace, love, acceptance, equality, ecology, and happiness. Totoroism dismisses hatred, bigotry, and prejudice and welcomes every good person regardless of race, sexuality or gender. With Totoro as our Neighbor and Catbus as his Muse, I welcome you with open arms to The Camphor Tree. (telegram if interested)
