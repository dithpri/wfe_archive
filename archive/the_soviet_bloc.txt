The Soviet Bloc is best region ran by best Kremlin. Is not of puppet region of Communist Bloc, but is own, successful region. Nation must at least have part of economy be state run (part as in more than 15%) to be eligible to participate in government role like Border Control, or Embassy Officer. Election happen every few week, so be aware of that. Most successful communist region (100% Socialist, and Best Economy) get special authority over bloc, and I hope to see you around! *Region was featured on April 26, 2018
