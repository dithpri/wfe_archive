Bon voyage Soviet Bloc. We have loved it but we must however release it from our ownership. It&amp;#39;s hard to think but sometimes if you love something so much, you have to just let it go. We had good times; Divokl, Contravian...Tobagna. But now, we&amp;#39;ve got a new region. One where we can truly be safe with friends and flip off raiders whenever we wish. Good bye! Just raiders, do me one last favour if you figure out this Soviet Bloc&amp;#39;s password. Don&amp;#39;t. Let those who still wish to stay here do so in peace.
