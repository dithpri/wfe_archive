[u][color=red][b]Welcome to The Soviet Bloc![/b][/color][/u]

[b][color=brown]Created out of the fires of socialism. Forged from the workers of communism. Conceived through the ideas of Marx and Lenin. Enacted through democracy, and established as a home to all left-winged nations. The Soviet Bloc is a region strong in culture and prosperity. Home to a great many countries, governments and ideologies, the Soviet Bloc welcomes all who strive for the proletariat, and fight for the right of the greater good![/color][/b]
