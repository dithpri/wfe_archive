[b]This Region has been captured by the [region]Europeia[/region] Republican Navy! 

I have to say that Raideron, Onder and the Invading Spirit are with me tonight, though. Literally one second after I moved into here, my browser crashed. Good to know that the Gods are on my side! And this region&amp;#39;s supplies of rum, scotch, bourbon and cattle will be taken. The first three for us, the latter to be sacrificed to Raideron, Onder and the Invading Spirit.

Thanks to our friends in [region]Kantrias[/region], [region]The Black Riders[/region] and [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] for their help.[/b]
