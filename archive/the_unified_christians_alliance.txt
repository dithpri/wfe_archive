[b]Nations of UCA, your attention please.[/b]

I could have destroyed this region with the help of mercenaries I often use for such a purpose. However, I have much respect for [nation]Sanman[/nation], so your region has simply been &quot;tag raided&quot; as a warning. Others, less sympathetic to your founder, WILL come and destroy it at some point. It is inevitable. The only way to properly secure your region is to leave this one, let it cease to exist at the update, and refound it. I urge you to take this friendly warning seriously.

[nation]Dermatopia[/nation] will not receive telegrams. All correspondence is to be addressed to me.

Sincerely, 
[nation=long]Zealasia[/nation]
