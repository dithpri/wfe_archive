The Lush Land Of Utopia was founded buy the country The Freedom Flyers, who, in turn, was founded by Christopher Thomas, an active Liberal, most noted for his powerful wealth gained from music, a start in a garage.
This region is hell bent on world peace, still being lead by Christopher Thomas.
Freedom is a necessity and any countries trying to join that have laws supporting racial/sex/ and religions segregation will be placed on the watch list.
The watch list will be checked regular for any suspicious movement.
