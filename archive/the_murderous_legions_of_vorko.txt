[color=red]Ten million strong are the ruthless hordes of The Legions of Vorko. From birth they are brutally disciplined to become the merciless warriors they are.

Their hearts are solidified, icy stone; yet their blood is molten lead from the soul-crushing rage and ambition that drives their frenzied bloodlust.
