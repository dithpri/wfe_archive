The Hyrule Alliance was named after a great hero from Outset Island. His name was Kinnoto. Kinnoto is a hero known for his many adventure but not many people knew of his origin. He was born on Outset Island. At the age of 10 he went on a journy to save his sister from a raider group to kidnapped her (mistaking her for the queen Apola). In the end his sister was saved. The region started by his desendants.
We the people of the Hyrule Alliance promise to stand by eachother and support eachother in times of war.Our goal is to help small nations grow and become great super powers
