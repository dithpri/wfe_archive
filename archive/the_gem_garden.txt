Walk through the land where the sapphires grow and the rubies hang from the trees,
twinkling in the sun are the emerald flowers, singing a sweet song to all of the bees.
The moonstone tree rises up to the sky, providing contrast to the lilies of onyx,
A land of beauty for all to behold, we promise you there are no tricks.
