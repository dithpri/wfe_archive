True Name: &amp;#699;&amp;#256;ina Momona
&amp;#699;&amp;#256;ina: Land, that which feeds
Momona: Rich, abundant, plentiful, sweet, fat
&amp;#699;&amp;#256;ina Momona describes a land that is rich, abundant, plentiful, sweet and fat. It is a land that abounds in and produces much food. We see this in the word &amp;#699;&amp;#257;ina itself. While often translated as &#147;land&#148;, in it we have the word &amp;#699;ai, which also means to eat and is a way to refer to both food and kalo. Thus, in the Hawaiian worldview, &amp;#699;&amp;#257;ina is not merely land, but land that is healthy and one that feeds and nourishes.
