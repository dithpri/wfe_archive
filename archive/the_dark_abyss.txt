The Dark Abyss is a forgotten Region that most have never even heard of, as it has remained undiscovered, like Abysses in the ocean. It has mostly been reigned over by The Empire of Darknia. Reasoning for The Dark Abyss being undiscovered is the fact that Darknia hasn&amp;#39;t made contact with other Regions for some time, rather isolating themselves. But now, Darknia is beginning to make itself known, along with the rest of The Dark Abyss.
