We sing the song of the crow
We go where others don&#146;t go
Danger? A mere nuisance small
To those who burn in chaos&#133; 
Five men were told a lie, they grasped upon ill fortune
A chance to live their lives, but could not live immune
Deteriorated minds, they tore at flesh like snakes
And all that&#39;s left behind was the will to stay awake&#133;[/color]
