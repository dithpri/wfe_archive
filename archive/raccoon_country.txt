[color=#2991CB]Raccoon Country is NationStates&#39; premier raccoon-centric region for all things raccoon, raccoon-related, &amp; beyond! The Raccoon Country celebrates the natural environment and all wildlife. We value compassion and inclusiveness. All who share similar values are invited to visit or settle.

Procyonids of every kind are all over the place, but you truly don&#39;t have to be a raccoon-lover to belong here. Just be respectful, wash your hands, and enjoy a biscuit. &amp;#127850;[/color]
