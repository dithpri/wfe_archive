[color=blue]~~[/color][color=orange]Welcome to The Great Region of Jackoosh![/color][color=blue]~~[/color]

Founded in 1109 by lord Jackoosh himself, bitter infighting caused [region]The Outer Regions of Jackoosh[/region] and the [region]Regions Vaguely Associated with Jackoosh[/region] to split off, and finally all the nations within to split afterwards. Nowadays many nations (such as [nation]iniania[/nation]) are beset by revolutions on an almost daily basis simply due to the lack of people happy with their governments.

Frequently plagued by hyenas.
