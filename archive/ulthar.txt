[color=5d727b]A surreal city of varied entities, from small kittens to eldritch horrors. Can you pet the cats? Yes. Petting cats is encouraged. You can even pet cats via embassy posting. Venturous spirits may attempt to pet the velociraptor or the panther. Ulthar likes bears. You can call The Great Old Ones; it remains undetermined whether they&#39;ll notice. If you have wishes about the world factbook entry, contact a cat near you.[/color]
