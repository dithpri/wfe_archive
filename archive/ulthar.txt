[color=5d727b]A surreal city of varied entities, from small kittens to eldritch horrors. Can you pet the cats? Yes. Petting cats is encouraged. You can even pet cats via embassy posting. Ulthar likes bears. You can call The Great Old Ones, but be careful: we think that&#39;s how we lost our velociraptor. If you have wishes about the world factbook entry, contact a cat near you.[/color]
