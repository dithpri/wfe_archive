Welcome to the Midlands, a region of diverse nations in the New World. Millions still struggle under the yoke of capitalism in the Midlands, but there are many nations that have realized the dreams of Marx and King that stand together in solidarity as workers and people of the World. All who seek to embrace the Red Rose are invited to join and fight against the corporate theocracies of the Midlands that threaten the peace and stability of the region.
