The story of Tommy Nitro is essentially this: An average teenage metrosexual complete with courier bag and gelled hair, gets accosted by three goons dressed up like red punching bags. Not making this crap up folks. The leader of this group is called &#147;The Crimson Sausage&#148; which may be a subtle suggestion for the benefit of the desperate housewives who&#146;d normally buy something like this for their kids. The goons don&#146;t actually beat Tommy up, they just call him names like &#147;Tommy Salami&#148;. Oooh&#133; ice burn!
