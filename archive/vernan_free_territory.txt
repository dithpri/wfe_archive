[color=4169E1][b]On the horizon of the coastal shores, a fleet of square rigged ships fill the harbour. Glimpses of small shapes pouring out of the hulls; pirates begin storming the beaches and local towns, looting and pillaging. A dark void can be seen; the abyss. The swashbucklers throw everything they could find into it, loot or prisoners alike. If you peered to deeply into the abyss, you may have seen what seems to be a Jiang-Shi being watching in the shadows or may hear strange rants about Spy X Family season 2, and... Hamsters?[/color]
