Terra as a planet is similar, if not identical, to Earth, including having an oxygen atmosphere, a more-or-less identical gravity and atmospheric pressure, and carbon-based lifeforms. Much of its geography and climate are similar to that of Earth as well, albeit being more arid filled with many unhospitable place, a phenomenon similar to that of the Permian era in Earth&#39;s geological period. 

What sets Terra apart from Earth is its hidden threats that could easily wipe out its civilizations. To start with, the planet is filled with Catastrophes &#150; cataclysmic natural disasters, forcing much of the Terrans to adopt a nomadic way of life through nomadic cities instead of a sedentary one.
