The &Icirc;le Stup&egrave;fiant is an island south of the tropics in the middle of a vast ocean, far off from the rest of the world. Its shores feature crystal blue waters, high waves, and stunning skylines. Its inlands are awash with gentle, rolling hills and rich farmlands. The center of the island is a flat valley and colorful canyon surrounded by a ring-shaped mountain range; this center circle is ringed with major industrial cities.
