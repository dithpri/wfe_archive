Surrounded on all sides by vast desert and an inexplicable number of Gulagatian/Tagalugian Moose-Ox/Ox-Moose, The GulaTaga Wastes are a series of dried-up lakebeds and chasms into what the locals call &quot;The Forbidden Zone&quot;. It&#39;s primary selling points for any invading nations: infertile dirt, infertile mud, and The Empire of Gulagat/The Grand Duchy of Tagalug.

Due to the constant bickering and ideological differences between the Gulagatians and Tagalugians, The Republic of Lagutag was established in the Gulagatian/Tagalugian de-militarised zone. Also, as a result of political infighting in The Republic of Lagutag, refugees elected to resettle along the territory&#39;s perimeter in &#39;invasion deterrence camps&#39;, AKA &#39;The Free Land of Aluggat&#39;.
