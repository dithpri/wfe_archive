[i]An undiscovered continent has just been discovered! Well, it was already discovered long ago by the native Orquideans, but let&#39;s just overlook that. Anyway, they only lived on one island-- Orquidea. For some undisclosed reason (artistic license in place), two mighty empires are colonizing Verdantia but don&#39;t have power anywhere else in the world. Let&#39;s see how they get along with the locals...[/i]
