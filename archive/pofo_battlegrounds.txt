Where am I?

In the Village.
 
What do you want?

We want information.

Whose side are you on?

That would be telling. We want information... information... information.

You won&amp;#39;t get it.

By hook or by crook, we will.

Who are you?

The new Number 2.

Who is Number 1?

You are Number 6.

 I am not a number, I am a free man. 
[b]Good, you are honest. That is of use. Honesty attracts confidence, and confidence is our core of our business. See how honest I am being with you?[/b]
