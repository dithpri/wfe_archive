TRR will fall. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;if&quot; but a matter of &quot;when&quot;. The tyrannical regime ruling over the Rejected Realms has overstayed its welcome. It&#39;s time for a popular revolution.

[color=red][b]NEWS: The Rejected Revolution is officially in a state of war with The Rejected Realms. We may be a small region of two joke-y alt accounts, but we can take on the totalitarian regime of TRR. We accept any aid from anyone of any political background. We&#39;re all united against the Toerana administration. Victory is near, morning will come.[/color][/b]
