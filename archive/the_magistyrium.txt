[b]The Magistyrium[/b]

The Magistyrium is a place where my friends and I roleplay, hang out, and generally just have fun. Anyone is welcome, and we are looking for more people to join and fill up some spots. While we may be small, we will accept anyone and their puppets, unless you spit swears in the RMB. 

[b]Some rules:[/b]

1 No being mean

2 No double posting (pleaseee this is so annoying)

3 No spamming at all really

4 If you are gonna roleplay, please be accurate to your nation and don&#146;t make yourself crazy overpowered

5 Uhh

6 yeah

[b]Other stuff[/b]

You can bring your puppets but don&#146;t post in the RMB rules as them

So yeah that&#146;s about it :D
