The Great Firmament is a region of Christian faith, missionaries, prosperity, and armed brothers. Grand cathedrals can be found in every corner, protected by fine soldiers of Christ. Members of this region are advised to practice stewardship, as instructed in the Bible. 

The cooperation and support of regional neighbors is highly encouraged if they are of same faith and goal.

The Great Firmament&#146;s geography is not unique, but our treatment of it is. With both humble shrubs and grand trees growing in the forests, meek prey and powerful predator competing in the plains, and magnificent clouds cut by colossal mountains providing water to all, the Great Firmament will care for man if man cares for it.
