After discovering the ruins of Atlantis a few scientists decided to build an observation deck around it. After the massive scientific success of the observation deck Chrysantia petitioned to move to the observation deck. The move was accepted and since then space has been made available to nations on the Atlantic Floor. Reputable scientists have assured the World Assembly that the process of moving a nation to the Atlantic Floor has minimal environmental impacts. Scientists from nations living on the Atlantic Floor are encouraged to research the ancient technologies of Atlantis.
