[i][b][color=black]Your region has be seized by the appropriate authorities in the provisional Department of War from the [u][region]Green Isles[/region][/u]. We will not eject or ban you as that is a disgraceful act. Instead, we would like to entice you to move to Green Isles. If you don&amp;#39;t want to, that is fine. We intend on refurbishing and restoring the region, then incorporating it into the Green Isles.[/i][/b][/color]
