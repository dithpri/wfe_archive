[b][i][region]The Seven Realms[/region] is currently a closed region until an indefinite period of time. We may open again some day, but for now, have a nice gameplay on Nationstates. Feel free to visit some of our other regions instead such us [region]FNAF[/region], [region]The Panic Room[/region], [region]Rockefeller Street[/region], [region]Argonne Forest[/region], [region]The Nouveu Coryan Corporation[/region] or [region]Owl City[/region]. Its been a great time so far and I hope to bring back the region to its former self and beyond some day.[/i][/b]
