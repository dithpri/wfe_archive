Introduction
Welcome to the Armed Forces of NAOD. Here our main goal is to protect our resident, and those we consider our allies. We are not hell-bent on destruction nor raiding, we only seek to help those, and gain some power in the process.

Some basic information
Here we do not cower in fear from the higher ups that attempt to take us over. If there is a attempted take over you can be sure it will result in the immediate ban of all opposing members and removal of any authority or propaganda posted. We are open for embassies, however there will be a talk before hand within our region to determine your approval rating before officially creating an embassy.
