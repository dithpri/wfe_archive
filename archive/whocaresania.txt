Whocaresania is for players who are more concerned with actually enjoying this bizzare mindscrew of a game than owning a functional nation. Beginners and filthy casuals are especially welcome, but should understand that we are not a serious political powerhouse. Silliness is encouraged. Anything goes, as long as you never leak the fact that we are secretly the sixth branch of the Illuminati and control everything that happens in this game and the world.
