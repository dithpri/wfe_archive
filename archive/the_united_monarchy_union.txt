The UMU (an abbreviation of The United Monarchy Union) is a union of countries bound together by the laws and regulations of the UMU. We fight together, we protect each other and we support each other.

The United Monarchy Union was founded on May 22nd, 2019 by Makko Oko. Makko Oko thought about founding a union somewhat similar to the UN and the EU because of all the raids. We can be the protectors of ourselves and our allies.
