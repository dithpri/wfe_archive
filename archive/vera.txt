Currently under construction at this time. 

Vera is a region rich with culture and history, full of charm and mystery. It gleams in the daylight and shines through the moonlit night, arms open to all who wish to explore and learn. 

(I intend to begin laying the foundation for a region with open roleplaying in the form of regionwide happenings, and possibly multi-region play in the future. If you wish to join and help us, please do so, as we are looking for experienced roleplayers and experienced players of NationStates.)
