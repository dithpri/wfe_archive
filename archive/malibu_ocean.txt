[b]Malibu Ocean[/b] is the union of the historical [i]Malibu Islands[/i] region and the breakoff [i]Southern Malibu Islands[/i] chain. The head of the regional Commonwealth is Jianna I of Gruenberg; she is rarely seen at her palace, but if you miss her there, you can always catch her frolicking on one of our many beautiful tropical shores, because that&#39;s, like, way funner than listening to some lame sub-viziers yammer on about &quot;threats to national security.&quot; A hybrid of both the modern (beach volleyball and beer commercials) and the primitive (Gruenberg), our rich culture has much to offer to your country and its travel-weary citizens.
