[b]Malibu Ocean[/b] is the union of the historical [i]Malibu Islands[/i] region and the breakoff [i]Southern Malibu Islands[/i] chain. The head of the regional Commonwealth is Jianna I of Gruenberg; she is rarely seen at her palace in Flurthwel, but if you miss her there, you can always catch her frolicking on one of the island paradise&#39;s many beautiful tropical shores, likely with one of your country&#39;s popular male sex symbols. A hybrid of both the modern (beach volleyball and beer commercials) and the primitive (Gruenberg), our rich culture has much to offer to your country and its travel-weary citizens.
