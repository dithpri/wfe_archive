Greetings, [region]Winterfell[/region]!

Since our original WFE tag was a little unclear, here&#39;s a clearer one. If you have any questions, concerns, or requests, please contact Minister of Defense [nation]Darcania[/nation] directly.

The [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=485374]North Pacific Army[/url] decided we needed some practice defending a pile, and when we saw [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=rmb/postid=34564564]this post[/url] we decided this region would be best for the sheer irony. You may occasionally see other NPA soldiers running lib attempts - all part of a little in-house competition we have going on.

For those concerned, we will restore this region to its original state as well as we can before leaving, and cause as little lasting damage as possible. We&#39;ll leave some time this weekend.

Remember to contact Minister [nation]Darcania[/nation] if you have anything further to say.
