We are a band of brothers, native to the soil,
Fighting for our Liberty with treasure,blood,and toil.
We are a union of various confederacies.We were founded as a war broke out in our native region.Facing pressure to side with factions under threat,a ban on someone for an opinion, and a stripping of our national sovereignty, we chose to secede and form our own region.We will welcome any white (again, exceptions can be made) nations who are sick of tyranny and terror.We pledge not to censor commentary, no matter how vulgar or dissenting.The Confederacy is honoured to lead the way to Greatness and Glory. 
Gl&oacute;ir len&aacute;r Confederacy nua cr&oacute;ga!
