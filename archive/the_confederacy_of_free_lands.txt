[b][u]The Confederacy of Free Lands[/u][/b]

We are a league of various free states. We were founded as a war broke out in our native region. Facing pressure to side with factions under threat, a ban on someone for an opinion, a slow shift towards centralisation, and a stripping of our national sovereignty, we chose to secede and form our own region.We will welcome any Christian nations who are sick of the tyranny and terror of Communism and Dictatorship. We pledge not to censor commentary, no matter what it is.The Confederacy is honoured to lead the way to Greatness and Glory. We decline to have regional positions of power, as this was seen by our founders to be much too alike what the old region was demanding. Our confederacy is a place for free nations!
