We are a band of brothers, native to the soil,
Fighting for our Liberty with treasure, blood, and toil.
We are a league of various free states. We were founded as a war broke out in our native region. Facing pressure to side with factions under threat, a ban on someone for an opinion, a slow shift leftward, and a stripping of our national sovereignty, we chose to secede and form our own region.We will welcome any White, Right Wing nations who are sick of the tyranny and terror of Communism and Multiculturalism. We pledge not to censor commentary, no matter how racist, vulgar, or dissenting.The Confederacy is honoured to lead the way to Greatness and Glory.
