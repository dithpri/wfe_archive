Welcome to DCA! this region has no government, but rather is a place for nations that want to join DCA, or regions in the DCA that are sending a delegate to reprisent them in the DCA. while we have no real government, in the DCA, there is the Alliance council, which makes all the decisions. there is also the Alliance chairman, [nation]Democratic Capitalist Alliance[/nation], who founded this alliance. He runs the Alliance, but must abide by and enforce the council&amp;#39;s decisions.
