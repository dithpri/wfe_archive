[b][url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=428675]This isn&#39;t the first time[/url] [region]Angvar[/region] has shown they embrace terrorism. Absolutely disgusting. This is why we&#39;ve come to your region to spread the word and ask you to cut all ties with them (as well as [region]The Iron Order[/region], who approves of their actions). Whatever your cause is, I&#39;m sure you want to pursue it in a dignified manner, without associating with terrorists.

We&#39;re not here to destroy your region, only the relevant embassies are being closed, we&#39;re here to spread this important message. Please listen to us.[/b]

Vincent Drake and Merlin were here too!
