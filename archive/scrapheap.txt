This region has been raided by the wonderfully huggable [nation]Sweeze[/nation] and [nation]Sakariet[/nation] (who managed to nab 117 regions, well done congrats, etc.), but they&#39;ve now both been adopted as the supreme overlord&#39;s ([nation]Felis Silvestris Grampia[/nation]&#39;s) pets, so all&#39;s good. However, [i]drastic measures must be taken.[/i] It has been decided that all future raiders must be boiled alive in soup.

[nation]istria and izsac[/nation] is back in Scrapheap! (woot!)

Have a nice time here, and don&#39;t forget to bring soup.

Yours in floofiness,
[nation]Felis Silvestris Grampia[/nation]
