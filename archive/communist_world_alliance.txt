The CWA was started in 2030, when a Dutch Coup took over the Netherlands.
Poland was heavily suffering under the new Fascist and capitalist regime. A large portion of people rose up against the people, and took them down.

Poland joined the CWA with the Netherlands.
However, there are more nations couping against the world.
Communism makes a return once again.

The CWA exists out a Trotskyist and Leninist nations.
There is however, a Nazi ally. But this is not a danger.
