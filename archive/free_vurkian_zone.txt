Alright change in plans,

I will be/am storing my puppets in this region. To reserve their names, I don&#39;t want copies of Vurks on hands of other people. Because in future, I might use them for RP or anything possible.

Also these are just puppet nations with its isolated region, to satisfy &quot;What if?&quot; questions while answering issues. Other than that, if there is something about roleplay, contact with [nation]Foreign Relations of Vurk[/nation], otherwise contact with [nation]Vurk[/nation], if you need to say things other then embassy, invitation to other regions etc. Rest of them are puppets and region don&#39;t receive any message.

No, I don&#39;t do card farm.
