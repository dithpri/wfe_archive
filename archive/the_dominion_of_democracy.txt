Our goal is to unite a fair amount of Democratic nations to abolish tyranny and dictatorship of all forms. The Region itself is entirely democratic since all members have a vote on actions of the Region, and the WA Delegate is endorsed by the nations and has power and administration over the Region. The Founder position is only for keeping away Raiders and managing things if it all goes to chaos. The position isn&amp;#39;t used for any other purposes.
