In the beginning:


[url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe15/sbe15055.htm]The creation[/url]
Verily in the beginning this was Brahman, one (p. 89) only. That being one, was not strong enough.

 In the beginning this was Self alone, in the shape of a person (purusha). He looking round saw nothing but his Self. He first said, &#39;This is I;&#39; therefore he became I by name. Therefore even now, if a man is asked, he first says, &#39;This is I,&#39; and then pronounces the other name which he may have. And because before (p&ucirc;rva) all this, he (the Self) burnt down (ush) all evils, therefore he was a person (pur-usha). Verily he who knows this, burns down every one who tries to be before him.
