[i][color=#27005d]Somewhere in the middle of nowhere stands a stone arch, engraved all over with mysterious symbols. As the sun sets every night, this arch lights up, and a purple light fills the entryway. Those who dare to pass through, find a whole new world.

The magic of this place fills the body in an instant. You can feel the power. There are miles of wilderness, ripe for the taking. This is a place to build a great nation, to make a name for yourself.

This is the Other Side. This is home.[/color][/i]
