Don&#39;t you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
&#39;Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
It&#39;ll take you to the other side
&#39;Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you&#39;ll finally take the key
Suddenly you&#39;re free to fly
It&#39;ll take you to the other side
