[b]Cosmo Land[/b] is where the original Advance Wars took place. The largest landmass is shared by: [b]Orange Star[/b] in the northwest, [b]Blue Moon[/b] in the northeast, and [b]Green Earth[/b] in the south. [b]Yellow Comet[/b] resides to the east, and [b]Black Hole[/b] has occupied two small islands in the southwest. The origin of [b]Cosmo Land[/b] begins with the nation of [b]Orange Star[/b] in a war against the neighboring country of [b]Blue Moon[/b]. It is revealed that the enigmatic [b]Black Hole Army[/b], under the command of Sturm, has ignited the entire conflict, stirring up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them. The four countries unite to drive [b]Black Hole[/b] out of their land, and thus became the [b]Allied Nations[/b] of what is present day [b]Cosmo Land[/b].
