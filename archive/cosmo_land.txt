Cosmo Land is the one of Wars World&#39;s continents, and where the original Advance Wars took place. The largest landmass is shared by three countries: Orange Star in the northwest, Blue Moon in the northeast, and Green Earth in the south. Yellow Comet resides on an archipelago to the east, and Black Hole has occupied two small islands in the southwest.
