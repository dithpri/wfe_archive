[color=blue]The World Assembly is NationStates governing body, similar in nature to the real world United Nations, a hot-bed of political intrigue and double-dealing.

The General Assembly is concerned with passing international law: resolutions to improve human rights, environmental standards, and the like. 

The Security Council, on the other hand, is very much about specifics. It passes resolutions that Condemn or Commend particular nations or regions, and authorizes Liberation&#39;s, by removing a Delegate&#39;s authority to set a regional password (usually to restore order following its capture by invaders).[/color]
