The [b]International Syndicate Against Democracy[/b], otherwise known as [b]Lex Magnus Corpus[/b], stands as an alliance pact between regions with the common interest of seeing democracy&#39;s demise throughout NationStates. The syndicate was founded by [nation=Jocospor], under the divine rule of Emperor Emanoel II.
