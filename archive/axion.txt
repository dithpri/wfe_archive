[b][color=purple] Axion is for the believers, the thinkers, the astronomers, the astrologers, the philosophers, the new agers, and the scientists. Founded off of the idea, of space, dark matter, and questionable reality.[/color][/b] 

[b][color=black]The galaxy is a wonderful thing, and we want to hear your side of the argument. It does NOT matter (Get it ;)) what you believe, we will take you! That said, Christians are welcome, this is not a debate whether or not we should allow you to join, you are already accepted![/color][/b]
