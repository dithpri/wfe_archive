Axion is a diverse region of 40 separate provinces, each governed by a different nation. with different political ideas. Each Nation can rule as they please, however they must deal with consequences to their actions, such as war (coalitioned or otherwise). So making peace with your neighbors is the best option of staying alive. (Note: If you are defeated in war and do not agree to the peace treaty, you WILL be banned.) 

In Axion, RP is set in Feudal and Medieval times -- meaning no modern tech for anyone.
