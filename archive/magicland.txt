Magicland is a Region that contains some of the most &quot;intriguing&quot; nations. It contains nations of massive military might, and some that don&#39;t have a military at all. It contains nations of grand scientific knowledge, and some that haven&#39;t discovered fire yet. It contains nations of massive cultural output, and some that steal culture from others to feel good about themselves. It even contains nations that have extraordinary economic output, and some that go crazy at anything that looks shiny. (The owner of the region is from Australia and is a real Australian who isn&#39;t a soft lefty &amp;lt;3)
