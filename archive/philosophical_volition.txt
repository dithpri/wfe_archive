[b]Daily quote:[/b][color=red] &amp;quot;Except in very narrow cases, where there&amp;#39;s breakthrough science that needs patent production, worrying about competitors is a waste of time. If you can&amp;#39;t out iterate someone who is trying to copy you, you&amp;#39;re toast anyway.&amp;quot; ~ Eric Ries[/color]
