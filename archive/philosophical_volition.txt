Welcome to Philosophical Volition, a band of forward thinking.

[b]Todays featured question:[/b] Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw? If you continue this way, you will eventually deplete the entire bale of hay, and the question is: at what point is it no longer a bale of hay?
