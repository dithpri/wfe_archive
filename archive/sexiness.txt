This formerly-founderless gynocentric region was successfully liberated from the black riders and password locked by the forces of [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b], July 24 &#150; Sept. 14, 2013, leaving the region to long-term resident [nation=short]Jenna Jameson[/nation] and [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region]&amp;#39;s[/b] representative, [nation=short]Sophia Loren[/nation]. The region was without an administrator for four months, when [nation=short]Jenna Jameson[/nation] ceased to exist in January of 2014. It was decided that the best course of action was to have [nation=short]Sophia Loren[/nation] refound the region so it could finally have an administrator.

The region is presently closed due to lack of interest. If you would like to join, or if you would like more information, please contact [nation]Femdom Empire[/nation].

Praise Sexiness, Femmepower!
