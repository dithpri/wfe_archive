[b][color=skyblue]Welcome to the Nav Ocean, Wanderer![/b][/color]

The regions included here are part of Nav Oceanic Zone. Have a nice stay while you are here. Currently, we are trying to build our regional government. Embassies are welcome and any help is appreciated. This is also a quiet place for nations that want to discuss issues rather than participate in the expansive World politics.
