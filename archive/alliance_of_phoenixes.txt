[b][color=red]Welcome to the Alliance of Phoenixes![/color][/b]
We are a fledgling region consisting of exactly three members, but seasoned nations are always welcome!  We are open to any ideologies, no matter how sane or insane they appear to be.  
If you come from MVHS or THHS, this is the place for you.
Have fun!

Yeah, that&amp;#39;s it for the description for now...more coming your way soon.  If you want to suggest things we can put up here (Official Regional Rules, Regional Map, some sort of Constitution, etc.) feel free to do so.
WE HAVE NOT DIED
