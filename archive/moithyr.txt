One night, time began in a dark dream, beheld by Eolaisin. There were presence with her, and for a time the darkness stayed until a wash of light illuminated her existence. These became known as Grian, and Aluun, formless spirits who made themselves her companions. All were created by the thoughts of Eolaisin. These three were known as the Aisfey. Grian and Aluun were born with all of Eolaisin&#146;s knowledge and they grew in knowledge the more Eolaisin understood. The three created good things, for existence was only possible through goodness and so what was made was good too.
