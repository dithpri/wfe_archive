!WELCOME!

Hello world! Welcome to....this place. We are happy to see you all, and hope that you are enjoying your time here in our wonderful region! Please feel free to leave a message on the regional message board. Talk to me, Baishita, if you have any recommendations for polls or how I should update the Factbook. We are not here to please you, though, so I implore you to remember that beggars can&amp;#39;t be choosers.
