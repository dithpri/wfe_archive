[hr]Welcome to The Rhineland! The Rhine is a semi-autonomous state of the League, dedicated to supporting the growth and prosperity of the Rhine and Hanseatic regions. We encourage you to either join the Government of the Rhine and help grow its strength, or immigrate into the League which has much more opportunities to offer you. We also encourage you to give us suggestions on how we can improve the quality of life in the Rhine.
