We are here for one reason: unifying all German based peoples and nations in one region.
There is, in political geography, no Germany proper to speak of. There are Kingdoms and Grand Duchies, and Duchies and Principalities, inhabited by Germans, and each separately ruled by an independent sovereign with all the machinery of State. Yet there is a natural undercurrent tending to a national feeling and toward a union of the Germans into one great nation, ruled by one common head as a national unit. That unit shall be the Union of Germanic Nations, and I Emperor Daniel Falopian shall be Benevolant Dictator For Life. Just Let me know what needs doing, and I&amp;#39;ll try to get it done.

Deutsche aller L&auml;nder vereinigt Euch!
