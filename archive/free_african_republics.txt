Welcome, we are a group of African nations all united under the ideas of Democratic Socialism. We support the growth of freedom, of equal rights, and of a new world where all nations will live in peace, but that world starts small in Africa and most grow. If you are an African nation that is Democratic Socialist, then please feel free to join!
