America, the protector of the free world and guardian of democracy is left in nothing more than ruins after the nuclear fires plagued our nation. As uncivilized raiders and tribes combat each other to assume control of America, they bring it to its knees. We, the Enclave, true successor to the United States Of America will regain our strenght and territory to become better than we were before. From the vast deserts of the Mojave Wasteland to the rolling hills in Appalachia, America will be whole again, opposed or unopposed.
