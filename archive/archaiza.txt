Archaiza is the plane of dream and magic. It is an extra-dimensional space where supernatural people and creatures of all kinds dwell and where time often flows differently. Its denizens consider themselves to be above other lesser beings and above world government. They openly reject participating in the charade of politics and submitting to a will of strangers determined by an arbitrary majority.
