Primitivistan is a continent located in the Southern Hemisphere of the World, known for its lush vegetation, several hectares of unexplored land and a plethora of plant species and diverse wildlife.

 Some human societies living there belong to very primitive tribal villages that often clash with each other. Some of those who were exiled by their tribes are often caught and detained by much larger civilizations with Monkerland being a notable example, the corporate police state has been known to violate human rights; genocide of humans, mass extermination of certain species. Some conspiracy theorists claim the government officials are actually highly intelligent apes.
