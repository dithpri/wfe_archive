The Great Northern Union has some of the hardiest nations in the world. We are focused on quality of life, freedom, and international peace. We do this through diplomacy, not warfare. We have elections by diffrent members, who send a request to the Chancellor (New Mangoria) who decides weather to have a vote. Current goals include: 1. Reducing our carbon footprint as much as we can. 2. Upholding freedom to the highest degrees. 3. Assisting non-violently in the downfall of tyrannnical regimes and human rights abusers.
