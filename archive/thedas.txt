Thedas is a continent in the southern Hemisphere, and the only known continent of the Dragon Age universe, upon which all of the Dragon Age games are set. It is presumed that there are other continents, as the Qunari do not originally come from Thedas but from a unknown land across the Northern Ocean. According to some sources, the humans also came from the north.

The word &amp;quot;Thedas&amp;quot; originates from Tevinter, once referring to all lands beyond the Imperium and eventually, it came to encompass the entire continent. A native of Thedas is referred to as a Thedosian.
