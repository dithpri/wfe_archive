Welcome to [b][i]The Greater Southern Confederation[/i][/b]! We usually like to shorten it to simply the [b][i]G-S-C[/i][/b]. Here any and all nations on either end of the political spectrum are welcome. We believe that it is your country and you have the right to run how you wish. We don&amp;#39;t have any rules other than get to know your neighbors and enjoy yourself! There are old players, newbies, and all the in-between people!
