The Covenant of Royal Blood is a region only for monarchies.

This region is made to unite and protect the rights of all sovereign monarchy. We are a region whose members are from different areas and yet we all co-exist in harmony. War is an option to us; it our right to protect the members of this region against any hostility.
Our region is neither oppressive, tyrannical, slave driver or warmonger.
