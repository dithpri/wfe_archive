Once a small collection of nations, The Awakened Season banded together to become a small collection of nations, but with a snazzy name! The Awakened Season is most well known for its passion for economical pursuits and really cool background images that have petals and stuff. The land the region is founded around contains rolling hills and majestic cherry trees, which give The Awakened Season its name. The main goal of this coalition of nations is to create a utopia filled with the same things there is today, except with 20% more flowers.
