[I] We are the Dwarfs of Erebor and we have come to reclaim our homeland [/I]

Everybody is welcome to join our region!

Our song:

[I] Far over the Misty Mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day,
To find our long-forgotten gold

The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red, it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light [/I]
