[hr][b][color=red]&amp;quot;The modern proletarian class doesn&amp;#39;t carry out its struggle according to a plan set out in some book or theory; the modern workers&amp;#39; struggle is a part of history, a part of social progress, and in the middle of history, in the middle of progress, in the middle of the fight, we learn how we must fight... That&amp;#39;s exactly what is laudable about it, that&amp;#39;s exactly why this colossal piece of culture, within the modern workers&amp;#39; movement, is epoch-defining: that the great masses of the working people first forge from their own consciousness, from their own belief, and even from their own understanding the weapons of their own liberation.&amp;quot;[/color] [color=black]- Rosa Luxemburg[/color][/b][hr]
