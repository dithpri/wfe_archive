[b][url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=507257]A major update to NationStates[/url] that is [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=40435737#p40435737]soon to be released[/url][/b] will [b]drastically rebalance the game[/b] by allowing any region to [i][b]spawn newly-founded nations[/b][/i]!

[b]There is a hitch, though: The Security Council will be able to pass &quot;Injunction&quot; resolutions to strip the right to transition away from regions.[/b]

This travesty is yet another overreach by the WA that will be used to prevent regions they dislike from exercising their [i][violet][/i]-given right to self-determination.

If this matter concerns you, I urge you to read our [i]Declaration of Regional Sovereignty[/i] below, [b]and let us know if your region would like to become a signatory![/b]
