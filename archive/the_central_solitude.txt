A casual region created as a means of escaping the world to find some simple peace and quiet. All are welcome to join me in this centre of solitude - personally, I don&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with multi-player solitaire.

Since this is a casual region, the &amp;#39;invasion game&amp;#39; and its associates will not be played. Role-playing is acceptable within limits, and flaming, insulting, or otherwise harassing another member for any reason will not be tolerated and will result in an immediate ban from the region.

This region welcomes discussion of anime, manga, music, video games, and any other nerdy topics you can think of. Hetalia freaks are extra-welcome. :)
