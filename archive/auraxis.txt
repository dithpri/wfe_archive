The planet Auraxis has been engaged in perpetual conflict since the Terran Republic&amp;#39;s first colony was founded in 2643. The Terran Republic located Auraxis after traveling through a wormhole which then collapsed behind the republic expeditionary force, preventing any further communication with Earth. The resulting chaos led to the fracturing of the remaining republic forces which led to the formation of both the New Conglomerate and the Vanu Sovereignty.
