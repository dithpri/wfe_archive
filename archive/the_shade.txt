[b]Storyline[/b]: [color=brown]Founded at the edge of &amp;quot;Planet Z&amp;quot; by an isolated nation, The Shade became a lifestyle in a way. People kept to themselves. But one faithful day, it all changed. A ship emerged in the atmosphere. A man walked out and spread his nation&amp;#39;s culture and ways. It brought trade and a new life to The Shade.[/color]
