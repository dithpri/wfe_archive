[spoiler=4. Birds of a Feather]
You come upon the aviary,
and what did you see
but a little piece of poetry.

[pre]
You had a query, I have the answer...
If you can figure out the answer to the next riddle:

If the sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -
what sweet treat keeps the Bird warm?
