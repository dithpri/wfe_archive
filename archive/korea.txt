[b]Hail traveler![/b] What strange clothes and mannerisms you exhibit... You must have heard of our beautiful peninsula, and sought to reach it either by perilously crossing the [i]Amnokgang[/i] or sailing across the vast [i]Hwanghae[/i]. Your journey has landed you success, but seek no more to preach your irrational religion or spread your erroneous political ideology. The [b][color=#0DCBD2]Korean[/color][/b] monarchy has always provided for its subjects, and it shall for you too.
