[b]Hail traveler![/b] What strange clothes and mannerisms you exhibit... You must have heard about our beautiful peninsula, and sought to reach it either by perilously crossing the [i]Amnokgang[/i] or sailing across the vast [i]Hwanghae[/i]. Your journey has landed you success, but seek no more to proselytize your irrational religion or spread your erroneous political ideology. The [color=#0DCBD2][b]Korean[/b][/color] monarchy will make sure you are well taken care of.
