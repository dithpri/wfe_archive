The region of Godless Pragmatists is developed for nations that value pragmatic leadership, reject extremist ideologies and strive for practical solutions to problems rather than blindly following an ideology, and promote scientific progress. Atheism is a key feature of this region, regardless of whether your nation&#39;s economy is communism, laissez-faire capitalism, or a mixed economy, whether your nation&#39;s political structure is an anarchy, republic, dictatorship, or something else entirely.

Although this is a new region, we are hopeful to grow and develop the region of Godless Pragmatists into a thriving community.
