Carina Void is a FT region meant to provide a chat room for its members to talk about rps and to make conversation when most of us are split by thousands of miles and can&amp;#39;t use IIRC. Carina Void is not a separate entity from FT prime like other groups, it is a discussion room for FT in all cannons available for its members use. Carina&amp;#39;s primary role is to foster world building not to be a insular group, therefore its members are not required to only partake in certain RPs for them to count as cannon.
