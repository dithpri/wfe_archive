a quaint vacation home in the alps near berchtesgaden. lovely furnishings, beautiful mountainside views, lush greenery, a great hall for important discussions and a kegelbahn ring in the basement. delightful place for a holiday.

high regional officials may use the space for meetings on request, or to exchange mail. send in an embassy request and we should accept- if we do not, try again and hopefully we will get to you next time. :)

enjoy your visit!
