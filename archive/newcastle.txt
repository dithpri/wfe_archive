Welcome to Newcastle!
Although we are a small and relatively new region, we are currently accepting anyone, regardless of whether they&amp;#39;re communist, capitalist, fascist, socialist, and so on. We might be small but we&amp;#39;re mighty and help anyone in our region however we can, not only that but Newcastle is also a region very good for culture, trade and opportunity, and so on et cetera.
