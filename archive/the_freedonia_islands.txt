[color=#B0171F] [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=valle_de_arena]The Sekhmet Legion[/url], along with our friend from [region]The Black Hawks[/region], couldn&#146;t help but notice that [region]The Freedonia Islands[/region] had been recruiting on other regions&#146; message boards, including our universal jump point, [region]Suspicious[/region]. While most regions frown upon such uncouth methods, we decided to take them up on their offer! Of course, this came with the stipulation that we got to do some redecorating &amp;gt;:)[/color]

We raiders have taught the natives about the error of their ways, and hopefully we shall never see RMB recruitment posts from them again![/b]
