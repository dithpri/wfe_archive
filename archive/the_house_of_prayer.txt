[color=#AA336A][b]Prayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication. 
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.
Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Come to our region, offer thanks to the Lord, repent, and clean up your act.[/color][/b]
