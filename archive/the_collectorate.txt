[i]&amp;quot;I never forget for one moment what I am: a collector. That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve chosen to do with my life; everything else is just an accident of birth.&amp;quot;[/i]

Anyone is welcome. No one is prevented from leaving. Except, of course, when they are...

I am the enigmatic and rich [b]Irving Braxiatel[/b], and my Collection has expanded over the galaxy. Anything may happen in this area, so beware.

[i]&amp;quot;And in another time and another place, Irving Braxiatel smiles as he looks across his Collection... and he thinks about all that he owns, especially the pawn once more waiting to be sacrificed.&amp;quot;[/i]
