We, the conquerers from the tenth dimension, come from a higher dimensional plane and have full control of your pitiful multiverse and have slaughtered more snivelling civilizations than your puny mind can comprehend. We have conquered all of your miserable universe, and we come to you wtih a message of pure peace. Give us all your resources and become our slaves and pets or we will extinguish you with no less than a thought. We already have an agent in your region, but that is only so he can sow dissent and we can laugh at your misfortune.
