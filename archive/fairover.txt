Founded as a center for all to prosper in a beautiful and flourishing environment with a reasonable economy, Fairover is largely known for its strong belief in an altered form of Bushido. The samurai is common here, none more renowned than Talon Fadewing, a legendary warrior with a blazing katana possessed by the spirit of a Phoenix diet called Murakumo. Currently the sole leader of the country, he struggles to lead the new country of Tamashi as the youngest leader in Fairover at just seventeen years old.
