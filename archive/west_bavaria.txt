[tr][td][color=blue]We are a republic! We aim to bring the Bavarian region back to the prominence and reach that it once boasted. The Bavarian region has one of the most exciting and complex systems of government where everyone feels involved and powerful. Some of Bavaria&#39;s greatest achievements are:[list][*]An intricate and engaging system of government where no citizen feels excluded
[*]The largest and most in-depth constitution boasting over 12,000 words (this makes for fun legislative debates)
[*]North Bavaria was in the top 100 for all regions on NationStates![/list][/color][/td][td][/td][/tr]
