[tr][td][color=blue]We are a republic! Being involved in government has never been easier! We allow political parties to roam West Bavaria, seeking whom they may buy over! We are not a one-party state. Our national religion is Christianity and our official church is the [u]Roman Catholic Church[/u]. Seated in the easter hemisphere; and a sister nation to Germany, West Bavaria is the perfect place to grow your nation![/color][/td][td][/td][/tr]
