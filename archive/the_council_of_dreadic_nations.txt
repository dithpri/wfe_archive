A council of nations along the Dreadic sea, each with their own desires, enemies, and allies taken here to debate about it with their fellow members. It was founded by switzenzka, as a way to easily communicate with their fellow residents of the Dreadic sea. Currently the council is still under development, with the only members being Switzenzka, the koopa Troopa Nation, and Natzinheim.
