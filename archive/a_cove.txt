Another tribal bastion.
As a region we are in the opposition of the Security Council&amp;#39;s doings, which consist of popularity contests, often concerning the biased wordings offered by those defeated in the silly game of raiding. Our region&amp;#39;s commendation is reserved for those who work toward eradicating Liberation, Commendation and Condemnation, the popularity contests which usually shun a nation or region&amp;#39;s right to enact legislation as they so please in this game -ideological intolerance- or their right to do that of which is not explicitly outlawed or made impossible -raiding-.
