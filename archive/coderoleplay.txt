Hello! This is a nice hangout for fellow club memebers and roleplayers. How To Roleplay: You Start Out With A Counrty And Build Up. When Building Vechiles, It May Define Realism But Not To Crazy. Keep The SuperWeapons Not Space Or Flying Vechile, But Ground And Navy Forces May Contain One Or Two SuperWeapons. When Attacking, Other Gray Countries Are As Smart As You. They Progress The Speed You Do And Are Like Us. Have A Reason If You Ever Attack A Country Controlled By A Club Memeber. Telegram Me Your Country And Color Before You RolePlay.
