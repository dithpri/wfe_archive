If there is nowhere else for you to go, if there&amp;#39;s a problem with your current region, or if you just need to get into a region, you can become a member of North Australasia! This is the region where you can be accepted for who you are and can have the time of your life!!! We hold role plays, sports leagues, and have formed the NAPT (North Australasia Peace Treaty).
 
We will NOT tolerate any kind of bullying, harassment, torment, etc. Doing so will result in immediate banning. We will hold a poll if you request to get back in, and if you get voted in then you get another chance. If not, adios! If you mess up a second time, you&amp;#39;re permanently banned.

So why not have a good time in North Australasia?
