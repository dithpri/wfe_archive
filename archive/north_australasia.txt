Welcome to [b][color=009FB8]North Australasia![/color][/b] We are a region recently founded in 2015 where people are welcome to take part in roleplays, run for elections and have the right of opinion. North Australasia is controlled by a elected governmental system where people can vote after a month long campaign, an existing officer steps down or a challenge has arose.
