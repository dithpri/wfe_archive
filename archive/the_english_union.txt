The English Union is an intergovernmental association of English-speaking liberal democratic nation-states united by their shared history, language, and culture, as well as their values of the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. Member states retain sovereignty but have some level of responsibility to one another. They also share a common free-trade area, currency, and common visa policies. 

The English Union, as a liberal democratic association of nation-states, requires members to either be constitutional monarchies or parliamentary republics. The English Union is libertarian and moderately socially conservative in outlook, with the majority of citizens identifying as conservative liberals.
