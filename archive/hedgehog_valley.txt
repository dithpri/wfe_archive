This region is a safe place for allies and friends in common, to join power as one. Hedgehog valley is also known for the annual holiday &quot;Hedgehog Day&quot;, held on April 9th, in which all the citizens find the beauty in nature (Little kids tend to dress up like hedgehogs in representation to the national animal). This region is good at finding differences and celebrating them. Join Hedgehog Valley if you feel you can always find the beauty in difference, and hedgehogs!
