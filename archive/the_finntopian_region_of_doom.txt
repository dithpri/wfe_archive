[B][color=purple]We at TFROD (The Finntopian Region of DOOM) like people to speak their minds, so please, if you have any questions or problems, let us know.

You have freedom of speech here, but you are not allowed to break the site&#39;s rules.

We don&#39;t ask people to join the World Assembly, but if you do decide to do so, please endorse [nation]The Finntopian Empire[/nation], our founder.

We don&#39;t have an official roleplay system, but you are allowed to roleplay in the RMB, if you so wish.

We accept almost all embassy requests, but we are not an embassy collector region.
