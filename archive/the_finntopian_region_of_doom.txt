[B][color=purple]We at TFROD (The Finntopian Region of DOOM) like people to speak their minds, so please, if you have any questions or problems, let us know.

You have freedom of speech here, but you are not allowed to break the site&#39;s rules.

We don&#39;t ask people to join the World Assembly, but if you do decide to do so, please endorse [nation]The Finntopian Empire[/nation], our World Assembly Delegate, who is also the Founder. (you don&#39;t have to but it would be great if you did!)

We don&#39;t have an official roleplay system (yet?), but you are allowed to roleplay if you want.

We accept almost all embassy requests, but we are not an embassy collector region.
