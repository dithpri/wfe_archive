[B]We are a small region but that just means everyone matters.

We like people to say their minds.

We believe in total freedom of speech.

We don&#39;t ask people to join the world assembly, but if you do, please endorse The Finntopian Empire, our delegate, and the founder. (you don&#39;t have to but it would be great if you did!)

We don&#39;t have an official roleplay system, but you are allowed to roleplay if you want!

We accept almost all embassies.[/B]
