This region serves to store any puppets previously used in raids at the behest of The Mighty Hyena, under the service of the formerly glorious raider armies of The Alliance of Dictators.
The AOD has undergone a positive transformation and I will not tarnish their new direction with puppets whose hands are covered in the blood of our former conquests.
Feel free to come and go as you please, but be respectful of the legacy or face the consequences.
