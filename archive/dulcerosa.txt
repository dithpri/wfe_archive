Known as the &amp;quot;sweet empty&amp;quot; by its inhabitants, the rugged region of Dulcerosa is home to Freedovia and Margovia. Bounded on three sides by the Escalpia Mountain Range,the higest in the world,the region is effectively sequestered from adjacent land masses. Its fourth boundary, or the mouth of the &amp;quot;Golden U&amp;quot; stretches as coastline, rife with deep harbours and several navigable rivers.
While its borders, on three sides are stunningly rugged, Dulcerosa&amp;#39;s interior is deep and lush. Seventy percent of the interior is protected National Forest Perserve. It is home to hundreds of species of wildlife, including the national animal, the Twain Fox.
