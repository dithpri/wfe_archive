The South German Union was created by the cooperation of Austria and Bavaria in response to the creation of the North German Confederation. Although every part of it was germanic, nationalism began to grow within the union. Many attempts were made to hold the state together and a communist regime rose to power, to supress nationalistic para-militaries and values. It all came to a breaking point in february when the &quot;Bavarianisation Program&quot; rolled out. Many states revolted and destroyed the South German Union. Some joined the North German Confederation while others stand alone on the world stage awaiting their fate.
