[color=darkblue]The historical Kalmar Union was based in Denmark and lasted from the end of the 14th century to the early 16th century. But what if it were to somehow come together again?

This is my attempt at imagining what a revived Kalmar Union based in Sweden instead might look like if it were to exist today, in the 21st century.[/color]
