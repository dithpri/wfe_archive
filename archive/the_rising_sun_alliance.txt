This region serves as a symbol of hope, prosperity, and alliance. United as one as a partnership, the contained nations will serve to protect one another from the forces who threaten governmental structure and prosperity amongst the common man. As one we will stand together strong and shine as bright even in the darkest of times. As the sun always rises, we will always stand tall.
