Ognarsjog&amp;#39;s Floating City is the fabulous place where lies Ognaria&amp;#39;s government.

It&amp;#39;s a round platform which float a few hundred meters upon the sea, it can move and go where Ognaria&amp;#39;s citizen votes where they wants to be. It usually float in the south of North Atlantic ocean, where the climate is nice.

Nobody knows actually who build this amazing structure. It isn&amp;#39;t without reminding of the Gulliver&amp;#39;s Laputa, who knows ? Maybe there is really a relation ?

This region is too small to support a number of country, it is why this region is private.
