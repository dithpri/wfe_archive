[b][color=darkred]UNION OF WESTERN COMMUNIST REPUBLIC ([i]UNTERRELIC[/i])[/color][/b]
[hr][color=darkred]Already 48 years have passed, the fall of the revolutionary Loush Land Communist state has almost certainly ended! But no, after the agreement [i][b]Eht Communista-Republica Loush[/b][/i] was signed, the communist countries were tarnished by this pact! The utterly impure communists disgusted the advanced politicians who were beheaded! Not now! This is a new revolution! No more liberal state will rule over the communist nation or discriminate against it! From the moment you read this statement, this is a letter of protest! And those who have read it are the people who decide for themselves who is wrong and right![/color]
