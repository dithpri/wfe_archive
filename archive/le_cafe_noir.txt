An excellent, dependable bar on the edge of the Sentier district, the Black Caf&eacute; is, in fact, predominantly red, and one of those bars you decide to turn into a regular haunt. It&#146;s always packed, with a mix of French and Anglophone imbibers attracted by the friendly and very hip ambience.[hr][hr]
