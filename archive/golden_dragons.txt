Here at the Golden Dragons we are mostly a Medieval region, however we do pride ourselves on having democratic elections , and an active government that votes on the issues of the region.

Here we have two main government bodies, the House of Lords which votes on most of the general region issues and the High Council, in which each member is in charge of a specific aspect of the region.

We encourage everyone to join our discord, however it is mandatory for all those who are wishing to join the regional government.

Diplomats or ambassadors are also encouraged to join the Discord if they wish to discuss anything more in depth.
