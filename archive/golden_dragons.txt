Here at the Golden Dragons we are a mostly Medieval region, however we do pride ourselves on having democratic elections, and an active government that votes on issues of the region.

Here we have two main government bodies, the House of Lords witch votes on most general region Issues and the High Council, in witch each member is in charge of a specific aspect of the region. 

We encourage everyone to join our discord, however it is mandatory for all those who are wishing to join the regional government.
