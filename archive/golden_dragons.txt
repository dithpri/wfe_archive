Here at the [color=d18e00]Golden Dragons[/color] we are mostly a [color=007fa3]Medieval region,[/color] however we do pride ourselves on having democratic elections, and an active government that votes on the issues of the region.

Here we have two main government bodies, the [color=purple]House of Lords[/color] which votes on most of the general region issues and the [color=blue]High Council,[/color] in which each member is in charge of a specific aspect of the region.

[color=3c7296]We encourage everyone to join our discord, however it is mandatory for all those who are wishing to join the regional government.

[color=green]Diplomats or ambassadors are also encouraged to join the Discord if they wish to discuss anything more in depth.[/color]
