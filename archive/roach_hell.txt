Here, cockroaches are supreme! Humans are prohibited from entering this region. The environment here is extremely filthy, stagnating, rife with diarrhea and waste, and completely devoid of sanitation. The entire region is festering with disease and is infested with termites, centipedes, flies, mosquitoes, and of course, us, babylicious baby-buns!
