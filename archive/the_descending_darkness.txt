[b][u]The time has come for darkness to snuff out the candles burning bright,
There is no place for them in the eternal night![/b][/u]

We are the Descending Darkness. A new region to resurrect an ancient and long dead invader region. Our name has long been forgotten by the world of nation states, but we have risen; as night does each day to quench the suns light. 
Join us, and become part of a world forgotten.

For now we are too few in numbers. Join us and together our strength will outnumber the stars. We accept all vengeful requests and wage war on all who oppose our members. We want WA nations from everywhere to join in our revelry!
