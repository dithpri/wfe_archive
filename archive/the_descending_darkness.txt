[b][color=#000061]Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah! This region proved far stronger than the [region=The Black Riders]! Who we defeated mercilessly.[/color]

The Riders all came, but were fallen by the great night.
We are the Descending Darkness, 
The time has come to snuff out the light,
It has no place in endless night.
Our purpose is to destroy the weakened regions of this world.
