This region was established with the purpose of providing a space on NationStates for all peace-loving Muslims and their friends, a space that is free from petty differences, where all can unite around the things all Muslims have in common.

All are welcome. Inshallah, we can grow into a region that will be respected, and which will encourage respect for Allah (swt), the Prophet (pbuh), and the Noble Qur&amp;#39;an.

Those who are interested are invited to form a committee to draw up and submit a regional constitution for discussion.
