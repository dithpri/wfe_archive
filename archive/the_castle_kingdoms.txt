An alliance of kingdoms and castles that seek to preserve their existence formed by The Kingdom of [nation]CaskKeep[/nation] and aided by [nation]Iathrah[/nation]. The majority of this region is founded on the ruins of the Kingdom of Brammek although small parts of it are islands surrounding the continent or western parts of the continent that had not been taken by Brammek&#39;s many kings.


This region is basically only one person and is just a fun thing I wanted to do.
