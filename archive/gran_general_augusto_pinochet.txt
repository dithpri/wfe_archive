A safe haven for all whose regions have been invaded by Communist tyrants!
Here, the Reds will be thrown out of helicopters!
Almost [i]all[/i] anti-communists are welcome here, even if you disagree with Pinochet or his policies, that&#146;s perfectly fine!
The only exception is Nazis/fascists, any glorification on Nazism or glorification/denial of atrocities will get you [b][i][u]IMMEDIATELY BANNED!!![/u][/i][/b]

All communists (and Nazis) will be banned, ejected, and/or thrown out of helicopters!

Against the WA due to its commendation of communist tyrants like the Red Fleet and MT Army.
WA members are permitted in this region, but we do not support the organization as a whole.
