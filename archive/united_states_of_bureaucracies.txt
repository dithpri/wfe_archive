In this region kingdoms and empires will join and discuss ideas and manifest destiny giving eachother support in every way, due to this region being a united states there are endless bureaucracies, so every one has power, a job and a department, such as: FIA, HIB, department of justice, police, the treasury and agriculture, and 100s more with more being created every week.
