This region has,
1) attacked peaceful countries in an effort to advance our global domination,
2) a policy of shooting fascists and nazis in sight,
3) cooperated heavily with communists,
4) given said communists carte-blanche to dominate half a continent,
5) occupied formerly hostile countries for decades,
6) removed fascists and nazis from office on the principle that they are fascist or nazi officials.

We are very evil and should be condemned.
