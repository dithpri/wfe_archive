Please research the cure for the zombie apocalypse. This will save our region from being overrun.

Also, if you have the ability to fire &amp;quot;Cure Missiles&amp;quot;, please go to another nation in the RA&amp;#39;s page (by clicking on their name.) and help them out by shooting a cure missile at them.  I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;d appreciate it. 

Also, no one is allowed to shoot any of [nation=short]Buddyland[/nation]&amp;#39;s residents.  He will consider doing so an act of war.  You may send cure missiles, but not  Zombie Hordes and Tactical Zombie Elimination Squads[/b]
