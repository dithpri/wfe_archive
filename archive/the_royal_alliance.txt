This is a message from your Prime Minister:

I have been recently feeling under the weather.  I don&amp;#39;t expect to be sick for long, but I may be slow to respond to certain requests.


Thanks for your understanding,

Buddyland
Prime Minister

P.S. BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS!

P.P.P.S. If anyone was planning to take up eating organ meats, now may be the best time to start. :D

P.P.P.S. No need to panic, just stay calm, and stay still :)

P.P.P.P.S. If you wouldn&amp;#39;t mind bringing out the Worcestershire sauce, just in case I pay you a visit, that&amp;#39;d be much appreciated. :)
