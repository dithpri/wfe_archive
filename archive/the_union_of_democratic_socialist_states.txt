[b]Please note, the Union of Democratic Socialist States may eject your nation from the union without warning. This could be due to multiple reasons, which are listed below.[/b]

1: [i]Being undemocratic in nature.[/i] Authoritarian nations to either side of the political spectrum will be ejected.
2: [i]Being too far to either side of the political spectrum.[/i] Highly conservative and highly communist nations will be ejected.
3: [i]Not being socialist in any way.[/i] If your nation fails to have any kind of social institutions or public infrastructure, your nation will not be eligible to join the union and will be ejected.

Thank you for joining the Union of Democratic Socialist States. [b][i]For a better tomorrow. For a social future. Democratic forever, in union.[/b][/i]
