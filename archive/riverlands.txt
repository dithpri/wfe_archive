The [b]Riverlands[/b] is a central region of the [b][region]Seven Kingdoms of Westeros[/region][/b], consisting of the rich, fertile, and populous areas around the three forks of the Trident and the northern Blackwater Rush.  Because of their central position in Westeros and lack of natural boundaries, the Riverlands have been a frequent battleground. 

The Riverlands are ruled from Riverrun by House Tully, the Lords Paramount of the Trident. Notable houses of the region have included Blackwood, Bracken, Darry, Frey, Lothston, Mallister, Mooton, Mudd, Piper, Ryger, Strong, Vance, and Whent. &#151; [url=https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Riverlands][color=990000]A Wiki of Ice and Fire[/color][/url][hr]
