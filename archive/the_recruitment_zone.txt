[b][color=#0C9291]What is this place you say? [region=The Recruitment Zone] is a place, for, recruiting nations! I guess. This is an attempt to see if this might actually work, so, why don&#39;t you request an embassy, or perhaps, send a puppet over? Drop a message on the RMB for your most beautiful region. Whatever it may be. Well, what are you waiting for then?[/color][/b]
