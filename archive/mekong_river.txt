The Mekong is a trans-boundary river in Southeast Asia. It is the world&#39;s 12th-longest river and the 7th-longest in Asia. Its estimated length is 4,350 km, and it drains an area of 795,000 km2, discharging 457 km3 of water annually.

From the Tibetan Plateau the river runs through China&#39;s Yunnan Province, Dhal Sim, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. 

The extreme seasonal variations in flow and the presence of rapids and waterfalls in the Mekong make navigation difficult. Even so, the river is a major trade route between western China and Southeast Asia.
