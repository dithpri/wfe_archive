[b][color=#FFDD00]Welcome to Horizons Sanctum.[/color][/b]

Horizons Sanctum is a region based solely on a DnD system, where each nation can only preform major actions through the results shown by the rolled dices given out by the selected GMs. Roleplay preformed within your own nation for development purposes is allowed, however contacts made between other nations are to be done by dice results.

The DnD system to this region is custom. Meaning there can be some flaws or unbalancing here and there. However if there is a number of complaints to the custom DnD system, then the selected GM&amp;#39;s will discuss and decide to shuffle things through if agreed upon. However, if not. You&amp;#39;ll have to deal with it.
