[b] Welcome, capitalist friends. Welcome to the Capitalist Pact of Asia! [/b]


The [color=blue][b]Asia Capitalist Pact[/color][/b] is a region seceded from the USSD to allow capitalism and to get rid of 

socialism. We&#39;re currently planning for war against the socialist brainwashing USSD, but are needing 

more members. Join the Asia Capitalist Pact and we&#39;ll rid Europe and Asia of [color=red][b]socialist commies![/color][/b]
