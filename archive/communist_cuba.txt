[b]Intellectual Property of [region]The Fascist Union[/region][/b]


[b][color=red] Fascism is therefore opposed
to Socialism to which unity within the State (which
amalgamates classes into a single economic and
ethical reality) is unknown, and which sees in history
nothing but the class struggle. Fascism is likewise
opposed to trade unionism as a class weapon. But
when brought within the orbit of the State, Fascism
recognizes the real needs which gave rise to
socialism and trade unionism, giving them due
weight in the guild or corporative system in which
divergent interests are coordinated and harmonized in
the unity of the State [/color]
