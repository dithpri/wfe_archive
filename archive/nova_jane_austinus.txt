[b]Founded by refugees from old Jane Austinus after High Lord Brickbeard oppressed the people.
However out of the darkness came a growing light! &#39;Behold!&#39; shouted the rebels, &#39;Behold Saint Joe!&#39;
Unfortunately, Joe was crushed by a ton of bricks.
After Saint Joe the Savior died, the nation erupted into chaos.
The rebels were later executed via brick torture, but they caused the downfall of Lord Brickbeard!
The world rejoiced, and from the ashes of Lord Brickbeard&#39;s domain came Nova Jane Austinus[/b]
