Adam was exiled from the Garden of Eden for the sins of Eve, but God let him keep some powers including his immortality. He has been many famous figures throughout history, including Harpagus, Herodotus, Cardinal Wolsey and G&ouml;ring. Soon he grew bloated, so he used his powers to take a slab of fat from his body.

From Adam&#39;s belly fat, Nova Jane Austinus formed and was guided by the glorious light of God to success.
