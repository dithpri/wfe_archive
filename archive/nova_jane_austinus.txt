[b]Founded by refugees from old Jane Austinus after High Lord Brick Beard oppressed the people.
They didn&#39;t stand a chance against lord Brick Beard&#39;s brick launchers.
However out of the darkness came a growing light! &#39;behold&#39; shouted the rebels, &#39;behold saint Joe!&#39;
Unfortunately Joe was crushed by a ton of bricks.
After Saint Joe the saviour died the nation erupted into chaos.
The nation gasped when polish nationalists supporting the rebels found lord Brick Beard&#39;s selfies.
These rebels were later executed via brick torture, but they caused the downfall of Lord Brick Beard!
The world rejoiced, and from the ashes of Lord Brick Beard&#39;s domain came Nova Jane Austinus[/b]
