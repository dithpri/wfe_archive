[b]Founded by refugees from old Jane Austinus after High Lord Brickbeard oppressed the people.
They didn&#39;t stand a chance against Lord Brickbeard&#39;s brick launchers.
However out of the darkness came a growing light! &#39;Behold!&#39; shouted the rebels, &#39;Behold Saint Joe!&#39;
Unfortunately, Joe was crushed by a ton of bricks.
After Saint Joe the Saviour died, the nation erupted into chaos.
The nation gasped when Polish nationalists supporting the rebels found Lord Brickbeard&#39;s selfies.
These rebels were later executed via brick torture, but they caused the downfall of Lord Brickbeard!
The world rejoiced, and from the ashes of Lord Brickbeard&#39;s domain came Nova Jane Austinus[/b]
