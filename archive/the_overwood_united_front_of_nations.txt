We stand as the sole counter-offensive against the obtrusive and corrupted Underwood Regime.  We support representative elections and the freedom of all to voice their own opinion.  Anyone wishing to join may do so, we welcome all who support our democratic government.

Due to our democratic nature, the endorsed WA delegate of this region has all administrative powers in this region.  If a member is not satisfied with the current WA representative&amp;#39;s conduct, he/she may propose a &amp;quot;vote of no confidence&amp;quot; in order to offer a new candidate for election.
