Anyone coming in from foreign lands who we don&amp;#39;t know:  You&amp;#39;re welcome here, and there&amp;#39;s a crapload more RP stuff going on on our regional forum than there is on the wall.  So if you see that the last posts were made hundreds of days ago, don&amp;#39;t worry.  We&amp;#39;re probably all killing each other on the forum.
