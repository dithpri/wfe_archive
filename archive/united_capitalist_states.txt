Welcome, fellow capitalist! We yield to the demands of the corporations, we keep our government as small as we like and we, of course love money. 

While we are diverse in our governance, all agree that:

1. Countries must have a private sector consisting at least 40% of the economy (in other words, no communists or socialists).

2. No country in the region shall exceed a government size of 18 on the Bureaucratic Comprehensiveness Rating Scale Index.

3. All WA nations must endorse [nation=Cymansia].
