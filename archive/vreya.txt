Vreya is a II role playing region set in the era of pike and shot tactics with some light fantasy element. Vreya its self is but a single continent in a larger world. Resembling Europe in the late 16th century, it is a land emerging from its own middle ages and into the early modern era, as such political and religious upheaval are common as new philosophizes and technology clash with the ways of old. It is a land dominated by kings and dukes and religion yet also a land where science and the modern idea of a nation state are beginning to take shape.
