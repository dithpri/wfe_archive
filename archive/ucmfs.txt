Welcome to the United Coalition of Martinian Free States.
Inspired by the many valiant sacrifices of our god-like pilgrim, the Martinian Free States broke away from their respective regions; uniting together under a banner of loyalty, honour, and vengeance. Together, we shall punish those responsible for the King Sh*t, rain fire upon those who spit toothpaste in the bubbler, and strive always to emulate the ways of our holy prophet T-Stain.
