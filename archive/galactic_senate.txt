The Galactic Senate was the governing body of the Galactic Republic. It consisted of hundreds of senators who represented the many worlds of the galaxy,[16] and was led by a Supreme Chancellor that was elected by and from the representatives.[1] Its primary concern was mediating disputes between varying worlds and dictating the laws and regulations necessary to maintain the Republic.
