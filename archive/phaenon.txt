Phaenon is a large continent which spans from the north polar region down into the tropics. Due to this, it has a wildly variable landscape and climate, ranging from frozen tundras and snow-capped mountains in the north to lush forests and a centrally located lake district to balmy white sand beaches in the tropical southern regions.

Phaenon is home to The Free Land of Rainshine.
