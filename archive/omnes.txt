The Omnesian landscape, dominated by the forested North, the arid west, and the fertile South. Marked by great mountain ranges and legendary expansive plains. The six oceans surround Omnes&amp;#39; four continents. The planet, larger but more arid than that of more familiar life-supporting planets, has seen many unique species dominate, falter, and die off- the exceptions being Humans, Magniviri, and the exceptionally rare Elephantic Dragon. The dominant race of Humanity numbers in the billions, with most of the population living in the South.
