Attention dictators, war-masters, super villains. 

We all know words are fickle things used to subdue the populace so i&amp;#39;ll get straight to the point. I am Klaus Johnson, leader of the IoA. I founded this region after my predecessor met an *coughs* untimely end. Assassinations aside, this region was made to a seat of power, a place where the greatest rulers of the planet can converge to escape the ignorant commandments of those savages called the World Assembly.

 I give you my personal welcome, and glory to the UAP.
