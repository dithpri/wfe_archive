The Fellowship of Nations is a conglomerate of all sorts of nations who are willing to roleplay. In order to prevent invasion by any riders or something, I will hold position as the region&amp;#39;s leader, and the WA delegate will take my place in the event I leave. Polls will be used in order to make decisions. Roleplays will be done semi-regularly, in which negotiations, trade, possible war scenarios, and general politics could be discussed.

Rules:
1. Apply here (required):
2. No bullying of any kind. No racism, no prejudice to any group including religions.
3. No spamming.

We will not tell you how to rule your nation. You can do whatever you wish with it.

Have fun~
