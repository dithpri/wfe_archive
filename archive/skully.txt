[color=red]I only annex colonies if I think they&#39;re good enough or had a certain history. Soon I will record the history of a region onto their RMBs carefully. I doubt I&#39;m going to make any more colonies than 24. I&#39;ve got enough puppets and I don&#39;t want to have any more to tend to.[/color]
