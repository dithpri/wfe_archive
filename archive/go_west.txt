When you are dominated by someone, you&#39;d probably want revenge. This region is an example of that. The N-Day 6 faction held in this region severely damaged my own Verchy Defense Coalition. N-Day 7? Straight up killed Star Hold, my own faction and scored 6th place at the end! As such, when I saw this region vanish, I decided SPECIAL occupation was needed.
