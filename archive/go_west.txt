It exists to facilitate a single-player faction for N-Day[sup]7[/sup], along the lines of two past factions based out of this region:
[list=I][*][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=877108]We Still Like Mike Atherton[/url], Tinhampton&#39;s initially successful one-woman faction from N-Day[sup]2[/sup]; and
[*][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1598843]SINGER[/url], Tinhampton&#39;s wildly unsuccessful solo effort from N-Day[sup]6[/sup].[/list]
(Neither this region nor the faction associated with it is endorsed by any other nation or region.)

[i]Our flag is teal and white to honour [nation=Aynia Moreaux], a friend of Tinhampton&#39;s.[/i]
