When you are dominated by someone, you&#39;d probably want revenge. This region is an example of that. The N-Day 6 faction held in this region severely damaged my own Verchy Defense Coalition. N-Day 7? After I had brought back one of my old nations for the event, [nation]129392[/nation], the faction straight up killed Star Hold, my own faction and scored [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=news/2022/09/25/index.html]6TH PLACE at the end![/url] As such, when I saw this region vanish, I decided SPECIAL occupation was needed.

Let this region be a lesson to all of you, don&#39;t anger someone while poorly maintaining your properties.
However, forgiveness might be good, so [nation]Tinhampton[/nation] has been given permission to request the release of this region.
