[nation=short]Tinhampton[/nation]&#39;s personal jump point. If you see a nation moving from Go West to some region where raiders are currently occupying, Tinhampton is taking part in that operation out of his own free will (he is not part of any military organisation). Tinhampton never engages in raids of historical/pre-founder communities, or roleplay regions.
