The Self-Aligned Group (SAG) is an international organization of nations who do not want to be officially aligned with or against any major power bloc. We seek the national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned countries in their struggle against  all forms of foreign aggression, occupation, domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics.
