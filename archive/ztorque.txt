Welcome to NationStates and the fine region of Ztorque, a mountainous forested area which in former times was an island of pirates. Now, the Old King Meinertzhageni has passed on and his tomb can be found in the ruins of his castle.  Many precious jewels in the middle of the region can be discovered. Spectacular views, world-renowned wilderness, clean air and cool fresh water, are also proof that Ztorque has truly been blessed by nature.  Enjoy your stay!
