Born from multiple countries seeking one thing, power, the Apex alliance aims to make its members strong and powerful leaving the weak to wither and die out. We will be strong, we will be power, we are Apex. 

Although Apex makes its name in weaponisation, it also includes various types of powers such as a strong economy or strong employment rates. Regardless of the strength, The Apex Alliance aims to make it the best it can be! 

If you share this ideology, join the Apex Alliance!
