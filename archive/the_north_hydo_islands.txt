This region was created as a protest to overstep by the leaders of the [region]The Commonwealth of South Hydo Islands[/region].

War is always allowed, and bans and ejects are only used in the case of breaking critical site rules, raids, and large numbers of sub-nations entering at once. (No more Keraizan crusades)

Currently, administration slots are being filled with WA nations only.
