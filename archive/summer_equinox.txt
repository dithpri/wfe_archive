Welcome to Summer Equinox!

We are an all inclusive community. Here all are welcome. 

Take my love, take my land,
Take me where I cannot stand.
I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m still free,
You can&#39;t take the sky from me.

We all can fly if we work together. And that is the basis of this community.
