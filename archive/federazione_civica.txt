[color=lightblue]Federazione Civica[/color] was founded on the principles of [color=green]Civic Republicanism[/color]: Freedom of speech, Freedom of worship, Freedom from want and Freedom from fear. Federazione Civica matches these principles with four ideals. Freedom of speech and worship with [color=gold]Liberty[/color], Freedom from want with [color=maroon]Justice[/color], Freedom from fear with [color=silver]Peace[/color], and to these it adds another: [color=green]Progress[/color], the Freedom of all humans to pursue a better, more sustainable, future. The field upon which the pillars sit is representative of [color=lightblue]internationalism[/color], and the universality of these high aims: [color=maroon]Giustizia[/color], [color=green]Progresso[/color], [color=gold]Liberta[/color], [color=silver]Pace[/color].
