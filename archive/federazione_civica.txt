The Federazione Civica was founded on the principles of Civic Republicanism. The Four Freedoms represent the common good for which it stands:

Freedom of speech, Freedom of worship, Freedom from want and Freedom from fear.

Federazione Civica matches these principles with four ideals: Freedom of speech and worship with Liberty (gold), Freedom from want with Justice (red), Freedom from fear with Peace (white), and to these it adds another: Progress (green), representing the right of all humans to a better, sustainable, future. The field upon which the pillars stand represents the universality of these high ideals (blue).
