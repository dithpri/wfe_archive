The Region of Daddy Lyonsland was created in response to pressure from outsiders that forced a group of nations to band together in mutual weirdness, and from this, the region was born. The original founder was swallowed by the synthetic re-creation of the Sarlacc Pit, and so the region was renamed in his honor, as he was clearly the godliest thing known to any of the nations. The original name has been lost to time, and one too many Hot Pockets.
