[b][i][color=#990000]Whet the Seax, sing our lore
Wyrm of white, our banners four

Of the West, East, South and North
Kin of blood, guard the door

Against those, that we abhor
Saxons rise from [region]Saxon Shores[/region]

Fight [region]Spear Danes[/region], draped in gore
[region]The Order of the Grey Wardens[/region], punish more

Join [nation=short]Brits First[/nation], and beacons fire
raise sail, to [region]Femdom Empire[/region]![/color][/i][/b]
