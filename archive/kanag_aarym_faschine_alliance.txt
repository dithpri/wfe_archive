The Kanag Aarym Faschine Alliance is a region that is actually a Political entity and not a physical one. It&amp;#39;s noncontiguous and contiguous nations thrive under their own governments free to do anything, as long as it doesn&amp;#39;t threaten any of the other nations. There is absolutely no region recruiting. Go find another region to steal nations from.
The KAFA headquarters are based in Kir&iacute;l, Kanag Republika. The region is home to ST Kir&iacute;l Armory, Sephyr Corporations, FOCARM, and many other high end companies.
