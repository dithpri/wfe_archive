Hidden in the shadow of the tower a wilting poppy whispered grievances seeded upon a brisk wind. 

~
Have you yet seen how they dance on the wold.
The clouds, the clouds, cast a shadow from high.
On the seas they did froth, and the fields they did roll.
And the meadows, they toiled and lay neath the sky.

From the clearings i grew, and i took not for need.
I have not a name, though you may call me Greed.
