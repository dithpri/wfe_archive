&quot;The Kuiper belt (/&amp;#712;ka&amp;#618;p&amp;#601;r/)[1] is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune at 30 astronomical units (AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.[2] It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger&#151;20 times as wide and 20&#150;200 times as massive.[3][4] Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed.&quot;
