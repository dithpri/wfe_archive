HATRED!
Fuel for endless war -
The eternal flame that burns in the chest
HATRED!
We must quench the blood of our enemies
The hunger of the Gods that look out of the darkness!

Hatred is the fiend of hell
Hatred is the breath of darkness
Hate is the radiance of the Warp
Hatred is the embodiment of war
