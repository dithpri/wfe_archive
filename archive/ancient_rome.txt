Greetings, denizen of Ancient Roma!

This region has been set free by Caesars Republic. Seeing the plight that faced you all, our region has generously offered it&amp;#39;s support, and Legions!

Our region strives to achieve those milestones that Rome once marched with across the World with the banner of Order and Civilization!

Long Live Roma! Roma Invicta!!!!!

All Hail Caesars Republic ! All Hail The Emperor of Caesars Republic !
