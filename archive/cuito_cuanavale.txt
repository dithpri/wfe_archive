Cuito Cuanavale, Angola, was the site of a major battle in the long and bloody Angolan Civil War (1975-2002). This war was fought primarily between the MPLA and UNITA, two of the three major forces who had been fighting Portugal for independence. As with many Cold War conflicts, the Angolan Civil War was a proxy war: the MPLA was supported by the Soviet bloc, while UNITA was supported by the West (most notably South Africa) and China. Both sides committed vast human rights abuses.
