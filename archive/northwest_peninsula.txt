Y&amp;#39;all must think you&amp;#39;re cool for invading a region with one member in it that obviously doesn&amp;#39;t care about recruiting or the arrogant games you play. Congratulations, do you want a cookie? I&amp;#39;ve banned/ejected you all and it took me a good six seconds to fix everything you attempted to smash. I&amp;#39;m someone working by myself on my single nation. I&amp;#39;ve also password protected the Northwest Peninusla. If you want to play invader, find a region that actually wants to play back. Thanks in advance.
