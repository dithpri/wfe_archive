[b]Nearly a century following the March on Rome - having completed the second phase of its own [i]Risorgimento[/i] - the Revolution formed in defense of a [i]Fatherland in crisis[/i] now expands beyond its national borders to liberate the rest of Europe in defense of Western civilization itself.

It is in the mass heroism of its anti-globalist struggle and the mobilizing myth of a reborn Rome&amp;#39;s transcendence over the [i]&amp;quot;immortal principles&amp;quot;[/i] that [region]Italia Imperiale[/region] will find its defining, redemptive mission in the 21st century.
