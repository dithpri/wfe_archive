A dreamlike domain in a constant state of rapid advancement in all things, creating a hodgepodge of ideas and technologies coexisting and self-sustaining through the sheer will and ingenuity of its inhabitants. The Unconquerable Dawn maintains a perpetual Renaissance in Revolution, where the flames of inspiration and motivation never turn to ember, her nations are ruled by Philosopher-Kings, Revolutionaries, Technocrats or some combination thereof. Aurora Invictus is maintained and sustained by the dreams and ideals of the innovators and thinkers of the multiverse, in peaceful perpetuity.[hr]
