[color=darkgreen]WA Delegate Elections are on the last Wednesday of each month, with Vice-Lotl elections the Monday after. All elections last 3 days, and only officers can be elected. Please make sure that every poll made is WA voters only, unless it isn&#39;t important or serious. If you want to become an officer, please contact the founder or delegate.
