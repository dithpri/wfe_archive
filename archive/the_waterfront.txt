Welcome to [region]The Waterfront[/region]!

[b]General Background[/b]
Our region is set in the present day while our countries are facing the issues the world faces today, countries can negotiate their own trade agreements and have their preferred allies and enemies. The region wide government therefore will be very small while we act mostly as individual nations. 
P.S.- This is only a preliminary description! Our regional description will be changing soon and more links and other things will be added down below.
