The UBCR was established in order to keep the peace between rivaling nations, and to also support Democracy and freedoms of individuals. Though the name implies that only Bolshevik and communist ideals are accepted, that is far from the truth. Nearly any nation is allowed to enter the UBCR, as long as they follow a few regional guidelines.

[u]Regional Sayings:[/u] 
&amp;quot;Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.&amp;quot; - Karl Marx (1844)
&amp;quot;Freedom is the recognition of necessity.&amp;quot; - Friedrich Engels 

[u] Guidelines: [/u]
1.) No Fascists and no Nazis
2.) Relish in the grandeur that is &amp;quot;Freedom of Expression&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Individual Rights&amp;quot;
3.) Do not debauch anyone&amp;#39;s personal opinions in any way
