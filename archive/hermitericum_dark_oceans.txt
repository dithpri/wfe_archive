The infinite soul of The Imperial Isolation Of Entako Hermitarity. A place so dark and remote, it serves an ideal heaven for the solitary, or a hell for those infected with sociality.

 The Hermitericum Dark Oceans (HDO) have a vast amount of islands, which are all controlled by the Imperial Isolation, and they all contain massive metropolises, heavy military defence, underground facilities and tremendous air fleets patrolling infinitely like haunting ghosts.

Let it be known- no one is allowed to enter the Hermitericum.

&amp;quot;Solitude is my life, Solitude is my world!&amp;quot;
