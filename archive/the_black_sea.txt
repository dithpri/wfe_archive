[b]Welcome to the Black Sea[/b]

The Black Sea is an inland sea located between far-southeastern Europe and the far-western edges of Asia. It is bordered by Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia. 

Over many centuries, the Black Sea has been of critical importance to regional commerce. Today, this body of water serves as a primary highway for the transport of energy to Europe from Russia and western Asia.
