[b]What is this place?[/b]

This is a place of peace and nonsense. It is also used to prevent regional disputes in [region]The Great Chili[/region] and to provide an alternate government to the democracy of said region. Not many rules to remember, other than:
No Godmodding
No Profanity
No Sexual Talk
No Spam or Flaming
Be Mature

And for crying out loud, [color=red]NO DESTROYING FURNITURE.[/color]
