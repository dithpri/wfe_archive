[b]Hail, Foreigners! Have you heard the good word about our Lord and Defender, Ademar?

[color=green]No, of course you haven&#39;t. Very few people have, and it saddens us. To help you get better acquainted with salvation, this region has been visited by the Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army! We at The East Pacific are happy to correct heresy wherever it may be found. Questions may be directed to Chief Missionary Pakitsk.[/color][/b]
