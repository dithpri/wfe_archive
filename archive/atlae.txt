Hi, I&#39;m [nation]The Atlae Isles[/nation]. You might see me around [region]The East Pacific[/region] sometimes, where I serve as the Overseeing Officer of the Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army.

This region is mostly used for cards! If you have any inquiries about card sales please contact my main nation. If you want to say hi, contact my main nation. :) If you want to complain about a region I raided, please contact another nation. :P

I sell cards at Junk Value! Sometimes. I reserve the right to raise prices. I will not sell TEP cards unless I own multiple copies! If you have a TEP card and you&#39;re willing to sell, contact me! I&#39;m also collecting cards from [region]Fox Rite[/region], [region]Asendavia[/region], [region]Hyrule[/region] (or general Zelda-themed cards), [region]Pasridi Confederacy[/region], [region]From the End[/region], and [region]Frozen Circle[/region]!
