[b]AS DECLARED  BY THE SECOND REGIONAL POLL OF UTOPIAN SOCIETIES, A REGIONAL GOVERNMENT WOULD FORM.[/b]
This new government will consist of the following: 
       1. [b]A legislature[/b] made-up-of all participating nations who will vote on new policies put forward by the executives
       2. [b]Two Executives[/b] who will put forward policy to be voted on by the legislature and check the other executive&amp;#39;s actions.
       3. [b]A court[/b] consisting of nations specially appointed by the executives and approved of by the legislature who will, when necessary, declare any passed policy void of all power.
The goal of this new regional government is to provide more interaction between the nations within our region and allow everyone a say, not just those with admin powers.
