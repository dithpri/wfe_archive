[i][b][color=rainbow]We are a region that broke away from the oppression of [region]Baymonia[/region]. We are here to create a level, safe, and fair environment where nations can feel welcome. Join us, and your NationStates journey will be a long and very fun one![/color][/b][/i]. 

Ultranus is now under the control of the Ultranus Council (The officers below) 
The Council&#39;s job is to resolve issues faced by the Region. The WA doesn&#39;t vote and is merely a judge and enforcer.
