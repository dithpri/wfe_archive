[b]Welcome to the International Capitalist Union![/b]

[i]&#147;Capitalism demands the best of every man&#151;his rationality&#151;and rewards him accordingly. It leaves every man free to choose the work he likes, to specialize in it, to trade his product for the products of others, and to go as far on the road of achievement as his ability and ambition will carry him.&#148; -Ayn Rand[/i]
