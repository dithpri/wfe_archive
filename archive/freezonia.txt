This Is Freezonia, the land of Penguins! 

We have a bad map at https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1k5h7FITsxzvfDEpw_RgGImvbLJ_yFSTumJgySWDAkE4/view. We will have a better map soon.

Anyway, our average year-round temperature is 14 degrees fahrenheit. Our summer high is 35 degrees fahrenheit (Above freezing!), and our winter low is -19 degrees fahrenheit.

Our scientists and intelligence are what we focus on. Our scientists have been able to permanently unfreeze some of our ice into water somehow. They have also genetically modified about 17.83% of plants known to man so that they can survive the cold and be grown in snow.
