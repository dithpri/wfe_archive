The United Colonies is a region dedicated towards imperial democracy. We are bloc of nations dedicated to the exploitation of resources, subjugation of markets, and the building of a collective socio-capitalist nation state.

Our main focus is on economic and social development at all costs. Civil rights and corporate rights are a priority. Working to create a working economic system while protecting peoples liberties is one of our main tenets. Political rights are expendable, if they hinder true development. The joining of small nations, are preferable for membership.

Join the United Colonies! Fight for our emperor! The imperial revolution starts now!!!
