The Empire of Narvolk, as it was formerly known, lasted a period of close to a year. Narvolk was part of SBTO (Slavic Balken Treaty Organization), and was ruled as an absolute monarchy. It was eventually disbanded when the founder decided to terminate its existence following an extended period of declining activity.
Today its memory is preserved by The Holy Reich of Bunicken.
