[region]Germindia[/region] is a cave like location stretching from the underground of Germany to India.
The only entrances are two active volcanoes in which the residents need specialized suits to enter and exit. Due to the extreme heat Germindia is a beautiful but barren place. Different nations exist within and even though their cultures and ideals are polarized, they get along peacefully.
