Germindia is a cave like location stretching from the underground of Germany to India.
The only entrances are two active volcanoes in which the residents need specialized suits to enter and exit. Due to the extreme heat Germindia is a barren but beautiful place. Different nations exist within and even though the cultures and ideals are polarized, they get along peacefully.
