[b]Imperium Aeternum[/b]  
[i]&#147;Eternal is our will. Unyielding is our dominion.&#148;[/i]

Welcome to [b]Imperium Aeternum[/b] &#151; a region ruled by might, order, and discipline. Here, strength is virtue, loyalty is honor, and unity under firm rule leads to eternal glory. The weak serve, and the strong lead by force. Civil liberties are luxuries; efficiency, obedience, and power are necessities.

[b]Core Values: [/b]
- Authoritarian Governance  
- Militaristic Prowess  
- Economic Domination  
- Environmental Control

Nations with high political freedom will be expelled.

The Imperium does not negotiate with decay.
