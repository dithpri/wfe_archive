I am [b]thou[/b], thou art I... Thou hast acquired a [b]new[/b] vow.

It shall [b]become[/b] the wings of rebellion that [b]breaketh[/b] thy chains of captivity.

With the birth of the Castinia Persona, I have obtained the winds of [b]blessing[/b] that shall lead to freedom and [b]new[/b] power...

WELCOME TO THE CASTINIAN ALLIANCE! We are a semi-militaristic region with a small but friendly player base. We aim to unite nations, whether you&#39;re looking just to mess around or you want to hardcore role-play, do/say whatever you want as long as you&#39;re not toxic. I hope you will enjoy your stay. Glory to the Canstinians! Paratum Ad Proelium! Justice, Unity, Peace! Kuole Rotta Loria!
