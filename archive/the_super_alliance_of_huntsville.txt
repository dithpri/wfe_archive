[b][color=red]ATTENTION RAIDERS![/color][/b]

[b]This region, despite having an active founder, has grown tired of the same WFE and wants you to raid us.[/b] Feel free to enter! You can use this region for training, as a warzone with your rival, or just for the fun of raiding. My only request: do not ban any natives. Natives include Ihavanonokia, exotic lemur, nickelsburg, and killerpinkpanda. The founder will occasionally reset the factbook to normal and eject raiders, but you are welcome to come back.
