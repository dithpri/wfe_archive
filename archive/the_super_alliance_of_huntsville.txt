Hello and welcome to the region.

If you have any questions or concerns please report them to the prime minister. Any questions regarding officers, power, or the region should be asked to the founder. Also we do not currently have a WA Delegate, if you are interested please send the founder a message. If you know a friend or can convince someone trusted to join, please do so. Any complaints or concerns should be addressed to the Prime Minister, and check for polls every once in a while. The duties and responsibilities of the officers will be up soon. Also, Exotic Lemur and Nickelsburg are the same person. Finally, please read all of the dispatches, particularly if you desire to become an officer.
