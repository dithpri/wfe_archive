[color=#337B40][b]Welcome to the Kingdom of Yawgoog[/b]
[i]Bienvenue au Royaume de Yawgoog[/i][/color][hr][hr][color=#120065]The [b][region]Kingdom of Yawgoog[/region] (KOY)[/b] is a constitutional monarchy loosely based upon the real-life &quot;Camp Yawgoog&quot; in Rhode Island. Yawgoog is reigned over by [b]His Majesty [nation]Megedagik[/nation], King of the Yawgoogians[/b], although the monarch is a largely ceremonial figurehead; most power is held by the regional Prime Minister. The KOY prides itself on a vibrant regional culture that blends Native American and European (primarily French) culture into a mix that is uniquely Yawgoogian, as well as its active off-site community on Discord.
