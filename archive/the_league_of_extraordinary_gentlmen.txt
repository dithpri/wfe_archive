This is an organization for the classiest of world leaders, like those who never have a meal without paying at least $10,000 on wine, or never end an evening without a glass of scotch and a cigar. Nations large or small are welcome. So long as there are no mistempered quarries within the league, all nations here shall prosper. Should you cause fights among ourselves, your membership to the league shall pay as forfeit for the peace.
