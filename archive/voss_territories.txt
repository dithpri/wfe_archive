This is a region of great political division. Each &quot;nation&quot; within this region is led by politicians (usually) who have a very strict and often very radical political agenda. From Republicans to Democrats, from fascist to hippies, from no authority to an authority that is attempting to make its citizens as homogeneous as possible, everything is here. Feel free to travel here as a citizen but NO other government may establish authority within the region. If you&#39;d like to talk immigration, please speak to a representative of Radical Conservatism. Thank you.
