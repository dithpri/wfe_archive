Martha&#39;s Vineyard, a Massachusetts island, sits in the Atlantic just south of Cape Cod. A longtime New England summer colony, it encompasses harbor towns and lighthouses, sandy beaches and farmland. It&#39;s accessible only by boat or air. Vineyard Haven, on the eastern end, is a ferry port and the island&#39;s commercial center. Oak Bluffs has Carpenter Gothic cottages and an iconic carousel.
