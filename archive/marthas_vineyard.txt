Welcome to sparkling Martha&#39;s Vineyard, where the sun meets the sand! Hobnob on our white sandy beaches with John F. Kennedy, or attend one of our lavish galas with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis! 

Or if that doesn&#39;t float your boat, how about visit one of our many antique shops. Or pick fresh flowers for your significant other at our floral shops.

And then there&#39;s the shopping! You can try right here in Hyannisport, or try Dennis. 

History buff? Why not try the Naval Museum at Wood&#39;s Hole? Don&#39;t get nipped by one of those toothy Great White sharks, now!

In short, there&#39;s something here for every one. We&#39;re a non-ideological region, so every one is welcome to do their thing!

Ta!
