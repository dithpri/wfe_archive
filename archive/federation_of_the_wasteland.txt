The Federation of the Wasteland was founded in 2299 by Vault 29 to unify settlements and vaults in a mutual defense pact against raiders and other hostiles from the Wasteland. Note, this is set in the Fallout Universe, and we only take in Fallout themed nations / settlements. If you wish to join, send me, Vault 29, a telegram.
