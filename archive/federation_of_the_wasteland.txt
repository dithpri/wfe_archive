The Federation of the Wasteland was founded in 2299 by [nation]Vault 29[/nation] to create what was essentially a New United Nations. Note, this is set in the Fallout Universe, and we only take in Fallout themed nations / settlements. If you wish to join, send me, [nation]Vault 29[/nation], a telegram. Also ignore that Tag that says &quot;founderless&quot;. I just ceased to exist for a while... unless I have ceased to exist, then don&#39;t ignore that.
