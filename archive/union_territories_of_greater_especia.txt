In 2016, some breakaway states of the former Especian Empire moved towards peace in the Especian subcontinent, with the signing of the The Doctrine of Peace. A number of nations have added their name to the treaty, consisting of varying government types. While these countries do not always agree, they never engage in any type of conflict. This doctrine forms the Union Territories of Greater Especia, with a goal in mind simply to ease tension in the subcontinent, increase communication and understanding, and maybe one day, unite the people of Especia once more, but under a new, less oppressive government. Any other countries of the subcontinent are welcome to add their name to the treaty.
