[b]Welcome to the Union Territories of Greater Especia[/b]
[hr]
Founded in year 2016 after tensions were getting too high between the many breakaway states of the former Especian Empire. On the verge of conflict, some of these states decided to band together in the name of peace. Member nations do not always agree, and have vastly different ideologies, but they&#39;ve all sworn to maintain peace in the Especian continent. Any nations in the continent that have previously declined to join the Union are welcome to join at any time they wish. The official currency is the Especian Real, but member nations are not required to adopt.
