[b][color=mediumseagreen]Tarandus[/color][/b] is a distant continent, far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western NationStates universe. Dense mists shroud the snow-capped mountain peaks while haze hides arid southern landscapes, all distant beyond an expansive and long coastline interrupted by numerous bays and peninsulas. Named after the herds of deer and caribou that transverse the continent, Tarandus is a welcoming refuge for the nations and people who call it home.

Tarandus is a casual RP region. The region is geared towards nations that mostly want some neighbours for the sake of nation-building. Nations must formally apply to the region for a place on the map.
