It&#39;s cold outside
There&#39;s no kind of atmosphere
I&#39;m all alone, more or less
Let me fly far away from here
Fun Fun Fun, in the Sun Sun Sun
I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose
Drinking fresh mango juice
Gold fish shoals
Nibbling at my toes
Fun Fun Fun in the Sun Sun Sun
Fun Fun Fun in the Sun Sun Sun
