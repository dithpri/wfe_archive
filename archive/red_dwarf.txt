It&#39;s cold outside
Theres no kind of atmosphere
I&#39;m all alone, more or less
Let me fly far away from here
Fun Fun Fun, in the Sun Sun Sun
I want to lie, Shipwrecked in-comatose
Drinking fresh mango juice
Gold fish shoals
Nibbling at my toes
Fun Fun Fun in the Sun Sun Sun
Fun Fun Fun in the Sun Sun Sun
