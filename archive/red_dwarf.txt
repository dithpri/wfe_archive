[color=red][b][i]Welcome to the Jupiter Mining Corporation Ship[/i] Red Dwarf.[i] Please endorse Supreme Arch-Admiral [nation]Arnold J Rimmer[/nation].[/i][/b][/color]

Red Dwarf is a small (indeed, [i]very[/i] small) region committed mainly to [b]issue play[/b]. Don&#39;t have the time or interest to get invested in raiding or defending, or even lifting a finger to deal with things like &quot;regional government&quot;? This is the place for you! Our RMB is open to discussion about how to get your nation where you want it, whether you want to build a utopia or lord over your citizens.

Our other interest is the [b]World Assembly[/b], where we seek to protect human rights, support international cooperation efforts, and in general not do what NatSovs are promoting. At least, &quot;we&quot; would if this region had more than one nation. Mhm.
