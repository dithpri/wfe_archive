The Theodorian Archipelago was discovered by the British explorer and naturalist &quot;Sir Theodore Blackwood&quot; in the late 18th century, the Islands were quickly turned into a colony. The British colony of the Theodorian Archipelago didn&#39;t last long as the rebellious native population and the low importance of the islands got the British to leave the Islands and let the natives run for themselves. The Archipelago fell into a power vacuum which paved the way for brutal kings and dictators. This all changed during the great revolution that led to people led governments. After years of diplomatic and militaristic missions the isles agreed on a Mutual co-orporation.
