[i]A soft paw padding sound is heard, then a pounce! The squeak of a mouse is cut short.[/i]

Cats from [region]Elmos Small World[/region] were chasing mice, and the mice came right into this region!
The mice came to nibble on some hard cheese that this region had embassies with.
While they nibbled on the cheese, the cats pounced and caught them. Seems they caught the region as well.
[region]Elmos Small World[/region]will eat well tonight, that [region]hard cheese[/region] is quite delicious.
