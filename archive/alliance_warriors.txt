Following the model of A.B. Simpson to be warriors in Christ who focus upon the great commission. It is our goal to dedicate our lives through the regeneration of our souls to then follow the path of sanctification and be perseverant through death. The great commission(Matt 28:19-20) is the requirement of every evangelistic Christian who seeks to follow Christ after salvation. Be Unashamed! (Romans 1:16) God bless you and your endeavors.
