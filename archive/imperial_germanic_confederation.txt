[B]The Imperial Germanic Confederation[/B]

[i]&amp;quot;Gott mit uns&amp;quot;[/i]

Welcome to the Imperial Germanic Confederation! We are a region consisting of countries and provinces who are either under the rule of Confederate Germany or swear fealty to the Emperor. We are a federal monarchy, so those who are not provinces may run their own government as they so please (Provided they stay loyal to the Emperor as mentioned earlier). We are always looking for new people to join us.
