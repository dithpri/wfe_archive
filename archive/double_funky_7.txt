Associate puppet regions: [region=Ancient Lands], [region=Brazzaville] and [region=Ecuador].

[spoiler=ORACLE][url=http://nsdossier.texasregion.net/embassyOracle.aspx]Oracle Game[/url][/spoiler]

Goal of this version of the Oracle Game is to create a chain of links connecting as many regions as long as possible, with no short circuits.

[region=Double Funky 7] has [b]525[/b] degrees of separation to [region=Country of God]

This region has replaced [region=The Icelandic Commonwealth] as my lead Oracle region.
The Oracle Group of regions will soon be cut short as many nation based regions will be leaving the Oracle Game and start exchanging embassies with anyone so inclined to do so. Only regions named after the official nation name, and not the alternative nation name, or any colony, region or territory.[/color]

[color=red]SORRY, This region will not accept any embassy offers.[/color]
