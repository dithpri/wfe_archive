Real human being
And a real hero
Back against the wall at odds
With the strength of a militant cause
A pursuit some called outstanding
Or emotionally complex
Against the grain of distopic claims
On the thoughts your actions entertained
And you have proved to be
A real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being
A pilot on a cold, cold morn&#39;
One-hundred fifty-five people on board
All safe and all rescued
From the slowly sinking ship
Water warmer than, his head so cool
In that tight bind knew what to do 
And you have proved to be
A real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being
Real human being
