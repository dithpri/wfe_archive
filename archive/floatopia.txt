[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were looking across their calendar when they saw... an extra day? That&#39;s right! It&#39;s a leap day. It wasn&#39;t quite 8 days a week, but the Hawks were happy to use their extra day - which we get once every four years - to spread chaos and mayhem throughout NationStates... with a little help from our friends.
