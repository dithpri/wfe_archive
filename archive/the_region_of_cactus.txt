The Region of Cactus is a vast piece of land monitored by [color=green]Shrek, the Great Green One[/color]. After the fourth World War the entire world was transformed into a damp, lush, onion-scented swamp. The [color=green]GGO (Great Green One)[/color] made himself at home in this new environment. Through his successful campaigns (Shrek is Drek, Everything Will be Ogre), [color=green]Shrek[/color] was appointed as Supreme Ruler of the World. While he has no official political power, he is able to control any conflict by invading the homes of political leaders in the middle of the night and filling them with his sweet green onion juice. Their true layers will show after this life changing experience.
