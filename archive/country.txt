Countries exist, they come in all different shapes and sizes, some with mountains of people and some with little populations, some incredibly rich beyond the stars, and some stuck decades behind other countries.

Some have great economies, some are barely staying afloat.

What country do you embody? Do you feel like it defines you?

Nothing lasts forever, and countries will always change.
