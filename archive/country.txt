[b]A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity. It is often referred to as the land of an individual&#39;s birth, residence or citizenship.
A country may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. It is not inherently sovereign.[/b]
