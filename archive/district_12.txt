Following insidious effort by traitorous rebels to disrupt the Quarter Quell, Peacekeepers were forced to act to protect themselves and civilians from extremists acting within District 12. Sadly, these elements started a fire in an attempt to cover their retreat - a fire that soon sped throughout the entire coal-soaked District. Our Peacekeepers were able to extract themselves and a number of loyal citizens, who will be given refuge in the Capitol until our Peacekeepers secure District 12 - ensuring no element of those separatists remains.
