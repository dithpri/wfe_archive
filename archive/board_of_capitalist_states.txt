Welcome to the Board of Capitalist States!

The Board of Capitalist States is an international organization that promotes national sovereignty, free market economies, and limited government. 

The BCS is anti-globalism and, therefore, anti-World Assembly. Any and all agents of the WA will not be recognized by the BCS or it member states. 

If you support liberty and the free market, then this is the region for you. Feel free to post political discussion!
