A collection of large islands, Aldberia contains many tall forests, with small patches of grassland along the oceans and major rivers. Young, Tall mountain ranges run down the center of Aldberia&#39;s central Islands, Aldelmari, Airmanagild, and Fridwald, connecting with the many other islands of Aldberia to form a large, calm sea.
