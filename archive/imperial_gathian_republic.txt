The Imperial Gathian Republic was once a breakaway region from [region=Gath] founded by Emperor Hades of Gath, to rebel against Anzia. Notable Members of this rebellion include Hades, Altanea, and Wutaco. It eventually became one with Gath once more upon securing that region, and now stands as a monument to eras past and the people that made them.

Those interested in becoming Gathians and those old-time Gathians looking to return home should go to [region=Gath].
