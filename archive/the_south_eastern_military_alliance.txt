My little bro! He hacked into The Black Hawks as the Spam Master and spammed up the whole forum.  It was excellent! Now their forum is on lock-down so we slowed down all progress that they were making. He doesn&amp;#39;t even have a nationstates account. O how I want to see their faces now. It was excellent he even advertised becoming a spammer too. Hopefuly more people will come into are happy family because of him.
Who will be the next Member of the Week?
