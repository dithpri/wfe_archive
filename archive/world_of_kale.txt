Yes, this is TWGP Region #3. Whatever Caleonia says goes (trust me this won&#146;t be corrupt) and it must be followed. [b]No exceptions.[/b]

[b]Rules[/b]
&deg;No Superweapons
&deg;No Godmodding
&deg;No Metagaming
&deg;No WMDs (Unless a vote is passed or to stop a tyrant)
&deg;No Racism or Threats (No threating to kill someone or telling people to kill themselves.)
&deg;No Revealing IRL Identities  
&deg;Be Respectful
&deg;No arguing about borders in general chat. Discuss that with Caleonia in a Telegram.
&deg;No magical properties. This is 2090, not 1453.
&deg;The rule above does not apply to bio-weapons that cannot kill nor improve someone in the slightest.
