A small region devoted to the ideals of autocratic states and dictatorships, The Union of Autocratic States favours those nations who align with autocracy. This union-ship does not interfere with the internal affairs of its members, rather, the Union of Autocratic States aims to be the sole representative of autocratic governments and an influential body within the World Assembly.

The Union of Autocratic Nations commits to provide and uphold security, freedom, order, justice and welfare for all of its members and aims at putting the interests of autocratic nations ahead of others within the World Assembly.
