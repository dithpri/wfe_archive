Prairia was first inhabited by various indigenous tribes, who lived in harmony with the vast grasslands and rolling hills of the region. These tribes hunted buffalo, farmed the fertile soil, and traded with one another. In the 17th century, European explorers arrived in Prairia, and soon after, settlers began to arrive as well. The settlers brought with them new technology and ideas, which dramatically changed the landscape of Prairia.
