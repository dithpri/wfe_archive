A peninsula in east Asia dominated by authoritarian regimes. The peninsula is known for the atrocious People&#146;s Republic of Taosun, and for the yearly spectacle of gymnastics and propaganda that the regime hosts known as the &#147;Yosan Mass Games&#148;. This is where the peninsula gets most of its tourism. Don&#146;t go if you&#146;re American.
