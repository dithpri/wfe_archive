We are a region founded on the principles of freedom and clarity. 

Freedom: I welcome entrance and the potential to develop a successful region, but respect your country&amp;#39;s right to sovereignty. Therefor interaction will be as much or as little as you like. 

Clarity: I swear to be clear in all dealings and information.

It is my goal to form a region in which you are truly free to govern and collaborate. If this intrigues you at any level feel free to wire me any questions, comments.
