We are a region founded on the principles of freedom and clarity. 

The Region of Incorporated Countries welcomes you join. The purpose of this region is to establish connexions with other nations for mutual benefit. In so doing we will respect the sovereignty of your nation leaving the option of interaction up to you. 

There is no requirement relating to World Assembly status. At the moment there is no W.A. delegate, however the option is always open. Said delegate will be openly elected and expected to vacate office if voted out.  

It is my goal to form a region in which you are truly free to govern and collaborate. If this intrigues you at any level feel free to wire the region or Parliamentary Republic 4077 any questions, comments.
