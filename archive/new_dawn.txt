The world is divided by an endless conflict between different ideologies, between [b][u]civilization and barbarianism[/u][/b]. Borders separate the interregional community into &#39;regions&#39; that adopt sovereignist doctrines but fail to understand the importance of cooperation; all wars are caused by division and lack of unity. 

It is a Conventist&#39;s mission to spread the light of culture and expose vice; all Conventists should seek unification under one Conventium and banner in a world for good people free of indifference, instability and conflict, a world without treason and corruption, without the Parenthilus syndrome: [b][u]Eternal Concorporatia[/u][/b].


Victory and loss are both temporary; only the [u][b]goal is eternal[/b][/u].
