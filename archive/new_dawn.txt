[b]Welcome to New Dawn[/b]

[b]All are welcome here, whether you are a conservative, liberal, libertarian or anywhere in between, there is a place here for you. 

Our goal is simple, to put aside our differences that divide us and unite to form One government, One voice, One unified mind to help better ourselves and each other. 

All nations are equal here. We strive for peace and prosperity for all. All ideals and beliefs are accepted without question. There are only two rules to follow.[/b]                                                                                                                  

[b]1. Treat others the way you want to be treated. 2. Respect your fellow man.[/b]

[b]If enough people join, we can create a government that everyone can participate in![/b]
