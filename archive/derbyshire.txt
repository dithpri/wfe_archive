Derbyshire is a county in the&nbsp;East Midlands&nbsp;of England. A substantial portion of the&nbsp;Peak District National Park&nbsp;lies within Derbyshire. The southern extremity of thePennine range&nbsp;of hills extends into the north of the county.&nbsp;

The area that is now Derbyshire was first visited, probably briefly, by humans 200,000 years ago during the Aveleyinterglacial. Further occupation came with the&nbsp;Upper Paleolithic&nbsp;and&nbsp;Neolithic&nbsp;periods of the Stone Age when&nbsp;Mesolithic&nbsp;hunter gatherers roamed the hilly tundra.&nbsp;The evidence of these nomadic tribes is centred around&nbsp;limestone&nbsp;caves located on the Nottinghamshire border. Deposits left in the caves date the occupancy at around 12,000 to 7,000&nbsp;BCE.
