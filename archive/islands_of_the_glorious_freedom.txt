 [color=green]We are the remnants[/color] of [color=purple]The Emirates of Teaurnian States[/color] and the Promised Land for the [color=green]Survivors of The Great War[/color]. We enjoy lattes. That&amp;#39;s what we enjoy. Come to think of it, we enjoy [color=blue]lemons, cake and lattes[/color]. Now you&amp;#39;re talking. Lattes, Lemons and Cake. Anyway, besides our regional policies on cake, lemons and lattes for dinner every night, you can whatever the heck you want here, just don&amp;#39;t do what you were planning to do. Do something different. Because what you were going to do was boring and you probably would have [color=red]gotten banned[/color] for it. [b]Seriously[/b]. If you need to know the rules, please telegram [nation]Dvinglus[/nation].
