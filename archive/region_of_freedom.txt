We here in the Region of Freedom only allow the freest of free. We aren&#39;t scared to do what is necessary to get our freedom. Even if that means removing the freedom of other countries not in our region. Including to our freedom, all member nations must accept the rule that their borders are open. One reason for this is so our citizens and leaders can chat. One popular place that citizens and leaders like to meet is on our discord (https://discord.gg/zZ5NkGV). It isn&#39;t required to join it but it is recommended or something.
