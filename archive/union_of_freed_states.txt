The [color=blue][b]Union of Freed States[/b][/color] is a small collection of independent nations who have decided to band together for mutual cooperation.

We believe that every person should be free to make their own decision.

There are bi-weekly elections to determine the [b]Delegate at Large[/b] who will use their power to enact the will of the member nations.

Issues brought forward by proposal will be voted on my all members.
