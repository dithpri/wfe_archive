Lethe is the Greek spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion. She was often associated with the eponymous underworld river.
Also known as the Ameles potamos (river of unmindfulness), the Lethe flowed around the cave of Hypnos and through the Underworld, where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness. Here, Lethe allows drinkers to forget their past and bathe in its shallow waters, forever freed from the burden of conscience.
