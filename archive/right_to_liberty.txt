[region]Right to Liberty[/region] is a community dedicated to the preservation of human rights. Specifically, we believe in the inviolability of the physical body; an individual&#39;s right to personal autonomy and self-determination must be upheld where possible. We strongly feel that it is unethical to deny human beings any measure of control over their own bodies which does not threaten that of others.
