The United States of America is one of the most powerful countries in the World, and so naturally, it&#39;s empire is too.

However, it&#39;s empire is not like the others, for the states that are part of it are completely autonomous.

All countries that are a part of it are completely autonomous with access to the USD and the US Army (although they&#39;re both optional). How, Congress is allowed to pass legislation for any and all countries, which they can challenge.

It&#39;s the free-est most autonomous empire in the World.
