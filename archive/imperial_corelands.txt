The Imperial Core of the Delta Alignment. This area is cold and rainy with little sun in the summer, leading to a dreary atmosphere all year round. Many other empires and the such are likely to be in the Corelands, taking influence from their neighbours.
The Corelands are home to a mutual and relative peace as most people in the lands will be either bound to pacts of non-aggression or allies.
To the Officers of the Corelands one thing is certain - strength and superiority over all!
There will be one king - forever ruling.
