The Court of Rand is the sole executive authority over the isle of Caspos, a landmass surrounded by (see Metacaspos) an ocean called the Depths of Rand. 
There are a variety of nations which inhabit Caspos, however all have been united over the aforementioned Court of Rand, a large authority led by the strange nation of Gran Caspia.

To be a member, all nations within the Court must hold loyalty to Gran Caspia, with most nations having to pay tribute and some becoming a near-complete vassal for Caspia. Though plenty of members enjoy autonomy, most are still referred to as &#39;vassals&#39;.
