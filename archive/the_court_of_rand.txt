The Court of Rand is the sole executive authority over the isle/continent of Caspos, a gigantic landmass completely surrounded by a cold, saltwater ocean called the Depths of Rand. 

There are a variety of nations which inhabit Caspos, however all have been united over the so-called &quot;Court of Rand&quot;, a large authority led by the strange nation of Gran Caspia, which holds sole control of the complete center of Caspos.

All nations within the Court, meaning all nations of Caspos, also must hold loyalty to Gran Caspia, with most nations having to pay tribute and some becoming a near-complete vassal for Caspia.
