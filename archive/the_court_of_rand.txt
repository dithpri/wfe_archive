[region]The Court of Rand[/region] is the sole executive authority over the isle of Caspos, a landmass surrounded by (see Metacaspos) an ocean called the Depths of Rand. 
There are a variety of nations which inhabit Caspos, however all have (always?) been united under the Court, a large federation led by the Solar Regent, currently [nation]Gran Caspia[/nation].

To be a member, all nations within the Court must hold some degree of fealty to the Regent. The more disorderly ones might have to pay tribute, and a few have been known to become vassals of the Regent. 

However for most, [i][b]a great degree of autonomy[/b][/i] is enjoyed and expressed as they navigate the mysteries of Caspos.
