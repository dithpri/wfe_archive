The largest of the Macedonian successor states that emerged after the death of Alexander the Great. It was created by Seleukos Nikator, from his satrapy of Babylonia, incorporating the infrastructure of the preceding Persian Empire.

Today, the descendants of the Seleucid Syrians are the Antiochan Greeks, the Levantine Roum.
