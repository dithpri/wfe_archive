The Kingdom of Crowns is a region set in Medieval times. It will NOT be grounded completely in historical fact. That being said, there will also be NO fantasy elements within the region.As TKC is a new region, obviously there will be many changes as the region comes together and nations join. Bare with me during this process and i will endeavor to make the region one where all who join have a great experience.
