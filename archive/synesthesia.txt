The word [u][i]synesthesia[/i][/u] usually refers to a psychological or neurological condition in which sensory stimulus from one sense generates a response from another sense. 
This can include seeing a particular color associated with a number, having a sound provoke a tactile sensation, or experiencing a smell or a taste that also manifests itself visually.  

[i]They who have put out the people&amp;#39;s eyes reproach them of their blindness.[/i]
-John Milton
