The word [u][i]synesthesia[/i][/u] usually refers to a psychological or neurological condition in which sensory stimulus from one sense generates a response from another sense. 
This can include seeing a particular color associated with a number, having a sound provoke a tactile sensation, or experiencing a smell or taste that also manifests itself visually.  

This term is also frequently used in describing a certain type of figurative language often used in poetry.
