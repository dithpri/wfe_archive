The Neo-Crusader States are a small collection of nations still ruled by Catholic dictum and dogma, serving as voices for the devout sections of the world. The states themselves do not actively engage in &#39;crusades&#39;; the name is simply an homage to the once mighty Crusader Kingdoms. Whilst each nation is still ruled by their respective leaders, the Crusader States themselves are ruled (ceremoniously) by the Holy See, as well as the Crown of Karthu.
