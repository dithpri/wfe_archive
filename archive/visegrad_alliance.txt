  Men women and children shall labour under the watchful eye of the government they must work day and night in the factories and on the fields, their hard work will help the motherland prosper and ensure that the dictatorship and it&#39;s ideology survive for another generation. If you do not do the back breaking work than you will be killed the secret police will find you and end your life. You must forever serve the dictatorship with all of your loyalty and dedication or else...

Life may be hard but at least the government will be there for you when the capitalists invade.

Long live The Visegrade Alliance and it&#39;s glorious leader Velke Trencin!

May communism continue into the ages!
