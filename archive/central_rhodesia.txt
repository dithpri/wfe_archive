Honestly, I had to Google Rhodesia and boy, was I in for a surprise. I had no idea that Rhodesia was an apartheid state in southern Africa that modern white supremacists, including Dylann Roof, idolize. You did though&#133;because your flag is of the Rhodesian Foreign Legion, an all-white pro-government unit in the actual Rhodesian army. So that begs the question&#133;what&#146;s your deal?

I usually leave a link to our regional forums here but stuff got dark here pretty quick. I think we&#146;re just gonna&#146; go.[/b]
