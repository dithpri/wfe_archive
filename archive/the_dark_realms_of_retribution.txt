We of all the world&amp;#39;s realms, shall assign justice and vengeance upon our foes. Banished and rejected from our own homeland, we stand alone, seeking the bitter sweet taste of our enemies blood flowing over the battle fields. 
Dismissed from services we return during the realms darkest hour to follow the path of retribution, allowing the spirit of vengeance to take its toll on those that would do the world harm. We will die by retribution.

Those that oppose &amp;#39;The Dark Realms Of Retribution&amp;#39; will perish before our might! 




MODEDIT: How about we stop with the ducking of word censors and threatening other players?
