Strategists is a free realm, where all are aloud to join; whether they be typically hostile, or friendly nations. As the founder, I will hold complete control of the region, unless this regions expands. If it expands to a large enough point, I will open control up a little. I hope you enjoy your stay her, in Strategists.
