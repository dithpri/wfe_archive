[hr]Captured: 6/15/21

[hr]I was looking at [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=region_history/region=nihon]Nihon&#39;s History Page[/url] to see what kind of special treasures I&#39;ll unfold. Well I found this land looking up with me with y&#39;know satisfaction telling me to take this land so I did. That&#39;s not even the best part. The best part is when I tell the  [i][u]history[/u][/i] of the region. Well you see this region was clearly glorifying Stalin, Lenin, Bolsheviks in general, but this region was also property of [region]The Kingdom of Great Britain[/region], [region]the West Pacific[/region], [region]KAISERREICH[/region], and [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. So this is like a capture of a region to the [b][u]5th degree[/u][/b], and now I own it.
