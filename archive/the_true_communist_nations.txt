We are the true Communist nations, join us or be destroyed.  
Stalin is my waifu, Lenin is my god.
No capitalist pigs allowed. 


Our national animal is the Stallion.
Our motto is &quot;Give me fresh berry pie or give me death!&quot; 
National Anthem: Plink Plank Plunk played by Kiriku, Japanese hand bell ensemble, the finest hand bell ensemble in the world.
