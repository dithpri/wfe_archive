[color=blue]The [b]Alliance of the Lock[/b] is a pro-defender organization dedicated to protecting vulnerable NS regions across the multiverse. We practice a tactic called &quot;locking&quot;, which is essentially assisting a native member of a region who has a sufficient amount of influence in accessing their regional controls and passwording their region to prevent invaders from ever destroying their region for absolutely nothing paid to us from them.
[i]For information contact Director [nation=noflag]Thunderwave Cave[/nation]. If we think your region is vulnerable we may reach out to you.[/i][/color]
