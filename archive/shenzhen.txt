[b]Shenzhen[/b] is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. It forms part of the Pearl River Delta megalopolis north of Hong Kong. It holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province.

Shenzhen&#39;s registered population as of 2017 was estimated at 12,905,000; however, the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee estimates that the population of Shenzhen is about 20 million, due to the large unregistered floating migrant population living in the city. Shenzhen was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world in the 1990s and the 2000s and has been ranked second on the list of top 10 cities to visit in 2019. -Wikipedia[hr]
