[b][u]Mission Statement[/b][/u]

The human species has been gifted with exceptional intelligence and abilities.

The humans have utilized this gift to deliberately maximize unnecessary suffering, cruelty, and misery to an overwhelming degree; propagating and prioritizing war, terrorism, oppression, conformity, prohibition, corruption, injustice, poverty, exploitation, slavery, superstition, intolerance, supremacism, discrimination, rape, murder, genocide, environmental destruction, and every other expression and force of malevolence without limit or shame.

For the survival and basic well-being of all other species, the human race, wholly defined by its systemic sadomasochism, must be absolutely and irrevocably eradicated from the universe.
