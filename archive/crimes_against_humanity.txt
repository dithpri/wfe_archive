The human species has been gifted with exceptional intelligence and abilities.

The humans have utilized this gift to maximize unnecessary suffering, cruelty, and misery to an overwhelming degree; propagating and prioritizing war, terrorism, oppression, conformity, injustice, poverty, exploitation, slavery, superstition, intolerance, discrimination, rape, murder, genocide, environmental destruction, and every other expression of pure malevolence without limit or shame.

The human species, defined by its sadomasochism, under no circumstances, deserves to continue existing. 

For the survival and basic well-being of other species, the human race must be absolutely and irrevocably eradicated from the universe.

No mercy for the disease of humanity.
