The human species has been gifted with exceptional intelligence and abilities.

The humans have utilized this gift to maximize unnecessary suffering, cruelty, and misery to an overwhelming degree; propagating and prioritizing war, terrorism, oppression, conformity, prohibition, corruption, injustice, poverty, exploitation, slavery, superstition, intolerance, discrimination, rape, murder, genocide, environmental destruction, and every other expression of malevolence without limit or shame.

For the survival and basic well-being of all other species, the human race, wholly defined by its sadomasochism, must be absolutely and irrevocably eradicated from the universe.

No mercy for the disease of humanity. You can&#39;t cure what&#39;s rotten to the core.
