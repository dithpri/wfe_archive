[b][color=black]This region&amp;#39;s original WFE read as such: 

[i]&amp;quot;In response to The Union of Nations Against Fascism, i [nation=short]Aalderbaran[/nation] have created the NFUN, a region dedicated to liberating lost fascists holds, and bringing a new era of prosperity. Heil der Reich.[/i]

And so, on the 16th June 2012, the following comrades dispatched this Fash region permanently, bringing its &amp;#39;Era of prosperity&amp;#39; to an abrupt end:

[*]Generalissimo [nation]The Fascist-Free Lands[/nation]
[*]Sergeant [nation]Communist Quinntopia[/nation].
