The Pacific
Most of the ocean is water, but once you look around, you start to see islands, Polynesians colonized these islands many millennium ago, then the Europeans came, divided the islands, and eventually left them.
While Currently Being a Small Alliance only consisting of 10 nations, Kanaka Maol hopes the Alliance will expand, and be something of a NATO and EU mix in the Pacific, functioning as a Military Pact, And a Economic Treaty.

The Pacific Alliance Currently spans all around the pacific, From The South American Coast, All the way to The northern Russia coast, and down to Australia, the Alliance is currently not seen as that powerful but Kanaka Maol is sure that will change in the future.
