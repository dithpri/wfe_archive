Welcome to the [b] Empire of Tamriel! [/b] As a small region, each nation within Tamriel will have a chance to prosper and make decisions affecting the whole region. 

Each nation in The Empire of Tamriel is a member of the Elder Council, and as such decisions are made directly by the nations. The Emperor (aka Delegate) can make no decisions without the backing of the Elder Council.

Roleplaying is encouraged, but not required!

We accept all nations, although those based on The Elder Scrolls are the main focus.
