The Nations of Kazano have a common heritage, being stuck with each other on the same continent whether they like it or not, and thus have (perhaps resignedly) pooled resources and military might for the benefit of all member nations. There are many transnational events and interactions, including but not limited to: cultural events such as festivals and tours, economic and research agreements, and an assembly in which member states vote on regional issues.
