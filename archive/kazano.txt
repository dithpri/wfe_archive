The Nations of Kazano share a common heritage, being stuck with each other in the same (general) corner of the planet whether they like it or not, and over time have (perhaps resignedly) began multilateral development throughout all member nations after a history of near-constant war, finally resolving in peace, albeit a hesitant one. There are many transnational events and interactions, including but not limited to: cultural events such as festivals and tours, economic and research agreements, and an assembly in which member states vote on regional issues.
