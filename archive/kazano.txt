The Nations of Kazano have a common heritage, being stuck with each other on the same planet whether they like it or not, and over time have (perhaps resignedly) began multilateral development throughout all member nations, albeit a hesitant peace. There are many transnational events and interactions, including but not limited to: cultural events such as festivals and tours, economic and research agreements, and an assembly in which member states vote on regional issues.
