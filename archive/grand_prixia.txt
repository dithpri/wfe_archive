Welcome to [b][color=red]Grand Prixia[/color][/b], a region of [b]28 nations[/b] who&amp;#39;s leader&amp;#39;s spend most of their time grueling over how to make a formula one team run faster. These leaders sometimes take a spare minute of their precious time to handle the trivial matters of determining stances on issues within their nations. We have a wide variety of nations; capitalist nations, communist nations, democracy nations. We don&amp;#39;t care wether you are a communist or a republican, as long as you love racing!
