Relicum, Latin for &#39;future&#39;. My nations animal? Turritopsis dohrni (Immortal Jellyfish). The Relicum Region is about looking forward, not disregarding the past, but adapting and evolving to become the best. Much like the Turritopsis dohrni, we will never die out:only be reborn and start afresh with the experiences we have encountered. Relicum is about doing what&#39;s right, for the population and as a region globally. Democratically creating the best, moving forward into the future. Like what you hear? Join us and become part of the movement towards the future.
