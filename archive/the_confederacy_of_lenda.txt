&quot;To code, or not to code&quot;
-Lenda

We are a region committed to everything Arduino, engineering, bagels, and to having a few laughs on the way. But seriously, all joking aside, we are an extremely oppressive and dictorial region that doesn&#39;t put up with anything. Make no mistakes, feeble leaders, or the people will sweep this illusion right out from under you feet.




Have fun! :) &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3
