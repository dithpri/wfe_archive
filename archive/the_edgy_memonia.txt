After the co-founder nation Kvelikerino left us, I have decided to initiate a more organized system than before with officers, ranks and other things like that. You could say that I have assumed direct control which I more or less have. Our goals here at the Edgy Memonia is to hunt edges to stay as edgy as possible, while at the same time gaining minor superiority and get more recruits to expand more. Raise your flags comrades, we will expand sooner or later. Also, 21th of October shall be remembered as the Day of Direct Control, as it marks when the lead changed and that I instituted a more organized system for our glorious region.
