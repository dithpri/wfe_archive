From my perspective, the primary goals of NationStates are to entertain and to educate. When one or more of those goals is achieved in a content such as a forum post, all is well. However, content such as spam, messages along the lines of &quot;You&#39;re bad&quot; and &quot;Your country is bad&quot;, trolling, or flaming possesses neither of the goals. As such, it is against the purposes of the site and should be avoided. If someone posts content you find hateful, wrong, or morally reprehensible, then it is far better to calmly state why that is or to simply leave it to rot in the depths of the NationStates forums then to react violently and continue the cycle. Thank you.
