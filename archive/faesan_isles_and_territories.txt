The Faesan Isles consist of a large string of medium to small islands in a vast 3000 km wide Ocean.
The temperature year round is temperate and mild, this being an exception to tropical island chains, instead the islands are covered in pines as well as other temperate vegetation. The climate fluctuates inbetween copious amounts of fog or overwhelming rain.
