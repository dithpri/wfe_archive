The Buluin Allies is a system of Sultans, Dictators, and Monarchs who have complete control, but are mostly benevolent. We don&amp;#39;t participate in raids or other malevolent activities, instead counter-raiding and defending. The Delegate is General Pisces, who is also the leader of the Armed Republic of the Flying Fish. Former Sultan, Emperor, Imam, and Founder Azil Al-Makhmad has retired from those lower positions and has become the Caliph of The Faith. &amp;quot;He protects us, and will bring us to greatness as defenders of other regions. We will be victorious!&amp;quot; The flag is Eowyn defeating the Witch King, signifying our goal to stop the Black Riders- Permanently.
