In response to the region, [region]Kekistan[/region], which in fact was never taken over but simply was founded but never grew, other Kekistani regions with altered names grew, and Kekistan as a name just dissappated.

When you also realize that Kekistan is actually Democratic and encourages free speech while fascism is a complete opposite.
