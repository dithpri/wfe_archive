Enter. I am The Chapter, only a mere pawn of a higher organization (which I cannot tell you about unless we are very good friends), and I am here to aid Raider and War-like Nations and Regions. It is by the will of my Master that I do, and it&#39;s reason&#39;s are specified between it and I. Be warned that I am one of hundreds of my Master&#39;s minions, even your closest friend Nations and Regional leaders can be among them. For any other questions, ask me in a Telegram.
