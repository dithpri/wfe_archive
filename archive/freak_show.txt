[b][color=orange]Dare you enter the most grotesque region in NS? 

[region]FREAK SHOW[/region]&#153;

Roll up, roll up. One greasy dollar. Half Boys, Half Girls, Oddities, Freaks. The Earth&#39;s, probably the Universe&#39;s, Strangest Creatures from Nightmares and Frightening Fantasy. All together in one sideshow tent for the first time. 

Enter at your own risk, no refunds, no re-entry.[/color][hr]

[color=red]This region was saved by the s/heroes of [region]Gay[/region], [region]Gay Equality[/region], [region]Solid Kingdom[/region], and the Mysterious Defenders of [i]X[/i]. Thank you all.[/color]
