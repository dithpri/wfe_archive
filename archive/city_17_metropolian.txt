City 17 and the former country it is part of are impossible to pin down exactly due to contradictory information, not unlike Springfield in The Simpsons, although it is possible to limit the location somewhat. For example, City 17&amp;#39;s country is almost certainly one that uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which is often seen in the game; since, whereas the Latin alphabet is commonly seen in Cyrillic-using countries, the reverse is much rarer. Secondly, City 17&amp;#39;s country borders the sea. And in fact, there are only three countries that both use Cyrillic and are not landlocked: Russia, Ukraine, and Bulgaria.
