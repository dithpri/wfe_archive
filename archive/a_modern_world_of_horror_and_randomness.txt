This region is one set in a futuristic, fictional, parallel universe. Practically anything can happen. Aliens, meteorites, nuclear war, blackholes, super-duper nova, plagues, you name it. Hell can fall. The galaxy can be obliterated. That thing from Mortal Engines can happen. Anything. So join now.

No limits in tech, WA membership, types of play (Except raiding or Spam-fest), or anything else reasonable. Anyone&#39;s welcome who wants to hang out and not be a nuisance - using this region as a base to raid from is a nuisance. Just Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t do it. Raiders looking to mess the place up are also a nuisance. If you Raid or are annoying, prepare yourselves. You will be destroyed, ejected, then banned. In that order. Have Fun with That.
