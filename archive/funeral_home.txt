All nations that want to leave Nationstates can go here. This can be used to quit, or to dispose of puppets not needed anymore.

However, to have a grave, embassy nations are the only nations allowed to have more than a tombstone and a coffin (as in, a whole building dedicated to their grave.). The others have to pick between cremation and burial (or, for those with large economies and want to return one day, cryogenic freezing).
