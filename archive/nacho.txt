Greetings, we are [b][color=orange]NACHO[/color][/b], or the [b][color=orange]Nuclear Alliance for Coordinated Hostile Operations[/color][/b]! Our purpose is simple: to stand together in mutual defense, launch coordinated strikes against our foes, and ensure every member region enjoys the finest tactical coverage possible. 

We welcome all regions, large or small, who want to fight alongside allies, joke and trash-talk with friends, and melt enemy shields like so much cheese.
