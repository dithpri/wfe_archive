Hello! And Welcome to The International Kingdom! After a long time of hardship, and the region coming under occupation, I am happy to declare that TIK is now a free and independent region once more! 

The King has been removed from power, and whilst we remain a nominal Kingdom, the monarchy is purely ceremonial.  

Remember to endorse the delegate [nation=short]Juliejayne[/nation] and most important of all: Remember that your voice always counts!
