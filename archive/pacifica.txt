[b][color=0272ac]Pacifica[/color][/b] was a major region in 2018-2019, peaking at over 600 nations. The region closed in late 2019 and has been dormant for three months. On Christmas Day 2019 the Founder reversed the decision to close the region and reopened the region to the public. My goal is to have recruitment up and running by New Years. and to break 100 nations in January. 

There&#39;s going to be some changes this time around, so I&#39;ll let you know shortly.  Thank you all!
