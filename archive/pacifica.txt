Welcome to [b][color=022133]Pacifica[/color][/b]! Our region is home to the [b][color=066394]Republic[/color][/b] of [b][color=022133]Pacifica[/color][/b]. 

Our region is eternally at [b][color=a72133]war[/color][/b] with the New Pacific Order, the autocratic regime that has oppressed and impeded the Pacific for over a decade. The [b][color=066394]Republic[/color][/b] of [b][color=022133]Pacifica[/color][/b] is organized by [b][color=066394]freedom fighters[/color][/b] that will work to reduce the power and influence of the NPO in NationStates. We invite all [b][color=022133]Pacificans[/color][/b] and [b][color=066394]former Pacificans[/color][/b] to join our [b][color=a72133]resistance[/color][/b]. 

The [b][color=066394]Republic[/color][/b] is governed by an elected body of [b][color=022133]Senators[/color][/b] and a [b][color=066394]Chancellor[/color][/b] (executive, head of state) that is elected from all the citizens of [b][color=022133]Pacifica[/color][/b].

This region is not currently being developed. The Interim Chancellor is [nation=short]Weed[/nation]. [url=http://pacifica.forumotion.com/]Our forums[/url] will be expanded in the future. 

[b][i]Pacifica is Free!
The Republic is Rising![/i][/b]
