&laquo;&laquo;&laquo; [color=243e59][b]Pacifica[/b][/color] is [color=467f9c][b]Free[/b][/color], the [color=467f9c][b]Republic[/b][/color] is [color=243e59][b]Rising[/b][/color]! &raquo;&raquo;&raquo;

[color=243e59][b]Pacifica[/b][/color] was occupied by the disgraced raider organization DEN until April 2, 2016 when the former [color=467f9c][b]native[/b][/color] regained control. 

Before the region was lost, the vision for [color=243e59][b]Pacifica[/b][/color] was a [color=467f9c][b]democratic defender[/b][/color] region that stood for [color=467f9c][b]liberty[/b][/color] and [color=467f9c][b]justice[/b][/color]. 

Currently, I mainly hold [color=243e59][b]Pacifica[/b][/color] as a back-up region for [b][region]St Abbaddon[/region][/b]. In the event we should lose control of the region due to a raid, [color=243e59][b]Pacifica[/b][/color] would be utilized. 

Any future use of this region will be at the discretion of [nation=short]Topid[/nation].
