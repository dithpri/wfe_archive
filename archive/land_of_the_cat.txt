Welcome to the Land of the Cat!

Here we like to mess around and don&#39;t talk serious about many things, as to try to be a safe haven for people who are tired of all the issues of the multiverse and world and need a break from all of that. 

If you do wish to join, we&#39;d be honored to have you here! Discord or any other social app is not required to join, and we gladly accept nations that are kind! The only requirements to join are to not be racist, homophobic, antisemitic, or offensive in general.

If you happen to be in the WA, we would be very grateful if you support our delegate, [nation=long]Macedon Peoples[/nation]! WA membership is not required, though, nor is endorsement.
