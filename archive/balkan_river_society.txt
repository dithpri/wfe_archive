Much like the Romanian River society, we are attempting to unite the Danube river, with Bulgaria, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary and Czechia all helping. Tiranije and Tiranie are working together, for Tiranie to join the Balkan River Society. If they do, we would be so pleased, because they are saying they might not be joining. Tiranije will except anyone, anywhere, anytime into the BRS. Thank you for reading.
