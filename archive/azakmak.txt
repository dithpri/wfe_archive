Welcome to the ancient land of the Akulic and other peoples of the continent of Azkamak. The strongest people are the Amuilak, centered in the city of Tukarman. The Olmar to the Northeast threaten the peace of this realm. In the South the once powerful civilizations of Ayurm, Vurba, Kumalik, and Opilu once thrived but infight and are religiously fanatic backwaters. To the East is the trade based powers of the Ukamak confederacy, which is dangerous to the central civilization of Akuli. Located in the west is the Jukamar and its dozens of allied city states, which compete with multiple other confederations, the Hujam, Lokama, Cuvxar, and Burstati.
