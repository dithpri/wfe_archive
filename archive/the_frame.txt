The solar system known as &amp;quot;The Frame&amp;quot; by Shape Cod inhabitants is comprised of five planets, orbiting a young star, known as &amp;quot;The Orb&amp;quot;. The fourth planet from The Orb is the location of the Shape Cod homeworld. Colonization efforts are underway on the third planet, &amp;quot;New Shape Cod&amp;quot;, after Shape Cod military forces eliminated an indigenous, multi-colored, tribal, and savage race that had a cult-like belief in a non-existent, nature-loving, parental figure.
