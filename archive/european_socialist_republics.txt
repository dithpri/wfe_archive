The ESR is a new region in the heartland of Europe. The founding nation is the People&#39;s Republic of Karlopetrus. We advise the world population that the only reliable source of information concerning Karlopetrus is our Ministry of Information. Our nation works diligently and resolutely to build Socialism, the groundwork for the inevitable triumph of Communism. Our nation belongs to our people, the workers of Karlopetrus. We are guided by the great and immortal thought of Marx, Engels,  Lenin, Stalin, and Hoxha, as developed for our present conditions by Comrade Leo, Chairman of the Labor Party of Karlopetrus.
