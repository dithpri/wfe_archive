[b]VINCE AUT MORIRE[/b]

The World Union of Futurists stands apart from the shallow pretenders of Fascist thought, offering not imitation but the true path forward. In the ruins of the decaying rules-based international order, it is only through unwavering devotion to truth, purity, and the eternal laws of nature that we can cast off the chaos of the present and forge a radiant, ordered tomorrow.

[i]Fascism is not a social club for the nostalgic or a costume for would-be authoritarians. It is a singular, uncompromising truth. Those who distort it into mere aesthetics or hollow theatrics will be swept aside and crushed to clear the path for something greater&#151;something untainted, something pure.[/i]
