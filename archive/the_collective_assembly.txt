Good day to all; And welcome to another fine day in the Collective Assembly.  First some formalities, if you&amp;#39;re new and are a member of the World Assembly please endorse [nation=short]Rempalistan[/nation], our regional World Assembly Delegate.  Feel free to post stuff on the message board (please no profanities).

If you are not a member of the Collective Assembly, and are looking to possibly join, we are an extremely small region and your regional influence will skyrocket.  We are not hardcore Nation Statesers (is that a thing).  We don&amp;#39;t have our own websites or governance although we might start the second one if enough people join.

Sincerely,
Regional Founder,
[nation]Heckyessia[/nation]
