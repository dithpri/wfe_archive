8th of April, 2016 - It was discovered today by [nation]Gurifon[/nation] and [nation]Davis City Militia[/nation] that Syria possesses no valuable resources whatsoever. For the most part, not even the soil is fertile enough to grow crops, and therefor the CCR has no interest in annexing that region.
