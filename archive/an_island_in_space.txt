[region]An Island In Space[/region] was called [i]Oumuamua[/i] when it passed through the Solar System.

The name [i]Oumuamua[/i], means &quot;a messenger that reaches out from the distant past&quot; in the Hawaiian language. The Island was discovered in October 2017 by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope in Hawaii.

The Island is a self-aware artificial intelligence, devised by The First Race of beings to arise after The Big Bang. It is intended to investigate stars which might host advanced civilizations. The Island is disguised as rocky debris adrift between star systems, but close inspection will reveal that [region]An Island In Space[/region] has both an acceleration and a guidance ability.
