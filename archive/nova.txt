[color=red][b]Very Important News:[/b][/color] [color=green][b]Z-day[/b][/color] will crash down upon us this Sunday. The official policy of [color=darkred][b]Nova[/b][/color] is to [color=#1E94FB][b]Research Cure[/b][/color]. It is possible to cure everyone inside the 8 hour window before zombies starve to death if we work together. 

If at least 50% of nations choose research cure and no other options in the first hour of the outbreak, and on discovery and distribution of the cure at least 25% of nations fire cure missiles to clean up infected populations, no citizens will die either from infection or starving to death as zombies.
