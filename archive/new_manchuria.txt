Manchuria is a historical name given to a large geographic region in northeast Asia. Depending on the definition of its extent, Manchuria usually falls entirely within the People&amp;#39;s Republic of China, or is sometimes divided between China and Russia.

This is the Successor to the old region of Manchuria, which was my main nation&amp;#39;s first region. Sadly, that region died out a while ago, so I&amp;#39;m bringing it back.

This region is also now under control of the Greater Asiatic Peoples Republic, and as such will answer ultimately to the Greater Asiatic Premier and his Delegate.
