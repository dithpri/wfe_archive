[b]Anci3nt MAGA[/b] got overtaken and is now a region that strongly disagrees with the ideological legacy of President Donald Trump and the Make America Great Again philosophy. We steadfastly and unwaveringly support any protest against President Trump, while upholding MAGA as a natural continuation of what the Founding Fathers would have fought against.

We believe the MAGA-ideology to be stuck in prehistoric times, having lost any connection to the modern and real world - hence our name, Anci3nt MAGA. We use the actions of the Trump administration as our proof, showing that the Trump cronies have influenced the flow of history in an unskilled and unfavourable manner.
