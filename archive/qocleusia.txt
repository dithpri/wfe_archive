[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were on a mission. They were on their way to save a princess from a group of 3 mysterious men. As they were on their adventure, the Hawks in Black had to face each of them in unique battles. The first one was a sword fight with a man who very politely introduced himself. The second, a battle with a giant, and the third a battle of wits. The Hawks in Black were able to pass all the challenges and save the princess.
