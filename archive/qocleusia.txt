[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were chilling out in their nest, hangin&#146; out eating [colour=green]fruit salad[/colour] &#150; yummy yummy! They were going to all go out that day in their [colour=red]big red car[/colour] to travel near and far, but they realised that [colour=purple]Jakker[/colour] had fallen asleep! They started their trip, hoping that they could wake him up. Arriving in your region seemed to do the trick!
