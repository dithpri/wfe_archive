The [b][color=blue]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republic[/color] [color=Green]Navy[/color][/b] always has its eyes headed towards the Dawn, usually because that&#39;s where the good rum is. So when we saw a new dawn and a rising sun we had to head there. We&#39;ve come for your rum, your Szechuan Sauce, and any other alcoholic or delicious things we can find, so that we can take them back to [region]Europeia[/region] with us and party!
