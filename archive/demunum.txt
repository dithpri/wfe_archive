Demunum is a conjunction of the words in latin for democracy [i](democratia)[/i] , unity [i](unum)[/i] , and fun [i](fun)[/i]. This region is still in the works. We aim to provide a system of roleplay and government for nations. Feel free to join!

[u]Goals[/u]
1. If we can get 10 nations to join, we can start drafts of the regional constitution. 
2. If we can get 13 nations to join, we can start our first election (need to finish goal #2).
3. If we can get 20 nations to join, we can create an offsite forum.

[B]I&#39;ll now be taking ideas for our regional flag and coat of arms, it should be something to represent the regions ideals. TG me to submit your ideas. We&#39;ll be voting on them :)[/B]
