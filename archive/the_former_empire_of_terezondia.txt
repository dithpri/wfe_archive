This region is composed of the land that was previously the territory of the terrifying empire of Terezondia. Jingoistic, multicultural, and endlessly dissatisfied with what it had, Terezondia held a reign of terror over the continent for generations, before collapsing due to political instability (brought on by a succession crisis known to the Terezondians themselves as &#39;the Fraternal Tantrum&#39;) and sacking by various dissatisfied citizen nations. It is now home to states who vye for power and control, and others who try to survive against those that do. Only time will tell the future of this region.
