The UMWF is a political, military, trade, and if the individual empires so choose, economic alliance designed to offer protection and diplomatic communications via the differentiating species in our galaxy. The galaxy is a dangerous and foreign place, and we plan to change that.

Poltiical orientation: We understand that politics are very different and often tie into the biological nature of each species. Therefore, applicable political orientations range from: 
Personal Freedom: Medium to High 
Economic Freedom: All forms allowed
Political Freedom: Medium to High

Exceptions may be made for species that are designated as &#39;Hive Mind&#39; by the federation.
Keep tuned in as changes will occur often.
