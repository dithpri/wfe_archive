The Garden Castle is an ancient castle, now half in ruin, surrounded by a large garden that has long since gone wild.  This castle was the ancestral home of the Rose Family, who have long since vanished.  It is said however that the descendants of the famous Knight of Roses still guard this place, bound by the most ancient of oaths.
