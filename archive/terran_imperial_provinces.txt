Conquered by The Empire of Vulaxinora in the name of The Grand Alliance of Democratic Nations. Terran imperial Provinces first conquered The Grand Union of Democratic States, the region that Proreadem, Vulaxinora, and Adamantiland were setting up. After being pushed backed to The Grand Alliance, Vulaxinora decided to play the long con and wait until the region died. Even after Vulaxinora refounded the Union, the Allies decided to say in the Grand Alliance. The Union today is used as storage for extra nations.
