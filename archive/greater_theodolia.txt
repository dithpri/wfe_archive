[i][color=brown]A large desolate, barren, but resource rich continent with kilometers of flat arid land as well as rugged hills and mountains. Theodolia sits in the middle of a large ocean, isolated from the rest of the world. This remoteness has not stalled conflict, as the abundant mineral and fossil fuel resources have been a source of tension and hostility for decades. As such, the region is known for its gruff mercenaries, suspiciously wealthy persons, and world-class Gin.[/color][/i]
