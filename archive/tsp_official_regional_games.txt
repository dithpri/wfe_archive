I, Escade (aka The Hummingbird) will be your game host! Welcome you to the first inter-regional games in NationStates and are excited to see the best that NS has to offer!

Team Phoenix&amp;#39;s flag is flying in honor of their come from their surprising win of the games!  A dispatch with commentary and discussion of MVPs from all teams will be up this week!

I&amp;#39;d like to hug the 24 amazing players in the game! There are over 1000 messages in the team HQs and it was fun to watch you get to know each other and work with each other!  I hope, in the spirit of the games, that players will extend their friendships beyond regional borders!
