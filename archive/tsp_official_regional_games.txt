[b]Welcome to the South Pacific&amp;#39;s first official regional games![/b]

I will post new dates for the regional games once I have confirmed with Spiritus and TEP!

 TSPers will compete individually and in teams to test their endurance, creativity, cunning, and intellect! 

We welcome our friends from the regions of [],[], who will be competing with us.

*Please note nations not following the naming convention rules will be ejected!
