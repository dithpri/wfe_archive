[b]Welcome to the South Pacific&amp;#39;s first official inter-regional games![/b]

I, Escade (aka The Hummingbird) and Arbiter08 will be your game hosts and mods and welcome you to this breathtaking game that rivals the gladiator games!  We are joined by the best of the best from Spiritus, The East Pacific, The South Pacific, and members from a few other regions.

All players intending to participate must enter the region by April 22 so they may be divided into teams and given their first challenge!

Clock here to keep track of the time: {Link}

Players will compete in teams to test their endurance, creativity, cunning, and intellect!
