Players from Spiritus, The East Pacific, The South Pacific, and members from a few other regions will work together in teams to engage in inter-regional cooperation. The winning team will be rewarded with eternal fame and glory and a few perks!

The first challenge has begun and will come to a close on [b]April 24, 2014 at 12 noon EST[/b].  Teams are working on the challenges in their secret HQs!
