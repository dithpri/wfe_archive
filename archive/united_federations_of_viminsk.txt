[b]Member of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were sitting around in The Nest, when the newest LTN, Drexlore asked if they should take a drive to take in the fall colors before winter finally set in. He and a bunch of fellow Hawks went out for a drive, er, fly, to visit regions that still had trees with the pretty colors on them. It was a nice relaxing fly, and we suggest that you [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Come Join Us[/url] if you want to participate next time!
