Welcome to a new age, a new region and a new system of order. Yesterday&#39;s is gone, tomorrow is coming, today.... Well today we should be celebrating because we are able to take another step closer to victory. How will we be victorious you may ask, Our region is a small region but in time we will grow into an empire, we will change the world of how they observe us, we will over rule them and over throw anyone who stands in our way. One cannot achieve this goal on his own understanding, in that, I ask that we bind together as one and in hopes we will build our power, our strength and our resources to gain what we deserve.
