The world is a dangerous place. Terrorists, bandits and insane leaders threaten the lives and well-being of our citizens. In the recent past, wars and military intervention have become more common. The Iron Alliance was founded by several nations, standing together to defend our individual rights as one.

We have come to the decision that an act of war against one member state shall constitute an act of war against all. From unity comes strength and from strength comes security. The Iron Alliance offers a mutual defensive arrangement for nations that particularly value their sovereignty and governance, along with the possibility of economic and scientific cooperation.

We are unyielding. We are unbreakable. We are Iron![/color][hr]
