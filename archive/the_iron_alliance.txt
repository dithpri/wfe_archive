The world is a dangerous place. Terrorists, bandits and insane leaders threaten the lives and wellbeing of our citizens. In the recent past wars and military interventions have become more common. The Iron Alliance was founded by several nations which stood together to defend our individual rights as one. 

We have come to the decision that an act of war against one member state must be considered an act of war against all. From unity comes strength and from strength comes security. The Iron Alliance offers you the possibility to work with other nations on the fields of defense but it will also have a place for economic and scientific cooperation.
