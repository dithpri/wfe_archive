[color=blue][region]Adamenthia[/region] was created right after the Zombie Apocalypse of October 2015 by a group of like-minded individuals. Our founder [nation]Attonaria[/nation] sought to remove his allies from what he realized was a dangerous world, as well as give each of us a chance to enact change within the confines of our own political (and geographical) land-mass.[/color]
[color=gold]The political process within the region is largely democratic, where the majority of decisions are made through a council composed of all current members of it (excluding those owning multiple nations).
In the end we all have our history, and together we hope to forge a common one, a better one. Long Live Adamenthia ![/color]
