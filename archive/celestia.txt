Regional Anthym, sung to the tune of &amp;#39;America, america&amp;#39; :

            Oh horrorful for gloomy days while crimson stains the grass,
           All humans shall reunite with olden beasts at last.
              Celestia! Celestia! Let magic beasts stand proud.
              And let the elves and dwarves blow their horns sure and loud.
           Oh as the wolves howl in the night and creatures roam freely,
           The pirates can raid foe&amp;#39;s coasts and slay and plunder with glee!
              Celestia! Celestia! Let magic beasts stand proud.
              And let the elves and dwarves blow their horns sure and loud
