Private region of [nation]Waxelto[/nation] and [nation]Zantago[/nation]. Entry prohibited, but embassies are welcome!
We plan to open our borders in the forseeable future, but for now it&#39;s a tight-knit region.
Embassy Policies:
No one from an embassy region may take an office in the region.
No embassies with raider regions, or regions that actively IRL spread hate to the NS community.
Embassy regions may only post one message in the RMB, and wait for another nation to post again.
Region Rules:
TBA
Check out our poll, open to ALL nations! :D
