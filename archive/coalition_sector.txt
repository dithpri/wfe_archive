Coalition Sector is the section of the Multiverse controlled by the United Mojave Coalition. Ten universes, with 20 more as trading partners, have joined up, with its armies looking for more trade partners and annexation of other universes, with the Coalition Fleet leading the way. Within Coalition Sector, the United Mojave Coalition has supreme authority, thanks to its teleportation technology allowing entire fleets and armies passage into any part of the Multiverse, along with advanced FTL technology.
