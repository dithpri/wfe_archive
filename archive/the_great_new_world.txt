The world is a roughly typical &quot;middle age fantasy world,&quot; yet there are many connections to YGGDRASIL in both history and culture. Ainz Ooal Gown&#39;s objective is to make his (originally his guild&#39;s) name an everlasting legend in this world.

Ainz noted this world was like continental Europe which had recently come out of the Middle Ages. However, certain parts were said to be far more advanced than their modern age counterparts. For example, there were magic items that could produce light without fuel and electricity. There were leather pouches that produced, although not infinite, an unnaturally large amount of water.
