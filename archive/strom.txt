The continent of Strom is a large and vast land mass with desert in the west, and mountainous deciduous environment in the east, with hot swampy jungles in the south east.  It&amp;#39;s native people called the Hungii were eradicted a couple hundred years ago when the Arathorians landed on the shores and established their foothold, and eventually their own nation.
