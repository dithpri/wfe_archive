The land of long-lasting green hills. The sounds of laughter and Bagpipes in the taverns and pubs along the land, the people of Sauvage live there.

Thousands of green fields and lakes spot the land, blemished by booming cities of olden times. The age of cobblestone and musket, horses and spirituality. But also pirates and overlords, pirate coves and towns live in the surrounding islands.

The main island is largely unpopulated, the outlandish people of Vapaa fight for the common man, they fight from their wooden ships and flintlock pistols in the surrounding islands and seas. Pirates some call them, others call them the &amp;quot;Free people&amp;quot;.

&amp;quot;This is the reborn Borg Mainland, fight for what is right in the world.&amp;quot;
