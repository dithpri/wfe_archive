And the best part is: You can&#39;t come!! That&#39;s right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister, a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! It&#39;s the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! So come on down to Cartmanland now! But don&#39;t plan on getting past the parking lot, &#39;cause remember: So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can&#39;t come! Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
