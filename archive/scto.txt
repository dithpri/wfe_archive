[i]Welcome to the [b]Sovereign Crowned States Treaty Organization (SCTO) [/b][/i]

SCTO is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to promote amity and cooperation between sovereign states that have a monarchical system of government. Other important objectives of SCTO are to foster respect and appreciation of the individual monarchical history and traditions of member-states, and the development of the monarchical system that respects individual liberties and protections.
