The largest temperate grassland in the world is the Eurasian steppe, extending from Hungary to China. The Eurasian steppe has historically been one of the most important routes for travel and trade. The most famous trade route on the Eurasian steppe is the Silk Road, connecting China, India, and Europe. During the 13th century, Mongolian leader Genghis Khan conquered almost the entire Eurasian steppe.
