You progress forward through the untried portal that once looked like a regular door. You&#39;re immediately met by a pleasant world. A massive, oddly colored lake reflects the even more peculiarly colored mountains in the distance. It&#39;s peaceful and quiet here. Your immediate instinct is to seek shelter, to find some form of relief from this atmosphere.
Regardless of the horrible conditions you get the feeling you&#39;re not in immediate danger. This world is unmistakably menacing and there&#39;s nothing that could ruin this experience.
You know you&#39;ve got everything sorted and prepared as you begin a journey unlike any other. But, with a bag of tricks, some scouting experience, and a few back-up plans, you know you can charter this uncharted land.
