Glorious Uganda is a region which follows the philosophies and life of Idi Amin, who led one of the most influential World Assembly Runs in 2016. Here you can find the Ugandan Liberation Forces and a people loyal to their nation and leader. We govern ourselves and we are against communism its sympathizers. The World Assembly is not present here, for they have allowed Communists and Obotes power over us!

GLORY TO AMIN!
