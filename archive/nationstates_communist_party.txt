[color=red][b]Colony of [region=The Black Hawks][/b][/color]

Surprise surprise eh?

Heard of [b]The Black Hawks[/b], the Most Feared Military Organisation on NationStates? Well now you have!

[nation=XanthiumII] was a long term sleeper in this region, and infiltrated his way into the heart of the natives. He gained maximum influence, enough to instantly password protect the region upon gaining WA delegacy. He was elected WA delegate by the natives, as well as external support from [b]The Union[/b]. No one saw this one coming....

Fendas were too dopey to spot who [nation=XanthiumII] really was.

This is yet another example of how deadly [b]The Black Hawks[/b] are!
