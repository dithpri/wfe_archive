Wyrmgore. Wyrmgore. Wyrmgore, Wyrmgore, Wyrmgore. Where do we start? It&amp;#39;s a small region, potentially expanding, you never know. There&amp;#39;s a land mass, and some islands. Maybe even more islands. The cartographers haven&amp;#39;t exactly done the best job of documenting things.

Anyway, things may develop. Or may stagnate once again. You never know.
