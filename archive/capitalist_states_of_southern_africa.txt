.[b]Out in the wide vacuum of space, a wide variety of strange planets can exist. [Region]The Black Hawks[/region] while exploring the cosmos came across one of these bizarre planets: a pineapple shaped planet, with a massive tree at the top, acting as shelter for its inhabitants. The hawks went around the planet, meeting all the people who called it home, and explored the rest of the planet, learning so much about the strange world.
