The Satellite of Love (sometimes shortened to SOL) is the primary setting of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It is a giant bone-shaped spacecraft in which Joel Robinson and his friends &#151; robots Crow, Tom Servo, Gypsy, Cambot, and the noncorporeal Magic Voice live. The vessel was in orbit above Earth during the entire series, except for a journey to the end of the universe and its flight throughout the space-time continuum with Pearl Forrester.
