Homieland is in ruin right now, but its former glory can be restored. We need more nations to rise from the ashes and fight for what&#146;s left of this world, and for the fate of humanity. This region is open to any and all willing nations, puppets included. Any history prior to joining the region (for already-established nations looking for something new) can be written into our timeline. If you are willing to join the fight, send a telegram requesting admission to [nation]Thaideland[/nation] and you will be given further instruction.
