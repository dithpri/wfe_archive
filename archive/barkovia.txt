[color=blue][b]The Cataclyst Order have come to save you from the disabling and sinful government type also known as &quot;independence&quot; , and as a result we have decided to announce a few changes in the administration. You must endorse the delegate or one of your kind occupators. Since we are benevolent if one chooses not to, we will guide you to a lovely new estate in the Rejected Realms. Free of cost, of course. Endorsements for any body else will not be tolerated and will be met with extreme force if necessary.[/b][/color]
