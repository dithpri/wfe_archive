Located just above the planetary cloud cover the floating island of [region]Cyleto[/region] is home to [nation=noflag]Cytoscandia[/nation].

[region]Cyleto[/region] features three mountains in a scalene triangle, otherwise known as The Scalene Mountains. Located between them is a fully enclosed valley called The Primary; [nation=short+noflag]Cytoscandia[/nation] is located here.

Three rivers run from the scalene mountains down to the primary and each river has a large basin attached to it. Other smaller rivers then connect these basins to the edge of the island through a series of caverns which redirects the excess water off of the island.
