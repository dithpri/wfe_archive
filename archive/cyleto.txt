Located just above the planetary cloud cover the floating island of Cyleto is home to the nation of Cytoscandia.

Cyleto features three mountains in a scalene triangle, otherwise known as The Scalene Mountains. Located between them is a fully enclosed valley called The Primary; Cytoscandia is located here.

Three rivers run from the scalene mountains down to the primary and each river has a large basin attached to it. Other smaller rivers then connect these basins to the edge of the island through a series of caverns which redirects the excess water off of the island.
