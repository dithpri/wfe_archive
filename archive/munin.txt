United with her sister region [region]Hugin[/region], the two ravens scour Midgar in search of signs to warn Odin of the coming apocalypse. 

In Norse mythology, Huginn (from Old Norse &quot;thought&quot;) and Muninn (Old Norse &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;mind&quot;) are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, Midgard, and bring information to the viking god Odin. Huginn and Muninn are attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources: the Prose Edda and Heimskringla; in the Third Grammatical Treatise, compiled in the 13th century by &Oacute;l&aacute;fr &THORN;&oacute;r&eth;arson; and in the poetry of skalds. The names of the ravens are sometimes modernly anglicized as Hugin and Munin.
