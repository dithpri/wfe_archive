The Planetary Economic and Environment League was originally founded by a group of 12 nations seeking an end to the strife of the rest of the world.

Their legacy is continued by the enduring presence of several of the original nations as well as others, whom, attracted by the prosperity and goodwill between neighbours of the PEEL region, sought to preserve the spirit of friendship and cooperation which the O-12 had held so dear.
