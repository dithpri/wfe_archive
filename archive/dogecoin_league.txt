The Dogecoin League is a region of nations that use the Dogecoin as the common currency. Dogecoin is a currency in which we believe will flourish. The League is dedicated to more hardcore gameplay, though is open to more comical issues and discussions as well. All are welcome given that they have a fondness for the Dogecoin currency, as well as a tolerance for a very anarchical forum board.
