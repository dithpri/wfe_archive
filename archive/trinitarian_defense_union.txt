Welcome!

Greetings from the [region]Trinitarian Defense Union[/region], a conglomerate of states dedicated to the defense and upholstery of its people and ideals. We are committed to the mutual defense of our union and the protection of our peoples, our freedom and our land. 

This union is a selection of states from around the globe, free of regional bonds, in preference to a more global economic and defense partnership.

This Union will help uphold a more globalized world, with ethnic peoples from all over the world chipping in to defend the people, the land, the development of nations globally, the freedom to express all parts of oneself, and the freedom of the union.

Happy Holidays!
