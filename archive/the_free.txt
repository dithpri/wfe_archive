[b][u]Do whatever.[/b][/u]

Hello those who choose to wander to this land.

Let us know peace, not together, but individually. Do whatever you want, and let others do as they see fit.

This is not a land governed, but a land given, to you. Without rule, with only freedom.

Peace to all, or not... I don&amp;#39;t care.
