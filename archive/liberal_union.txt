On the third of February, 2018, we were raided  by [region]The Roman Empire[/region]. They elected [nation=long]HNoMS Helge Ingstad[/nation] as WA Delegate, canceled all our embassies, changed our flag, changed our World Factbook, and cancelled our welcome telegram. The invaders have been banjected, their damage has been undone, and a password has been instituted.
