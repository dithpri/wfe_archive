The final Remainders of the Union.

[b]News[/b]
Debhatastan is now a free state between Greater Charles and Squisaviour, and so will be treated equally to the rest in The Remainders.

Because of a tie in the voting for Seniorate, the Seniorate has been decided using three different methods of voting, meaning that Hungerie is the new Seniorate for October.

[b]Policies:[/b]
Puppet stated are allowed in The Remainders with exceptions. Exceptions include if puppets are being used for voting exploits or other purposes to put votes in their favour.
