The Commonwealth of Bootsinunu is a collective of states that share cultural, military, economic, or historical ties with the Constitutional Monarchy of Bootsinunu.

While members of the Commonwealth operate independently of each other, membership obligates each member to the economic and military assistance to the Constitutional Monarchy of Bootsinunu. Membership often comes by request of a nation or formal invite from Justin Hanover XI, the King of Bootsinunu.

Member states can each appoint a delegate to the United Parliament of the Commonwealth, a legislative group that passes voluntary laws as well as acting as a court of law in the course of a dispute between two member nations.
