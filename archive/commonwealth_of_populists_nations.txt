[color=red]About us[/color]
We are a region based on values and inclusion, ignorance does not proliferate and sovereignty is key. We are against radical right-wing extremists, but everyone else is welcome. We are nations with progressive ideals in favor of the environment and human development.The freedom of expression and the critical capacity of the nation are especially valued, and religion is free. In general, this region is to promote fair treatment and repeating all decisions, which fit the fair, WA.
In case of violation of these, we must all act both militarily and economically due to violations of our values, principles, and beliefs.
