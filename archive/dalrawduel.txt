[b][color=scarlet]~[u]WELCOME TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTOCRACY OF DALRAWDUEL[/u]~[/color][/b]
[hr][i][color=orange]Dalrawduel, one of the five major GHS regions, is known for its rich political history and its strong interregional influence. Originally formed as a small monarchy, it has since transitioned through periods of republic and dictatorship, respectively, during which time it rose massively in influence and power. Now a constitutional autocracy, it continues to uphold its ever-expanding legacy.[/i][/color]
