[b][color=scarlet]~[u]WELCOME TO DALRAWDUEL[/u]~[/color][/b]
[hr][i][color=orange]Dalrawduel, one of the historical five major GHS regions, was known for its rich political history and strong interregional influence. Originally formed as a small monarchy, it has since transitioned through periods of republic, dictatorship, and constitutional autocracy, respectively, during which time it rose massively in influence and power. As the oldest remaining Grissom region, it is now forever bound in the memories and history of the Grissom High School NationStates community. May its legend never die.[/i][/color]
[hr][color=green][b]A Message from the Founder:[/b][/color]
[color=navy]Grissom&#39;s time on NS is now over. But while it lasted, it was a wonderful community of peers, so much more than just a game. And I just want to thank everyone who made it what it was.[/color]
