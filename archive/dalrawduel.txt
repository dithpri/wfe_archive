For those who seek power, glory, and success, welcome to Dalrawduel! 

Among all the other features of the region, we have initiated the first-ever regional constitution, which can be located in the Factbook of [nation]Danton[/nation]. Please read over the document if you wish to join the region. You are not required to know every detail of it - just know the basics of what applies to you. I hope that it may serve to make this region a much better place for all who join it!

If you have any questions or wish to join, contact the Founder, the World Assembly Delegate, or our High Justice, [nation]The Republic of Gerginhiem[/nation].

For all who seek a great quest among their collection of NationStates experiences, Dalrawduel is the home for you!
