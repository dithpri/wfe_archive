For those who seek power, glory, and success, welcome to Dalrawduel! 

Dalrawduel is a medieval-themed region with a great variety of nations, and we have also instituted the first-ever regional constitution, known as the Medieval Compact of Dalrawduel (located below). Please read over this document so as to be informed of what laws you are required to follow. You need not read over the entire compact, but need only know what applies to you. If you have any questions or wish to join, please telegram our founder, delegate, or our regional High Justice, [nation]The Republic of Gerginhiem[/nation].

We will be glad to receive you as a member of this fantastic region!
