[b][color=scarlet]~[u]WELCOME TO DALRAWDUEL[/u]~[/color][/b]
[hr][i][color=orange]Dalrawduel, one of the historical five major GHS regions, was known for its rich political history and strong interregional influence. Originally formed as a small monarchy, it has since transitioned through periods of republic and dictatorship, respectively, during which time it rose massively in influence and power. Having ended its period of influence as a constitutional autocracy, it is now forever bound in the memories and history of the Grissom High School NationStates community. May its legend never die.[/i][/color]
[hr][color=green][b]A Message from the Founder:[/b][/color]
[color=navy]Grissom&#39;s time on NS is now over. But while it lasted, it was a wonderful community of peers, so much more than just a game. And I just want to thank everyone who made it what it was.[/color]
