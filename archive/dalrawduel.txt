[b]JONATHON IS BANISHED FOR THE TIME BEING - LET HIS FATE BE A WARNING TO YOU ALL![/b]
 - Radical Day is coming up on September 6! Be sure to take this glorious opportunity to make fun of Jonathon and Daniel.
 - A new holiday has been decided for Dalrawduel! [b]Compact Day[/b] will take place on the eleventh of every month. On this day, The Medieval Compact of Dalrawduel will come into effect, bringing back a brief reminisce of the time last year when our region was full of not only more equal rights, but also vicious arguments over both major and trivial political issues. Enjoy your temporary freedom from totalitarianism while you have it for those short twenty-four hours...
And don&amp;#39;t try anything, you guys, I&amp;#39;m only on vacation...
