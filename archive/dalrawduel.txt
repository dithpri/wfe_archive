 - So, in light of the newly released trailer for [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmeOjFno6Do]Avengers: Age of Ultron[/url], I thought I&amp;#39;d re-announce the availability of spots on the region&amp;#39;s own team of Avengers. Located below, I have two Factbooks that include lists of the Avengers and several of the villains they face. I started this last year, but by now, we have a whole new assortment of people in the region, plus a lot of the ones previously occupying spots died. So if you&amp;#39;d like to sign up for this, as a roleplay thing, feel free to. Also, it might be kind of cool to have this in the future for something else I have planned that is yet to be revealed
