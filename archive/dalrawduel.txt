[color=green]Summer is here at last.[/color]

[color=pink]All is joyous.[/color]

[color=gold]All is wonderful.[/color]

[color=blue]Freedom abounds.[/color]

[color=red]OH WAIT NEVER MIND NO IT DOESN&amp;#39;T

BECAUSE[/color][color=brown] [B]I STILL HAVE [/color][color=orange]BAND[/color][/B]

But even so, I hope that everyone has a great [color=green]Summer Break! [/color]I will be inactive during it (to the best of my knowledge), but hopefully we&amp;#39;ll get things started again next year! However, if I wind up being homeschooled, I&amp;#39;ll probably remain inactive. For all I know, this could be the last day of my life that I ever access NationStates. I suppose we&amp;#39;ll just have to see...
