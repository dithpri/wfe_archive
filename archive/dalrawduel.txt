 - A new holiday has been decided for Dalrawduel! [b]Compact Day[/b] will take place on the eleventh of every month. On this day, The Medieval Compact of Dalrawduel will come into effect, bringing back a brief reminisce of the time last year when our region was full of not only more equal rights, but also vicious arguments over both major and trivial political issues. Enjoy your temporary freedom from totalitarianism while you have it for those short twenty-four hours...
- Compact Day is coming up in just three short days. Make sure you vote on the poll. I would like to see your opinions of the new holiday.
