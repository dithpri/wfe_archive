For those who seek power, glory, and success, welcome to Dalrawduel! 

This medieval-styled world of magic and myth will aid any nation on its path to greatness. Among all the other features of the region, we have initiated the first-ever regional constitution, which can be located in the Factbook of [nation]Danton[/nation]. Please read over the document if you wish to join the region. However, it will not come into effect until January 11. You are also not required to know every detail of it - just know the basics of what applies to you.

For all who seek a great quest among their collection of NationStates experiences, Dalrawduel is the home for you!
