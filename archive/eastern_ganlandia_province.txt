This burgeoning region, centered around the flourishing nation of Ganlandia, is noted for its tolerance of all governments. Whether your people are run by a democracy or a dictatorship, EGP is a place to practice your freedom to rule however you choose. There is one condition: we are a unified region, and the inhabitants of Eastern Ganlandia Province are expected to uphold the peace treaty that has been enacted between all nations involved. Welcome!
