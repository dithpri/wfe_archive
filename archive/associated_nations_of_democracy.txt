Freedom must reign over every last star
Through citizen&#39;s blood spilled in our righteous wars
Honor their deaths, do your part for the cause
Steadfast support of our regime is how humankind will reign supreme
No questions or doubts shall be allowed
Traitors will all be disavowed
Managed democracy is the true path
All who resist it shall suffer our wrath
White, yellow, blue flying on all the worlds
Justice and hope are forever unfurled
Our way of life, galaxy-wide
Paved with the skulls of those who&#39;ve died
Unslakable tide of super Earth pride
A torrent that can&#39;t be satisfied
We sacrifice for paradise
Anything less, will not suffice
Citizens rise, liberty rise
Super Earth, rise up to the skies
Stay free! (Helldivers 2)
