[b]THE REGION OF BLACK DOMINATION.[/b]

You don&#39;t have to be Black to be a member of Black Domination, you just have to believe in Black Domination/Black Superiority. So if you believe in Black Domination/Black Superiority, then this is the region for you no matter what color you are. There is only one criteria for membership, and it applies to everyone equally regardless of race: [b]believe in Black Domination/Black Superiority[/b]. If you don&#39;t believe in Black Domination/Black Superiority, then you should find another region.

All conversation within roleplay context is fair game, but any threat to commit real-life violence will result in instant banjection.
