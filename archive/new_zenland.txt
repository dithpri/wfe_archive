Created 2/23/13 after the bloody decline of Old Zenland. Our purpose is to serve as a safe-haven for surviving nations worldwide. Dedicated as a region to restoring the prosperity of the Golden Age to each of its nations. Soon we will recruit all weary survivors, elect a WA delegate and perhaps someday draft a Constitution. 

If you would like to join New Zenland send a telegram to our delegate Piacentine requesting the regional password.
