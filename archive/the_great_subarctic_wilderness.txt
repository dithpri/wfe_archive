The Great Subarctic Wilderness is one of the most stunningly beautiful regions in all of the world.  Characterized by its enormous fjords, stunning forest of pine and maple, and its majestic wildlife, it represents one of the last great open lands.  It is not uncommon to see bears walking through the streets of this regions whilst the locals continue to sit calmly in the open air cafes, sipping their tea and talking about the latest scores of Flonkerton, the region&amp;#39;s most popular sport.  Tis a charming region, especially known for its delightful pastries and delightfully large swords (which are more for show and less for battle).
