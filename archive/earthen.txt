The Earthen Alliance. We are the wise and strong, our enemies may mount up before us, but our might has no bounds, our thirst for knowledge unquenchable.

We don&#39;t care about what rights your people have but your economy must stay in the green. If you fail to do so you have one week to get your economy up before you are kicked. You can rejoin after your economy is brought up.
