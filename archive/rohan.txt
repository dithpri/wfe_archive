Rohan is a realm in J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s fantasy era of Middle-earth. It is a grassland which lies north of its ally Gondor and north-west of Mordor, the realm of Sauron, their enemy (see maps of Middle-earth). It is inhabited by the Rohirrim, a people of herdsmen and farmers who are well-known for their horses and cavalry. Rohan is also referred to as Riddermark or the Mark. The realm is of significant importance in the author&#39;s most famous book, The Lord of the Rings.
