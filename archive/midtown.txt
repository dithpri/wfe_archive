Little is known about this Region due to it&amp;#39;s diligent participation of both government and citizen alike in an obvious pro-active roll to eradicate any outside observers in and around its borders. The Region is obviously technologically advanced insofar as all satellite and radar imagery and data has been unsuccessful to date. it must be mentioned that lack of scientific data acquired about the Region is an oddity since thousands of minds have been at work on this data acquisition project for over a decade now. The most significant finding has been that all equipment that has passed over this Region has not come back or has a lack of chronological evidence of its existence.
