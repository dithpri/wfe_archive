World 2070 is a small newly established region that is open to anyone who wants to participate in it. After playing for a long time in [region]Libertas[/region], I came to the conclusion that I would start a region myself. I hope you will build this region with me and create something big.

This world is shattered after a Great War and thus offers space for a variety of nations in a slight science-fiction setting: successor states of today&#39;s nations, new nations, new colonies on new lands (perhaps even on the moon), run-down post-apocalyptic tribes &#133;
