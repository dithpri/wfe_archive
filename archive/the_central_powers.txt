[i][b]Welcome to the Central Powers[/b][/i]

The Central Powers were one of the two warring factions in World War I, composed of [nation=short]Imperial-Germany[/nation], [nation=short]Austro Hungary[/nation], the [nation=short]Ottoman-Empire[/nation] and [nation=short]the Kingdom of Bulgaria[/nation].

[i]Regardless of affiliation, a lot of lives were lost from both sides during the First World War. For the next four years, let&amp;#39;s remember and commemorate to those who&amp;#39;ve fought in the Great War, for they shall never be forgotten.[/i]
