Sunni Islam (/&amp;#712;su&amp;#720;ni, &amp;#712;s&amp;#650;ni/) is by far the largest branch of Islam, followed by 85&#150;90% of the world&#39;s Muslims. Its name comes from the word Sunnah, referring to the behaviour of Muhammad. The differences between Sunni and Shia Muslims arose from a disagreement over the succession to Muhammad and subsequently acquired broader political significance, as well as theological and juridical dimensions.According to Sunni traditions, Muhammad designated Abu Bakr as his successor (the first caliph).
