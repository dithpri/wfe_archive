The Conservative Christian States are a group of states that center their way of life around Christian beliefs. We believe in the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in canonical gospels and other New Testament writings. The Conservative Christian States are a peaceful region, and do not mean to cause harm to any of its region&amp;#39;s people or any other region&amp;#39;s people.
