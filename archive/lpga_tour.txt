[color=scarlet]Greetings, all nations! Peace be with you.
Welcome to a place which is an oasis for peace, pleasant communication, freedom, &amp; plenty of golf.
We adore our two benevolent leaders. Queen Nelly &amp; Queen Jessica of The Most Noble House of Korda rule the LPGA Tour with wisdom, grace, kindness, compassion, humility, &amp; the most fundamentally perfect golf swings.
Feel free to spend some time with us on holiday or even live here if you would like to do that also.
Please stop by for a friendly round of golf any time.
God bless!
