A Region mostly centered around P2TM roleplay (specifically [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;amp;t=268717]Postapocalyptia[/url]), but of course everyone who is interested in and enjoys good company and general goofery is welcome.

If interested, you should apply for our RP. We accept players periodically, but you can drop a character idea whenever you wish. This will give you a head start once a new recruitment round starts.

Are you an artist? Are you willing to make Postapocalyptia a better place? Good! We need illustrators. Well, don&amp;#39;t exactly &amp;quot;need,&amp;quot; but it&amp;#39;d be neat if you drew some stuff or something.
