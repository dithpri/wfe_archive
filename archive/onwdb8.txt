Naturallaws will serve as the game maker and reff. Your voice will outweigh him if you are all in agreement.

Conflicts and events will go through NaturalLaws, and covert actions can be sent to me (Michael/ NaturalLaws) such as military mobilization in secret, placing a spy, or formations of secret alliances. Keep me informed of your plans, so I can make the game better, I will keep them secret.

I will also try to keep the game going, and keep it fair.

I will call out GodModding, and do my best to ensure the game is fair and engaging, even if means you lose a battle.

The game will only be controlled and fair as long as this authority is recognized. I will have the final say, as long as you all let me.  Above that, scheme and plot all you want.
