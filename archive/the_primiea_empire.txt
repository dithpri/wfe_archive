Founded by The [color=red]Glorious Akantu Empire[/color], The Primiea Empire was founded on the belief of a safe and secure society for all nations wishing to grow and flourish on the world stage. All are welcome to join the collective. As this empire grows and makes its mark, more details will be added to The Primiea Archives. 

Please make sure to endorse [nation]Akantu[/nation] and [nation]Benignity Prime[/nation]!

We are new to NS but we are looking forward to growing and staking our claim as the most influential region in this game! We will be growing into a semi-roleplaying community, involving policies of not just the nations and the Empire, but helping determine world policy at the WA.
