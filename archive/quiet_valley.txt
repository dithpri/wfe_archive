The Quiet Valley lies in the middle of a lush, peaceful continent. Vast populations of fauna and flora coexist in natural harmony, free of human burdens. Olvaria has relocated to the Valley for a quiet, nonpolitical life. Other peace-loving, free countries supportive of democracy are free to move in with Olvaria.

The Black Riders and similar invaders are not welcomed here. This is a place of peaceful gatherings and not petty invasions for the sake of personal benefit.
