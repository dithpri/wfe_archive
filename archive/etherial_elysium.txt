Deponia is a colossal island which was originally inhabited by a large human population, until the majority ascended towards living in a utopia-styled floating city called Elysium. Over time, the Elysians forgot their origins and past with the island, assuming it to be nothing more than an uninhabitable world. For the remaining humans left behind, their home became a dumping ground for those who ascended, leaving them to make settlements amongst the trash that is regularly dumped on the surface&#39;s landmasses, with communities managing to thrive as best they can, and clean water considered the most valuable commodity for them.
