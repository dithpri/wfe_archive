The Region of Iserlohn serves as a beacon of LoGH (Legend of the Galactic Heroes) fandom on Nationstates. The theme of the region is centered around the Republic of Iserlohn Fortress maintained by Yang Wenli and his democratic followers after the collapse of the Free Planets Alliance during the conquest of the realm by the Lohengramm Empire led by Reinhard Von Lohengramm.
