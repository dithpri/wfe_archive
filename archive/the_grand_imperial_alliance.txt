Welcome to [b][color=gold]the Grand Imperial Alliance[/color][/b],

GIA members have no legal obligation one to another, instead they are united by language, history and culture, and their shared values of [b][color=gold]democracy[/color][/b], [b][color=gold]human rights[/color][/b] and the [b][color=gold]rule of law[/color][/b]. These values are enshrined in the [b][color=gold]GIA Charter[/color][/b] and promoted by the [b][color=gold]Grand Olympic Games[/color][/b]. 

Over the years the GIA community has grown to over 30 member states. GIA also aims to provide quality, realistic Role Playing opportunities for new and established members alike.
