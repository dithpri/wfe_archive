Welcome to [b][color=gold]the Grand Imperial Alliance[/color][/b],

For over [b][color=gold]10 years[/color][/b], the Grand Imperial Alliance (GIA) has stayed true to its founding principles, that member states have no legal obligation to one another but are united by their differences in language, history, and culture. But all member states shared the same vision of values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. These values are enshrined in the GIA Charter and promoted by the Grand Olympic Games.

The GIA strives to provide quality realistic, modern-tech, roleplaying opportunities for new and established members alike.
