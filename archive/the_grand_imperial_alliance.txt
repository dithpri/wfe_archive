Welcome to [b][color=gold]the Grand Imperial Alliance[/color][/b],

The Grand Imperial Alliance (GIA) was formed 10 years ago with the idea that member states have no legal obligation one to another, but are instead united by their differences in language, history and culture. But all member states shared the same vision of values of [b][color=gold]democracy[/color][/b], [b][color=gold]human rights[/color][/b] and the [b][color=gold]rule of law[/color][/b]. These values are enshrined in the [b][color=gold]GIA Charter[/color][/b] and promoted by the [b][color=gold]Grand Olympic Games[/color][/b].

Over the years the GIA community has grown to over 20 member states. GIA strives to provide quality realistic, modern-tech, roleplaying opportunities for new and established members alike.
