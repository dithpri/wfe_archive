Welcome to [b][color=gold]the Grand Imperial Alliance[/color][/b],

Five years ago, G.I.A. was formed with the idea that member states have no legal obligation one to another, but are instead unified by their differences in language, history and culture. But all member states share the same vision of the values of [b][color=gold]democracy[/color][/b], [b][color=gold]human rights[/color][/b] and the [b][color=gold]rule of law[/color][/b]. These values are enshrined in the [b][color=gold]G.I.A. Charter[/color][/b] and promoted by the [b][color=gold]Grand Olympic Games[/color][/b]. 

Over the years the G.I.A. community had previously grown to over 20 member states. The G.I.A. strives to provide quality realistic, modern-tech, roleplaying opportunities for new and established members alike.
