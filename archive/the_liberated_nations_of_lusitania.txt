The Liberated Nations of Lusitania is an alliance of nation states unbeholden to the will of outsiders or each other. Each might have a different view on how freedom is to be achieved, and each is free to achieve it in his own way. However, the states do trade with each other, provide help in times of hardship, and if necessary, back each other militarily. Each country&#39;s strength makes up for another weakness. This is the ideal of Lusitania.
