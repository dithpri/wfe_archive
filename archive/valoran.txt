Valoran is the northern continent of Runeterra. Valoran is connected to the now Shuriman Continent through a small artificial land bridge where modern day Piltover and Zaun are located, which was once the center location of the continent before the event that shattered the continent into two. While the most well-known regions of the continent are Kled, Demacia, Noxus, and Freljord, there are also hundreds of smaller states and nations that are not part of them.
