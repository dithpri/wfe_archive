[b][u][color=blue]UCIA WORLD FACTBOOK[/color][/u][/b]
[b]The UCIA was created to provide a place
for nations to thrive together. The UCIA is dedicated to providing resources to its citizens to make it a safe and prosperous region. [color=green]United In Love and Service![/color][/b] 

[b]The UCIA has seen times of power and times fallen back into the dust. We run this region on the memories of our fallen comrades, and will continue running this region on behalf of the wonderful insights that had once filled our region. We will rise up once more, and return back with a golden age. Long live the UCIA![/b]
