The Forge&#39;s Den was once a popular pub and gathering place in the long-bygone People&#39;s Republic of Lazarus. In the years since its collapse, the Den has gone forgotten, becoming a gathering place for thieves and miscreants.

In 2018, some citizens of the Free Republic of Nesapo with revolutionary ties put together some money to reacquire the Den, renaming it to reflect the new ownership. It is now a hall for reminiscing, and at every table one can see graybeards clinking their glasses to the good old days. 

This region functions as a puppet storage for [region]Nesapo[/region]. Regardless of origin, you are welcome to come in and enjoy a drink before departing. We&#39;ll be here.
