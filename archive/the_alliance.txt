[b][color=319dc1]The Alliance[/color][/b] welcomes you, soldier.

[b][color=319dc1]The Alliance[/color][/b] is a project I&#39;ve always wanted to work on which is a defender region with a bit of a different twist, an org that does not spend all of the time cleaning up tags and instead just gives natives info about how to do it themselves, and clears WFE/flag.  My idea was to redefine the way defenders respond to tagging to more equalize the time and work involved on our side compared to the other side, and make it equally visible when we are active, as a means to keep our numbers up so that defenders have more updaters to actually help natives facing &quot;real&quot; raids.
