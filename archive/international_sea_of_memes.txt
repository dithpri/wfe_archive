The International Sea of Memes is a mainly authoritarian region, but we allow other types of nations as well. While it may say [nation=noflag]Roblock[/nation] is the founder. [nation=noflag]Roblock[/nation] was actually annexed by [nation=noflag]Joergenland[/nation] and is under [nation=noflag]Joergenland[/nation]&#39;s control.
