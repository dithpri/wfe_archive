[b][color=blue]Welcome[/color][/b]
The International Sea of Memes is a mainly authoritarian region, but we allow other types of nations as well. While it may say [nation=noflag]Roblock[/nation] is the founder, Roblock actually ceded their land to [nation=noflag]Joergenland[/nation] and they are now under Joergenland&#39;s control.

[b][color=blue]Laws of Immigration:[/color][/b]
1. Must be in the WA
2. Must endorse [nation=noflag]Joergenland[/nation]
3. Must not have more endorsements than Joergenland
4. Must pledge loyalty to the region.
5. Breach of these laws will result in a warning, and then a kick.
