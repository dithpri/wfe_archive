This is the place to be because we have true freedom, that will not turn to anarchy because of structure and morality. A river is the model of true freedom because it is swift and headed to something greater. it is that way because of the boundaries, its banks. without them it is nothing but a lazy lake this is stuck where it is and subject to the environment. It will eventually evaporate, leaving nothing but a memory.
