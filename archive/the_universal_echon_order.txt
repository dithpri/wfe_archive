We are the Universal Echon Order. &amp;quot;Echon&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;each one&amp;quot; &amp;amp; we strive to hear out every member who is admitted to this region. We accept any military-based or republican-based governments in this faction. Our goals include expansionism, and humanitarian aid. The Universal Echon Order is here as a means to collect many, many nations and have military, economic, and social exchanging under the ideology of *Wilkesism.  Born again from the founding of the Universal Echon Order a la Nations, we hope you too, will be a better, more orderly, universe.
