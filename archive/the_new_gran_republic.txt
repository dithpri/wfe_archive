Hello, and welcome to [region]The New Gran Republic[/region]!

Here, we pride ourselves on the ideals of freedom and Republicanism.

Instead of having WA delegates, we vote for Consul on polls. The consul has the power to choose other officials. A Consul can have infinite terms, each being 1 month. If you have any questions, just ask the consul or the vice.
When the term is over the next poll begins!
