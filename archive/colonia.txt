A small arcypelagus, in the atlantic, discovered in 1641 by an unknown man. The islands were colonized by the man, and they founded a state called &quot;Pretoria&quot;, which, in the long run, became known as Democratic Republic of The old earth, . Though, many other islands in the arcypelagus remain free for colonization from other countries, as long as they accept the Democratic Republic of The old earth as their leader.
