The Floating Isles is a myriad of small islands that have been literally &amp;quot;floating&amp;quot; for as long as anyone can remember. Although they are technically a &amp;quot;region&amp;quot; of their own, the Floating Isles is merely the location of the country Helvet Miori Thysa. A decrepit wasteland, these strange fixtures are perfect for bolstering the economy of the country that inhabits them. Wyverns and other dragons inhabit the harsh mountains of Helvet Major, the largest island. Some notable settled islands include Helvet Minor, Thysaia, Cronus, Lysteria, Starlit Sun, the Canopy, Irelia, Hurla, Jursta, and Miori, the location of Vemina, the capital.
