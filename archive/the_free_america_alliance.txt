The Free America Alliance is an alliance of independent nations on the North American continent that came about as a result of an inspiration from the Second War of Southern Independence, during which the Confederacy of Southern States won its independence from the ever increasingly dictatorial United States. These nations all range in size from the size of one state to several to regional sizes and all have a vested interest in allying to protect their sovereignty not only from the bitter dictatorial US, but also from foreign powers who may be chomping at the bit to take pieces of the old US that are now independent of the broken nation.
