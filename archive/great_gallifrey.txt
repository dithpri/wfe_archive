Gallifrey&#39;s deep red grass looks beautiful as the second sun glints off of it and the surrounding silver-leafed trees. The vast mountain ranges capped with snow shine as the sun hits them and creates protection around the surrounding nations. The rocks that made up the mountains are beautiful shades of red, brown and purple, and gold.
