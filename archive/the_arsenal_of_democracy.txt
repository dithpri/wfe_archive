The Arsenal of Democracy is an alliance of nations to stop Fascism, Dictatorships, all inferior systems, and most of all Communism. We will cement the Free Market, Capitalism, and Democracy as basic human rights. We will accomplish this with powerful economies, overwhelming military power, and very catchy patriotic songs. 

Remember better dead than red and democracy is nonnegotiable.
