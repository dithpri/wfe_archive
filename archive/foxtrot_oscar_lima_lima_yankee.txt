&#149;The region of F.O.L.L.Y, though small, aims to increase activity and grow rapidly.  No puppet nations here, please.  If you want to be a part of a vigorous young region, F.O.L.L.Y is for you.  Also if you like rock, are open-mindedish (all religions and political views are welcome), or enjoy partaking in an intelligent conversation on the RMB.  And true to its name, there&amp;#39;s always room for a bit of foolishness!=^.^=
