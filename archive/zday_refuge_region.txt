-Welcome to the Zday Refuge Region! This region was at first created for Zday5, but we then decided to take refugees all year round. It&#39;s like The Rejected Realms, only without the troublemakers, who actually get kicked out. Of course, it&#39;ll be a safe haven on forthcoming Z-days.
-All embassy requests welcome-as long as you&#39;re not invaders or other evil groups of that sort.
