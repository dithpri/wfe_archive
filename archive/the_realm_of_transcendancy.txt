Here, only those who have become so advanced that Future tech is considered low tech, wonder this realm. They are enlightened, and have transcended beyond war, knowing that if they participated, they would be without equal. Those that wonder this realm strife for knowledge, enlightenment, control, peace, and isolation.

Those that dwell here could be considered gods, but they do not desire to be worshipped, prayed to, or be feared by those that live in the lesser planes.

Those that reside here, can traverse the multiverses and every dimension.
