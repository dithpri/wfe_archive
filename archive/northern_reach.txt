The Northern Reach region is perfect for countries who have a large tourist industry. The region has mountain ranges on the western side where many outdoor tourist activities (camping, fishing, hiking, skiing, etc.) thrive. On the coast lies many cities. This region is new, so we&amp;#39;re looking for countries with similar interests to join so we can come up with ideas and make this an amazing, much desired region.
For an idea of the countries that we believe would fit well in Northern Reach, look at the overview of our founding nation, The Commonwealth of Desfall.
Eventually we&amp;#39;d like to roleplay with government agencies. For further info, click this http://dark.nationstates.net/nation=desfall/detail=factbook/id=197769
