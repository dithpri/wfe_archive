[b][i]This region is off limits, stranger.[/b][/i]

If you are seriously looking for a new region, be sure to telegram [nation]Chycotia[/nation] randomly and without ceasing.

Also, be sure that the telegram you plan to send is about nothing of real importance and tedious in nature.  Some examples of acceptable telegram topics are as follows:

- Depression
- Frozen the Movie
- &amp;quot;Unforgiven&amp;quot; by Blood on the Dance Floor
- Your daily cheese intake

He loves these kinds of telegrams, especially in unfathomably large quantities.  He may tell you otherwise, but I can assure you that he will read your telegram and consider giving you the password to the region of [region]Paiterra[/region].

Thank you and good day.
