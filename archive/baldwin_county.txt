Baldwin County was founded by some good ole Barn Well boys. After the territory of Baldwin County spread, other peoples of many sovereign nations were invited by the Barn Well council (Barn Well Boys United) to settle the lush and vast lands of Baldwin under the Barn Well flag. The resettlement of people increased the border of the Baldwin even further and a vote by the BWBU in July 2016 allowed this nations to once again fly under their own flags and re establish their old governments.
