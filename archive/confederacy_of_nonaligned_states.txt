We&amp;#39;re a group of roleplayers with a loose regional government. All ideologies and government types are welcome here! The regional government exists to coordinate regional activities, not to overrule the stances of your nation. WA and non-WA nations alike are all welcome to participate.

Move in, say hello, and pick yourself a spot on the map!
