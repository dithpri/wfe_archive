[b]Nationland[/b] is an artificially constructed platform with an area of roughly 4,500 square kilometers located at an indeterminate location within the Hudson Bay. It consists of a 800-meter-thick slab of reinforced concrete resting on a lattice of over five million nitrogen tanks that keep the platform above water. To limit ecological, the massive raft charts an erratic path within the Hudson Bay, usually mimicking prevailing winds. On the surface of the desolate slab, energy can be generated with wind turbines, or brought in from tidal generators located within larger settlements on the coasts.

Nationland is currently open for settlement.
