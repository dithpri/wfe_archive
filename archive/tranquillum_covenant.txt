  The Tranquillum Covenant is a collection of nations that inhabit a very large island, nearly it&#39;s own continent. The island has a very varied climate, ranging from tropical rainforests to snowy tundras. 

  In the Covenant, overall government and economy type are not a factor in relations between nations. All that matter is that all nations share the common goal of preserving each other, at least somewhat. For the most part, you are fine, as long as you keep the peace with your neighbors.

The Inheritor Empire oversees the Covenant, and is acknowledged as it&#39;s ruling nation. The Inheritors are not strict on rules, so expect much independence.
