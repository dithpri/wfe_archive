Are you a nation with a purpose? The purpose of generating and collecting international artwork? 

Have you recognized that the sole purpose of issues is to generate art? Realized that the specific choice is immaterial, and it&#39;s effect on nation a mere illusion?

With that universal truth internalized, do you leave to your siblings, the shenanigans of the world assembly? Dedicate yourself only to the holy creative service of collecting cards?

Do you abhor the nations that are sneaky snipers or those that heist the banks? See the occasional need for a white knight to chase them off?

If you answered yes to some or all of the above, this region is made just for you.
