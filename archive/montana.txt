Montana, called &amp;quot;Big Sky Country,&amp;quot; is the fourth largest state in the US by land area, but 44th in population, and therefore has the third lowest population density in the United States. The economy is primarily based on services statewide, with ranching, wheat farming, oil and coal in the east, and lumber, tourism, and hard rock mining in the west. Millions of tourists annually visit Glacier National Park, the Battle of Little Bighorn site, and three of the five entrances to Yellowstone National Park.
