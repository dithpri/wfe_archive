[color=#230069][b]A shotgun may not be considered a [i]typical[/i] tool for assassination, but whatever gets the job done gets the job done. A squad of assassins from [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] descended on this region and started blasting. But what they didn&#39;t realize was that [nation=short]Good Waffles[/nation] and [nation=short]Miserable peoples[/nation] had a M2 browning at the ready. As the assassins went in they saw the M2 and turned and ran. Just as they were almost out [nation=short]Scottiesland[/nation] fell and go shot.
