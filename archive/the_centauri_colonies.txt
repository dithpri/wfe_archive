Welcome to the Centauri Colonies! The year is 2114, and humans have reached the nearest habitable planet, Proxima Centauri. The narrow sliver of habitability between the hot and the freezing sides is dominated by many nations seeking control of the most power. Fight your way for dominance of the map and become the most well-known colony! 
P.S, If you wish to keep your fighting to a minimum, consider joining the active Discord role-play! Nations are represented as people with their own personalities determined by the players!

Consider endorsing the WA Chancellor to support their efforts of controlling the order of The Centauri Colonies. (As soon as I finish the Discord and everything)
