The United Nations of Justopia was founded when Krakmar realized they were strong enough and personable enough to create and found their own region. They welcome all democracy-lovers, and even those who don&#39;t. 
Welcome!

Our main goal is to help everyone enjoy NationStates &amp; to have many embassies.
We are looking for new nomadic nations to join us &amp; keep in touch with our current embassies, as it&#39;s a lot of work for Milwalkiee. You will become an embassies officer.
When you join, we&#39;ll have a one-on-one chat to see where you would like to be in our region, &amp; find your best fit.
