The South Shetland Islands are an island chain off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. By the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, the Islands&amp;#39; sovereignty is neither recognized nor disputed by the signatories, and they are free for use by any signatory for non-military purposes. This treaty was in action until 2159, when an army of Neo-Romans calling themselves Iotians, shattered the treaty by claiming the South Shetland Islands for their own, thus renaming it Iotus.
