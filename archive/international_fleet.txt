We strive to conquer the universe.

Elections will be held on the 5th of every month.
There are four positions:
[color=red][b]President[/color]- [color=navy]Inchoatus[/color][/b]- [b]Will handle laws[/b]
[color=red][b]Chief Justice[/color]- [color=navy]Hydronious[/color][/b]- [b]Will handle disputes[/b]

[color=red][b]Ambassador to Foreign Countries[/color]- [color=navy]Bomoux[/color][/b]- [b]Will handle foreign relations[/b]

Due to flaws in the game&amp;#39;s setup all action will have to be completed through the founder with no objection.

Also due to lack of nations I, the Founder, shall appoint positions until we have enough nations.
If you have any problems with the appointments wire a telegram to Ratomba.
