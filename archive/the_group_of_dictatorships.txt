We, The Group of Dictatorships, do not believe in freedom for our people, or have very little of it. We focus on military might and making sure nobody gets in our way. We have great freedoms for our countries, though. You can use your own currency, and make whatever decisions you want, with one exception,

It has to be a Dictatorship or closely resemble a Dictatorship.

Follow this condition and you will have a good life in The Group of Dictatorships.
