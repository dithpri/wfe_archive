We, The Group of Dictatorships, do not believe in freedom for our people, or have very little of it. We focus on military might and making sure nobody gets in our way. We have great freedoms for our countries, though. You can use your own currency, and make whatever decisions you want, with three exceptions:

1. It has to be a dictatorship.

2. Drugs have to be legal.

3. Public nudity has to be legal.

Follow these three conditions and you will have a good life in The Group of Dictatorships.
