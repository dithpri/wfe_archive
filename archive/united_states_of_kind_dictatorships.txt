This Region is founded on the basis of one basic principle. A dictatorship is the best system of government, it is effective and efficient. It bypasses the un-democratic theory of democracy which doesn&#39;t represent the people. But notice the word kind, we don&#39;t believe that people are simply pawns to be crushed and pushed around. We believe in Civil Liberties, we believe in people having rights. If your country believes in these ideals, then if you haven&#39;t already, join our region.
