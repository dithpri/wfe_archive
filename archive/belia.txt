[color=green][u][i][b]Welcome to the wonderful world of Belia![/color][/u][/b][/i]

This region is set in a medieval fantasy setting, with Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes and Kin (Animal People). This is also a kingdom type region, with nations actually controlling a Kingdom (or Empire or whatever floats your boat ;) ) and each nation can have their own ruler.
