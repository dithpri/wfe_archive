Aramos is a region for the future. We strive to be creative, have fun, and push NationStates to the limits. It is everything from a programming development region to a roleplay region. Through the leadership of our founder and the input of our citizens, we can achieve anything.

Aramos is now open to the general public! Invite your friends! All nations joining before July 10 at 20:00 UTC will earn Phase 3 Early &amp; Proud Residency membership!
