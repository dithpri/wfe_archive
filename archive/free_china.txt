Welcome to the glorious region of Free China! 

We pride ourselves on our commitments to democracy, liberty, equal opportunities and a free market.

Following the fall of the Communist Party of China, ruled by Xi Jinping, the Western Coalition, led by the USA, implemented a free and open political system along with a strong constitution, guaranteeing the rights of the Chinese people. 

Shortly after, the newly formed Freedom and Fairness Party won mainland China&#39;s first democratic election since 1918. Despite its historical significance, Beijing was replaced as the capital by the western-leaning and capitalist city of Shanghai, a metropolis whose growth and success is a reflection of the benefits of democracy and free markets.
