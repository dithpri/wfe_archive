[b]Welcome to Trigalaya! [/b]

This small region we call home has a few rules and guidelines. First, please endorse the United Kingdom of Alyqya. Second, make sure to pass a Bill of Rights (You can copy Alyqya&#39;s bill of rights). Finally, Trigalaya does NOT allow any authoritarian nations. Our definition of authoritarian is simply a nation with few civil rights, political freedoms, or top 5% authoritarian or socially conservative. Make sure to join the World Assembly, and endorse de-facto leader Alyqya, due to the departure of our founder.

Have fun, and enjoy.
