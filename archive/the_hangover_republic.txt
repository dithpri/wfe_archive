Welcome to the pillaged lands of the Hangover Republic!

Some FAQ:

- Do you know what happened last night?
No, no I do not.

- Are you okay?
No, no I am not. I believe I am still drunk at the moment.

- Has this region been raided yet?
Not today, perhaps tomorrow.

- Why do people keep trying to raid this place?
That is far beyond my knowledge. I offer no resistance or pride to be won in my conquering.

Raiding this region is like raping a prostitute. You&#39;re not really gaining anything of value, you&#39;re trampling on someone else&#39;s miserable existence, and you&#39;re only making yourself look like a complete douche.
