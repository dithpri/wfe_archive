PyroFalkon ironically discovered the oceans and established the [nation]Falkon Islands[/nation] on Mar 10, 2014.

Invaded by a merry band of pirates near midnight on Sep 1, 2017, led by [nation]RigelsLight 9[/nation]. The pirates briefly took control of the Archipelago, altering the flag, attempting to affect embassies, and stealing all the rum. The invasion was alerted to by the Archipelago&#39;s main ally, [nation]Sharuez Clan[/nation] of [region]The Blacken Wastes[/region]. PyroFalkon of the [nation]Falkon Islands[/nation] quickly reasserted control within a few hours with its navy, but did not ouster the invaders, instead preferring to recapture the rum that had not yet been drunk. PyroFalkon respects the effort.
