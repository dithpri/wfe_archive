[i]&#147;Throughout this whole struggle, we Black students at the school had been ardent supporters of the position of Stalin and the Central Committee. Most certainly we were Stalinists &#150; whose policies we saw as the continuation of Lenin&#146;s. Those today who use the term &#147;Stalinist&#148; as an epithet evade the real question: that is, were Stalin and the Central Committee correct? I believe history has proven that they were correct.&#148;[/i] &#150; [b]Harry Haywood[/b]
