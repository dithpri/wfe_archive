The Galaxy Wars of the Ancient is a place used for Star Wars related Roleplays (RP) along with a Discord Server for Roleplaying and Information. The RPs will be set up in different eras (So Clones and Droids being in the Rise of the Empire Era or New Republic and Imperial Remnant being in the New Republic, New Jedi Order, and Legacy Eras) so make sure you know what eras your faction is in. 

If you wish to join, send me a telegram revealing 1. Why you wish to join, and 2. What your faction will be in the RPs and I will take a few minutes to decide, if I decide to let you in, I shall give you the password, otherwise, I shall tell you that you will not be accepted.
