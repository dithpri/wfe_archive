Welcome to this drab magical land.
This is where I Keep Auzkhia and the redundant puppets.
Other nations are welcome.
Yes this a monarchist region, but not a requirement.
Empires, Kingdoms, Queendoms, Counties, Duchies, Grand Duchies, Principalities, Emirates, Sultanates, Bishoprics, Most Serene Republics, and any other monarchist states are welcome to reside here.
All sapient species are welcomed as well.
