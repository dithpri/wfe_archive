Welcome to this drab magical land.
This is where I Keep Auzkhia and the redundant puppets. Seriously? Why do I have puppets? Who needs puppets?!

Other nations are welcome. You can check out anytime you like but can never leave. Etc.

Yes this a monarchist region, but not a requirement. 
Empires, Kingdoms, Queendoms, Counties, Duchies, Grand Duchies, Principalities, Emirates, Sultanates, Bishoprics, Most Serene Republics, and any other monarchist states are welcome to reside here. 

All sapient species are welcomed as well. Oh and magic, and visit my Yodel Land Pub of Beer, Pretzels and Alpine Chocolate milk. The Ski inclines are elsewhere.
