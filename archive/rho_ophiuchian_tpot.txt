This region can be used for TPOT organizational matters and puppet storage, as opposed to the (now invaded) main TPOT region. As I am the president, I have decided to found this region, to allow us to be protected from random invasions while also being able to use our WA accounts for regional security of the regions of our main nations.

Basically, I want to endorse East Durthang for regional security, but do not want TPOT to be invaded, so I just founded a new region to act as TPOT during the remainder of my presidency.

TG my main, [nation]Rho Ophiuchi[/nation] if you would like to join, and I will give you the regional password.
