The successor interregional alliance to the corrupt, prudish, and conservative NSLeft. The Greater Leftist Coexistence Sphere represents every real leftist on NationStates and consists of the core region, [region]Surpridom of the Left[/region], and multiple satellite regions (Satellite Surpridoms) who are essentially ruled by the same government and whose citizens are considered Comrades and thus have the same rights as citizens in the Surpridom of the Left, such as running for offices in the Surpridom.
