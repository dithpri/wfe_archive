The successor interregional alliance to the corrupt, prudish, and conservative NSLeft. The Greater Leftist Coexistence Sphere represents every real leftist on NationStates and consists of the core region, [region]Surpridom of the Left[/region], satellite regions (Satellite Surpridoms) who are essentially ruled by the same government, and autonomous regions who maintain their own government. All citizens of both satellite and autonomous regions are considered Comrades and share the same rights and can run for office in the Surpridom of the Left.
