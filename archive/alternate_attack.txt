Alternate Attack is a region on Earth(duh) founded by the nation Warrioran. We are fairly new, and made up of nations centered around attacking(not actually possible, but just pretend it is) and the military. If you enjoy having your nation attack(again, not really possible), potential internal wars, or just enjoy strengthening the military, then Alternate Attack might just be the place for you! We are a community who are automatic allies once we are in the region, and we all have each others backs in battle(STILL NOT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE) and almost anything else!
