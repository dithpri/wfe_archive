[i]Be glorius, Fleur De Nationstates.

For you have past the days of glory and thunderstorms.

May you flourish like never before,

But now, rest in peace.

Treasured in my heart you&#146;ll stay, untill we meet again some day.

We miss you very much and love you dearly
We know our God is taking care of you
And you are now one of his special angels
You are forever in our hearts
We can&#146;t wait to be with you again[/i]
