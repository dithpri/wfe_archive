Welcome to Elemental Chaos!

Back in 2014, our region was originally founded by [nation]Aetaris[/nation]. Slowly, over time, as each nation left or CTE&#39;d, our region grew smaller, and was eventually absorbed by our historically good friends over in the [region]Renegade Islands Alliance[/region]. I myself even spent a good while with them, and everyone there is absolutely wonderful and helpful!

Now, January 16, 2021, I&#39;m refounding EC, in a glorious rebirth of the region, and I&#39;d like you to join me!
