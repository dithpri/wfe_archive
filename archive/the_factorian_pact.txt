[b][color=blue]WELCOME TO THE FACTORIAN PACT[/b][/color]

[b][color=blue]The Factorian Pact is built on the foundations set by our three main beliefs and values: Loyalty, Dignity and Respect. We guarantee full aid to all of our nations, be it financial, logistical or militaristic. Our main goal is peace and prosperity but we realize that in the today&#39;s world peace is sometimes only possible through war. We do not tolerate any kind of conflicts and we will surely not ignore any kind of attack on any of our members. We will solve all issues that could damage our members&#39; interest, through dialogue and cooperation, or through military force if needed. Declaration of war to any Pact member will mean the declaration of war to all of Its members.[/color][/b]
