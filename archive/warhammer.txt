[i]Welcome to NationStates premier Warhammer region~![/i]

[center][WIP]Here we offer multiple opportunities with our Warhammer theming, take a look into our lovely role-play (begins right after Franz is elected Emperor, same time as the Warhammer Total War games), work your way up until taking the prestigious title of Emperor of Man in our government. Or, even better yet, take your stab-stabs and WAAAGHs to our raiding team and crush filthy man-things for Gork and Mork and the Horned Rat~![WIP][/center]

As the region is in creation and will be like this for a while, those who join will have the prestigious opportunity of being a part of the Council of the Old Ones; that will have the task of creating exactly how the region will work.
