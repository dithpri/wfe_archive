Welcome to the International Mining Council! Feel free to join if your nation likes mining, or if you&#39;re just a passerby we like you too. We appreciate everybody here, [i]especially those who enjoy searching for those evasive ores[/i], and we would love for you to stay and chat about our region.

The International Mining Council is focused on bringing mining-oriented nations together in peaceful accord and strengthening the might of the mining industry.

If you wish to join the International Mining Council please do so! We are always looking for new members to join our mission of making mining greater. We happen to have an open position for WA Delegate.
