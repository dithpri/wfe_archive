Welcome to [b]ANKH MAUTA[/b]&#153;, an accepting, embassy-friendly region. We&#39;ll take any friendly nation. Possibly by force. We&#39;re tolerant of all beliefs and religions, and request you to be as well. Any who wish to enter, TG [nation]G-Tech Corporation[/nation] or one of our Regional Officers and have a current resident ready to vouch for you.

The first Region to use the &#147;No WA Campaigning&#148; and &#147;P2TM&#148; tags. Because we were hip before it was cool.
