The Zurich forums is where most of our activity takes place and you may request the help of our Armed Forces there. It also contains information such as our Constitution, our Laws, and our Allies. Visit our forums at [b]http://z11.invisionfree.com/Zurich/index.php?[/b] 

Who am I kidding?  Nationstates is DEAD and nobody has been on the forums for over a year.  Zurich is still the most badass region that ever existed though.  That I can promise you.
