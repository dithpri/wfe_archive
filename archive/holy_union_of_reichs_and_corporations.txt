We, the Reichs and the Corporate states, belive in full economic freedom and prosperity. Saftey, strength and economic power is all that matters in our glorious union, socialists, communists and collectivists are not welcome. Healthcare, police and fire departments are not the states responsibility, but the private sectors responsibilty. The private deaths squads, police and military secure a vast amount of jobs and keep our economies strong.
Our peoples wallets come before their freedoms, their freedom to spend is the most important factor. Child gambling and drinking is an important freedom that we must allow within our glorious region.
