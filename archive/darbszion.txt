This region is known for it&#146;s diversity and is mainly inhabited by a species called the Darbs. They are peaceful but some states can be slightly more aggressive but everyone is welcome. Be warned though, we love people, especially those who feel like outsiders or are new to the game. Hope you don&#146;t regret your decision to join us! This is how you get annexed into the rising-to-power Darb Nation. You can always leave and this is also a democracy (unless the Ultimate Leader Maximus changes it). Hope you have fun in this growing community.
