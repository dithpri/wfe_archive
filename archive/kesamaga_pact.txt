Welcome to the Kesamaga Pact!

The Pact is a region - named after the titular Amagatuna capital of Kesamaga - dedicated to the co-benefaction of nations supportive of monarchism, imperialism, anti-communism and pro-statism (Anarcho-monarchism doesn&#39;t count), and/or nations that are monarchies or empires. In other words, we are all about monarchies and empires, so join if you seek to join in the economic welfare and mutual defence pact we offer. For now, it may not be much, but the monarchist powers of the world shall either rise together or fall alone.
