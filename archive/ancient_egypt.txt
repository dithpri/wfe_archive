[color=green]Welcome to Ancient Egypt![/color] This region is, of course, a region that respects to the Ancient Egyptian Gods, such as Anubis, Osiris, Ra, Isis, and so on. Just remember, that upon joining this region, just keep in mind, that forever will you run the risk of being ejected and banned. I hope you accept my apology, The Rejected Realms, but your region is kind of BLAND.
