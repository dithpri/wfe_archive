[B][color=darkred][i]&quot;Let him submit to me! Only the god of death
Is so relentless, Death submits to no one -
So mortals hate him most of all the gods.&quot;[/i][/color]

[hr]Welcome to the dark realm of the Black Legion![color=DarkRed] If you are one of us, welcome home. If you are an outsider, tread lightly.[/color]
[hr][color=darkred]We are the Black Legion. An elite order born of blood and death. Our fighting men relish in the red liqueur of their enemies.[/color] We do not cease, we do not hold, we do not stop, we do not show mercy. We are the blackness of the bleakest night. We are the last thing every man sees before his death. We are the dark cloak whipping in the wind. We are the executioner&#39;s hood.
