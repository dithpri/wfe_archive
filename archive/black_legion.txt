The small but warlike Black Legion is a tightly-knit community of nations that mostly possess large armies and surviving economies. All are welcome to the Legion. While only home to 13 nations, the members of the Legion work together and communicate on a friendly basis. Home to many of the most Inclusive nations in the Census, the Legion also is reputed for its bellicose nature. So basically, we&#39;re both nice AND love to make war!
