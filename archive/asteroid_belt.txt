SPACE SPACE SPACE. SPACE.

Welcome to the Asteroid Belt! As this is a lawless region of space, we can&amp;#39;t exactly guarantee your safety... but it&amp;#39;s certainly entertaining to live all the way out here! 

Nations of all kinds welcomed, although it may be difficult to breathe if you&amp;#39;re a land based nation. Hope you&amp;#39;ve got plenty of oxygen supplies!
