At 6:25 this morning, I, Sealand-the land branch discovered that we, Candyland, we&amp;#39;re being invaded. The invasion started about 18 to 20 hous prior. The invaders were members of The Black Riders, more specifically, The Dissent Quashing Fist of Aurum Riders 119th Treasury,The Allied States of Ehtoaniheasanoeni, andThe Kingdom of SIlver and Green Whirlwind. They have since been ejected and banned, after a very short term takeover. We seem to have been saved by their lack of influence. Were it not for that luck, Candyland would have been lost.
