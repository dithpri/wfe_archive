[i]Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn&amp;#39;t get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I&amp;#39;m back in the USSR
You don&amp;#39;t know how lucky you are boy
Back in the USSR

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia&amp;#39;s always on my mind

Oh, show me around your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy&amp;#39;s farm
Let me hear your balalaika&amp;#39;s ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I&amp;#39;m back in the USSR
Hey you don&amp;#39;t know how lucky you are boys
Back in the US
Back in the US
Back in the USSR[/i]
