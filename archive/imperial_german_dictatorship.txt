This is a fierce and malevolent region, full of dictators and corrupt politicians. It is a very rainy area, about 59% of the time, the sky is gray. This nation has cruel and unusual punishment on a daily basis and these punishments are shown publicly. This is a trigger-happy nation and is not afraid to use atomic warfare. This nation always has war on the mind, and has been known to strike out at other smaller countries for revenge for the smallest reason. This nation is fill of consumerism, mainly weapons are made. Governments are rarely ever used because the dictators are jerks. The suffering of citizens, tourist, and enemies is enjoyed by the dictators and kings. Being gay is wrong.
