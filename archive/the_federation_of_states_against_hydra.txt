As a direct result of the invasion of [region]Alliance of SHIELD[/region], His Holiness, the Glorious Avenger, ruler of [nation]The Union of Mandalorian Erebor[/nation], deemed it necessary to establish a new region devoted to the same cause: the destruction of terror organization HYDRA. Thus, the [region]Federation of States Against HYDRA[/region] (FSAH) was established.

We seek to end the tyranny of pro-HYDRA groups such as the [region]Black Riders[/region], who invaded our previous region.

We are currently seeking a WA Delegate for this region; when one is found, a message to endorse said nation shall be posted.

Interregional assistance shall only be provided through RP.

Justice has a name, and that name (besides justice) is the [region]Federation of States Against HYDRA[/region]!
