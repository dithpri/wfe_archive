The Confederation is a fledgling region whose binding force is an opposition to oppression and the tyranny of dictatorship and fascism. Confederation nations are expected to maintain an amount of freedom, justice, rights, and equality for their citizens. No matter the political philosophy, any nation in the Confederation must be dedicated to allowing their citizens a good life of freedom and fairness.

Equality and Freedom for All!
