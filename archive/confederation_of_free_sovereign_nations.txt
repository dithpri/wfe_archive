The Confederation is a fledgling region whose binding force is an opposition to oppression and the tyranny of fascism. Confederation nations are expected to maintain an amount of freedom, justice, rights, and equality for their citizens, and to be benevolent, regardless of being a republic or a dictatorship. No matter the political philosophy, any nation in the Confederation must be dedicated to allowing their citizens a good life of freedom and fairness.

Nations that lack civil rights in this region are strongly encouraged to fix this issue and allow for more personal freedom.

Equality and Freedom for All!
