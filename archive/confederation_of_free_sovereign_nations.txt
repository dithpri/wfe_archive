[color=scarlet]Did wander darkling in the eternal space,[/color]
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth
[color=scarlet]Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;[/color]
Morn came and went&#151;and came, and brought no day,
[color=scarlet]And men forgot their passions in the dread[/color]
Of this their desolation; and all hearts
[color=scarlet]Were chill&#39;d into a selfish prayer for light:[/color]
And they did live by watchfires&#151;and the thrones,
[color=scarlet]The palaces of crowned kings&#151;the huts,[/color]
The habitations of all things which dwell,
[color=scarlet]Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum&#39;d,[/color]
And men were gather&#39;d round their blazing homes
[color=scarlet]To look once more into each other&#39;s face.[/color]
No respite could be had, nor comfort given,
[color=scarlet]For the [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]foe[/url] had gathered[/color]
And darkness swallowed the sun.[/i]
