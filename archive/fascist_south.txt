[b][region]Facist South[/region] but no Fascist South?[/b]. Were here to change that.

After [nation]Eurasian Commander Sokolov[/nation]&#39;s home in [region]Roses Without Thorns[/region] was burned, he took the liberty in making his own home in Fascistopia, living amongst the smoldering rubble of the ideology he hated. This region was never inhabited, making it a free plot of land to build his home upon.

On October 29th, the Eurasian army, previously guarding the region [region]NationStates Museum of Art[/region] came and secured the region of Fascist South from the Maxtopia Gods, allowing construction to begin.

[b]Glory to Socialism, Glory to Sokolov!.[/b]
