 Messiah&#146;s Crest
Cristi Cacumen
&quot;Hic Regnat Agnus.&quot;
Here reigns the Lamb.
Long before kingdoms rose, a holy hill stood &#151; untouched by time, unknown to kings. Called Messiah&#146;s Crest, or Cristi Cacumen, it is said to be the first place the Verbum Dei (Word of God) touched the earth.
At its summit stands an uncut stone, where a Lamb robed in light was once seen. Pilgrims who climbed its slopes spoke of healing waters, whispering winds, and visions of glory.
Inscribed upon the stone:
&#147;Sanguis ejus terrae vitam dedit.&#148;
His blood gave life to the earth.
Now hidden from the proud, the Crest awaits the return of the Rex Aeternus &#151; the Eternal King &#151; when once more,
&#147;Lux Christi super montem fulgebit.&#148;
The Light of Christ shall shine upon the hill.
