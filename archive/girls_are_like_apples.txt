Girls are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree. The boys don&#39;t want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren&#39;t as good, but easy. So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they&#39;re amazing. They just have to wait for the right boy to come along, the one who&#39;s brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree.
