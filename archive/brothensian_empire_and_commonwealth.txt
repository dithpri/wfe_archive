There once was a kingdom known as the ATORYAN EMPIRE, ruled by an overzealous manchild named STORYAS. The provinces of Brothens and south Brothens, deciding to rebel, combined their arms with the brave, skilled soldiers of Tenburg, and together they fought and won a bloody war against Storyas. As the old empire died, new fledgling nations joined the first three, and a new day dawned, full of hope.
