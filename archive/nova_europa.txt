[b]Welcome to Nova Europa![/b]

Nova Europa is an &amp;quot;alternate version&amp;quot; of modern-day Europe--a region in which players RP Europe-style nations on a RL Europe map.  We encourage players to work individually and in collaboration to build nations with well-developed histories, governments, societies, and cultures that intertwine with others in a way that makes RP fun and interesting for everyone!

Nova Europa is a mature region undergoing a reboot, so players of all ages, sizes, and skill levels are welcome.  Above all else, NE is designed to be a friendly region where fun can be had by all, so don&amp;#39;t be shy--stop by, sign up, and join the fun!
