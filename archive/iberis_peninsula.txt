The Iberis Peninsular is a tropical paradise bordering [nation]Caracasus[/nation]&#146;s Quoris Province. It is a beautiful region with long sandy beaches, coral reefs and a marvelous tropical flora and fauna. The highest point of the region are the Menthi Mountains which almost cut the peninsular in half. Port Parsoh is the region&#39;s only deep water port. For several miles into the ocean the water depth does not exceed three fathoms which make the waters outside Port Parsoh only navigable for small fishing boats.
