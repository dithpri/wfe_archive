Before the name change this region was liberated by the combined forces of [region]Regional Defense Committee[/region], [region]The Red Fleet[/region], [region]MT Army[/region] and [region]Asgard[/region].

[nation=short]Marxist-Feminists[/nation] took the lead with &amp;quot;[b]French Nationalism[/b]&amp;quot; as her puppet and today the region remains under the control of [region]North Korea[/region] and the [region]Korean Peoples Army[/region].
