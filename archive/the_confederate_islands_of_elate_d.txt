The Elate(D) Islands sprang into existence at the time of Hallowe&amp;#39;en, the 2012 World Series and in the run-up to the US Presidential and UK Police Commissioner elections. And Bonfire night. The Islands are a loose confederacy of nations, each of whom seeks to develop a set of alliances and mutual political understandings with their follow nations. 
The objective of the Elate(D) Islands is to foster debate on Issues and, hopefully, to create an issue to present to the World.
