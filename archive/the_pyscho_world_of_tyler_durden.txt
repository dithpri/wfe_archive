[b]In the world I see - you are stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You&#39;ll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life. You&#39;ll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. And when you look down, you&#39;ll see tiny figures pounding corn, laying strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of some abandoned superhighway. [/b]
