A community of roleplayers seeking home after the decline of [region]Southfield[/region], Newfield was a vibrant region owned by [nation]Kanjuura[/nation] until it ceased to exist due to internal divisions and splits. 

If anyone has information on its former flag or other displayable histories, please telegram [nation]Newfield Preservation[/nation]. It will likely not be noticed for a while, but it will be seen eventually.

I will not transfer this region to anyone but [nation]Kanjuura[/nation], who is currently on an extended haitus.

In safekeeping by [nation]Quebecshire[/nation] (a former native/resident roleplayer).
