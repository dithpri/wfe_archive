A large amount of land surrounded by a mountain range. There is only one way in or out, and that is Airborne. This area is very capable of inhabitance for humans and animals, holding multiple biomes, forests, and other landmarks. With a moderate climate it isn&#39;t difficult to live inside, but in the winter they are hit with harsh cold. There are only a few biomes not already taken.
