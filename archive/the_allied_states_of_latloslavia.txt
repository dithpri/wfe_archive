The Allied States of Latloslavia welcomes you. Our Capitalist Coalition does the best in offering the best sensation.

The Allied States of Latloslavia is a fledgling, environmentally stunning nation, remarkable for its strong anti-business policies. The intelligent population of 5 million citizens are prohibited from doing almost everything except voting, which they do timidly and conservatively.

The enormous, socially-minded government juggles the competing demands of Law &amp;amp; Order, Religion &amp;amp; Spirituality, and Commerce. The average income tax rate is 35%, but much higher for the wealthy. Private enterprise is illegal, but for those in the know there is a slick and highly efficient black market in Retail.
