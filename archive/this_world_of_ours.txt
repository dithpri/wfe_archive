Though inhabited by nations with unfamiliar names, this world is not so different from our own. Humans are as irrational as ever, motivated by greed and a lust for power, yet also by strong moral convictions and noble causes. Your nation&#39;s place on the international stage will be decided by the choices it makes in world crises, which themselves will be influenced by your nations statistics. Will you dominate the earth with your powerful military? Will you seek to preserve the natural beauty of the planet? Will you strive to liberate the people of oppressive nations through your diplomatic efforts? In this world of ours, the choice is all yours.
