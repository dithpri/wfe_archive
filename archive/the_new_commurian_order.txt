 I am going against my old region, commuria. I simply have been inactive, and I tried to join commuria once more, but it is locked down, and you need a password. They have made it so that are locked borders, stifling growth, and stopping ones who accidentally been to inactive to not be allowed to be there without signing a citezinship signup, which is very long. Along with this, it seems they are at least do not like communists, as they have a question regarding that. Not only that, but they need you to be active, which limits they&#39;re potential. My new commurian order is a place where a country of any kind can stay, even if they are communist, fascist, or imperialists. This region is also very open to roleplay, as too is Commuria.
