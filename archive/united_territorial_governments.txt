The United Territorial Governments (U.T.G) is a union of local governments that have banded together against the oppression of western influences. Founded in 1941, they are led by an unknown Council, each Government sending a single representative. The people live in a Free Utopia, crime is all but unknown, and all citizens are satisfied and happy. Any rumors of Nuclear weapons and Biological weaponry are to be ignored.
