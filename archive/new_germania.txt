[b]New Germania[/b]

The political union of the sub-continent of New Germania between different colonies and nation states has been a recent development in world history. First introduced at the beginning of WWII, it is now an area of turmoil and competition. 

The union itself functions in a similar fashion to the Holy Roman Empire. With an &#39;Emperor&#39; called the [i]Kaisermeist[/i] and 7 elector states called the [i]Kurf&uuml;rst[/i], New Germania functions as more of a confederation, rather than an empire.
