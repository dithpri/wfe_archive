Anteiku is a region that consists of various nations.
The founder is [nation]Montination[/nation], with a leader who occasionally leaves his domain usually with someone who has gone missing. The local government does nothing about this.

The [nation]Secure Contain Protect Corporation[/nation] has found this to be quite... Intriguing, and with O-5 Council approval, they have set up a local operation to keep an eye on Montination, and its leader.

Many nations have gone missing, including but not limited to...
[nation]Nineeleven jokesareplanewrong[/nation], who was the Manager
