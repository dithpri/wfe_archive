(Soon to be a written story) The Imperium of the Eastern Oceans is heavily influenced and inspired by not only real world events, nations, regions, but also heavily influenced by Papers, Please. Xeria, the most notorious nation of them all, also known for its hostile attitude to those whom oppose them are influenced by the Soviet Union, with blends of Germany during WW2, however not nearly as oppressive. Xeria was once a wonderous nation that dominated a lot of the region, but with Colonial uprisings, politics and wars, Xeria was henceforth turned into the nation it is now. The way of Xeria is to control its nationalist identity, crush the opposition, and shame those who fail their nation, with very little tolerance for failure, and so on.
