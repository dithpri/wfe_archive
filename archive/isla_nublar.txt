A short time ago a mentor and a dear friend Ceased to Exist. We miss him and wish he would return ASAP. He is a large reason I&#39;m still around in NS to leave this message. We even left some messages: http://forum.thenorthpacific.org/topic/9180544/1/

Deropia: You were a light to us in the NPA. When you return, we will accept you with open arms.
