[i][color=green][b]We come from an egg much smaller than the head of a pin.
We live on a spinning rock that one day will crash into a dwarf star.
But we are made of light and poetry and love and filth and death and so much else.
We have been here ever since the beauty of Earth yearned for someone to see her.[/color][/b][/i][hr][b][color=red]The [/color]GDP [color=red]are always hard. 
The [/color]GDP[color=red] tells the truth. 
The [/color]GDP [color=red]never says, &quot;I&#39;m only kidding.&quot; 
War is ugly because the truth can be ugly,
and war is very sincere.[/color][/b]

[b][color=red]Every [/color]GDP[color=red] soldier always was, is, and always will be the instrument of their own salvation.
It&#39;s hard. But there it is.
