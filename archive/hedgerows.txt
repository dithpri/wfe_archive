Hedgerows is a marvelous region, ruled with apparent diplomacy by the current World Assembly Delegate, with the Founder, Yithylvania watching over. The other 3 of the 4 founding fathers take a significantly less involved stance in the regions politics. Randomly bombing neighboring countries is smiled upon, and the occasional invasion of other regions may or may not take place, depending on the capricious nature of the Grand Marshal. Hail Hedgerows.
