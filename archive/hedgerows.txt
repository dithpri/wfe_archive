[colour=blue][b]Fascism[/b] is not tolerated by the sailors of the [b][region]Pacifica[/region] Republican Armada[/b]! This region was the predecessor of [region]the Slide Countries[/region], a fascist-tagged region with embassies with [region]Nazi Europa[/region], [region]Despotic Europe[/region], [region]The Reich[/region] and the like. This region is now under control of [b]Pacifica[/b], as a museum against fascism, which Pacifica is strongly against. Semper Pacifica![/colour]
