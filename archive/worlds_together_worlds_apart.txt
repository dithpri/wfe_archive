An exclusive mountainous region composed of those who believe in tradition, education, and diversity. We are open to those with unique opinion, but we will not tolerate blatant inequality or irreverence. Not for the feeble, the only thing worse than a soft head is a hard heart. Together, we will find the truth at all costs.
