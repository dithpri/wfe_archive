[i][b]The Isles of Haven[/b][/i] is a politicians paradise where the most powerful nation is not the one with the largest military, but instead is the one with the sharpest tongue and keenest mind. The nation that can sway a room with a few well placed words or incite a war with a few choice comments. 

Welcome to The Isles of Haven, where knowledge is truly power.
