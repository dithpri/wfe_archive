Roleplay Free is a region free of roleplay, where member nations use in-game features only without &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;war&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ministries&amp;quot; and the like. There are no offsite forums, maps, etc. It&amp;#39;s a haven where we can quietly get on with the game.

[b]Recruitment policy[/b]

This region does not actively recruit nations. However, member nations are free to invite other nations to our region if you so desire. All nations are welcome, regardless of political or other views. Please note, however, that we do have an agreement with [region]The Free Region[/region] not to invite nations from each other&amp;#39;s regions.
