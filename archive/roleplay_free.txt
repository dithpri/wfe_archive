Roleplay Free is, as its name indicates, a region free of roleplay, where member nations use in-game features only without being pestered with inane chatter about &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;war&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ministries&amp;quot; and the like. There are no offsite forums, no silly maps, or any such things. It&amp;#39;s a haven where we can quietly get on with the game in peace.

By joining our region, you agree not to pester other nations in the region with roleplay requests.

This region does not actively recruit nations. However, all are welcome, regardless of political or other views.
