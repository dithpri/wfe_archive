[b][i][color=Royalblue]Welcome to the Union of Londinium![/i][/b][/color]

[color=Crimson]Priding ourselves on Strength, Unity and Self-Determination, Londinium is a vibrant kingdom of lots of diverse nations. Move your nation here today to help forge a more powerful region and make the most of this incredible oppurtunity.

Our region is a constitutional monarchy, meaning we have an active founder while the people retain most of the power.  All nation types are welcome: please make sure to introduce yourself on the Regional Message Board and join the off site forum (registering under your nation name).[/color]
