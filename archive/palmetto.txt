Bad move. So Ambis called up his friends from [region]Osiris[/region], [region]Ijaka[/region], [region]Sparkalia[/region], [region]Astoria[/region], and [region]The Mystical Alliance[/region] to cause a bit of mischief! Well, they bust in on Mafia Pirate Ships [TM] with us. So thanks to all of you lovely people!
