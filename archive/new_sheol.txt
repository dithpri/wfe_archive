The bible-believing region of New Sheol is known for its white-sand shores, and lush rain-forests. It&amp;#39;s central nation, Ctrico lies to the north east of the region, situated around a volcano, densely populated with rare fruit trees, and a large rain-forest to the north. Nations wishing to enter the region must pass an extensive background check, to confirm its religious intent.
