[region]Lebanon[/region] is the historic home of the Phoenicians, a maritime culture which flourished for more than 2,000 years (2700-450 B.C.). Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, the five provinces that comprise present-day Lebanon were mandated to France. The country gained independence in 1943, and French troops withdrew in 1946. Since then Lebanon has been Independent, Catholic and a major ally to the Western world. As A Mediterranean country the culture and beauty is marred only by socialist and religious extremists attempting to take power.
