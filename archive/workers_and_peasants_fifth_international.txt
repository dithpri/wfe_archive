I welcome you to the Workers&#39; and Peasants&#39; Fifth International, a place for which each nation can spread the seeds of revolution and free the working class of their chains.

&quot;If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.&quot;
-Karl Marx
