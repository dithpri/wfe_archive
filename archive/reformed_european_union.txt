The Reformed European Union promotes the Pan-European project freed from the perceived illnesses plaguing the present European Union. Its core values are &quot;virt&ugrave;&quot;, discipline, morality and self-sufficiency, which it achieves by:

Rejecting status quo politics, meaningless culture wars, and everything that distracts from real issues.
Rejecting individualism, consumerism and hedonism.
Valuing a scientific understanding of the world without falling into mechanism.
Opposing the rule of a corporate oligarchy that controls societal institutions from behind.
Opposing both dogmatism and characterlessness, favouring pragmatism in service of ideals.
