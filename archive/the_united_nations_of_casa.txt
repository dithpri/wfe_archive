Welcome to the United Nations of CASA! [b][color=red](Cours a&eacute;rospatial avanc&eacute;)[/color][/b]

Recruitment telegram is currently pinned on [b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_united_nations_of_casa]The WFE[/url][/b], so feel free to edit it on your own.

Elections should be starting once we get 15 nations, so keep an eye out for that.

We should be getting a regional map pretty soon, along with a forum, 
but as you may know already, [color=yellow][b][i]these things take time[/i][/b][/color], so just be patient and we should have them soon

[b]15 days left![/b]
