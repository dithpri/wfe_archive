Welcome to the United Nations of CASA!

Feel free to make yourself at home here, and telegram the command team if you need anything!

Elections should be starting once we get 15 nations, so keep an eye out for that.

We now have a forum! It is still under construction, and if you have any ideas to improve it please contact [nation]Suvmia[/nation] and tell him what you want changed.
