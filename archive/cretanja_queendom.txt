Created 30th/October/2015 

[color=purple]Cretanja Queendom&amp;#39;s Region[/color] was created to house a safe environment for the Queendom and others if they so choose, to evolve and prosper. Cretanja is a personal region, ruled by the Cretanjan Monarchy. Any nation joining our region [color=red]will be expected to accept[/color] the Sovereignty of the Cretanjan Monarchy over this region. Cretanja Queendom will not interfere with the regions elections for a regional delegate. However, any delegate elected [color=red]must[/color] accept the Queendom&amp;#39;s Sovereignty or else the Ministry of Cretanja will intervene. 

All nations are welcome to join our humble region. We encourage diversity.
