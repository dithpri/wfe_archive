This serves as a place for OGF mappers wanting to role-play.

You may join if:
[list]
[*]You wish to organise role-plays with other OGF users; or
[*]You have a NS nation based on your OGF nation
[/list]

If you&#39;re a regular NS passer-by and wish to get involved, I&#39;m afraid you can&#39;t unless you are an active OGF mapper with your own territory. You may read on how to join and more [url=https://wiki.opengeofiction.net/wiki/index.php/OGF:Frequently_asked_questions]here[/url].
