[b]A jump point refounded by [region]The Black Hawks[/region] in memory of a region that no longer plays NS.[/b]
[hr]
Years ago, Leucippus used to belong to [b]The Autumnal Court[/b], the military of [b][region]Caer Sidi[/region][/b].

However, later, Caer Sidi got rid of its military. After that, the jump point&#39;s founder kept it as a private jump point.

A few years after that, the jump point ended up abandoned and forgotten, with a CTE founder account and only staying alive because of a few puppets moved in by other people.

Later, there were two attempts to raid it, a month after each other. Both got defended. For a month, the region was also taken over by a group of &quot;refugees&quot; from somewhere.

RIP [region]Caer Sidi[/region] on NS 2017-2024. May the force be with you wherever else you are.
