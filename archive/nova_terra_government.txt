This region is a government simulation. Nations with various political leanings are welcome. The WA participation is recommended, and the WA delegate will represent the regional government. The governing nation will appoint ministers, and the remaining nations are free to form an opposition alliance.

You are free to debate, in-character or not, and you will endorse the candidates who you feel are more fit for the region leadership.
