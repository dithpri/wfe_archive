The Netherest Region is so remote that it has, in fact, never been located.  It has only one world, Sovereignia, which has been in The Netherest Region since, oh, I don&amp;#39;t know when.  It was once claimed that Hans Von Schippen-Footwart had &amp;quot;discovered&amp;quot; the region and founded Sovereignia, but research has shown that he never came closer than 30 feet.
