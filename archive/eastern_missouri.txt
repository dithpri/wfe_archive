This region has been liberated by the Interregional Defence Pact.

To the founder of this region I am sorry that so much damage has been done to your region also if you want some more information on what happened, would like support in rebuilding your region or you would like your to join our defence pact then send a telegram to [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation]. Also once you become active just dismiss the IDP defence assistant since you will no longer need it.
