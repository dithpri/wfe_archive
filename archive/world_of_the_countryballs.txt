[color=indigo][b][i]Welcome, countryballs![/color]

You must make an countryball account like me to enter. If you aren&#39;t countryball, then USSR will come and find you and eat you whole. So have fun roleplaying and meetings as a countryball! If an nation already has a name such as Italy Ball, then they must put a &quot;2&quot; at the end such as &quot;Italy 2&quot;. Same with a third person, such as &quot;Italy 3&quot; and so on. VIVA LA COUNTRYBALL![/i][/b]
