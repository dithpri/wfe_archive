India. The name Bh&amp;#257;rata (&amp;#2349;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2352;&amp;#2340;) came from emperor Bharata and it has been used as a self-ascribed name by people of the Indian subcontinent and the Republic of India. The designation Bh&amp;#257;rata appears in the official Sanskrit name of the country, Bh&amp;#257;rata Ga&amp;#7751;ar&amp;#257;jya. The name is derived from the ancient Hindu Puranas, which refer to the land that comprises India as Bh&amp;#257;ratavar&amp;#7779;a (Sanskrit: &amp;#2349;&amp;#2366;&amp;#2352;&amp;#2340;&amp;#2357;&amp;#2352;&amp;#2381;&amp;#2359;, lit. country of Bharata) and uses this term to distinguish it from other var&amp;#7779;as or continents. For example, the Vayu Puranas say &quot;he who conquers the whole of Bh&amp;#257;ratavar&amp;#7779;a is celebrated as a samr&amp;#257;t (Vayu Purana 45, 86).&quot;
