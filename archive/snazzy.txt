We serve wine, vodka, and margaritas. Drinks are on the house and bottomless.[hr]

[b]Yes, yes, zombies.[/b] As with all things Snazzy, do whatever. Cure a plague victim. Kill a civilian. Bite through a coworker&amp;#39;s skull (don&amp;#39;t be unreasonable, we don&amp;#39;t want to see any eye-eating). Ignore the feature. S&amp;#39;all good, let&amp;#39;s see who wins.

Happy Halloween/Boo Humbug, everybody!
