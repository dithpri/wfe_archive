This region of United States in Skyview is committed to being the most excellent region of them all. We will succeed in all endeavors we begin. By allowing you into our great region, we trust you will have integrity to uphold our code of conduct. Its stormy here, but rivers run dry. We pride ourselves in our trout fishing industry by the coast. 

We have opposition from the district of Vancouver, but we will prevail through the trials.
