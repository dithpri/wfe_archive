Queen Mary of Scots spent her childhood on foreign soil, France. After the death of her beloved husband, she returned to Scotland to take back her throne. Yet, she found her country divided into factions and between Catholics and Protestants. Thus, this region is struggling under Vatican&#39;s pressure, the threat of the Virgin Queen of England, Elizabeth and reverent Jhon Knox. Mary wishes to unite her crown with the English crown. Thus, it is important to have stability in this region. Our queen shall gain her power back and conquer the British Isles.

Long live the Queen!
