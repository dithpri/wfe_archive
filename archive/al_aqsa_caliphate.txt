The Muslim Ummah was divided by the various ideologies that spread throughout the world. Thus, al-Aqsa came to join the hearts of the people. They can break through us when we are divided, but never when we are one unit. The Caliphate emerged from Jerusalem, hence its name. We are the people of Ahlul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&amp;#39;ah (i.e. following orthodox Sunni Islam).

[b][i]&quot;Say: &#39;Allah, O Lord of the Kingdom, You give kingdom to whom You will, and take away kingdom from who You will; and You bestow honour on whom You will, and bring disgrace to whom You will. In Your hand lies the betterment. You are surely powerful over everything.&#39;&quot; (3:26) [/i][/b]
