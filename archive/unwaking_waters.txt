Previously the site of a floating temple known as Kuan Jun, the Harvest Temple, the Unwaking Waters is an immense, frozen whirlpool. When the Jade Winds passed over Cantha and Kuan Jun sunk beneath the ocean&#39;s surface, the whirlpool was formed, and like everything else in the path of the winds, became solid jade. Legends say a powerful dragon was trapped within the temple and lives there still.
