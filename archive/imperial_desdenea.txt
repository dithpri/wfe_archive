A Region founded by and named after a majestic and progressive nation whose citizens have hearts like lions and their cries are heard by the LORD.
Imperial Desdenea seeks to fight injustice and inequality throughout nationstates by the expansion of a policy of mass-communication, open-trade, and having as many trustworthy allies and embassies as possible. Only with light can we rid ourselves of the darkness, only with love can we rid ourselves of hate.

We stand for truth and honor, and do not condone ideologies which promote racial hatred and/or racial division. Fascists go home!
