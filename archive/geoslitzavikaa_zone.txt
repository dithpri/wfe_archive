[b]Welcome to the Wonderful Region of [color=purple]Geoslitzavikaa Zone[/color]! We do not classify ourselves as a Democracy or Monarch or Communism or any of that pointless crap that regions use to make themselves sound important. Instead, we are [color=gold]Originalists[/color]. We live to make ourselves stand out among the rest, whether we make it a good thing or bad. We don&amp;#39;t care. When you strive for being [color=gold]Original[/color], then you are [color=green]TRUE[/color] citizen of the [color=purple]Geoslitzavikaa Zone[/color].[/b]
