Z-Day Information

The region will go into lockdown once Z-Day begins.  [nation]TheStonedSurfers[/nation] and his puppets that reside in here will be working on researching the cure.  The more who do this, the faster it&#39;s developed, the faster it rolls out, the faster everyone survives and Z-Day is over.  If you leave the region while it is in lockdown, you will not be permitted reentry until Z-Day concludes.  Cure missiles are the only approved attack for the region.  People killing zombies will be booted until after Z-Day.

Thank you,
