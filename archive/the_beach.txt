Welcome to The Beach.

Lots of sunny, tropical beaches to rest and relax.  Have your drinks served to you by cabana folks, each drink with an umbrella no matter what kind it is.  Fight over the WA Delegacy.  It&#39;s non-executive, so it doesn&#39;t matter.  Just be cool to each other. 

Peace!
