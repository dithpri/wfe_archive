Z-Day 11 Update:

The region is cured.  We have reached a 100% survival rate with zero dead citizens.  Thank you for helping.  We are currently ranked #51 in all of NS for most survivors + no zombies.

Welcome to The Beach.

Lots of sunny, tropical beaches to rest and relax.  Have your drinks served to you by cabana folks, each drink with an umbrella no matter what kind it is.  Fight over the WA Delegacy.  It&#39;s non-executive, so it doesn&#39;t matter.  Just be cool to each other. 

Peace!
