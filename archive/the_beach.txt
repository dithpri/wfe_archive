Welcome to The Beach.

Lots of sunny, tropical beaches to rest and relax.  Have your drinks served to you by cabana folks, each drink with an umbrella no matter what kind it is.  The WA Delegacy is non-executive, so no requirements to endorse anyone, though your loving Founder could use two endorsements to help expand his ability to debate in the WA LOL.

Peace!
