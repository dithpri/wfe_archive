[b]WELCOME TO THE BEACH![/b]

You step out onto the golden strand while an azure sky stretches to meet a sapphire ocean.  The waves belt out Neptune&amp;#39;s symphony as the laughing gulls sing its joyful chorus.  The long, lazy days of summer speak to your soul melting the stress of everyday life into a distant memory.  You&amp;#39;ve found The Beach!

There are no tech limits here.   We&amp;#39;re also open to all players.  Doesn&amp;#39;t matter to us if your nation is an evil empire, a gentle republic, or an anarchists wet dream.  We&amp;#39;re  all here to have fun, and all are welcome to join!

Thanks for being here!
