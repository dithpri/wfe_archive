By order of the Big Kahuna, His Totally Awesomeness, TheStonedSurfers: 

The regional borders will be reopened in a few hours once our populations return to normal.  Those who come to our region to turn our survivors into undead hordes, and those already resident in the region who wish to do the same, shall be banned from the region until the termination of this event.
