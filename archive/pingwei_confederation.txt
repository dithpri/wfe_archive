[hr][color=#003366]The PingWei Confederation, sometimes referred to as the Confederation, is a small region, which is currently seeking to expand. The Confederation is a mostly isolationist region, but has had feuds with raiders.  Citizens of the PingWei Confederation tend to look to the Separatist States, the largest nation and founder, for guidance.

The PingWei Confederation consists of very contrasting nations, but these differences are of no importance, as the nations aim to accomplish shared goals.

Due to a history of raider attacks, the Confederation has closed its once open borders.  New nations are still welcomed with open arms, but entrance to the region requires a password.
