Isildur&#39;s sons were killed in that battle, while he attempted to escape using the power of invisibility of the One Ring. He ran and tried to cross the Anduin. But the [nation]Bane of Isildur[/nation] had slipped from his finger and when he stood up he was seen by Orcs and was slain by their arrows.

Of the two hundred N&uacute;men&oacute;reans only three survived. Two of them were [nation]Ohtar[/nation] and his companion who brought the [nation]Shards of Narsil[/nation] to Rivendell. The third was [nation]Estelmo[/nation], Elendur&#39;s esquire. He was stunned and not slain, and was later found alive.
