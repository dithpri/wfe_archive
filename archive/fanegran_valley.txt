[sub]The valley of faNegran, as the Sakkare people call it, is a valley in the Central Eurasian steppe, and the predominant home for the Sakkare. The Sakkare&#39;s home is bordered to the south by the steep mountains along the Issyk Kul lake; to the east by the imposing Tien Shan; to the north by the beaches of the Kapshagay; and to the west by the endless plains where the Kyrgyz make their homes. In the summer, they migrate north, 290 miles, to the shores of Lake Balkhash, so the fields for the sheep and goats can regrow.[/sub]
