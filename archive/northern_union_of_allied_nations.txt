A region in the northern hemisphere comprised of nations who have taken an oath of alliance with their neighbors.

In order to join the NUAN, one must send a telegram to the Federal Republic of Lilisia or to the WA Delegate with your agreement to the oath. The oath must be agreed to before you can receive the password.

Here is a copy of the oath:
I, (your country name here), hereby take a pledge of allegiance to the members of the NUAN. I will be helpful to and respectful of fellow members of the NUAN, and I will offer assitance if needed.
Additionally, I will also do my best to wisely govern my nation&amp;#39;s people.
This I swear before the stars above.
