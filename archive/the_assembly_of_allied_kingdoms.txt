[b]The Assembly of Allied Kingdoms is the bastion for just monarchs and their righteous subjects in these chaotic times of social democracies and other anarchies. All members have the right of council in Assembly Court and the right to allied protection from all non-allied agents.

All Assembly members have the right to rule their states how they see fit, as long as they maintain strict political and social order, and as long as their states are monarchies or vassals of a monarchy. The point of the Allied Assembly is to protect and support just and righteous monarchies, and their Divine Right to rule.
