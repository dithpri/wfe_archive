The Meridian Belt is a region of stark contrasts, where nostalgia meets modern industry. At its core lies Aurora, a barren expanse dominated by corporate giants, its landscape shaped by metallic towers and relentless innovation. Beyond the wasteland, Verdant. Fertile plains and misty hills host thriving nations that preserve old traditions, sustaining themselves through advanced irrigation and trade. A land of survival and adaptation, the Meridian Belt is torn between the echoes of history and the march of progress.
