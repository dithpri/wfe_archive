&quot;Ness, you&#39;ve stood on the eight power spots of the earth. From these, you created Magicant, the realm of your mind. In Magicant, there&#39;s beauty, kindness, sorrow, and hatred. Of course, there&#39;s an evil and violent side of you. The Sea of Eden sits at the center of those feelings. It takes you to the truth about yourself.&quot;
