Yet another totalitarian region has been destroyed by the [color=darkred]Korean[/color] [color=darkblue]Brigade[/color] of the [region]Libertatem[/region] [color=green]Army[/color]!

Originally founded by [nation=short]The Great North Korea[/nation], the &amp;#39;Juchism&amp;#39; isn&amp;#39;t fighting for workers&amp;#39; rights; it&amp;#39;s just a modified version of Nazism. And like its spiritual predecessor the Third Reich, the North Korean government has murdered millions in its quest for conformity, racial purification and absolute power.

This region is dedicated to the North Korean people, who have suffered for too long under the hands of tyrants foreign and domestic. May they one day see liberty under a free market and a free ballot box.
