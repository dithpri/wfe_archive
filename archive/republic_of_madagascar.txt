Madagascar, a huge island nation off the southeast coast of Africa, is home to thousands of animal species &#150; like lemurs &#150; found nowhere else, plus rainforests, beaches and reefs. Near the busy capital, Antananarivo, is Ambohimanga, a hillside complex of royal palaces and burial grounds, as well as the &#147;Avenue of the Baobabs,&#148; a dirt road lined by massive centuries-old trees.
