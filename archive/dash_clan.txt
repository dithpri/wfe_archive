Dedicated to all things Rainbow Dash, Dash Clan is an organization which actively promotes Dash-related products, industries, legislative decisions, and so forth. We seek peace through strength and strength through friendship.

Join us, or don&#39;t. It&#39;s really up to you I guess. But you should consider it.
Seriously, we&#39;re pretty legit.
