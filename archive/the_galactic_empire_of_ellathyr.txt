After mastering FTL technology, the Ellathyrians became a primarily nomadic people in space. Their capital ship was re-christened after their forgotten capital city, Kyandall and it is capable of housing approximately 25% of the Flotilla&#39;s population, including the government. 

This galaxy spanning Empire has outposts in every corner of the universe, with a few smaller Earth-like planets colonised. The majority of the fleet roams from system to system, harvesting, conquering, terra-forming and colonising before moving on. 

60% of Ellathyr&#39;s population roam as part of the flotilla. The remaining 40% live on stations or small planets doted throughout the Galactic Empire.
