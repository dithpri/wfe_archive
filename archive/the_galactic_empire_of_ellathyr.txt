After mastering FTL technology, the Ellathyrians became a primarily nomadic people in space. Their capital ship was re-christened after their forgotten capital city, Kyandall and it is capable of housing seven hundred and fifty million people simultaneously. This galaxy spanning Empire has outposts in every corner of the universe, with a few smaller Earth-like planets colonised. The majority of the fleet roams from system to system, harvesting, conquering, terra-forming and colonising before moving on. 60% of Ellathyr&#39;s population, including its leadership, roam as part of the flotilla. The remaining 40% live on stations or small planets doted throughout the Galactic Empire.
