Located on a rather isolated continent, The Borderworlds is as geographically diverse as it is ethnically decentralized. With red-sanded deserts stretching miles in every direction, lush rainforests that contain some lands never before seen by human eyes, and savannahs that hold the majority of trade centres, The Borderworlds are also home to hundreds of independent tribes and cultures that all view the land-locked continent as their home.

The law of the indigenous peoples is clear: all may walk the red sands but none may claim them under dominion. This has allowed many factions to develop... either to co-operate or to eventually seize control of the continent through intrigue or fire.
