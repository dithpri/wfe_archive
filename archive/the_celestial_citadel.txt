This Citadel Lies between the 2 Realms of Reality and Dreams, a &quot;[color=purple]Celestial Citadel[/color]&quot; of sorts. This Citadel Acts as the bridge between these 2 worlds and allows for people to pass through both realms, on purpose or not.

Welcome to the [color=purple]Celestial Citadel[/color], a nice place in-between the 2 realms, enjoy yourself a Galactic Cup of Hot Chocolate in this region mainly used by [region]Sky Haven[/region] to store their little side nations/puppets.
