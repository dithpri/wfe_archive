A continent in the far east covered in dense jungle and colonized by the Freehold.

In antiquity it was scarcely explored, and half-legendary and only known of through hazy traveler&#39;s tales. All that men from Otira knew about Ulthos were secondhand reports from travelers: these reports did not specify whether Ulthos was an entirely new continent, a large island, or a subcontinent/extension of another continent.
