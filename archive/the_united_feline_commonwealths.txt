Welcome to the United Feline Commonwealths! This is a region dedicated to cats, as you might be able to tell by the name, but we welcome all nations anyway, cat lovers or not. We are primarily left wing in our views, but we really don&amp;#39;t care if you disagree with us entirely, so long as you don&amp;#39;t try to force your opinions down our throat.

So feel free to make a home for yourself here, we&amp;#39;d be happy to have you!

[nation]Palidrade[/nation], our Delegate, is running a map thing at the moment, but I don&amp;#39;t have the files to set that up right now, so I&amp;#39;ll leave this here to be fixed up.

Thanks for reading, and bai bai raiders, I hope you enjoyed your two hours of control!
