[color=orange][b]Welcome to the United Feline Commonwealths![/b][/color]

We&amp;#39;re a region dedicated to ailurophilia (cat-loving), but if you&amp;#39;re a dog or bird or hybrid-elephant person, we don&amp;#39;t mind. Our political standings are primarily left-leaning, though we don&amp;#39;t judge people by their actions. (If your country has however, a bad human rights history, then we&amp;#39;re onto you). Please do be social, as we love to talk to all types of people.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you love your time here!
