Welcome! We are the UFC, a group of cat loving peoples. But you can come here even if cats aren&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;re thing we&amp;#39;ll welcome you anyway, be nice to us and we&amp;#39;ll like you.

We&amp;#39;re a mainly left-leaning region but we don&amp;#39;t really care what your views are so long as you don&amp;#39;t try and
a) convert us or
b) be an *insert expletive here* about it
so please feel free to join whatever your political leanings. We promise we&amp;#39;ll be nice to you.

[color=darkblue][b]Oh and raiders I got bored of this and made us non-exec with the exams I have at the moment I really don&amp;#39;t have time to keep doing this. I may change it back in Summer guys.[/b][/color]
