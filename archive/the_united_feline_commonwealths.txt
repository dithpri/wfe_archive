[b]Welcome to the UFC![/b]

This is a region dedicated to cats, but we really don&amp;#39;t care if that isn&amp;#39;t your thing, so long as you&amp;#39;re friendly, we&amp;#39;re happy to have you. We&amp;#39;re primarily left-leaning, but so long as you don&amp;#39;t try and force your views down our throats, we don&amp;#39;t mind if you disagree. Please give hugs (endorse) to Delegate [nation=short]Palidrade[/nation] and Founder [nation=short]Xarion[/nation], because they like &amp;#39;em.

[b][color=red]Raiders - SKEDADDLE. The Founder and Delegate are both active and we&amp;#39;ll ban and eject you from the region. If you&amp;#39;re revenge from the nation War Dragon or Nugut, shoo. Troublemakers will also be thrown in the Chokey.[/color][/b]

We hope you enjoy your time here!
