Krasnovodsk, now called T&uuml;rkmenba&amp;#351;y, is a port city on the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan. Situated at the western end of the Trans-Caspian Railway, it serves as a gateway to Central Asia. The city is known for its arid desert surroundings, oil refining industry, and proximity to the picturesque Awaza resort area. Despite its industrial focus, T&uuml;rkmenba&amp;#351;y boasts historical significance and serves as a key transportation and economic hub for the region. Its name change reflects Turkmenistan&#39;s post-Soviet national identity.
