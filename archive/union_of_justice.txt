Built from the ashes of The [region]Union of The Seekers[/region] after it&#39;s cleansing of nations that disagreed with the founder. The region strives to restore what had been lost to time and reform the glory of the UOTS. The Union of Justice welcomes all within our noble halls, and we practice the true arts of Freedoms of Expression, Press and Speech.
