The Grand Empire, in your tongue. We are led by the Emperor, or Caesar. I am the current emperor, Lanius, which gives me the rank of Lanius Caesar. I also lead the nation of Proviniae Imperii, or the Imperial Provinces. Your nation may join as long as you do not prove yourself as a nuisance, or you will be dealt with. You may rule your own nation as you like, as long as you do not tarnish our name.
