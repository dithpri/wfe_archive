[b]The [color=blue]Refugee Crisis Centre[/color] (RCC) is an international organization and center for refugee nations fleeing invaded, attacked, communist, fascist, war or religious intolerant regions.[/b] 

As a international refugee organization, our goal is to provide care and need for those in danger. We provided temporary residency and protection at the Refugee Crisis Centre, but our main goal is to provide each and every refugee a permanent region to be apart of. We are partnered with many registered regions, who have enacted laws regarding temporary or permanent asylum to those in danger.
