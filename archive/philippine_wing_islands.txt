This is a region of 32,010 islands that form the visualized &amp;quot;Wings&amp;quot; of the Philippines. These islands were formed as a result of a recent tectonic activity. The islands were uninhabited until Palompian settlers came and dominated the islands. Then Hierosolima was founded, which is a Judeo-Christian Empire and served as the Shield of Palompia, defending themselves from surrounding unholy, rogue nations.
