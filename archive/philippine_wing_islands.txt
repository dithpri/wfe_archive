[b][i]&quot;United with God&#39;s Kingdom...&quot;[/i][/b]

 This is a region of 32,010 islands that form the visualized &quot;Wings&quot; of the [region]Philippines[/region]. These islands were formed as a result of a recent tectonic activity. The islands were uninhabited until Palompian settlers came and dominated the islands. Then [color=green]Hierosolima[/color] was founded, which is a Judeo-Christian Empire and served as the Shield of [nation=short]Palompia[/nation], defending themselves from surrounding unholy, rogue nations.

   Righteousness exalts in the nations of this region, as they claimed, &quot;God Almighty is all that we praise, nations without him cannot stand forever.&quot; they vary upon government types, but still with unbroken ties with God&#39;s laws.
