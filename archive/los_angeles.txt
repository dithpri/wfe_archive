[b][color=black]I&#146;m tired of crying
For refugees, for amputees,
I&#146;m tired of crying
For the pain of the third world,
The poor unfortunates of Hiroshima, Bikini,
I&#146;m tired of crying
America ... America,
I&#146;m tired of crying for America.

I&#146;m tired of crying
For collecting boxes, for noble causes,
For victims, more victims,
Victims of violence, and protection,
Victims of privilege,
More violence, more victims

I&#146;m tired of crying, it changes nothing
The decay, the decaying,
I&#146;m tired of crying
For the broken backs and the broken dreams

ain&#39;t no decency in being boxed up alive, 
Look around, ain&#39;t no R.I.P. signs here,
