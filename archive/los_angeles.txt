[b][color=black]Our civilization is coming to an end. 
Not at some philosophical point in the future, but soon. 
The death throes of humanity will be a carnival of indescribable horror which I will now describe. 
At the zoo wild animals will form a dignified queue as they wait for the Elephants to stamp them to death. 
Watching Lions and Tigers being trodden like grapes, humans will attempt to join them, 
and Elephants will use their trunks to pull their heads off like champagne corks to the ecstatic applause of the sea lions.
Life on earth is over, and we can mope about it or we can enjoy the relief of knowing that nothing matters anymore. 
You made it to the end of the game. 
The movie is over, and we&#39;re living in the blooper reel....
