The Queendom of the Succubi stands for the unchained will of humanity, the pursuit of one&amp;#39;s desires free of the &amp;#39;morality&amp;#39; imposed on us by tyrannical religions and false gods. Power is taken by those who have the merit, courage and ambition earn and seize it. With power comes the freedom to pursue one&amp;#39;s desires.

We use the mythical demon of temptation - the Succubus - as our symbol, because of what it represents - the temptation to follow one&amp;#39;s desires. Freed from the chains of &amp;#39;morality&amp;#39;, we seek to free the human will, because unrestrained, there is almost no limit to what it can achieve.
