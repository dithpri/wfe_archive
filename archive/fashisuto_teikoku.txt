Anti-individualistic, we stress the importance of the government and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with those of his nation, which stands for the conscience and the universal, will of man as a historic entity.

We rejects the absurd conventional lie of political equality, the habit of collective irresponsibility, the myth of felicity and indefinite progress.
