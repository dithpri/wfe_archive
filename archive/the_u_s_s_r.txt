The Second Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, better known as the USSR or SUSSR, is a modified version of its predecessor, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which was founded in 1922. The Second USSR is founded on the basic principles of equality, and freedom for the working class. The SUSSR strives to create a classless society, in which all citizens function as a collective, where all can be accepted, and where all are free from the opressive forces of Capitalism.
