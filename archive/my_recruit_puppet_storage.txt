Exactly what it looks like. Please move to [region]The Holy Reich of Bunicken[/region]

*Clears throat* *Reads word by word from notecards in a clear, mundane voice devoid of emotion* Join the Holy Reich of Bunicken today, or more specifically, the &quot;House&quot;(similar to political parties) of Mori. As this system is new we have a clean slate to build on and rise to power. Participate in roleplay, regional government, and politics. Telegram me, The Sovereignty Nation of The Sorcerer Kingdom to join and complain about this spam (which, for clarification, will only happen every 24 hours or 10 posts, as in compliance with the game rules). Now excuse me as I move on to the annoy other people.
