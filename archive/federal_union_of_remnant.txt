The government of the Federal Union of Remnant was founded in 2017 by admins of a RWBY fan page (Tyrian &amp; Winter) who wanted to start a regional government for members of the RWBY FNDM. There is little known about the new political union except that it has executive, legislative &amp; judicial branches of it&#39;s government. The legislative government is represented by 1 delegate of each Kingdom in Remnant (Vale, Atlas, Vacuo, Mistral).
