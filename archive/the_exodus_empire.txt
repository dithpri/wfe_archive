[b]Welcome to The Exodus Empire![/b] 

Founded on the basis of individual rule unless intervention is required, The Exodus Empire provides nations to rule their country freely while provided protection from within. 

The Exodus Empire encourages nations to actively participate in global politics through the World Assembly but does not require member nations to partake if they wish to refuse entry; Because of this, World Assembly law is NOT universally recognized. In it&#39;s place, Regional Laws may be passed or challenged during Regional Assembly meetings.

Founder: [nation]Nuke Land[/nation]
