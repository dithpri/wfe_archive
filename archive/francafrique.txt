Fran&ccedil;afrique (French pronunciation: &amp;#8203;[f&amp;#641;&amp;#593;&amp;#771;saf&amp;#641;ik]) is France&#39;s relationship with its former African colonies. It was first used in a positive sense by President F&eacute;lix Houphou&euml;t-Boigny of C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire, in allusion to that country&#39;s economic growth and political stability under its alliance with France.
