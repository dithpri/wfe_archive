Here thee, here thee, thy region of Stapangaea was officially founded in order to maintain balances between thine countries, tis the land of one person only, and only him shall be able to accept or deny entry into this sacred land. Rise and awaketh thine souls and become one with this kingdom that is hereby declared founded and established.
