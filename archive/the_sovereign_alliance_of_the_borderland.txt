[b][color=red]Welcome![/color][/b]

I am [nation]Sterbenia[/nation], I am the Leader of [region]The Sovereign Alliance of The Borderland[/region].
This region is [i]debate friendly[/i]. Please no crude language, as we will kick you if you step over the line too many times.
[u]Ask me for the password.[/u]
We are looking to grow our region, so if you want a region that you can quickly gain power in, this one is perfect.
Sorry, but we don&amp;#39;t use skype.
We may have a forum up and running soon, so be patient.
