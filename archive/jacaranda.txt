Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone, help
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody&#39;s help in any way
But now these days are gone, I&#39;m not so self assured
Now I find I&#39;ve changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I&#39;m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won&#39;t you please, please help me
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I&#39;ve never done before
Help me if you can, I&#39;m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won&#39;t you please, please help me
