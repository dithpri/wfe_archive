Area 17 is a Britannian possesion in the South East Asia, consisted of what once called the Indonesian Archipelago.
After Area 17 was conquered sometime between 2017 a.t.b., shortly before the Holy Britannian Empire conquered the Middle Eastern Federation (Area 18). Area 17 is a developing area, with beautiful view of green archipelago and lush tropical forests. Its capital (and largest city) is Jakarta Settlement, and its a home of about 37 million Britannians and 202 million &quot;Seventeens&quot;.
Despite being a colonial possesion, Area 17 is still a fairly democratic region, where the members of the Regional Senate can elect its own Viceroy from the potential candidates presented by the Government of the Holy Britannian Empire.
