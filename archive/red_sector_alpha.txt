I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, merging Into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. My friend Jon says it&amp;#39;s nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under The Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.
