&amp;#39;I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, merging 
Into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as 
They trace their way across the steely sky. I used to think I had a pretty good life here, 
Just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple 
Paper in the evening. 

&amp;#39;My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer 
Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under 
The Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.
