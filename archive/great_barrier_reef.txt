A request from Atrulia he would like you to sign this petition: [url=https://www.change.org/p/nationstates-moderating-team-the-moderators-have-gone-too-far-nationstates]This petition[/url]

[color=red][B]Attention:[/B]

Atrulia is now DoS which means this region will slowly begin to decline and is now a target for raids. 

Atrulia&#39;s request is that everyone move to http://www.nationstates.net/region=hearth_of_hestia

I suggest that everyone do so in order to keep the community intact. Thank you![/color]
