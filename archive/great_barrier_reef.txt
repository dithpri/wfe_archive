Welcome to the former home of some Iwaku Refugees!
 
I call to all natives, to join the world assembly and to endorse [nation]The like nation[/nation] and vice-delegate [nation]Absolnia[/nation] for our regional security program. The endorsement cap is 2 for nations who endorse the delegate, and the vice delegate. [b]NOTE[/b] to all new nations and current WA members. If you do [i]NOT[/i] endorse these two nations within 24 hours of your WA delegate membership, you will be ejected for 24 hours. After that time is up you will be allowed to rejoin. (unless of course, you&#39;re a raider).
