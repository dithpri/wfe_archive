[nation=short]Absolnia[/nation]: Welcome to the former home of some Iwaku Refugees!
After the death of everyone&#39;s friend, Atrulia, this region has been raided, ridiculed, and ruined. Now I, [nation=short]Absolnia[/nation], am going to make this region great again.
But... This is a founder less region. And I don&#39;t have the time to maintain it. That is why I am making this a memorial to Atrulia. 


[nation=short]Gurkland[/Nation]: And me, its  [nation=short]Gurkland[/nation], his assistant. I call to all natives, to join the world assembly and to endorse [nation=short]Absolnia[/nation] for our regional security program. All countries outside the  Great Barrier Reef are invited to stop here to give  the essential contribution to strengthen this great place by helping us with their endorsements.
