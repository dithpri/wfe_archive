[color=2d79df]Hello everyone, and welcome to Great Barrier Reef! We are a kind and accepting region, where anyone is welcome! [/color]

[color=2d79df]Please tell your friends to join here too! I also send out recruitment telegrams on a regular basis~[/color]

[color=green]Be careful falling in love here! We have quite a lot of [/color][color=red]yanderes![/color]

[color=Edd721]Reading the rules is optional, but it&#39;ll still be your fault if you break one![/color]

[color=AD1453]Listen to [nation=short]Shimada Arisu[/nation]![/color]

[color=red][B]Attention:[/B]

Atrulia is now DoS which means this region will slowly begin to decline and is now a target for raids. 

Atrulia&#39;s request is that everyone move to http://www.nationstates.net/region=hearth_of_hestia

I suggest that everyone do so in order to keep the community intact. Thank you![/color]
