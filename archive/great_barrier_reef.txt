Welcome to the former home of some Iwaku Refugees!
After the death of everyone&#39;s friend, Atrulia, this region has been raided, ridiculed, and ruined. Now I, [nation=short]Absolnia[/nation], am going to make this region great again.
But... This is a founder less region. And I don&#39;t have the time to maintain it. That is why I am making this a memorial to Atrulia. 


[nation=short]Gurkland[/Nation]: And me, its  [nation=short]Gurkland[/nation], his assistant. I call to all natives, to join the world assembly and to endorse [nation=short]Absolnia[/nation] and [nation]The Like nation[/nation] for our regional security program. The goal is to empower  the delegate enough for the password-building campaign and therefore protect the entrance to this place from the menace of raiders. Safeguard this region! Act now and be a proud native!
