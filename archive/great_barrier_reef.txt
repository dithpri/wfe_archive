[b][i]On behalf of [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], welcome to beautiful Great Barrier Reef![/i]

Here, we enjoy a scenic view and beverages. While the founding nation perished as a result of violating the rules that keep us safe and this world secure, [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] seeks to provide a stable, inviting atmosphere.

While we will only be here for a short while, uninvited non-native inhabitants may be removed if their intentions are suspect. You are invited to endorse the delegate, [nation=short]Vyrhana[/nation], and inform them of how you would like them to vote on any current World Assembly matters.

Native inhabitants of this region are also invited to [url=http://s1.zetaboards.com/Invader_Haven]come to our forums[/url] or join us in friendly banter on the Regional Message Board.
