Long a desolate and neglected region, the large island of Aeanoropia and its sprawling archipelagos proved a sanctuary for the old Iba Oredian peoples. Political strife led to fragmentation- the Monarchy of Sulith in the west, the Republic of Gothulaka in the south, Iba Wasal in the west, Iba Ored Yutu in the north and east, and Iba Ored Aeanoropia in the east. Recently, the Guritri have permanently moved into the southern islands. Every recognized nation in Aeanoropia is a voting member in the Aeanoropian Council; the Republic of Guritri is allowed observer status, as the question of their legitimacy is currently being debated.
