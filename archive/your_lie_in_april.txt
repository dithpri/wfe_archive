[b]Welcome ~[/b] &amp;#9834;&amp;#9833;&amp;#9836; 
(especially to those who have watched the Your Lie in April anime :D)

[b][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbAtt4w6ZU]Song of the Week[/url][/b] (though if you&#39;re a music nerd, you&#39;ll know that this would be called a &quot;piece&quot; ;P)

A sane, anime and music themed region! We are a welcoming group that won&#39;t explode with incomprehensible RP, and we will notice you if you move here. An alternative to those bigger anime regions. (Nothing personal though, of course; they just might not be for everyone.)

Please join the party... Anyone who does gets a lifetime supply of egg sandwiches!
