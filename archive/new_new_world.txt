
Welcome to the [b]New New World[/b].
Tired of the restraints, constrictions and orders imposed upon by the regions of both the Old World and New World; we have founded the [b]New New World[/b] to be a perfect union whose members can freely advance in their [i]pursuits of justice, general welfare and happiness[/i]. In this direction; our most basic principle is [color=blue][b]freedom and equality[/color][/b]. The nations of the New New World are not restricted in their own internal affairs, nor are they subject to any constraintss or rules in their foreign relations and in their decisions on the regional governance, which is in line with the principle of direct representation; every nations&#39; ideas, not just votes; are heard through.
