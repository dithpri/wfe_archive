Welcome to the [b]New New World[/b].

Tired of the restraints, constrictions and orders imposed upon by the regions of both the Old World and New World; we have founded the [b]New New World[/b] to be a perfect union whose members can freely advance in their pursuits of [i] justice, general welfare and happiness. [/i] 
In this direction; the most basic principle of &quot;New New World&quot; is; [b][color=blue]freedom and equality[/color][/b]. The nations of the  New New World are not subject to any restriction in their own internal affairs, nor are they subject to any restrictions or rules in their relations with each other and in their decisions on the regional governance, which is in line with the principle of direct representation; every nations&#39; ideas, not just their votes; are heard through.
