The Brotherhood of Muslim Nations wishes to be the representative body of all Muslims in Nationstates in order to effectively resist the kuffar, insha&amp;#39;allah. As all Muslims are brothers, the fate of the BMN will be in the hands of the nations in it, under the guidance of Allah (SWT). So simply, for Muslims, by Muslims. We must reach strength through unity and unity through Allah (SWT).
