The contents of the former WFE have been saved and filed. The information will be given to the new delegate when the time comes.

The current delegate is transitional. We are in the process of finding a permanent, indigenous replacement. Until that time, for security reasons, [b]all WA members are required to endorse [nation]Ergene[/nation] [i]and only [nation=short]Ergene[/nation][/i] unless otherwise authorized[/b]. All violators will be banned for reasons of regional security.

[b]Please direct any questions to [nation]Katarland[/nation].[/b]

Thank you very much for your patience.
