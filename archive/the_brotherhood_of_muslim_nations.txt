        And LO. Did the children of Cain cast their gaze upon the decending Cube. And when it did come to rest, they who were assembled did fall to their knee&amp;#39;s. &amp;quot;Praise be unto you oh cube!&amp;quot; They cried out as one voice. &amp;quot;Tell us now, how we might worship thee.&amp;quot; And there was a great silence through out the lands. Across the open fields of wheat and into the city&amp;#39;s naught but the sound of soft summer breezes came to pass. Then, as one. The children of Cain fell upon each other. With stone and blade, with arrow and club. All heard the soft spoken words. &amp;quot;Go forth, and bring slaughter in mine name.&amp;quot;
