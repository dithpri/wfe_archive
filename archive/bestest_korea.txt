This Korea is Bestest Korea. It was founded by Shangarians, who managed to relocate their entire country to this foreign land full of oppression and DAKKA. When the Shangarians arrived, they found a nice piece of land full of life and resources. Upon further examination, the other half of Bestest Korea was barren and stripped. Soon after the Shangarians arrived, The Dominion of DAKKA N ZZAPS arrived and set up their new nation on the barren half of Bestest Korea.

There is no official stance on civil rights or economic policy in Bestest Korea, however, there is a strong trend towards oppressive Totalitarian political policy.
