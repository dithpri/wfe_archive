Everyone loves a [b]Big Bang[/b]!

The Big Bang is a well-tested scientific theory and is widely accepted within the scientific community. It offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background, large scale structure, and the Hubble diagram for Type Ia supernovae.

Thanks to the Big Bang, our Galaxy was formed, followed by our Sun and planet. Life evolved, and evolution gave us Kaley Cuoco.

As we are the beginning of all things, [i]no embassies will be accepted[/i].
