Welcome to [color=#B80000][i][B]The Great Chili[/B][/i][/color]! A hub of all kinds of roleplaying!

Originally founded November 2012 by the nation [nation=short]Senoheir[/nation], it ultimately fell extinct in early 2013.
The Great Chili was then promptly reestablished as The Universe Adjacent, founded by fellow Chilean [nation=short]Wabacha[/nation].
Eventually this region also fell extinct in late 2013 due to Chileans no longer logging into the site, resulting in a wasteland of inactivity.
Finally in June of 2014 The Great Chili was refounded by myself, [nation=short]Synnadine[/nation], a former core nation of the original TGC.

All WA nations are required to endorse the elected delegate, [nation=short]Wabacha[/nation]
