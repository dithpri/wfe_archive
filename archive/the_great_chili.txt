This is a region of roleplayers though idle chat is also welcome if you aren&amp;#39;t a roleplayer or are not in the mood for it. You can just talk here, be yourselves, and roleplay at your own leisure. There are few but simple rules which you can find pinned under the regions dispatches alongside other basic information. You may also store puppets here if you like, should you have any. If you have any questions at all please telegram the founder or acting WA delegate and we will answer them as quickly and accurately as we can.
