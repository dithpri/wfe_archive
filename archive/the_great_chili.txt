Welcome to [color=#B80000][i][B]The Great Chili[/B][/i][/color]!
TGC was original founded in November 2012 by friends [nation=short]Senoheir[/nation] and [nation=short]Wabacha[/nation].
Ultimately it fell extinct in May 2013 during a power struggle between the two, disagreements on where the region should go.
Eventually it was refounded in July 2014 by Synnadine, another friend of the two aforementioned nations and a member of the original TGC.
For better information on our region please refer to the pinned dispatches below, especially if you intend to roleplay at any point.
All WA nations are required to endorse the elected delegate, [nation=short]Wabacha[/nation]
