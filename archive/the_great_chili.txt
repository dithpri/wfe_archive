Here we are a region of mostly roleplayers, though all nations are welcome.
Feel free to direct any questions you may have to anyone who is on at the time.
Please refer to pinned dispatches for basics on the region, we are different from others.
Any complaints or suggestions are free to be voiced to the founder via telegrams.
Any factbooks are heavily encouraged, length is not an issue in any way.
