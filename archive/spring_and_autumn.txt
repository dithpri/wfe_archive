The Spring and Autumn perioo was a period in Chinese history from approximately 771 to 476 BC, or according to some authorities until 403 BC which corresponds roughly to the first half of the Eastern Zhou Period. The period&#39;s name derives from the Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronicle of the state of Lu between 722 and 479 BC, which tradition associates with Confucius.
