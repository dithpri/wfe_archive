The Northern Orient is full of displeased countries, fighting for survival amongst themselves. Unknown to the entire world, the Northern Orient is born from war and despair. Battered by the Decade War, every nation within the Northern Orient is trying to rebuild in-order to truly reestablish themselves in the new world. The Orient accepts new nations as they come in, but currently the region is in a odd state with new members. Although allowed, we prefer people do not join as of yet. Developments such as a map are soon to come.
