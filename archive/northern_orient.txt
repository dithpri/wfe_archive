The [region]Northern Orient[/region] is full of displeased countries, fighting for survival amongst themselves. Unknown to the entire world, the Northern Orient is born from war and despair. Battered by the [b]Decade War[/b], every nation within the Northern Orient is trying to rebuild in-order to truly reestablish themselves in the new world. The Orient accepts new nations as they come in, but currently the region is in a odd state with new members. Although allowed, we prefer people do not join as of yet. Developments such as a finished lore document, and a final version of the map are soon to arrive.
