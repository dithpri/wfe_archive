RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race is an American reality competition television series, the first in the Drag Race franchise, produced by World of Wonder for Logo TV (season 1&#150;8), WOW Presents Plus, VH1 (season 9&#150;14) and, beginning with the fifteenth season, MTV. The show documents RuPaul in the search for &quot;America&#39;s next drag superstar&quot;. RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. Contestants are judged by a panel that includes RuPaul, Michelle Visage, one of four rotating judges (Carson Kressley, Ross Mathews, Ts Madison, or Law Roach), as well as one or more guest judges, who critique their progress throughout the competition.
