The Union of Conservative Nations, or UCN, is a politically conservative region, founded on traditional beliefs. We respect the sovereignty of each nation, as well as the rights of citizens to live in a nation and region with other like-minded individuals. Like the America of old, we recognize religious freedom which also means freedom to not be religious, so long as it doesn&amp;#39;t impede on the freedoms of another person. We are founded on Judeo-Christian morality, and the bible is the model for our legal system. We are pro-life and pro-traditional marriage, and will not allow any regional or world-wide body to compromise those principles.
