Summerlyn was founded on April 3, 2015 in an effort to create a forum in which people can discuss why they chose what they chose for issues. There will be an official newspaper describing current trending forum topics. 
Summerlyn was not only created to discuss politics, but a place where you can talk to others about what you feel passionate about. If you want to talk about football, you can do that. If you want to talk about Magic: The Gathering spoilers, you can do that as well. 
We can also raid, if one prefers to do that, we would like to accomplice you and your needs in the best way possible. 
We would also like to raise awareness about the upcoming all new CCG: Chaos CCG, the first ever Community Card Game. Go check them out.
