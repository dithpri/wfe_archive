This region was set up as a memorial to Sturmabteilung member Horst Wessel, assassinated in 1930, by [region]The Realm[/region], at the time affiliated with the [region]National Socialist League[/region]. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].

As a human being, Mr. Wessel&amp;#39;s death was a tragedy. What&amp;#39;s also a tragedy is that his admirers don&amp;#39;t recognize the slaughtering of many millions as a tragedy.
