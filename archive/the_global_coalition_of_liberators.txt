There are a lot of authoritarian regimes in Nation States. The Global Coalition of Liberators sees these rulers for what they are: tyrants. We oppose dictatorship in all its forms, and actively seek to overthrow regions that encourage it.

Coalition members are allowed a large degree of freedom. In fact, we only require our members to follow one Cardinal Law:

[i] All nations who join The Coalition must, above all, value democracy. They must seek to foster democracy within their borders, spread democracy to the unfortunate who live outside them, and they must oppose any anti-democratic measures proposed to the World Assembly. [/i]

Beyond this one Law, Coalition members are free to do what they wish.
