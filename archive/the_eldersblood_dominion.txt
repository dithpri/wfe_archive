 It is rumored that the Eldersblood was gifted by the deities of nature, and provides special benefits to those whose blood contains it. Originally a forested set of isles inhabited by dragonkind, the founders of the region (revered now as &amp;quot;The Elders&amp;quot;) developed a strong relationship with the beasts, who respected their strength of spirit and closeness to nature. With the aid of the dragons that still roam the skies of the dominion today, the Elders created the strong council that has become the united Dominion today. The Dominion is run by a council with leaders from each nation, only those with pure Eldersblood may be on the council. The Dominion hold two truths above all else, knowledge and nature, everything else is secondary.
