Many regions from many universes and realities have spawned over the years. The Realmgates are situated in a chokepoint between the more &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; universes and the more bizarre ones. As the range of survivable space is filled with more and more planets, and more and more realities, the traffic between them has been rising to a tipping point. 

So, the once-empty Realmgates, serving only as a path between universes, have now been secured and are being held independently. The massive traffic has been diverted into less-traveled and more dangerous zones. The result has been the disruption of intergalactic military movements.

The nations in this region hold the key to the Realmgates, and somewhat control the tide of war.
