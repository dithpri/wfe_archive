Founded on the verge of the alternate First World War in southern Italy not far from Rome along the coast, Carne de Vitello is set to become what would be a first global-class tourist destination for English-speaking visitors in the early 20th century. It may have gained independence from Italy peacefully, but it still maintains strong ties with the Pope. It is also the go-to destination for the world&#39;s most efficient agricultural practices from its wide-open fields and wind turbines.

It also means &quot;Meat de Vale&quot;, or Valley of Meats, home to the world&#39;s fastest meat-growing abattoirs.
