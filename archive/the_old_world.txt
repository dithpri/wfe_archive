The Old World is a large planet populated by strange creatures and even stranger people. The world&amp;#39;s energy is run by eco. The planet was also once home to ancient powerful beings called precursors. In the world, there are many havens for humanity, like Haven City, Kras City and Spargus City. There are also evil beings, like the metalheads and the lurkers who seek only to destroy humanity and take all the eco for themselves.
