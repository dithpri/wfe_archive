[B][color=blue][i]WELCOME TO BIKINI BOTTOM[/i][/color][/B]
We are an underwater paradise. The city consists of various businesses, including restaurants, stores, and manufacturers. The city has a stable economy, a balanced education system, questionable health care and labor laws, a structured government, and a firm law enforcement system. There are even stadiums, amusement parks, and other recreational facilities (such as &amp;quot;Glove World&amp;quot;).
