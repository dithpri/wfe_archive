Everyone knows there are nations who are very selective about the region they choose. They are not alone. Hundreds of nations like these cease to exist for this purpose. They want a region full of life, but not too large, as sometimes they think that their voice will be heard over the chaos of hundreds of other nation in that region. This is a region for those nations. Here we will not dominate, we will stand by and watch as the others tear each other apart. We will be the last. WE ARE THE REJECTED ONES!!!!!
