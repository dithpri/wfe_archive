Welcome to Helvault! We&amp;#39;re here to help you, in whatever way you need. We&amp;#39;re small, but hope to grow through diplomacy. Our goal is to assist those who need help in any situation. If you&amp;#39;re an invader, and you need a couple more nations to back you up, we&amp;#39;ll do our best. If you need someone to help defend your region, we&amp;#39;ll do our best. We may develop allies, which would prevent us from assisting some regions, but it never hurts to ask!
