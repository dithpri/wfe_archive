If you&#39;re here, you probably know what this is.

[b]Rules[/b]
1. I (The Military Federation of Internet Freedom Republic) own everyone here, but I&#39;m cool about it and will let you do your thing. Disobey and you might get kicked out of the region.

2. The point of the region is to get along no matter our differences. Teasing each other about stuff about each other&#39;s nations is OK, e.g. shouting &quot;COMMIE!&quot; at a somewhat social nation. Ask before going to war with another nation in the region. No nukes for countries below 250 mil. population.

3. All country types are all welcome.
