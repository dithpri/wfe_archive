The [b][color=forestgreen]Union of Independent Nations[/color][/b] was a private roleplay region created by [b][nation]Internet Freedom Republic[/nation][/b] for an offsite community in 2016. After IFR was banned from the offsite community, they retaliated by banning [nation]Alelusia[/nation] from the region, creating a schism. Those who took Alelusia&#39;s side relocated to [region]Union of Autonomous Nations[/region].

Members of both regions quickly lost interest. UoIN fell first, and has been intermittently parked by a former UoAN loyalist, [nation]The Dark Lawn[/nation].
