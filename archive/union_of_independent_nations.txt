We are a democratic region of free independent states, the goal of the union is simple to offer security to nations seeking a safe haven from external forces. We offer refuge for raider refugees, exiled nations and other entities forced their region or seeking to settle down roots. Furthermore we accept all ideologies in this region except Nazis who we refuse entry. Thank you and welcome to the Union of Independent Nations.
