Hello, we&#39;re a region comprised of nations that won&#39;t bother each other, i.e. communist democratic republics and authoritarian military juntas holding hands and frolicking through the daisy fields on a bright spring day.

[b]Rules[/b]
1. [b]I AM A GENEROUS GOD.[/b] I own everyone here, but I&#39;m cool about it and will let you do your thing. Disobey and you might get kicked out of the region.

2. [b]DON&#39;T BE MEAN.[/b] The point of the region is to get along no matter our differences. Teasing each other about stuff about each other&#39;s nations is OK, e.g. shouting &quot;COMMIE!&quot; at a somewhat social nation.

3. [b]COME ONE, COME ALL.[/b] Nazis, communists, authoritarians, totalitarians, centrists, capitalists, socialists, libertarians, etc. are all welcome.
