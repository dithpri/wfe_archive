The [b]Union of Independent Nations[/b] founded originally by [nation]Peihan[/nation] he made the foolish mistake of letting it die. The region was re-founded by some random nation and then he made the foolish mistake of letting it die. Now re-founded by [nation]Revolutionary Libhiriya[/nation] I will never make the mistake of letting it die!

We are a serious role player region for human only nations. Here at the UIN we welcome all ideologies! The region is new and the future is uncertain, if you join early you will have a say in the future direction of this once glorious region!
