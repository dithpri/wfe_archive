[color=blue]Welcome to Paradise![/color]

Founded by [nation]Winteer[/nation], we are a tolerant democracy with a large supply of cake and vodka, if you&#39;re into that. The [color=brown]chocolate drizzle[/color] cheesecake is reserved for [color=green]Winteer[/color], please don&#39;t eat it.

I doubt any regions will want an embassy yet, but I will accept any from regions that have common views.

[color=teal]Anyone can join[/color], but if you are [color=red]hateful[/color] in the RMB, you might get [color=red]kicked out[/color]. Please be nice ;3

[color=lime]Happy hippos[/color] are very nice, if you see one please give it a slice of [color=purple]cake[/color]!

Thanks for reading,
[nation]Winteer[/nation]
