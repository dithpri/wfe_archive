The formidable force of the West-End (FFOTWE) is a truly frightening collective of a few, hand-selected up-and-coming independent nations. Save the &quot;democratic&quot; capitalist swine-state of Volcy, and the money-hungry-profit-over-people-bootlicker-fascist state of &#39;BYYWON,&#39; the collective is made up of proud Marxists who pride themselves on the principles of political freedom and equitable circumstance.
