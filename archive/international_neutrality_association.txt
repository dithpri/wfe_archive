A newly formed region for the specific purpose of non-alignment, neutrality and everlasting peace. We use diplomacy and mutual understanding to gain relations and embassies with those interested, but we will not be caught choosing sides or joining conflicts. As a frontier, the position of power will be chosen democratically by the wishes of the people, unless their is an immediate threat to the region (eg. raiders).
