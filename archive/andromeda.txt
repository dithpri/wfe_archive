[b]Welcome to [color=blue]Andromeda[/color].

A spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 light years from the Earth, [color=blue]Andromeda[/color] now welcomes those from all corners of the universe to partake in its culture and become a part of its history.[/b]

The entire galaxy is now under the management of The New TAO Order and its anti-marsupialist policies.

[b][color=blue]Andromeda[/color][/b] is a [b][color=red]RAIDER-FREE Region[/color][/b] ... and we aren&amp;#39;t that partial toward Defenders, either.
