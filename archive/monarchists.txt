We are a region that is ruled by a nation that is a monarchy and is ruled like a monarchy. Though benevolent monarchies are great, sometimes monarchies can be ruled by terrible people, like any government, therefore in the future there may or may not be elections for minor posts like polls and other stuff. However if this authority is abused the monarch has the right to punishment ranging from removal from post, to exile from the region. 

Welcome to Monarchy!
