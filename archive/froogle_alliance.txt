People in the Froogle Alliance began as a tribe characterized by its love of smoked meats. As more branched out into the agricultural and finance isles, their society became stratified. After much inner strife, a leader emerged who constructed a glass fortress from which he observed his subjects. A kind tyrant, he imposes a 10% flat tax on his citizens and all goes smoothly as long has everyone &quot;does her job.&quot; As long as the tax is paid and people show up to work on time, there is individual freedom (no uniforms) so long as leadership and trade decisions are left in the hands of those behind the glass.
