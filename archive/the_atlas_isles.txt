The ATLAS Isles is a large archipelago situated in a remote, undisclosed location far away from most civilized life. The ATLAS Isles contains a plethora of organic life not seen anywhere else, as well as large deposits of valuable minerals hidden deep beneath the surface. These isles rich with opportunity are overseen by an enigmatic construct known simply as ATLAS. Not much is known about ATLAS other than its primary objective, known as the ATLAS Protocol, which is to defend the area no matter the cost.
