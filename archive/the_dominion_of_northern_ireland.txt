I am trying to create a string of embassies from one region to another,
and to see how many embassy nation links it takes, 
to go from one end of my empire to the other[/color]

[color=006400]When I have decided to going back to collecting embassies,
I will begin with those that have not gone to the extreme of banning any of my founders.
It just takes one founder on a list, and I take it personal.

Not as if any of my founders would ever go visit your region.
I am not into role-playing with ambassadors.[/color][/list][hr]
