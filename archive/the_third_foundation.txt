[b][i]The Third[/i][/b]

The First Foundation is the unmilitaristic conquistadors of the Second Empire. The Second Foundation shrouds themselves in secrecy. The Third Foundation is not spoken of, however. It is a Foundation of the Spirit. One may argue poetry is what makes the galaxies dance, or that a nebula is the wildflower meadow of the night sky. No song does not go unsung in the halls of the Third Foundation, with it&#39;s compendium of human literature and artwork, it is the first Foundation, but only the last recognized one. For when the human race has passed, so the Third Foundation will shine as a shrine to its artistic forms and spiritual livelihood. When our civilization lies in ruins, a simple statue may be more telling than any spaceship crash.
