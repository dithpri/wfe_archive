Autumn leaf 
Flap and sway in the sweet Autumn zephyrs

Leaf gets crisp
Leaf buffets with the cool Autumn breeze, so brisk

Speckled orange leaf
Crispy on the sleepy tree
Whisk goes the leaf without it&#39;s lee 

Swirling leaf in among the many
Fiery threads in rolling waves
So drives the leaves in the late Autumn staves

Restless masses asleep at last 
Under the blanket of white fluff
Now nought but a hinter
In the dead of Winter
