[spoiler=May I go?]Many have come
Many have gone
I&#39;ll be another one
Moving along

It is at life&#39;s behest 
That I do not stay
It is time to rest this nation
To night from day

Memory is relative
My time here, little
I&#39;ve never &#39;id much to offer
I never put much in the coffer

Whether I stay or whether I go
No one would bother to know
And, perhaps, rightfully so.[/spoiler]
