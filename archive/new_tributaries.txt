[hr][color=darkblue][b]May your unfailing love rest upon us, O Lord, even as we put our hope in you. &#151; Psalms 33:22[/b][/color]
[Hr][b][Color=black][i]&quot;Tributaries? I&#39;ve seen this place before!&quot;[/i][/color]
[hr][color=darkblue]If the name sounds familiar, that&#39;s because it is, but this region is its own fresh start. My main goal is to make a region that&#146;s open, calm, and enjoyable to be part of. Different beliefs, views, and playstyles are welcome.
[hr]The Region [i]is[/i] still growing, setting up embassies, tweaking the WFE, and figuring out what roles we need as we go. If you want to help shape things, or if you just want a quiet place to settle your nation, welcome.[/b][/color]
[hr][B]We will accept embassies from basically anyone, except [I][u]raiders[/u][/i] and [i][u]fascists[/u][/I].[/b]
