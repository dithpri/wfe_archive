&amp;quot;Tyron Islands is a chain of tropical islands located in the southern side of the Atlantic, far from any coast, and surrounded by extensive coral reefs. This remote position, as well as the hazards of fate, is responsible for its isolated state. It was officially discovered as late as 1953. Before that date, the region had little contact with the outside world. A few lost merchant vessels did stumble on Tyron Islands, but failure to map or return to the islands led it to be labelled a myth, along the likes of Atlantis, Lemuria, Eldorado and Skull Island. As such, the region had a secluded history, and was spared the burden of European colonialism and its cultural influence, though recently things are starting to change.&amp;quot;
