You&#39;ll be back, soon, you&#39;ll see
You&#39;ll remember you belong to me
You&#39;ll be back, time will tell
You&#39;ll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will make a Region so we can unite again without all the extra
