San Andreas appears to be comprised entirely of islands, as the state is surrounded by water; however, several maps throughout the state depict the northern regions (Tierra Robada and Bone County) connecting to the mainland (despite this, it is possible to completely circumnavigate the state by boat). San Andreas is square-shaped and its area is estimated to be 33 square kilometres in size (12.7 square miles).

The state is divided into three cities and five counties: the cities of Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas; and the counties of Red County, Flint County, Whetstone, Tierra Robada and Bone County.
