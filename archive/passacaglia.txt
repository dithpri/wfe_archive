hi. 
This region is a bit messy, you see... Puppets with different themes are all mixed in here. I don&#39;t even know how many puppet series I have.
Region named after Leopold Godowsky&#39;s amazing Passacaglia (based on Schubert&#39;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony)
[hr]
Total number of legs found: 66 (including 3 pairs of legs)
[hr]
This region is a puppet storage, why request embassy if your region is not a puppet storage &amp; you don&#39;t know me?
