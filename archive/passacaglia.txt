hi. This region is a bit messy, you see... Puppets with different themes are all mixed in here. I don&#39;t even know how many puppet series I have.
Region named after Leopold Godowsky&#39;s amazing Passacaglia (based on Schubert&#39;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony)

Total number of legs found: 56 (including 3 pairs of legs)
