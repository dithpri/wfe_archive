In the  world, where the heresy flourishes, We are the region that unites the Faithful ones. 
We are the region of absolute theocracies.
We deny leftist myth of progress, and believe that the world, that strayed away from the right way, is degrading rapidly.
We deny leftist myth of science, because it can not explain, what the Faith can.
We may be of different religions, but we are closer to each other, than to any blasphemer.
And We are ready to purge the world from the ones, who dare to deny the will of Gods.
Everyone religious is welcome there, but remember, the filthy materialists will find there nothing but the bonfire that will turn them into ashes.
