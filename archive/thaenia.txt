[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region], were going to go on an adventure! Their goal: steal the angry stone. This stone was an ancient relic of [nation]Aquilanion[/nation] and to obtain it they would have to traverse through your region. The journey was a sleepy one, and they had to roll most of the way there with a pillow. When they finally got to the Stone, they realized it was actually made of pancake. Upset with this discovery they called for [nation]Aquilanion[/nation] to be sent to Osiris as punishment! If you want go on wacky adventures too, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Come join us![/url]
