[color=blue][b]Welcome to The Nameless[/color]

We are an ambitious people.  We do what we think is the best for our region and do not want any internal troubles. Any disputes or disagreements are to be resolved via voting, and identities will not be concealed.  In order to become an effective region, we must trust each other.  Also, please be kind to your fellow nations.  Any bullying or other undesirable behavior will drive us to ban you.  If you have any ideas on how we can improve our region, contact the leader of the region or Potadium, who can meet with the leader in person.  Follow these rules and we can become a strong nation.
