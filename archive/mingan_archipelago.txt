The Mingan Archipelago is located east of Quebec, Canada. It consists of a chain of about 40 islands.

Starting but 124 miles from the end of the road along the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (Le Fleuve), the Mingan Archipelago National Park Reserve of Canada spreads about 109 miles eastward as it dots the coastline with over 2,000 islands and islets. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
