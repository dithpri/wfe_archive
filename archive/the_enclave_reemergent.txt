The 3rd re-unification of the Enclave Remnants. 
The Enclave is a political, scientific, and militaristic organization that is descended directly from members of the pre-War United States government, and is the legally-sanctioned continuation of the government. The Enclave is made of (mostly) ancestral descendants of top ranking officials of the government, and members of the United States&#39; military, as well as a few others such as the Institute, who are descendants of the students and staff of M.I.T, Vault citizens and some pacified tribals.
