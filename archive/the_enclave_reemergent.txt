The 3rd re-unification of the Enclave Remnants. 
The Enclave is a political, scientific, and militaristic organization that is descended directly from members of the pre-War United States government, and is the legally-sanctioned continuation of the government. The Enclave is made of (mostly) descendants of top ranking officials of the government, members of the United States military, as well as the Institute, who are descendants of the students and staff of M.I.T, Vault citizens from Vault 40 and Vault 171and some pacified tribals from across American territories.
