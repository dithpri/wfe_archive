&quot;Be still, and know that I am God; 
I will be exalted among the nations, 
I will be exalted in the earth!&quot;
- Psalm 46:10

&quot;Leave no man&#39;s authority unquestioned,
and no excess unrestrained...
For although the Lord Christ is our King,
our mistakes are our own...
Our nation, like a family, is a thing to be stewarded,
not ignored like an unbeliever,
not abandoned like a coward.&quot; 
- William &quot;Wiley&quot; Mikkel van Horn O&#39;Fergus
