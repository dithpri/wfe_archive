&quot;Be still, and know that I am God; 
I will be exalted among the nations, 
I will be exalted in the earth!&quot;
- Psalm 46:10

&quot;No man&#39;s authority should remain unquestioned,
and none of his excesses left unrestrained...
Understand that although the Lord Christ is our King,
our mistakes are our own...
Our nation, like a family, is something to be stewarded,
not ignored like an unbeliever,
certainly not abandoned like a coward.&quot; 
- William &quot;Wiley&quot; Mikkel van Horn O&#39;Fergus
