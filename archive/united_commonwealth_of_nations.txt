Due to the authoritarian abolishment of the former GCA government by GCA founder Nova Hansa, the UCN was founded to become a democratic alternative in the inter regional community. We offer a democratic home to those who have been deposed, and or ejected, and wish to stand up for democracy amidst tyrants and dictators. Join us in our cause to defend and preserve liberty.

Due to increasing raids by the [region=the Great Conservative Alliance we will be controlling oir borders. If you would like to entor in the UNC please Telegram [nation=New Nagarno]
