The UNC was founded after the division and authoritarian take over of the GCA. We I courage all who have been illegally ejected, removed from power, or seen their home region lose its democratic values to join us. Together we will strive to make a strong constitutional and democratic alternative in the inter regional community. 

Feel free to create a party, join a party, invite others.
