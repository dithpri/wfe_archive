WELCOME TO THE NEW BLACK HAWKS! 

We are a revolution, a new and better version of the current Black Hawks.

In this Black Hawks, all are FREE! There is no totalitarianism! WA members are welcome, and the Delegate has administrative powers! These freedoms are not existent in the dark, gloomy, and old original Black Hawks.

We are developing, and growing ever stronger! 

FEAR US BLACK HAWKS! WE ARE HERE TO AVENGE YOUR OPPRESSION ON THE PEOPLE!

Why would you want to be part of a condemned region? The WA has forshamed Black Hawks for a reason, and the reason being that it is unworthy of NationStates!

[b][color=blue]Our motto:

&amp;quot;JOIN US AND RESPECT US, OR FEAR US AND EXPECT US!&amp;quot;[/color][/b]
