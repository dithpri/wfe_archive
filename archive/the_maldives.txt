[i][color=green]&#147;God! God!&#148; they cry,
till there&#146;s a callus on their tongue.
If saying God gave liberation,[/color]
[color=orange]saying candy made your mouth sweet,
saying fire burned your feet,[/color]
[color=blue]saying water quenched your thirst,
saying food banished hunger,
the whole world would be free.[/color][/i]
