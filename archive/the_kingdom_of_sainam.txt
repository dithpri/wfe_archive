The Kingdom of Sainam is a federalised Kingdom which consists of the Kingdom of Sainam, The Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Bei-Lu, the Republic of Bang-yang, and the People&#39;s Republic of Liao. All nations except for Liao are fully independent, but maintain a Compact of Free Association with the Kingdom of Sainam, accepting their monarch as theirs. The Kingdom maintains a seat at the World Assembly, where it also represents the interests of all other constituent nations, but Bei-Lu and Bang-Yang also maintain individual seats.
