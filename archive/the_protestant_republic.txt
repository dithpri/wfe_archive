The Protestant Republic is a block on nations coming together, in formation of a newly found Arc of Prosperity.

Our wealth and general prosperity is based on absolute adherence to our God-given inalienable rights, from which all affluence is possible.

We recognise that our prosperity and political freedoms is contingent on our Protestant work-ethic. This means our members give recognition to spirituality and resist the evil forces of nihilism. 

Naturally communism is not tolerated in our member states. Even the most innocuous appearing signals of Marxist intents are investigated and prosecuted-given there is at least some interpretative evidence to support accusations.
