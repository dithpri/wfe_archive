&#147;We Unite to fight oppressors until all are free &amp;amp; well&#148;

United we stand, one purpose to get swole, under no one and nothing except the heaviest iron we bend to our will. Today and every day we defend honor, freedom, right to health, education and heavy weights.
Under these jacked fibras is an idea: That no human being is above another, every miscer has potential, you are not born too late to explore the galaxy, and every second matters.
