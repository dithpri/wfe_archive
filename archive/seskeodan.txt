The planet Seskeodan is a gas giant in a densely populated solar system with twelve other planets.
Seskeodan is about 7.2 times bigger than Earth and its gravity is about 1.78 times that of Earth.

A single day lasts 39.21 hours and a year lasts 130 days. The planet is surrounded by several Zenith&#39;s, massive space stations that houses the member nations.
4 moons orbit the planet and Seskeodan itself orbits a white sun in an almost perfectly circular orbit.

While life will never be possible on this planet except on the Zenith&#39;s, it does offer a unique sight in the night sky of nearby planets. Its colors and distance to the planets around it occasionally makes the night quite magical on those planets, especially those with an atmosphere.
