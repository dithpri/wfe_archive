     We boast the best of what I have to offer; that being nothing. It is unlikely that this region will ever have more these 2 nations, nor will this little tidbit be updated anymore than it has now. I will simply stay here and watch my countries grow, content with the fact that I will never be burdened by the nuances of responsibility or leadership, and instead enjoy the freedom that comes with just sitting back and watching the world spin. Feel free to join, but realize this region has nothing more to offer than peace from others, and a friendly person to talk to.
