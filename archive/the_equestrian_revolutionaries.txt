The tyranny of [nation]the_old_lunar_republic[/nation] has not gone unnoticed. We will fight them and die by the hundreds, by the thousands, by the millions, but we will liberate [region]The Equestrian Empire[/region] in the name of the Holy God-Empress once and for all. We accept all who are willing to join our just and noble cause, no matter their ideology, species or past deeds.

Come, face us. If you dare.
