The &quot;fenda&quot; Aeshmadeva from The Barrier Reef defender region of old, has finally conquered Invaders after 9 years. It has been a gruelling campaign, but finally the black red and yellow flag of the Jamahiriya flew from Invaders City Hall in the capital. 

This region - The original home of &quot;Invaders Army&quot;, shall remain permanently under the control of Aeshmadeva Land as proof of his ultimate victory over them, and as a punishment for them kicking him out when he tried to infiltrate them.
