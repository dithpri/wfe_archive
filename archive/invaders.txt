This region is under the permanent control of &quot;fenda&quot; Aeshmadeva Land. I warned Invaders back in 2006 that I would eventually take over their region, and knew it was only a matter of time before they let their placeholder-nation in the original &quot;Invaders&quot; region go inactive. All I had to do was wait. When he went inactive, I quickly reformed.

This steals Invaders name from them, permanently preventing them from ever using it again. This region will stay permanently open as a mockery to the general failure of invader/raider regions in general, and as my lasting revenge against them for kicking me out of their group in 2006.
