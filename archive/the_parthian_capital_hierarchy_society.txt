Although [b][region]The Parthian Capital Hierarchy Society[/region][/b] was renowned for it&#39;s local activity, most of the nations have scattered in the past year.
It&#39;s left me no choice but to abandon the region [i][8-29-2018][/i], and place it in charge of my puppet: [b][nation]PCHS Keeper[/nation][/b].

If you are an attendant of [b][color=red]PCHS[/color][/b], telegram [b][nation]Adorable Kittens[/nation][/b] for the regional password.
