Union of all Unity pact members. Every member has freedom over their own country. The pact is a union of peace, any disturbance of the peace will be met with unending hatred and ultimate extinction.
Anyone is free to join, there is no set ideology that members need to follow.

We are currently operating in absolute opposition to the WA, which goes against the general authority of Union Leader[nation]Syra[/nation]. Joining the WA is seen as an act of [b]disobedience to the eternal rule of [nation]syra[/nation][/b].

Puppets of [nation]Syra[/nation] have no authority and are mindless zombies. Ignore them.
