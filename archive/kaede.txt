Kaede (pronounced kade) is a large planet with four main continents and six oceans. Kaede&amp;#146;s axis is on a tilt at 34.6 degrees, causing the development of extreme hot and cold periods.
The dominating terrain happens to be mountainous, but there are many gentler hilly areas which are good for settlements.
Forests are common, and food is plentiful.
The planet has a core which mostly consists of compressed silver and copper. Because of this, items such as compasses do not work, and the people of Kaede rely solely on the stars for navigation. There is said to be thousands of undiscovered lands in the oceans, and large oil deposits in many areas. Despite the extreme climate, Kaede is a lush planet full of life and resources.
