     [b]Hello, Everyone! Welcome to the all-inclusive region/planet of Kaede (pronounced Kade)! Anyone is welcome, as long the Terms &amp; Conditions are followed and others residing in the region are respected. [/b]
     There is a monthly &#145;meeting&#146; (Essentially a dispatch explaining regional happenings) of the Board Of Kaede on every first, so feel free to post any news you would like to share with fellow member states on the Regional Message Board. If not posting news, feel free to leave a nice poem there instead. There is no current WA delegate, but all WA nations are welcome. 
     If you have any questions about Kaede, feel free to telegram the Left-Wing Democracy of Nordikaa.
