Puppet storage region. All nations in this region are from various novels and/or projects not limited to the Betweenworlds itself, and some, like [nation]Calamitous Philistines[/nation] and [nation]Cat Zoomies[/nation], are entirely joke nations. The one thing they all share is they are all puppets of [nation]Leborux[/nation].

UPDATE 3/16/2023: Unfortunately, someone attempted to sabotage two of my puppet chains earlier today. [nation]5 slices of cheese[/nation] and [nation]Slice of cheese 10[/nation] are not me. The Betweenworlds shall endure this setback.
