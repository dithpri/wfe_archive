[b]Captured Region[/b]


[b]Free Sparrow[/b] was the third failed incarnation due to negligent management. [region]Sparrow[/region], then [region]New Sparrow[/region] predate this region, with many successor regions leading to the current [region]Declansburg[/region]. These regions all had one thing in common, but if I say what it is I may get in trouble.

Free Sparrow, Founded in 2016, Ancient Sparrow founded in 2019.

[b]I may not be a math major but Ancient Sparrow is clearly the failed third incarnation of the sparrow lineage!
