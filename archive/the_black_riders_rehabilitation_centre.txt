While our main duty is to assist former Black Riders who are looking to assimilate back into civil society, away from the dark world of raiding, anyone who is in a similar plight is most definitely welcome to join us, though precedence will be given to members from the Black Riders.

Note: We have no wish to destroy The Black Riders or any affiliated organisations. All we want is to help raiders from the aforementioned organisations who feel that it is time to step out of the darkness and seek help for themselves. 

We offer:

[b]1-to-1 Therapy &amp;amp; Counselling
Group Therapy Programme (5-8 Black Riders)
Intensive Emergency Programme
Feeder Regions Assimilation Programme
Skills &amp;amp; Redevelopment Programme
Critically Acclaimed Insulting Halcones Initiative[/b]
