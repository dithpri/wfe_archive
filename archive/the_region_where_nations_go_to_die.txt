A long time ago, the True Army tried to liberate this place, until pesky defenders that were hundreds of times our size bullied us out of it.

But then... they left and the natives died, so, we decided to pick up the scraps and refound this place!

So... now it&#39;s just &quot;The Region That Died&quot;

So... if you stumble upon this place, or you liked that terrible joke, join [region]True Land[/region] and help us take over more and more places!
