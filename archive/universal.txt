Ahh... that new Region smell. 

Universal is a region for everyone... kind of. 
The main focus will be on realism, hence the map with time zones and climate and such. 
Eventually, I would like to make some Regional RPs that can get this region active and look appealing to other RPers. 

The Founder, [nation]Sochiro[/nation], has knowledge about NSSports and P2TM. 
Thus, additional nations are wanted/needed/forced to join in order to make Universal a realistic and diverse region.
