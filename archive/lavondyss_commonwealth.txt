The serene and just Commonwealth has been brought into being to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of sovereign  rights and self-determination of peoples.
We maintain regional  peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, from external nations or reckless or detrimental World Assembly legislation.
