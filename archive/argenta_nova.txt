[b]Overview[/b]

Argenta Nova is a sprawling, geographically diverse region, stretching from rugged mountains and dense forests to fertile plains and strategic waterways. Currently home to five nations, each seeking influence in this dynamic landscape.

While the region boasts a wide array of governments, from utopian leftist states to consumer-driven democracies, one nation quietly ensures that order, discipline, and strategic oversight remain consistent across Argenta Nova. The Empire of One, serving as the region&#146;s World Assembly Delegate, exercises influence in ways subtle enough to amuse, and occasionally frustrate, its neighbors. Some claim the Empire &#147;runs the Assembly for everyone else,&#148; though few dispute its effectiveness.
