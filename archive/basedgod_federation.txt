[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their band of ragtag boys , [region]Osiris[/region], [region]Hartfelden[/region], [region]Voltarium[/region], and [region]The Ragerian Imperium[/region] ganged to together to stop Lil B in his rise to power. Though they took Lil B&#39;s fortress, their victory was shortlived as the bass rhythm to B*tch Doing 30 vibrated through the Fortress, and one by one, the dark birds were plucked clean of their feathers and cooked medium rare for His Godliness&#39; supper. 

The few attackers that survived, thus in failure in the face of Lil B&#39;s splendor, returned to their bunker to tell the tale.
