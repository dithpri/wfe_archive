The Allied Nations of the Wolf(TANW) is a region made to give nations within it the freedom to do what they want. Although the founder will have executive power, it would only be in order to keep the region save and in order. Everyone is free to give suggestions and TANW will hopefully always be changing to better fit the nations within the region. The founder wants all nations, especially executive powers, to be kind to one another and as helpful as possible. More information will be made as the region grows.
