[color=darkblue]did you evew heaw the twagedy of Pripyat pact the wise? i thought not. 
 it&#39;s a npa wegend. Engwand was a wegion, so powewfuw and so wise they couwd use the fowce to infwuence the midichwowians to not be tagged... 
 they had such a knowwedge of the dawk side that they couwd even keep the ones they cawed about fwom being tagged. 
 the dawk side of the fowce is a pathway to many abiwities some considew to be unnatuwaw. They became so powewfuw... 
 the onwy thing they wewe afwaid of was wosing theiw powew, which eventuawwy, of couwse, they did. 
 unfowtunatewy, the npa is stwong in the ways of the fowce and tagged them anyway 
it&#39;s iwonic they couwd save othews fwom being tagged, but not themsewves[/color]
