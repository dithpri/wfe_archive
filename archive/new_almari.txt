New Almari is a small role-playing region consisting of a collection of nations, both players and NPCs, interacting with each other in a realistic Earth-like world.  New Almari does not use NationStates stats or is part of the NationStates multiverse, and tries to be as realistic as a role-play as possible.  The current year is [b]1929[/b].  We invite all role-players to join our role-play and actively participate through writing dispatches and communicating with the other nations of the role-play.
