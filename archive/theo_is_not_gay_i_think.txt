Commander Red Back taught the hawks to raid
They&#146;ve been in and out of style
They&#146;re guaranteed to raise a smile
 
So may I introduce to you
The ones you&#146;ve raided with for all these years
Commander Red Back&#146;s Lonely Hawks Club Band
 
We&#146;re [region]The Black Hawks[/region], and we hope you will enjoy the show
Sit back on our [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]forums[/url] and let the evening go.
