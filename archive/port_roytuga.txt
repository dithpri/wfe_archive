[color=red]Greetings, sailor![/color] [color=Green]And welcome to Port Roytuga, where endless possibilities can occur![/color]
The Port has a long History: Founded by Pirates and Monks from Lapland, the wild and uncivilized Citizens of this Port were left untouched by the Colonial Powers of the World! Here, there are no laws [color=orange](Unless a proclaimed Dictator says so)[/color], and Anarchy levels are off the Chart!
[color=Lime]We play, sing, dance, laugh, and rest from all the hard work in the real World! So come on down and join us![/color]
And always remember, [color=purple]Enjoy your Stay[/color]!
