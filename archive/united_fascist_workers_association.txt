[b]&amp;#10016;[/b] [color=crimson][b]The United Fascist Workers&#39; Association is a region founded in dedication to the works of early fascists. We are the successors of Cercle Proudhon, and seek to make its vision a reality. This region is a community of workers, artists, and craftspeople dedicated to the fight for national liberation and sovereignty. Our goal is the creation of a syndicated caste society and the overthrow of the globalist, cosmopolitan bourgeoisie.[/b][/color] [b]&amp;#10016;[/b]
