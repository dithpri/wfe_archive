[color=#FF0000][b]United Fascist Workers&#39; Association is a region founded in dedication to the literary works of early fascists. We are the successors of the Cercle Proudhon, and seek to make its vision a reality. This region is a community of workers, artists, and craftspeople joined together in the virtuous and constant struggle for national liberation and sovereignty. Our spirit of reaction has bestowed on us the ultimate destiny of deposing the globalist, cosmopolitan bourgeoisie and establishing a syndicated caste society.[/b][/color]
