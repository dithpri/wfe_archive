&amp;#10016; [color=crimson][b]The United Fascist Workers&#39; Association is a region founded in dedication to the works of early fascists. We are the successors of Cercle Proudhon, and seek to make its vision a reality. This association of fascist workers will continuously fight for national liberation and sovereignty.

The goal of this association is to unite workers brought together by higher metaphysical principals, while encouraging political reaction which has long defended our heroic efforts as workers. Our goal is the creation of a syndicated caste society and the overthrow of the globalist, cosmopolitan bourgeoisie.[/b][/color] &amp;#10016;
