[b]The United Fascist Workers&#39; Association is a region founded in dedication to the works of Georges Sorel and early fascists.

We welcome nations who identify as Fascist, National Socialist, and National Syndicalist. We want to unite workers and encourage political reaction which has long defended work and tradition.
