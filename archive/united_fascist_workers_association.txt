[b]The United Fascist Workers&#39; Association is a region founded in dedication to the works of Georges Sorel and early fascists. We are the successors of Cercle Proudhon and seek to make its vision a reality.

We welcome nations who identify as Fascist, National Socialist, and National Syndicalist. We want to unite workers and encourage political reaction which has long defended work and tradition. Our goal is the syndication of society and the overthrow of the globalist bourgeoisie.

Far-Right/Third Positionist intellectuals and enthusiasts welcome! Memery is discouraged.
