[b]&amp;#10016;[/b] [color=crimson][b]The United Fascist Workers&#39; Association is a region founded in dedication to the works of early fascists. We are the successors of Cercle Proudhon, and seek to make its vision a reality. This association of fascist workers will continuously fight for national liberation and sovereignty.

The purpose of this association is to unite workers brought together by higher metaphysical principals, while defending our heroic efforts as workers through political reaction. Our goal is the creation of a syndicated caste society and the overthrow of the globalist, cosmopolitan bourgeoisie.[/b][/color] [b]&amp;#10016;[/b]
