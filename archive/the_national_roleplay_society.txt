First thing things first this society is accepting of all! So don&#39;t be afraid to join. The second thing this Society is heavily roleplay based so enjoy it! If you decide to roleplay your actual game stats do not have to correlate to your roleplay stats. We would normally roleplay on the Discord server however you can also roleplay on the group wall! Also yes we have a map, To get onto the map you have to send an application to the              Map-Applications channel on our discord (Read the pinned comment to view what you have to put on the application) and of course enjoy it.
