[color=ccccc]Berlin Pact is the Agreement between sovereign nationalist regions to stand against common foes in mutual support in time of war. We promote traditional family model and structure, condemn deviant lifestyles and interracial relationships as immoral and against our Christian values, and condemn those that support Bolsheviks, Anarchists, Holycross Deniers, and other threats to a nation&#39;s or region&#39;s ethnic unity.
