The Drystian League is an emerging democratic alliance comprised of several independent states. Unlike traditional alliances, it operates without a designated leader, promoting a collaborative approach to governance and decision-making among its members. The League&#39;s primary focus is on mutual support and cooperation, which increases its influence and stability in the region. As the political landscape shifts, the Drystian League is gradually rising to power, leveraging its democratic ideals to attract new members and strengthen its collective voice.
