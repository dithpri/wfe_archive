Following international discourse Mikorial Lia and Terra Pianura have founded the Coalition of the Economically Infeasible or CEI, a Region with a single goal: create the and build strongest and most reputable nations... with the weakest imaginable economies. We seek to be a neutral organization promoting each nation working at the interests of the people. As a coalition we are primarily focused on building strong nations on political freedom, civil rights, and lowering economic impact across the world. 

Please contact Mikorial Lia via the telegram with any questions or diplomatic requests. We hope to continue to avoid making decisions on the worlds stage and lowering our economic output until you can not notice us on the global scale.
