[u][i][b]The MPTC is what it says on the tin: A military pact (like NATO) for any Turkic countries willing to join.
[/b][/i][/u]
To join you must [b](1)[/b] be a Turkic country, and [b](2)[/b] have a reasonably sized military and economy.

[i]In the case that an MPTC nation goes to war, all nations must join that nation&#39;s side of the war, meaning that if a foreign entity declares war on one of us, they declare war on all of us.[/i]

If you wish to join, [b]contact [nation]Qarghastan[/nation].[/b]
