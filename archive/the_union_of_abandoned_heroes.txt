We are the long forgotten protectors of many nations; we are soldiers, warriors, leaders. When there cities burned and there people slaughtered we held the line against seemingly unstoppable foes for eons untold, we were heroes to be remembered for eternity but instead&#133;&#133;.. we were tossed aside when our once glorious nations no longer had need for us, exiled to the wastes and forgotten. with the fury of our loss in our hearts and an unquenchable thirst for vengeance, a Union of Abandoned Heroes was formed. Our soldiers know no fear, our warriors have no mercy, our leaders cannot be beaten, they are all heroes whose actions will never be forgotten. let stories of our glorious crusade for glory be told until the end of time!
