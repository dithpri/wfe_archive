Annulum Turturis is a world shaped as a torus that is perpetually suspended above the shell of a great cosmos fairing sea turtle through unknown and seemingly supernatural means. Held gravitationally within its center is a sphere of pure ocean containing most of the worlds water. Directly below is the shell of the great turtle, which is home to many exotic and dangerous flora and fauna, which survive by syphoning off nutrients from the void of space in which the turtle travels as well as from water fallen from the main torus. In orbit around Annulum Turturis are three stars and countless minor satellites, each with its own unique effect on the beings who call the land their home.
