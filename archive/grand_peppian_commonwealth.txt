Hello, Hallo, Merhaba, or &amp;#1055;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1090;, friends,
You may know that our Glorious Founder [nation]So Pep[/nation], and our good friend [nation]Kingdom of the Peps[/nation], have been temporarily silenced by the moderators for participating in a raid. The GPC Regional Parliament assures you that there is [b]nothing[/b] to worry about. So in the meantime, please join the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url] and endorse the delegate, [nation]Sartell Koltis[/nation].
This WFE shall remain until the founder has been reinstated. 
Goodbye, Auf Wiedersehen, G&uuml;le g&uuml;le, or &amp;#1076;&amp;#1086; &amp;#1089;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1103;, friends.
