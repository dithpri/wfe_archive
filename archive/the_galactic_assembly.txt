[B]The Galactic Assembly is a region for any nation that represents themselves as a sovereign planet in the galaxy. This works as a pact, or a coalition, to be able to defend sovereign states from galactic empires that may be willing to get a hold of more space. [/B]

This is mostly a region for friends who are using this for RP purposes. Although, if someone not part of our group wants to be part of the region, they can send a telegram to Tae-Terra for the password.
