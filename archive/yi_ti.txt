The land of Yi Ti has thick green patchwork farmland and dense sweltering jungles. Rumors have it that basilisks roam the jungles of Yi Ti. There is a trade route from Asabhad to Yin along the coast of the Jade Sea. The Five Forts guard the northeastern marches of the empire.

Throughout Yi Ti a great web of stone roads, built during the reign of the Eunuch Emperors, ensure that travelers can cross the lands of Yi Ti without much trouble. These roads are said to be equal to the dragonroads of the Valyrian Freehold.
