Yi Ti is a nation and region in Essos, east of Qarth and the Bone Mountains and bordered by the Jade Sea to the south.

The land of Yi Ti has thick green patchwork farmland and dense sweltering jungles.

Throughout Yi Ti a great web of stone roads, built during the reign of the Eunuch Emperors, ensure that travelers can cross the lands of Yi Ti without much trouble. These roads are said to be equal to the dragonroads of the Valyrian Freehold.
