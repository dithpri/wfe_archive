The slithering night constantly sifts through every street in Noctem.  There is no sign of any activity from the citizens of this mysterious area, and you can hear the clamoring of doors reacting to the incessant breeze.  Could this region, although appearing dark and absent of voice, turn into a thriving center of culture and politics?  Seize the night, turn this darkness into a prosperous community filled with bright minded individuals.  This means you, of course!
