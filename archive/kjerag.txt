Kjerag is a Terran country bordering Columbia, Kazimierz, Minos, and Victoria that is located on the central mountain range of the continent. It is a theocracy centering on the worship of Kjeragandr, the national goddess who protects the land, with the Karlan Saintess serving as both the spiritual leader and political figurehead. Due to its rugged, snowbound mountainous landscape that protects Kjerag from Catastrophes and foreign invasions, Kjerag is given the nickname as the &quot;Snow Realm.&quot;
