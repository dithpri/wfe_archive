From the rolling hills and filthy cities of the Dutch Horde, to the Mediterranean nudists of the Frotocracy and the Pirate bees that ravages the seas of Solimnar, Swusia is a diverse and spirited region, known for the incredible diversity of its citizens. Bees, bulls, stoats, lizards, dragonfly and fros live, not quite peacefully, together.
