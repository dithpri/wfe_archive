We are a union of nations in Scandinavia or with majority Scandinavian populations.

Scandinavia is defined as of Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Finland (including &Aring;land and surrounding islands), Sweden, Denmark, Norway and all islands of said nations.

Nations of Estonian, Scottish, Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish descent are permitted to join.

If you are outside these groups, you may apply with your geographical area and will be reviewed and allowed or denied entry.

Sami peoples are granted a seat as well.
