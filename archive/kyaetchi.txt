Kyaetchi is a region for those who have realized that the only way Senpai will notice them is through the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, most imperialist elements of finance capital. We are the only friends that Senpai needs. So what if he has seem us in wool bear panties and know we are paipans? The nations of  Kyaetchi  are united by a Japanophilic Fascist ideology which we formally acknowledge to be a front for finance capitalism. How else can we afford to build a dream home for Sempai? Our volk is dedicated toward ceaseless territorial expansion and the kawaiification of all lands. If you really, really, really love Senpai to death your are a comrade in our glorious perverted fighting camp.
