The Dexter Isles, colloquially known as Dexter or Dex, are a geographical subdivision of planet Earth&#39;s West Indies within the northern Caribbean Sea, above the Greater Antilles and due east of the Lucayan Archipelago.  Comprised of eight functionally sovereign states since their respective independences in 2021, they now form a political and economic union steadily uniting under free market eco-socialist Dexonomics and democratic leadership by the public.
