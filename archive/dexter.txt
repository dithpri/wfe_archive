The region of Dexter, headed by founding nation Dexterra (a portmanteau of Dexter and Terra), is dedicated to honoring our guardian angels by beginning with nothing and growing, evolving and transforming in a positive direction over time. Dexterish nations are ones which begin predominately libertarian (i.e., small government) and steadily enlarge themselves in order to guarantee the wellbeing of their people, permanently act as an agent of progress and altogether provide for the common good.
