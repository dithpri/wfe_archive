There&#146;s no ignorance, there is knowledge. There is no passion there is serenity.  There&#146;s no chaos, there&#146;s Harmony. there is no death, there is the force.

can you feel it? . The disturbance I mean. It grows with every new region that falls to the dark side&#133; invaders&#133;. Holding region hostages and for what&#133;glory? Fame? Greed? It&#146;s time to vanquish them, to protect the weak, to help the defenseless and bring harmony back to the force. We need a team&#133; a &#133; group of defenders of peace&#133;. We need The Jedi&#133;
