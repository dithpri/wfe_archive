[color=scarlet]A Roman legion that took part in a series of failed Roman attempts to annex Armenia.

The legion was responsible for severe warcrimes, including the mass killing of armenian civilians and the urbicide of several major towns, before it was defeated by Parthian forces and surrendered after the Battle of Rhandeia.

In the First-Jewish Roman War, the legion got defeated too and due to it many failures in war, Emperor Vespanian decided to fight without the legion in the Year of the Four Emperors.

The legion would later fight in three successless wars against the Parthians and from 219 AD on disappear from Roman records, indicating it was dissolved due to inefficiency and treason (as their commander tried to coup the Emperor but failed).[/color]
