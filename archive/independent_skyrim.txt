[b]Welcome[/b] to independent Skyrim.  Here you can role play as long as you follow simple rules.  The rules will be in a seperate dispatch below.  No restrictions on embassies.  You must always hail Ulfric Stormcloak  everyday.  Also we have a dispatch of shame and that dispatch is for recononizing nations that broke the rules.
