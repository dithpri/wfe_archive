Dead Soul Collective is a strategic alliance of military powers with strict law enforcement a very low tolerance for political dissent. As raiders and conquerors, we take what we want and crush those who stand in our way. Our people are fiercely patriotic and would never dream of questioning their government. Those who do die or disappear in sudden and mysterious ways.
