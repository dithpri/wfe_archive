When the World Assembly Security Council was created years ago, this region was used by Trav, Topid, Unibot, Sedge, and many other prominent members in the early Security Council as a drafting room.

The region served as the symbolic target of a Liberation resolution to show the WA community&amp;#39;s support for a full split of the General Assembly and the Security Council.

The region has fallen into disrepair, as has the corresponding body of the WA. With Rule IV in effect, the &amp;quot;Security Council Community&amp;quot; collapsed, and the SC has never recovered. There is no longer a group of players that identify primarily as Security Council players, and there never will be again.
