Welcome to Sections of World Nations

This a Role play Region Based on:
[b]Nstracker.com[/b] for justice, evening out the war--as of war we might want to prohibit attacking a nation weaker than your half(divided) military, but doing so still with means of wanting the conquering: if you would be able to force them into [b]alliance signing[/b], but do know that anyone can make them sign as well&amp;lt;meaning you will have to fight off your enemies. Then for role playing would be world news about what is in your nation/ about what is happening.
