You&#39;re traveling through another dimension, 
a dimension not only of sight and sound but of crimes. 
A journey into a worthless land whose boundaries are that of incarceration. 
That&#39;s the signpost up ahead&#151;your next stop, 
the Thirty Mile Zone.

Object known as a camera, vintage uncertain, origin unknown. But for the greedy, the avaricious, the fleet of foot who can run a four-minute mile so long as they&#39;re chasing a fast buck, it makes believe that it&#39;s an ally, but it isn&#39;t at all. 
It&#39;s a beckoning come-on for a quick walk around the block in the Thirty Mile Zone  ...hurray for Hollywood?
