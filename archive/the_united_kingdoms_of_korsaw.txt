We are the Kingdoms of Korsaw, a continent with a normally cold climate, and tons of undiscovered land! I, the Kaiser of The Kingdom of Dorklova, have a map that I constantly change based on the new nations and their history and climates. If you wish to see the map, just email me at Dstrick999&amp;#64;gmail.com and I will send you a copy of the latest map. We are mainly peace keepers but may have small feuds over land within ourselves from time to time, and will help fight for our allies when they are being raided. We have our importance of RPing and Politics equaled. I hope this region sounds fun to all of you. Take care!
