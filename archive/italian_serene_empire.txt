Welcome to the Italian Serene Empire, a region founded on protecting civil rights, providing a thriving economy, and supporting most types of government!

We support embassies and focus on creating a better region for the well-being of ourselves and others.
The Italian Serene Empire is one of the oldest regions, founded in 2006.

Our history and track records allow us to learn and use that knowledge for improving our military, social welfare, defense, and the education system!
