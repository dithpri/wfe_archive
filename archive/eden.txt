[b]Welcome to EDEN[/b]

[color=green]Your saddened eyes are full of tears,
But they belong to yesterday&amp;#39;s fears,
You can smile now because you&amp;#39;re here,
In the place they call Eden.

Your broken heart, it&amp;#39;ll mend for you,
Watch your smile as it breaks through,
And dry those tears you weep so blue,
In the Garden of Eden.

Your muscles ache, they&amp;#39;re battle scarred,
You&amp;#39;ve been through it all and had it hard,
All your worries and pain are gone away,
Now that you&amp;#39;re home, in Eden.
