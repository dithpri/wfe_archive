Welcome to the Isle of Wight; where music lovers can make a pilgrimage to the place where legends have set foot.
If you and your nation wish to live in a place where citizens can feel the love and the music then live on this Diamons shaped decaying rock.

Rock hard!
We welcome all goverment forms; but only those who are willing to do what they can for the good of the Island.
