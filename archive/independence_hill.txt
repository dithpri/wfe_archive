Induction of States:
-Set your title to State or Commonwealth.

-Set your currency to the Universal Treasury Note ([] = symbol for UTN).

-Vote on the New American Constitution of the United States of Independence Hill in the comment section of the Nation (Although ratified, the vote on the issue is still a requirement for statehood.)

Failure to meet these requirements will mean your nation will not be a State and will be geographically locked from the United States of Independence Hill, and recognized as a colony of the USIH.
