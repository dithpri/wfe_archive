Originally founded by Latin Revolutionaries in the revolution that turned The Anumist Alliance 2 into a revolutionary socialist group, The Anumist Revolution had a great history, but after the Founder died, the region was held under a dictatorship by Lawton Park (now banned from the game).

The [region]Children of the Grave[/region] invaded, freeing Anumists from Lawton&amp;#39;s regime, and, providing a neutral forum for Anumists to plan a new government, kept this region as a trophy once the Anumists found a new home in [region]The Anumist Alliance[/region], when the founder nation was gifted to [nation]Anumia[/nation] by [nation]Leviathen[/nation].

The region has been refounded by [nation]Anumia[/nation] and kept for its history.
