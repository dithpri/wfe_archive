[b]To celebrate a new friendship and alliance, [region]Thaecia[/region] and [region]Balder[/region] went on a pillaging spree! 

Floating down rivers to chill spots in starry islands, these unabashed pillagers traversed far and wide to the new yonder before chancing upon this fine spot for a chance to gander for loot, mayhaps chancing on some archipelagos chock full of pie.

To new adventures with new friends!
