[i]From the Halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli;
We fight our country&#39;s battles
In the air, on land, and sea;
First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean;
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marine
Our flag&#39;s unfurled to every breeze
From dawn to setting sun;
We have fought in every clime and place
Where we could take a gun;
In the snow of far-off Northern lands
And in sunny tropic scenes,
You will find us always on the job
The United States Marines.
Here&#39;s health to you and to our Corps
Which we are proud to serve;
In many a strife we&#39;ve fought for life
And never lost our nerve.
If the Army and the Navy
Ever look on Heaven&#39;s scenes,
They will find the streets are guarded
By United States Marines.[/i]
