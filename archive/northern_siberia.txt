[b]Northern Siberia will dominate the world![/b]

Northern Siberia is a place for isolation and freedom. The countries here must only follow a few simple rules:

1. No Monarchies, Theocracies, or Anarchy
2. We DO NOT interact with the filthy World Assembly

All are welcome as long as they obey the orders given by Vladimir Visilli of the COMi Corporation and Commosky.
