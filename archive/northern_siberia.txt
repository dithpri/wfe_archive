[b]WELCOME TO [color=blue]NORTHERN SIBERIA[/color][/b]
 [color=blue][i]~ Where Democracy is strong and Capitalism robust ~[/i][/color]

[color=blue]We do hope you have the most joyous of visits when visiting Northern Siberia. 
We tend not too view ourselves as a region of sorts, more of an International Community where our citizens reside.
There is no legislation in place requiring citizens of Northern Siberia too hold a passport or visa when travelling between our nations.[/color]

[color=red][i]Please be aware that [b]Northern Siberia[/b] does NOT have a military force; and shall not participate in any International conflict.[/i][/color]
