Welcome to the Roman Coalition, where there is peace, prosperity, and unity amongst all nations. We are but a small region, dedicated to keeping our borders safe from any and all malevolent forces. If you wish for protection, then you will find friends with open arms; if you wish for war, you will find only death and damnation. Under the banner of the one True Roman Empire, we can finally relinquish our shackles, and find solace under the Aurelianii, the Defenders of Rome.
Senatus Populusque Romanus!
