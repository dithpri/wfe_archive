[b][color=navy]Welcome to[/color] [color=red]Alterra,[/color] [color=navy]a New World![/b]

Alterra is a parallel version of the Earth with its own history. The region is based around role playing and the [b]Cooperative History Project[/b], a joint effort by all our nations to build a complete history of our world from the dawn of civilization to the present. There are unlimited opportunities for both new and experienced players to be part of building something unique from the ground up. Do you like creating history? Then this is the region for you!
