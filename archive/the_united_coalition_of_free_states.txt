The United Coalition of Free States or UCFS is a group of newer states trying to make it in the confusing and vast world of Nation States. While still weak, this group hopes to grow in power as an example of newer players coming together. As we grow, elections will be held to appoint you, the nations, into positions of power where YOU can make a real difference!
We highly value the opinions and wants of our players. Feel like a new office is needed? Suggest it and elections will be held to decide if it should be enacted.
