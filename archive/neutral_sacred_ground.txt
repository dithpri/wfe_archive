Long ago, the Earth existed in perfect harmony under the rule of three gods. Celestia the god of the stars ensured a safe and calm environment for the people through the means of strict laws and punishments. Umbra the god of the moon created freedom for all turning order into anarchy and risking lives for the sake of fun. Aurora the god of the sun watched over her demigods ensuring balance was kept between the light and the dark. And the people lived in paradise with the perfect mix of order and chaos. Umbra and Celestia worked together as opposites to ensure peace and prosperity to all.

But all good things must come to an end&#133;
