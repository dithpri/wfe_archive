     With God as our source of inspiration, guidance, and leadership, we will protect our great empire from it&#39;s enemies and seek to thrive in all areas, economy, society, and political freedom. Our leader will make the decisions he truly thinks is best with the help of his right hand man like God the Father does to judge the living and the dead.
