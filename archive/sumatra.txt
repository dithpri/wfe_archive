Sumatra is an island in western Indonesia and part of the Sunda Islands. It is the largest island that is entirely in Indonesia and the sixth largest island in the world.

The climate of the island is tropical, hot and humid. Sumatra has a wide range of plant and animal species but has lost almost 50 percent of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years, and many species are critically endangered such as the Sumatran Ground-cuckoo, Sumatran tiger, Sumatran elephant, Sumatran rhinoceros, and Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious haze over neighboring countries, causing considerable tensions with affected countries such as Malaysia and Singapore. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
