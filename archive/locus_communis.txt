Locus Communis is a collection of many advanced nations gathered within the one multiverse there is according to the Multiverse Theory. 

There are many different nations, alliances, factions and groups of nations that define the internal borders of Locus Communis. 

&quot;Locus Communis&quot; is Latin for &quot;Space Collective&quot;, which shows that the region, while it may be separated in its factions and alliances, is one with the multiverse, although it is often argued by many analysts that the region may as well have been split into the factions and alliances that are within its borders.

Please follow the rules and keep in mind that this region is a Work In Progress. Don&#39;t forget to join the official Discord server here:
