The Federation of Abenworth is an alliance of united nations that are not that united because they fight all the time. They sometimes stop nuking each other long enough to play a game of friendly soccer or perhaps eat some chocolate, but generally they hate each other. We are a united trade alliance throughout the universe.

The only purpose of this region is free trade.
