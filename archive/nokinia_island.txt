 A SHORT HISTORY OF NOKINIA ISLAND
Nokinia island was discovered in 1822 by Hopij Nokinia, an explorer from the continent of Thryshikinaston. It remained unsettled until 1893, when people fled Thryshikinaston by the trillions during the black uprising. A lot of them set sail for Nokinia island. 54/55 of them died along the way. The survivors thrived, as Nokinia island has been awarded the SSC (Society for Safer Citizens) award for best island to be washed up on and survive. In 1989, Thryshikinaston was destroyed by the zombie apocolypse, and was thus nuked into oblivion. Nokinia island is now the only landmass within 200,000,000,000 miles in any direction.
