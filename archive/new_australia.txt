Welcome to the Commonwealth of New Australia
- We give our respect to all Indigenous Peoples.

Both religion and republicanism are banned from all governance.

Most importantly: If you can&#39;t live in harmony, consider the borders closed.

We answer to our Sovereign: King Carlisle I of Brisbane.

We dance to our National Anthem: &quot;Treaty&quot; by Yothu Yindi.

Hate and division shall only cause love and unity here.
