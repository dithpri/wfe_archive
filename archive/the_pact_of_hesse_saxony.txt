Guten Tag and Willkommen to our fair region of Hesse-Saxony! We are a friendly region, that is fairly new to Nation States, and looking forward to a great experience! Feel free to stop by anytime for some friendly conversation, and a non alcoholic, ice cold, traditionally brewed, Oldenfranckian beer, thats got everyone yacking about it from the Rhine, all the way to the Elbe! Cheers and Danke!
