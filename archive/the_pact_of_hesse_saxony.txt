[color=red][b]Welcome to the Pact of Hesse Saxony![/b][/color]

Our region was before the [region]Union of Saxon Justice[/region] which has become essentially a failed region with little to no influence in the world. This region is currently in the work, and a constitution will be ratified in time. 

The merge with [region]Justice[/region] was a success for a time. Now it has created a region of nations fighting for control. Here we are a Pact of Nation, here to support each other and better our region with facts and nations. Leave the Union, and join the Pact!

Make sure you vote for [nation]Amer-Africa[/nation] in the current regional elections, he&#39;s the guy that knows what&#39;s best for the [region]Union of Saxon Justice[/region]
