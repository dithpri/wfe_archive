Derpopolis. A peaceful place, but an uneasy one. The BBI created this place as a nerd refuge from anti-science nations and regions. Unfortunatly the nations are inharmonius as the bandits roaming the deserts inbetween the ruins of Critchtovia, the new Critctovian island, the jungles of the squirrel kingdom, the chip tundra, and the cavernous Shadovian republic threten any movement between the area&#39;s. also the threatening defenses of all four nations make the bonds shakey at best. The squirrel kingdom is the most powerful, followed by shadovian republic, then chip and critchtovia.
