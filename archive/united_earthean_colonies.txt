From the Fields of Jiangsu;
To the shores of the Dead Sea;
We fight our reigon&#39;s battles
In the air, on land, and sea;

First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean;
We are proud to claim the title
Of Gamarasuvian Marines!

[b]To all those who fight for honor, and the unification of our planet and her colonies, we salute you[/b].
