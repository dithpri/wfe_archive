The Order of Conglomerate Nations consists of The Empire of The Callesta, The Commonwealth of Woolloomoolloo, and The Dominion of Tamrielic Islands.

The Order of Conglomerate Nations was founded by The Commonwealth of Woolloomoolloo after a peace treaty was signed between Woolloomoolloo and Emperor Callesta Constantus. The Domion of Tamrielic Islands joined, more by force rather than acceptance. But don&#39;t tell anyone we told you that.
