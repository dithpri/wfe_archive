two Holy Bishops of Rome who paid witness to our time, will be canonized.[/color][/b]

[b][color=black]Welcome to the [u]only[/u] sanctuary for the devout, serious Catholic in NS.
We are the [u]only[/u] truly serious Christian region involved in apologetics in NS.
Where faith, philosophy, and science are explored.

Science never contradicts faith, but upholds it. We believe in the inerrancy of [url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_INDEX.HTM]Sacred Scripture[/url],
along with sacred tradition which has served [url=http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm]The Church[/url] for over 2000 years.
We hold to the [url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM]catechism[/url] of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.

We honor, and remember Msgr. Georges Lema&icirc;tre[/color][/b]
