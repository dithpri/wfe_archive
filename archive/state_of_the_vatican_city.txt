The Vatican City State, sovereign and independent, are the remnants of the papal states that in 1859 comprised an area of some 17,000 sq mi (about 44,000 sq km).
Popes in their secular role ruled much of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy. 
In 1870, the pope&amp;#39;s holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of &amp;quot;prisoner&amp;quot; popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy
