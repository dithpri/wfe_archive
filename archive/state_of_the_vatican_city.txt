[b][color=black]Welcome to the sanctuary for the devout, serious Catholic.
We are the only truly serious Christian region involved in apologetics in NationStates.
Where faith, philosophy, and science are explored.

Science never contradicts faith, but upholds it. We believe in the inerrancy of [url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/_INDEX.HTM]Sacred Scripture[/url],
along with sacred tradition which has served [url=http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm]The Church[/url] for over 2000 years.
We hold to the [url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_INDEX.HTM]catechism[/url] of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.
We honor, and remember Msgr. Georges Lema&icirc;tre[/color][/b]
