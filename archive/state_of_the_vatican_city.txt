[color=red][b]Merry Christmas to one and all. Peace on earth to men of goodwill. The birth of Jesus Christ brings salvation to all those seeking God.[/b][/color]

[b]Welcome to our sanctuary where faith, philosophy, and science are explored.
Science never contradicts faith, but upholds it. We believe in the inerrancy of sacred scripture along with sacred tradition which has served the church for over 2000 years.

We hold to the catechism of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.
