[color=#C2ED00]Hello! You have stumbled into Greater Meme! We are a region mainly used for puppet storage, but anyone is welcome!
Many silly invaders have attempted to take us in the past year, but they can&#39;t breach through! Who would want to invade a puppet region anyway?
Enough about invaders. We have a cultural exchange contract with [region=21st Century Rome], we provide memes and jokes for their newspaper! We also are protected by [region=Spear Danes].
