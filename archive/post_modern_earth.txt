Are you looking for a Modern/Post-Modern roleplaying region? If so telegram [nation]Rupeslonga[/nation] for the password.  Post-Modern Earth is hopefully going to become a small sized region with active roleplayers. (10-20 Nations max)

*Regional Summit thread at 5 Nations
*Regional Map updated once national maps are submitted
*Feel free to take initiative and create roleplaying threads based within the region
*Wars between nations are allowed, however it is suggested appointing a neutral nation as a GM.
