The Holy Republic of Jai was founded by the nation of Hensoni, and continues to this day to be a Theocracy subject to the Holy Book of Jai, and it&#39;s ten creeds. Though it&#39;s religious policies have become more relaxed in recent years, it&#39;s Holy Emperor Lord Alexander the First is considered to be the communicator to Jai, and his word is law.
