This region is a complete democracy. Literally [b]EVERYTHING[/b] is decided by the people (if requested). Executive positions, embassies, bans, and even [b]the name of the region and the rules[/b].

You could have a poll deciding if a specific nation should have to have the Banana as their national animal or else they get banned. The possibilities are endless.
