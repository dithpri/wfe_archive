
The Cape Kingdom is a constitutional Monarchy.

The Monarch is the Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Military Forces. 

All citizens have a say in the Regional Assembly, where everyone have the opportunity to participate, debate, vote and join Government or run for elections.

We have Prime Minister who is the Head of Government of the Cape Kingdom

Our Regional Government is divided into four branches:

1. The Monarch (The King &amp; Queen)
2.  Executive Branch  (Cabinet)
3.  Legislature Branch  (Regional Assembly)
4. Judicial Branch  (Constitutional Court)

Let&#39;s share the power of Regional Government by joining the Cape Kingdom
