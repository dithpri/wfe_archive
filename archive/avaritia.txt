The Region of Avaritia is home to vast lands with many tribes, though not many established nations. The Rulers of these great lands come together to govern as a whole in the council known as The Greater Nations. The main two players of this council, The ELOL and Impius Gentes, have been at odds as of late due to a series of bombing in The ELOL caused by Impius Gentes. The Gentian leader, Hugh Kriegg, has called these actions a righteous punishment for the ELOL sins of failing to worship the One (Gentes&amp;#39; version of god) and has declared war against the &amp;quot;heathen lands&amp;quot; (though most leaders believe it is just the imperialistic leader&amp;#39;s excuse to take the ELOL.)
