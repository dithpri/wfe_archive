The Region of Avaritia is home to vast lands with many tribes, though not many established nations. The Rulers of these great lands come together to govern as a whole in the council known as The Greater Nations. The main two players of this council, The ELOL and Impius Gentes, have been at odds as of late due to a series of bombing in The ELOL thought by officials to be the work of Gentes. Though denying any and all affiliations with the bombings, Gentes has taken the accusations personally and declared war against the ELOL (Though many think this is a ploy by their imperialistic leader for more land). But both nations are unaware of a third enemy, who plans to destroy both nations and lead Avaritia against them.
