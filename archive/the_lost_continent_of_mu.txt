[region]The Lost Continent of Mu[/region] was recently rediscovered, emerging as a new player in world politics. Mu&amp;#39;s rich mythology plays on legends of arcane power, nameless horrors, and stunning vistas - its varied landscape is rivaled in awesome majesty only by the Cyclopean geometry of its ruins.

Mu&amp;#39;s nations share a rich history in the rumored &amp;quot;Birthplace of Humanity&amp;quot; which has so far prevented conflict, even among its most diverse nations. 

The Nation States of Mu currently discuss their issues at [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Lost_Continent_of_Mu/index/]The Council of Lemuria[/url] (offsite forum).
