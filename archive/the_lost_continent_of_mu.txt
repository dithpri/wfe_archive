Mu is a mystical lost continent introduced by Augustus Le Plongeon, who used the &quot;Land of Mu&quot; as an alternative name for Atlantis. It was subsequently popularized as an alternative term for the hypothetical land of Lemuria by James Churchward, who asserted that Mu was located in the Pacific.
