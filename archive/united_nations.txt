[b]The United Nations is a region welcoming all nations resolved to live in peace and active trade with their neighbors.  We are a diverse group.  We hope to have a representative of each kind of political category.[/b]

The history of this &amp;quot;ancient&amp;quot; region includes one threat of extinction and one near extinction.  Because we were resurrected we commemorate our survival with these everlasting cheers:  [color=green]LONG LIVE MAX BARRY!  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.  All Hail KING BOBERT, Monarch of the excellent [nation]Tihland[/nation]![/color]
