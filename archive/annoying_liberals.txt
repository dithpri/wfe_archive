Come on, people.  Wise up.   Some of you were still in college when you last voted, but now that you&amp;#39;re in the real working world --if you can find a job--you need to be realistic, not idealistic.  Vote for Romney and restore America.

Later note:  Now, with the health care mandate, we have had the largest tax increase in US history on the middle class.  Some of you were seriously fooled.  Read something other than the liberal newspapers.
