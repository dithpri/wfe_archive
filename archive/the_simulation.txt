the simulation is a region where nothing is ever fake or real. It was founded by a mad computer scientist trying to build a perfect new world. It is said to only exist in a computer screen but nobody is sure if it was a physical simulation of the world itself. It may be physical or digital nobody knows except the programmer and we&#39;re not even sure if he knew himself. Things randomly pop in and out of existence and much of the world is printed from peoples minds using nanobots.
