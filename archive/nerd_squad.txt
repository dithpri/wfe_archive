[region]Nerd Squad[/region] is a smallish region founded by [nation=noflag]Boatsisreal[/nation]. Originally home to four separatist nations that left [region]Realm 90[/region] after the infamous scandal that is known only as [i][color=red]The &#39;Bama Incident[/color][/i], the fledgling region has expanded to encompass [nation=noflag]United Republic of Ogrelands[/nation]. Nerd Squad maintains working relations with Realm 90, though the region&#39;s founder, [nation=noflag]Oclos[/nation], is barred from entering Nerd Squad territory. Recently, the nation once known as Pazooki dissolved for unknown reasons.
