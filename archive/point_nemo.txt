This is the place in the ocean that is farthest from land. The area is so remote that&#151;as with any location more than 400 kilometers (about 250 miles) from an inhabited area&#151;sometimes the closest human beings are astronauts aboard the International Space Station when it passes overhead.

All nations are welcome to join and leave as they please.
