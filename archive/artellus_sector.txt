Artellus Sector is a new region created for science-fiction RP within, you guessed it, the Artellus Sector.  The aim for this region is to sustain a well-rounded region with factions based around either mining and manufacturing, research and development, military, agriculture, finance, piracy, mercenary services and other industries to create a balanced sector.

The region is new and currently locked while assets are being created.  If you like the regional goals and what assets are forthcoming, feel free to TG me with an expression of interest and any queries you have.  I&amp;#39;d be happy to read and reply!
