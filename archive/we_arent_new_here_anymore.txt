This region is a new and revived version of the old region named &quot;Im Just New Here&quot; which was created in late 2016. Due to its founder [nation]Zawikhiztan[/nation] leaving and all other participant nations either leaving or ceasing to exist, the region itself ceased to exist. After heavy negotiations, they have agreed to return, but this time, [nation]Ubja[/nation] was to lead.

Though this name sounds like it&#39;s for veteran players, new players are invited to join it as well, as we strive to be a peaceful, neutral region.

This region is a neutral region and only desires to create a brotherhood between the nations. This region aims to be politically neutral however debates and other discussions are encouraged. 

Hope y&#39;all have a great time in WANHA
