
 [b]The bright sun was extinguish&#39;d, and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came and went&#151;and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions in the dread
Of this their desolation; and all hearts
Were chill&#39;d into a selfish prayer for light:
And they did live by watchfires&#151;and the thrones,
The palaces of crowned kings&#151;the huts,
The habitations of all things which dwell,
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum&#39;d,
And men were gather&#39;d round their blazing homes
To look once more into each other&#39;s face.
No respite could be had, nor comfort given,
for the [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]foe[/url] had gathered
and darkness swallowed the sun.
