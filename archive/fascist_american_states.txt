[b][color=#0d0d0d]This region was once a property of [nation]Frostland[/nation], long since disgraced. It then fell into the hands of a fellow anti-fascist organization, before that organization fell to ruin and this region was seized by the NationStates Anti-Fascist Compact. It will now stand as a monument against fascism, to be held for all time.[/color]
