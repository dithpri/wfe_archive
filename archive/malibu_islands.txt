Welcome to [b]Malibu Islands[/b]...home of the [i]islandicious[/i] Empress Jhessan and her many bouncy beach-volleyball mates! Also Jianna I of Gruenberg, who ain&#39;t too shabby herself. That can&#39;t be said for the many creepy dudes who like to travel here just to spy on them. Or that pervert Tehrani, who has installed lines of binocular viewers all along the islands&#39; shores so tourists can also get a peek. Or, for that matter, the paparazzi permanently encamped in various coconut trees lining our pristine golden beaches, or all the drunks passed out on said beaches... Er, whatever. Just enjoy your stay, and avoid the riffraff.

[b]Malibu Islands is a protectorate of [region]Antarctic Oasis[/region].[/b]
