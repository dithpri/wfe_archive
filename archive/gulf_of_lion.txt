[b][color=#5D3859]Gulf of Lion[/b][/color], extending along the coast of southern France from the Spanish border (west) to Toulon (east). The gulf receives the Tech, T&ecirc;t, Aude, Orb, H&eacute;rault, Vidourle, and Petit and Grand Rh&ocirc;ne rivers. When cold-air masses flow past the Alps and sweep southward down the Rh&ocirc;ne River valley, the gulf experiences a dry, cold, northerly wind known locally as the mistral.

The gulf coastline includes the easternmost spurs of the Pyrenees, several lagoons, the Rh&ocirc;ne River delta, and limestone hills near the city of Marseille. Many canals and waterways (especially, the Rh&ocirc;ne River) link coastal areas with the hinterland.
