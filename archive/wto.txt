The mighty forces of [region]The Death Platoon[/region] and [region]The Mongolian Empire[/region] have taken and annexed this region from the wannabe [nation]KingMaker[/nation]! \(*_*)/

This region is now annexed thanks to our fearless leaders, Genghis Khan and El Maestro. &amp;#128521;

But the main reason for taking over was just to take away that dreadful Facebook and abolish the flag that used to be here, if you&#39;re a native and active, you can take this down and put whatever you want. Good day!
