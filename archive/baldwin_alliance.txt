The [region]Baldwin Alliance[/region] was founded October 25, 2017, and is named after a divine family, the Baldwins. It is dedicated to this family and their two high-quality doggos, Casper and Dozer. 

We are extremely proud of what the Baldwin Alliance and its member nations have accomplished and what we stand for. The Alliance is led by the worthy and respected Doggo Dost, roughly translated as &quot;Friend of Dogs.&quot; This office is held by Charles Willis of [nation]Casper-Dozer[/nation], who also serves as the World Assembly Delegate and founded the region. [nation]Wealthy Commoners[/nation] is a trusted ally and advisor of the Doggo Dost who holds the position of Deputy Doggo Dost.
