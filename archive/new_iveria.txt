The region of New Iveria was born out of the downfall of the Iverian Union, which subsequently brought down all the existing nations of Old Iveria. The nations of New Iveria are relatively new, but the region is growing, and now hosts a variety of different countries. Officers have been assigned, no legislation has been passed, and the countries of New Iveria are voting on entering the World Assembly.
