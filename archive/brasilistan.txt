Brasilistan is a democratic country composed of many federative states. Each state has its own government and its own state laws, though all states must comply to national laws. 

Nations that maintain friendly relations with Brasilistan are welcome to stay. Nations who display aggression and animosity towards Brasilistan will be promptly removed. The same applies for regions as well. Requests for embassies will be subject to evaluation by the Brasilian Foreign Ministry.
