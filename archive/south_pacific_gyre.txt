[color=blue][b]The South Pacific Gyre[/b][/color]

The South Pacific Gyre is a [b][color=red]casual[/color][/b] region. We don&#39;t expect anything from our members except that they are not invaders and that they aren&#39;t mean to other players. 

New players can feel free to ask some of the more experienced nations if they don&#39;t know something about the game, or they could just look it up, there are very good explanations. 

This is a great region for players that just want to focus on their nation, and not regional affairs, but if you want to be an active member of the region, feel free to. Really, the only kinds of nations that shouldn&#39;t move to the [color=blue][b]Gyre[/b][/color] are invaders and players who like a lot of roleplay.
