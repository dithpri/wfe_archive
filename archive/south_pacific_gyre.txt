The south pacific gyre irl is where a lot of the world&#39;s trash collects. Likewise, this region is where Nationstates&#39; trash collects (as well as the occasional metaphorical &quot;beautiful tropical fish&quot;). This is a region for just about anyone, but was originally created for joke nations, ironic players, new players, and casual players. Join if you want to, join if you don&#39;t want to. We could really use more nations. The gyre once boasted 37 nations, but has recently, due to mass quittings, become a desolate wasteland of just 4 nations. So Join Now!
