Hello, and welcome to APSAD. Some people would like to call us extremists. We would like to call us visionaries. This is because we can see a future without violence, ignorance and prejudice. Now, after reading this brief description of our vision, would you call us extremists? If so, stop reading now. In the case that you are intrigued by our ideas and beliefs, you may be exactly the kind of person that we&#39;re looking for. But Nations that desire to join APSAD must fulfil particular criteria. Any nation requesting to join must be dedicated to this game, have a generally well kept nation, and must have an intelligent, and scientifically advanced nation. If you fit this criteria feel free to join.
