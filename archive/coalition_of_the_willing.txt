[B][Region]The Black Hawks[/region] took out some hawklings out for a flight today, with a plethora of folks taking to the skies as well to show them some moves! The Hawks and baby Hawks practiced their aerial tricks, flying through hoops and doing barrel rolls to show off their immense skill to each of the regions they flew through.
