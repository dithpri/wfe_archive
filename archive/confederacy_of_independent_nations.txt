Welcome to the Confederacy of Independent Nations. We are a union of sovereign nations which came together to strengthen our position in the world one another and work together. We value free trade and peaceful cooperation among ourselves. 
Our goals are the preservation, spreading and defence of democracy, liberty and justice.

We don&#146;t encourage membership in the World Assembly. The WA is a hopeless bureaucratic mess unable to solve the world problems. 

We are aligned economically and militarily.
