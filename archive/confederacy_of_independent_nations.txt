We are the region for the introverted isolationist nation. We will generally keep our nose out of your business, and vice versa with only a few exceptions. 

In short we are perfect for the world leaders who wish to go it alone, but don&#39;t want to get trampled by others.

We will provide for each other&#39;s mutual defense as long as the aggressor is not you.

The only stipulation is that you not be tyrannical, protect religious freedom within your own borders, and maintain a laissez faire capitalist system.

Let us lazy introvert nations unite!
