Ancient homeland of the Andertion Empire and the Ate Dominion (an semi-independent entity within the Andertion Empire)

A large valley near the coast of the Nodens Ocean. The Valley was once home to 21 clans, now the 20 are ruled by Andertion. The Ate, rulers of the Southern Deserts and builders of the Glass cities of the Oasis, who once raided and subjugated the Andertions, injecting them with Ate culture, now serve the Andertions as faithful, but often reluctant, allies.
