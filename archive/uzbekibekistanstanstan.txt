This region is made up of several seniors from Hanover High School.

Urban Dictionary defines HHS as :
&amp;quot;HHS is located in Hanover, NH. The student body is mostly made up of pot-smoking, preppy, 4.0 GPA, DI athletes. Many of the students complain about how they didn&amp;#39;t get into Yale, but instead they have to resort to going to a safety school, like Middlebury or Weslyan. Because Hanover is home to the Ivy League school Dartmouth, it&amp;#39;s a great way for HHS kids to go unwind with some frat-house parties any night of the week. 
Showing up to school hungover, or even still drunk from the nights adventures is common, and almost even expected.&amp;quot;
