An archipelago just north of the Shetland Islands, taking up a territory just below 14000 km&sup2;.
The whole archipelago is under the control of Ducker, and therefore, allows the countries near Quackapelago to only access some parts of it at a time. The main island, home to Duckeria, takes up a space of about 5162 km&sup2;, with the second largest island, being home to the second largest city, takes up a space of about 4848 km&sup2;. It is extremely rich in resources, but there is not much land to yield crops or support organic life.
