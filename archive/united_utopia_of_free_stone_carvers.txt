Welcome, traveler, to the tavern of the United Utopia of Free Stone Carvers. Stay a while and enjoy yourself. Post your tales from throughout NationStates on our regional message board, or banter with other travelers.

Everyone is welcome here, whether you are hiding from some raiders, banned from your last region, or just searching for a place to stay. We care about neither your past actions nor other regions&#39; grudges, as long as you do no harm to [i]us[/i].

Feel free to endorse our bartender and WA delegate [nation]Rorrickstead[/nation], or even your fellow travelers, as long as they don&#39;t reach two-thirds of Rorrikstead&#39;s endorsements.
