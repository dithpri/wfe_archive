A region home to two nations, who are at eternal war with one another.
On one side of the world is [B][color=red]Orionia[/color][/B], a theocratic, technophobic monarchy dedicated to maintaining order in the world at any cost. They fight against Vronsa because of their ultimate goal of spreading their religion across the entire world and forcing a hive-mind on every human alive.
Opposing them, [B][color=orange]Vronsa[/color][/B] is a chaotic territory dominated by mega-corporations and syndicates who do as they please. They fight against Orionia because they would lose their monumental wealth and power if they were ever to lose.
The war has gone on for 200 years, with no clear end in sight.
