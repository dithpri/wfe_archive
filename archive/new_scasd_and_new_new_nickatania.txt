Long ago, many nations sprung forth in the region of SCASD. For many years, they lived in harmony with each other and the four Nickatanian nations (founded by the sons of Nikolaus Mueller III), until their petty bickering led to the separation of the nations into the regions of Cooler than SCASD and Cooler than Cooler than SCASD. Eventually, the nations&amp;#39; infighting led to devastating wars until no governments were left and the land itself was scarred for eternity. The survivors traveled for generations until finding a new land where they would do well. They called this land &amp;quot;This Land&amp;quot;, but they agreed that it was a stupid name, so they named it in remembrance of the lost nations of their forefathers.
