[i]In generations past, the features of the ethereal void were known to its travelers as the shapes inside one&#39;s house. In the void, one travels as if by thought, yet sees neither friend nor foe. For the uninitiated, a journey through the void can change one&#39;s view of life itself. 

With the collapse of the Moongates, however, this retreat has closed. None can pass through them and into the void. From the befouled Sacred Shrines spills an ether barren of magical purity. Without this pure ether, there is no magic. Without this special link with the void, the shrine has become a barren station.[/i]
