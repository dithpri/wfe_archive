The Ethereal Void, also known as the Vortex, is an all-encompassing celestial framework within which the cosmos is bound.

It has been a major presence throughout the system, enveloping its many worlds and dimensions and drawing vast power from the life-forces of each. 

A higher plane of existence, the Void cannot be reached by physical travel; it is permeated by magic and accessible only by such means. Nevertheless, a number of beings, objects, and artificial constructs find their places in this astral domain.
