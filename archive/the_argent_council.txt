The Argent Council is committed to sterilizing darkspawn (raider) infections and presence in this world by any means necessary. 

Any region concurrently advertising a known raider group will be purged of said raider group&#39;s influence by our hand, by any means necessary, at any point that we are able to do so. 

We are not moralistic in our ideologies, nor can our actions be fully justified by the morally inclined, but make no mistake, we will do everything in our power to eliminate the raider infection in this game and drive these uncouth nations back to their home regions.
