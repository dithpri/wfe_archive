Eons ago, five moose broke free from a Lappland holding pen. These moose went into the wilderness of the Artic circle and were the first organisms to reach the North Pole. They then went and colonised New Zealand. This leads us to today - a mighty, and proud region in the Australasian ocean, with wierd tropical moose.
