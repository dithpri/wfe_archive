Declaration of the Protestant Commonwealth
Today, on the 9th of December in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior of all Sinners, by the rights invested in me by the Council of Elders, I hereby proclaim the region to be founded under new leadership. Today, we go from an autocratic monarchy to a republic. 
Today, the sounds of history echo through us, shouting of the past.
We can no longer submit ourselves to an outdated system of unstable governance, we take matters into our own hands.
