&quot;Yes, like other societies, Kievan Rus disappeared into history and will not return, but it has left a rich legacy in terms of socio-political system, religion, propaganda and culture.&quot;This is from &amp;#12298;The History of Russia&amp;#12299;,also I cut the original sentence into half only becuase it will be weird if I put the whole sentence though it is correct.Kievan Rus not only belong to russian history,or any other single country!&quot;The system and culture of Kievan Rus created bonds of bonding and prevented an era of division and defeat.&quot;Also &amp;#12298;The History of Russia&amp;#12299;
 Anyway welcom all leaders who enjoy this part of history.The passcode is the year of the fall of Kievan Rus,becuase the set up year isn&#39;t quite accurate.
