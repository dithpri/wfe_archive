Kievan Rus is a medieval Eastern European state with its capital in Kyiv, which existed during the ninth and thirteenth centuries. It united East Slavic and Finno-Ugric tribes under the rule of princes from the Rurik dynasty. At its peak, it stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south, and from the upper Vistula in the west to the Taman Peninsula in the east.
