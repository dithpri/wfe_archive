[b][i][color=red]IL CREDO DEL FASCISTA E L&#39;EROISMO, QUEOLLO DEL BORGHESE L&#39;EGOISMO[/b][/i][/color]

[b][color=blue]&quot; Liberty implies law.  If people would only get this little fact into their heads, they would not only begin to understand Fascism but begin to see all life in truer colours.  People who would disrupt society, break down the State, turn class against class, are the worst enemies of true liberty. True liberty is indeed preserved by the very denying of individuals to raise their hands against the State and against God.&quot;[/b][/color]
