This reign contains all of post apocalyptic America 

Fallout is an atompunk, retro-futuristic wasteland, ravaged by a 2077 nuclear war that froze culture in a stylized 1950s aesthetic. It is a dangerous, irradiated landscape of ruined cities, mutated creatures, and scavenging survivors, featuring, in some areas, a desperate struggle to rebuild civilization amidst the remnants of advanced, lost technology.
