Aurbis, also called Prime-world unofficially is the universe where Pilarcraft and Asmundia exist.
Pilarcraft does not remain in this region because I want to increase my influence, but the rest are all my puppets. (&amp;#64;Raiders: you [i]will[/i] be Ejected or Ban-Ejected when I notice you. please don&#39;t try it.)

View The Prime-World dispatch for information. The List of vacant nations that also exist in this universe will be added soon, TG any of the NS here, or [nation]Pilarcraft[/nation], if you want to RP as one.
