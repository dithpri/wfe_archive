Primarily an Elder Scrolls Roleplay Region. 
Please follow the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=884375]rules[/url]. if you have an idea for a new rule, share it. We will Put it to a referendum and if a majority agrees to it we will put it in the Rulebook.
(For the sake of comparing economy in different regions, we will suppose that The Currencies of each region all have the same value.)
As there is no rules right now, I&#39;m electing two of the members randomly to two random offices. In a few weeks, we&#39;ll have an election, as well as debate over whether we should have other positions of power or not
