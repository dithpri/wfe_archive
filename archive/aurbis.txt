The Aurbis contains Aetherius, Oblivion and the Mundus, which in turn contains Lorkhans own endeavor: Nirn. 

Nirn is the Arena. Only if your nation is strong enough, you will pass Lorkhans test.

This region is set in the 6th Era. All major alliances and empires dissolved, and Tamriel is now divided into small nations.

Please keep the nation names lore-friendly, and please don&amp;#39;t bring any ridiculous over-advanced technology into the realm.

Have fun!
