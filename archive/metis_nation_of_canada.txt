This is a region for anyone who identifies as M&eacute;tis. The M&eacute;tis are a group of indigenous peoples in Canada who being rejected by mainstream Canadian society, and by Aboriginal societies, were forced to form their own social group. Our values are similar to the First Nations of Canada as is our goals and at the same time, we juggle the competing demands of mainstream Canadian society.

We welcome all who love a good jig!
