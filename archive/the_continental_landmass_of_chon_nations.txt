The Continental Landmass of Chon Nations is a continent encompassing the now defunct Conglomerate of Chon Nations. An ancient region, the Conglomerate of Chon Nations was a place of diverse ecosystems, politics, and peoples. The Conglomerate of Chon Nations included 8 nations, each bringing their own unique flavor to the region. However, time degrades all things, even the Conglomerate of Chon Nations, though the specifics of how it dissolved are not known. Now, a newly reformed Chondai has come back to nation-state status. Creating The Continental Landmass of Chon Nations, Chondai seeks to recreate its once great conglomerate, echoing its predecessor&#39;s diversity in culture, environment, and society - one nation at a time.
