Place where I RP with myself.

[i]Five hundred years ago, the World&#39;s five great empires had a Great War.

The Trejanic Empire, the world&#39;s technological and military leader, won, and dissolved the other four empires into provinces dotting the world&#39;s map, and eliminated the other empires&#39; ruling dynasties.

After declaring himself God-Emperor of the World, Emperor Antonius lived gracefully into his 90s, and died.

Now, five hundred years later, the aging God-Emperor Davidus finds himself on his deathbed, with no legitimate heir, and the Empire poised to descend into civil war. . . . [/i]

RP year: 1933
Current God-Emperor: Davidus
