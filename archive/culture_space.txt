The Culture is an interstellar anarchist collective, with such advanced technology it has reached a state of post-scarcity, where few, if any, resources are not available to the general populace. The Culture centers itself around General Systems Vehicles, which store the vast majority of it&amp;#39;s populace. It also utilizes Orbitals, which are large artificial ring-worlds, as well as various less popular housing. It has generally transcended planets, and prefers to keep them in their natural, wild state.
Non-Culture entities are also welcome as guests, ambassadors, or simply because they wish to be here.
