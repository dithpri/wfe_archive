This is a huge continent, with a gargantuan mountain in the center, called the Autin Hal. To the south is the Farhalon Penninsula, and going around it counter-clockwise is the Southern Bay, then the Red Shore, then the Lowlands, followed by the Highlands, and finally the land beyond the destroyed wall. Coming up from that land is the long sea. North of the sea is the island, devided into two parts, with one half being consumed by the sands of the great desert, and the other half being crested by the spires of the impassable zion. West of this island is a vast jungle, and south of the jungle is the Badlands. Between the Badlands and the Farhalon Penninsula are a great sea, surrounding a sunken mountain chain that is dwarfed by the Autin Hal.
