The CUIM, or more formally known as the Confederation of United International Monarchies is an alliance of nations made to boost the power of each nation in this confederation. To join, you must be a monarchy (empire, kingdom, etc.)
Join the confederation to promote our influence!
The currency of this confederation is the dollar! You can name it with a pre-title of your choice! Although we suggest that you name it according to your nation. Adoption of this currency is not required and is up to you!
That is all! Thank you! :)
