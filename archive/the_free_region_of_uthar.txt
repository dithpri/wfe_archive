The free region of Uthar is a free region which accepts only democratic nations.

The People&#39;s republic Of FellingBurg has permanent Executive Authority over the region to maintain its permanent democracy. The region will only include non-corrupt and is strict on which nations to choose from.

The region is inhabited by a bunch of races, religions, and NGO&#39;s. Most governments are however secular to avoid a bias however all nations are excepted to accept religions and respect them. 

Other organizations cannot compare from Uthar due to it&#39;s lack of freedom and respect. Nations will be kicked out if they cannot compare to the standards of Uthar.
