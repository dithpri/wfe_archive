[b]This region is a different kind of region. Most democratic regions operate on a basis of a national government system, with nations being almost state-like entities in a loose confederacy. Here however we are creating a new type of region rarely seen, a community. This region will operate and breathe as a community. Here, nations operate as people. Our leaders are city councilmen and the Mayor, here we will thrive[/b]
