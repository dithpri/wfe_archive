[b][color=purple]Legend tells of figures that haunt these lands...[/color][hr]Figures in hooded robes, chanting prayers to a god as shadowy as the night they prowl. 
Figures with feathered forms, silent as the gusts of wind they soar upon. 
And as the firelight dims, you may find these are no mere legends at all...[hr]This region has been haunted by the spoooooky assassins from [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region], alongside a few friends from [region]the Black Hawks[/region]. Come, seek [url=https://discord.gg/brotherhoodofmalice][color=purple]the Overseer&#39;s unholy temple[/color][/url], and perhaps you may be the next to learn their ghostly ways.
