The Summum Bonum Stoic States, founded by the predestinated Grand duchy of Fatumnia is a region for that noble states that desire to achieve the ultimate highest goal: a piece of world completely free of worries, war, personal gain and other &#39;indifferentia&#39;. Based on the ancient Sto&iuml;c philosophy of Seneca, we stand for peace and fainess both in the region as in the people. In order to provide this to our citizens, our nations need to be open to new visions, yet strict to violators, and handle an absolute ban on capitalism, for capital (like money or oil) is the source of all evil and our greatest enemy in the quest for the Summum Bonum.
