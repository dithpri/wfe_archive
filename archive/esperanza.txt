&amp;quot;Not today, Scumbags.&amp;quot;
___
After a brief attempted take-over by the Black Riders, Esperanza is back under Nuurhielian control. As a precaution, WA delegates will no longer be allowed to access regional control, and we have changed our flag to mock the Black Riders for their failed attempt.
___
Esperanza is still running as normal: Mainly forgotten, ambivalent as ever, and singing the troll song at the Black Riders as this is their second time to attempt to invade us. I&amp;#39;ll reset this factbook entry soon, but for now this is a memo to let you know what happened, and an unofficial &amp;quot;TROLLOLOL&amp;quot; to the Black Riders, u mad bros?
