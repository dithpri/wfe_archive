[b][i]EMERGENCY ALERT! Hordes of zombies have been detected all across Esperanza, borders have been shut and Nuurhiel is researching a cure, while Valland and Summnter are trying to keep it under control with firepower. We urge all nations to take a stand on the issue in this dark time. We will update on the message board for further announcements.[/b][/i]

Tucked away in a lonesome corner of it&amp;#39;s own universe, Karkatus, a small region of nations resides by the name of Esperanza. It is a relatively peaceful region, and ambivalent towards all sides. Any nation or nations are welcome to join.
Embassy invitations will not be turned down, the region that sent them will be analyzed and if they are judged as &amp;quot;acceptable&amp;quot; they shall be accepted.
