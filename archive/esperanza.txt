Hidden away in a lonesome corner of Nationstates, Esperanza resides.. a place of refuge for nations wanting a more casual take on politics, more concerned with the game and talking with other nations than the serious aspects. Our stance on other regional events is neutrality. However, after two attempts now we are considering an Anti-Black Riders stance, meaning that we will remain ambivalent to all other regions, save those corrupted by the darkness, and will sometimes offer aid to regions that join in the fight for light... But normally are too lazy to do such things.

Embassy requests will generally be accepted, and the region that sent it will be at least be looked into to see if they are something we agree with. (By we, I mean Nuurhiel.)
