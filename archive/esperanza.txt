Hidden away in the corner of the world, in the one of the darkest, most forgotten places, a small group of nations resides. These nations strive to achieve peace with one another, and although it&amp;#39;s communications array between nations is normally quiet, there is occasionally some chatter between nations. Residents have no problem with new nations arriving, so long as they don&amp;#39;t cause trouble.
