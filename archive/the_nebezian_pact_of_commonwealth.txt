The Nebezian Pact of Commonwealth is a non-aggression alliance of social, political, economic and diplomatic agreement of interests among countries under the jurisdiction of the Nebezian centralized parliamentary government. Territories that opt or ought to join are subject to Nebezia&#146;s executive authority as official satellite states that are under any and all policies that form Nebezia&#146;s own laws. The Pact acts as an international community of mutual powers that promote the universal agenda of an isolationist status quo of neutrality. As an isolationist nation itself, Nebezia&#146;s attempts at depending on any global support is only through associating with the Commonwealth as an alternative to promoting the establishment of foreign treaties.
