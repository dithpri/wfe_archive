[Early Draft. Subject to Change]
Greetings, my friends. The Imperial Consortium is an empire that aims to both enlighten and protect the interests of the Human Race. Whilst we are not hostile towards Xenos species, we will not hesitate to remove them if they interfere with our agenda. Through politics, military maneuvering,espionage, and economic trade we will pave the way in gold for our fellow man.
In the Consortium, there is a place for all who wish to join us. To which his own reward according to his ability. We believe firmly that it is the responsibility of the Strong to strengthen the collective. When the weak become strong, then the strong become stronger.
Remember, Quid totum prodest, qui prodest
