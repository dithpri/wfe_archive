Southern Cabotia is the southernmost geographic portion of the Cabotian continent, and is usually considered a subcontinent.  While only the isthmian portion of Cabotia is usually considered to be the main portion of Southern Cabotia, numerous islands and occasionally part of Central Cabotia are also considered to be part of the region.  It consists mainly of tropical jungle and several mountain ranges.  It is considered a geologically active region and can experience many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes per year.
