 Helghan Empire is the autocratic governing body on planet Helghan, ruling over the Helghast people.The Helghast peoples&amp;#39; lives of extreme hardship naturally make them hardened soldiers. Most of Helghan&amp;#39;s fiscal and natural resources go towards the military, leaving little for domestic development. The Helghan military&amp;#39;s primary tactics primarily relate to the implementation of vicious, rapidly sweeping surgical strikes reliant on the element of surprise.
Endorse Militarized Helghan That is law.
&amp;quot;Violence has its own economy. Therefore be thoughtful and precise in your investment.&amp;quot;
&#151;Helghast philosophy
