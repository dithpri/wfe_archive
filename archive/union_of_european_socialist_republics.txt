[color=E9141D][i]SOCIALISTS will not be tolerated by the moral majority of this world. We cannot allow civil and moral degeneracy to spread to impressionable youth, because they as future leaders, must be responsible and respectable members of society[/i][/color][color=#000000]

We are FASCIST and we are everywhere!
