We, as Communist states, must unite for the rights of the proletariat and find our way to freedom! Not the false freedom, supposedly embraced by the larger &quot;Communist&quot; regions, for they have been corrupted from the inside by bourgeoisie infiltrators. The ideologies of Marx shall not go unnoticed in this century, as our might enlightens the skeptical and disillusioned. The inherent right of elections and free speech will be shown, communism will plant it&#39;s crops of peace within our lands, and borders will fall before the liberty shown by ourselves as well as brothers and sisters that are yet to join us. So comrades, I offer you a choice, stay complacent within your shackles, or rise to your feet as liberators!
