With the peace of tranquility and the strict enforcement of government, [region]POLATION[/region] is the republic that stands. Regarding the fair leadership of [nation=short]yu krane[/nation] and [nation=short]conglomerate authority[/nation], you are as equal the others.

We have survived terrorist, civil wars and the strongest, chaos. History is what would drag you down. The darkest of all darkness is the regret and anger of the past. Our shoulders are not compatible to sustain the anger we hold. Peace is the path of the future...
