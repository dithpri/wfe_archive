[b]REFOUNDED and made safe from further invasion, March 24, 2021.[/b]

Though a short distance from the urban areas of Cleveland and Akron, Cuyahoga Valley seems worlds away. The valley is a refuge for native plants and wildlife and provides routes of discovery for visitors. The winding Cuyahoga River gives way to deep forests, rolling hills and open farmlands. Walk or ride the Towpath Trail to follow the historic route of the Ohio and Erie Canal.
