The continent of Great Tyborrea is dominated by the Empire of Tyborrea, which controls the heartlands of Mitteland and exerts power over the continent&#39;s dominions. The dominions boast varying degrees of autonomy, from the frozen tundra of Aglaisland, the rocky isles of Kaisernum, the blistering deserts of Alakahiria and the rainforest covered archipelago of Caehdonia. Whilst the dominions are officially subservient to the Empire, each of the dominions have their own governments and act according to their own interests.
