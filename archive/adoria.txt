[colour=orange]Welcome to the region! This is a Conan/Hyborian inspired role play region set in the fantasy world of Adoria.[/colour]
In Adoria, many different creatures, creations and cultures come together to form a diverse landscape. Old and new nations have based themselves in Adoria, carving out legacies in the land.

There is no magic, but there are the blessings and the support of the almighty Gods. The Gods aid their followers and all those who pray for them, but they attempt to punish those who oppose them.

Can your nation brave Adoria, a land of foul creatures, warmongers and mysterious yet powerful Gods?
