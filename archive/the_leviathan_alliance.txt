The Leviathan Alliance is an established international alliance between nations whom generally support the revokement of political freedoms. While this does not apply to all the nations, it&amp;#39;s called &amp;quot;Leviathan&amp;quot; for a reason. The region has held off a great oppressor and an even greater enemy: The Black Riders, since it&amp;#39;s founding, and will continue to do so as long as it is the Leviathan Alliance.
