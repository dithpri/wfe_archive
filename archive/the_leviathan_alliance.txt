The Leviathan Alliance is an independent international alliance between sovereign nations determined to defend themselves against the former Black Riders. The Nations consist of various different governments and all operate differently. The only concern in the Alliance lies on an international, diplomatic scale. Internal affairs rarely, if ever, have an effect on the Alliance, unless they somehow impact other nations. Nations keep to themselves and operate purely out of the consolidation of power their alliance brings them.
