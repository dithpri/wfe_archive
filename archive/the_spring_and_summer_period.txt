In this Eurasian-inspired region, we cherish history and strive to ensure everyone can shape their nation&#39;s story. Our RP group embodies these core principles:

A:Hope prevails amidst conflict. We embrace optimism even in the face of tragedy, recognizing it as the path to a brighter future.

B: We foster a relaxed, friendly atmosphere, understanding busy schedules. Posting once a month suffices, and hostility is unwelcome.

C: Fascism, Communism, Anarchism, and hatred, is strictly prohibited. We prioritize tolerance, reject ethnic or cultural supremacism, extremism, and prejudice both in and out of character. While we accept anti-immigration policies, beliefs like &quot;The Great Replacement&quot; or xenophobia targeting specific cultures aren&#39;t.

Welcome!
