&amp;quot;In the conclusive years, [b]a silly place[/b] has been internationally noticed as a youthfully progressive and even thriving community by nobody. Some might find this regrettable, but I know I am speaking for all the citizens of this small community when I say: &amp;#39;We have longer socks than you.&amp;#39; Notable attractions here include the regional graveyard, which occupies nearly 80% of a silly place&amp;#39;s surface area, and the omnipresent threat of chavdom.&amp;quot;
