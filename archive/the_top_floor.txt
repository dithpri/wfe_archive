Somewhere in the WAHQ is a hallway that doesn&amp;#39;t get used. About two thirds the way down this hall, on the right side, is a door which appears to be for a woman&amp;#39;s bathroom. On this door is an old sign which says &amp;quot;OUT OF ORDER&amp;quot;. Behind the door is not a bathroom, but rather another hall leading to a lift. This lift only goes to the top floor of the building. The real top floor. The secret top floor. The real secret top floor. It is here that Gerome the Gnome lives.
