The Intercontinental Commune of Earth or I.C.E is a communist unionized Commune of unionized states (Continents) created by all the currently recognized continents of the world. All continents have relations with each other and authoritarian communist uniformity is evident as a precedence of this Earthly nation. All continents have equal rights as continents. While a barren land, the municipal continent of I.C.E is Antarctica.
