[b][color=#0d0d0d][i]They said you&#39;ll need the dark to shine / It&#39;s like I can see for the first time[/i]
This region has been [i]burned in glorious fire[/i] by the Champion of the Void, [nation]Nightrender[/nation], Lady of Many Masks. It is now a trophy of the Endless Void and that which beckons within. Those who do not bow down to the Endless Void will be eliminated, and those who do will be assimilated. You can dread it, run and hide, but the Void will always find you, and you too will be eliminated.[/color][/b]
