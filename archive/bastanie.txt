Bastanie is an old region which used to be prosperous. 7 nations used to cohabitate on the continent. The region was however devastated by Vavlar LLC., and only Biscarosse survived. 

Nowadays, Biscarosse controls the wastelands left from the ashes of its six former neighbors through its satellite commercial enterprises. 

Is Bastanie a region? Not anymore, Biscarosse IS Bastanie. Contact the Biscar Foreign Ministry for diplomatic interregional relations, or for migration. 
Glory to Biscarosse.
