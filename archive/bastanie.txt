A region that used to be a cradle of civilization, but was ravaged by the &quot;Inactivity&quot; disease. Only Biscarosse remains as a standing nation.
Biscarosse was able to recover quickly, and is a formidable nation:
A Military power, an Industrial power, a Cultural power, a Diplomatic power. All fit Biscarosse. 

After the downfall of Bastania, Biscarosse took control militarly of remains of the regions, using it as free real estate for settlers and industries alike. 
Occupied Bastania is separated into an Eastern, and a Western occupation zone, all commanded from Biscarosse.
