Ecstasia is a roleplaying region, that is based around becoming a dominant region. We are lead by [nation]Eudemra[/nation], founder of Ecstasia, who believes that dictatorship is alright as long as there is peace. We will always help a nation in need, and hope to establish good relations.

While some perceive Ecstasia as a floating island, it is actually in a secluded location that only allies know about.
