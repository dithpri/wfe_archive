Young man, there&#39;s no need to feel down
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground
I said, young man, &#39;cause you&#39;re in a new town 
There&#39;s no need to be unhappy
Young man, there&#39;s a place you can go
I said, young man, when you&#39;re short on your dough
You can stay there, and I&#39;m sure you will find 
Many ways to have a good time
It&#39;s fun to stay at the YMCA
