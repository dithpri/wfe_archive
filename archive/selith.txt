Selith is a region within Fairne, located on the Northwestern Quarter of most Imperial maps. It consists of one vast sprawling mainland, and then an archipelagic series of islands which gradually grow smaller and smaller before reaching the Rift Ocean, across which lies the land of Wolm. The land of Selith contains many different environments, but a great number of them are expansive, sprawling swamps while other areas are vast open plains with bogs. Travellers will often be blown away by the fantastical flora of Selith, such as the enormously overgrown mushrooms which sprout up around the swamps both on the islands and on the mainland.
