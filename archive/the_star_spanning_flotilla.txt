We have no homes. We are all different, but we have one thing in common; when things back home got rough, we took to the stars.

Welcome to the Star-Spanning Flotilla! We are a galaxy roaming fleet of starships with no homes. Whether you are political exiles or your home world suffered an apocalyptic event, you are welcome here. Just remember, try to keep the in-flotilla fighting to a minimum.
