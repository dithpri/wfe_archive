This is a fictional universe that I made, similar to one I made with my friend called &quot;Denvio&quot;.

However, in Denvio there are like 34862362462 nations, in Deruck, there are only 137, much lower than Denvio, and this is because every nation in Deruck is indeed very large and powerful, this happened after a Third World War in 1983 - 1995, in which different nations fought eachother and took over smaller nations for their own strength, which resulted in a significant decline in nations.

Major countries in the universe include:


Rojunland (562,961,554)
Duzekia (452,154,819)
South Feratia (424,671,800)
Britannia (424,500,000)
North Feratia (410,700,200)
