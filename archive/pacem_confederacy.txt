A Federation of peace-loving states founded in 2012 by President Hannah of the Federal Republic of Alexandrina. The Pacem Confederacy is a region proud of its cat-loving heritage, and its history of liking history.
The Confederacy is also known for the close, almost familial relations between its 3 leaders, with private dinners and &amp;#39;official&amp;#39; drinking competitions not unheard of.
The Pacem Confederacy is celebrated as the home of popular culture, with all of its 3 leaders being able to boast a considerable appreciation (if not quoting ability) of such comedic gems as Black Books, Peep Show, The IT Crowd, Seinfeld, etc.
