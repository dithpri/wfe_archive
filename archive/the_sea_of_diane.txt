Founded in the image of our Lord, Diane. 

Located in an undisclosed location in Canada, our members are refugees fleeing the horrors of high school.

We were founded to offer safety for our members from the scary world of politics and adulthood. Come here and be part of who we are. We make the decisions so you don&#39;t have to.

If your nation is new to the Sea of Diane, please send a telegram to [nation=short]Praedyth[/nation] and he will add you. Offices and descriptions of powers can be located under the Administration tab when you hover over our region&#39;s name in the left side bar. Include your name so we can add you to our &quot;Member States&quot; factbook and maintain order.

War is Peace
Freedom is Slavery
Ignorance is Strength

May Diane guide your every journey.
