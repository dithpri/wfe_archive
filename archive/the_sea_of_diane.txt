Founded in the image of our Lord, Diane. 

Located in an undisclosed location in Canada, our members are refugees fleeing the horrors of high school.

We were founded to offer safety for our members from the scary world of politics and adulthood. Come here and be part of who we are. We make the decisions so you don&#39;t have to.

War is Peace
Freedom is Slavery
Ignorance is Strength

May Diane guide your every journey.
