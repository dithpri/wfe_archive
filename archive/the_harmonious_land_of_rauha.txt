Hello And Welcome To The Harmonious Land Of Rauha, Where we are a not-so-sought after region as of the founding of this peaceful palace, I must Get into the story of our founding.

A rich man from Finland sets sail in 1839 to discover a new land to the northern tip of the globe and finds a land. He decides to adopt it as well as a new flag that was officially named lent&auml;v&auml; t&auml;hti, which is Finnish for flying star. Today you can find an area or maybe an island and settle into a democratic, peaceful region.

Sincerely, The King Of Rauha, Twain Pierson
