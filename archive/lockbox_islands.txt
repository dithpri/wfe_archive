[i]&amp;quot;Um, hello people of the Earth! My name is La-Lachlan Robinson, High Lord of the Theocracy of D-Daostimor. I would like to for-formally welcome you to the Lockbox Islands, our gracious homeland. We are highly supportive of nations with sim-similar legislations, religious beliefs and governing systems, but any nation found to be communist, liberal, atheist or not pro business w-will be oppressed. Heretical nations will be destroyed, as our L-Lord commands. We-welcome, and-and enjoy!&amp;quot;[/i]

[b]The Lockbox Islands[/b] are a large group of temperate islands, renowned as a dictatorship haven. Far-right nations, especially highly religious nations, are free to come here.
