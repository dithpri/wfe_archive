Equestria is a fictional kingdom inhabited by talking ponies and serves as the primary setting for the My Little Pony franchise. It&#39;s populated by three types of ponies: earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi. The country was once co-ruled by Princess Celestia and Princess Luna from their palace in Canterlot, but they eventually retired and were succeeded by Twilight Sparkle. The name &quot;Equestria&quot; is derived from the word &quot;equestrian&quot;, which relates to horseback riding.
