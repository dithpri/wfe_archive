Equestria is a fictional kingdom inhabited by talking ponies and serves as the primary setting for the My Little Pony franchise. It&#39;s populated by three types of ponies: earth ponies, unicorns, and pegasi.    The name &quot;Equestria&quot; is derived from the word &quot;equestrian&quot;, which relates to horseback riding.
