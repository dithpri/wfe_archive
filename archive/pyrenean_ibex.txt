Welcome to the former jump point of [region]The Snakes[/region]! We have done over 20 successful detags already!

*Bleats like an extinct wild goat*

This jump point was replaced by [region]Artificial Solar System[/region] on the 8th of January 2021, due to the poor quality of this jump point. However, it still stands as a memorial to the extremely poor-quality, but original jump point of the Snakes [region]Pyrenian Ibex[/region]. Due to the RMB, it is currently being used to report all missions.
