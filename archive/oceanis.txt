      Welcome to the beautiful island region of Oceanis. Centered in the Pacific Ocean, this region is comprised of many large and small nations. There is one thing these nations share in common, however: they are bonded together, and no matter their differences, they will always work together. Any nation is welcome to join, however, please be aware that any nations who come to cause havoc will be expelled.
