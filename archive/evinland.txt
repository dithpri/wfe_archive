[font=courier][b]Hey everyone! I&#39;m going to explain how this works the best that I can. Please bear with me, as this is a completely new kind of roleplay that I am trying. The roleplay will take place in a region called Evinland, and basically, the goal is to elect people into office, pass legislation, hold office at some point, and to overall have fun in this government roleplay. You can send a puppet there, and the puppet is the name of your person (for example, Kevin Landers). You may only have one person in the region. There can only be two political parties: Liberal and Conservative, due to us not having enough to make several different parties.[/font][/b]
