The Crimson Coalition is the southern most region of the world, but also simultaneously close to Southeastern Asia. Our collective main export is pizza delivery guys, as well as a small accompanying export of pizza. We believe in a &quot;diversity&quot; of political ideologies, such as regulated socialism and free-market economy.
