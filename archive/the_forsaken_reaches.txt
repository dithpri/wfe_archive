We&#39;re building something new and would love to have others join in on the fun!
This is a heavy RP region for people wanting to play as monsterous and &#39;evil&#39; races, if you&#39;ve ever wanted to play something traditionally evil without being the designated antagonist or villain in someone else&#39;s story, you&#39;ve found your home!

Each nation governs mostly independently however answer to the main democratically elected council, made up of a mutual collection of each of the races.

We want writers who commit to posts, who play politics well, and who find a functional coalition of misunderstood monsters more interesting than mindless chaos.

Outsiders call the Forsaken Reaches evil.
We consider that a failure of imagination.
