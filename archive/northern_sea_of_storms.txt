A remote, cold, region of the world lying around 65&deg;N latitude, the Northern Sea of Storms is an inhospitable place containing the Kingdom of Bautizar. Far to the east lie the remnants of the once-mighty Kingdom of Erindor, now largely sunk beneath the waves following an unexplained cataclysm almost 350 years ago. The citizens of this region value their privacy and solace away from the world, and guard its borders with the iron walls and mighty guns of His Majesty&amp;#39;s Navy.
