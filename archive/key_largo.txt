[color=003366][i]You&#146;ll enjoy your stay in the island paradise of Key Largo, the first of the fabulous Florida Keys and the self-proclaimed Dive Capital of the World. Key Largo is home to the world&amp;#39;s largest artificial reef, the 510-foot USS Spiegel Grove, the John Pennekamp Coral Reef Underwater State Park and the African Queen. Everglades National Park is just a short trip away. Diving, snorkeling and glass-bottom boating in the clear waters of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are fantastic experiences. Watersport activities are plentiful, including fishing, kayaking and swimming with the dolphins. Or, just relax with a tropical beverage and watch the beautiful sunsets.[/color][/i]
