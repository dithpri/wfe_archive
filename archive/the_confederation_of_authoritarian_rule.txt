As you might have guessed this is for dictatorships, tyrannical governments, and other oppressive people&#39;s. We find that far too often people choose freedom and oppress anything else, this is an organization for the freedom of oppression.

You do not necessarily have to &quot;oppress&quot; your people to join, but you must be a dictator in some way, shape, or form. 

Also, as for raiding: so long as it ain&#39;t us, have at it!
