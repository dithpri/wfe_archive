The Nordic Union was founded in response to the rising power of the Russians. While Luthorn was quite sure in her ability to defend herself, many smaller colonies and neighbors which were influenced by the Kingdom were sure to be quashed. King Gustav Vasa decided to offer protectorate status to any of these if they joined the newly established Nordic Union. Russian military forces tested the mettle of the Luths at the battle of Narke and quickly discovered that the Nordic Union was indeed a powerhouse as they lost 13,000 men and had to retreat back to Ingria. The Nordic Union is now focusing on supporting its people and defending against the ever-present Russian threat.
