Black Riders DENIED. The streets of The Batcave now flow with Heisenberg&amp;#39;s blue meth. Nothing, not even the Black Riders, can defeat Heisenberg&amp;#39;s blue meth!

I hereby declare that the nations that are within this region are the property of Heisenberg. Any other empires that set foot in this region will be destroyed in an epic turf war. You may have an army, but we have Mike Ehrmantraut. And Walter White.
