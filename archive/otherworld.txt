From the chaos of the Industrial Revolution, a new world order arises. Mighty empires have fallen and now new nationstates scramble to stake their claims on the world. The specter of Communism stalks the land: the old Savoien empire now flies the red flag, while the twisted dictatorship ruling what was once Rusanyia remains dark, shunning outside contact while it labors to build perfect socialism at home. The democracies are few, huddling together for protection against the cold wind of totalitarianism that has claimed Alstein, while ancient dynasties totter on their last legs in Weiland and Voroniya.
