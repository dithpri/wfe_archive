The Romanian River society was created on the 18th of December, 2023. We have developed from the Tyranny of Tiranie(I will also create an Anarchy, but I don&#146;t like either form of government in real life), and soon the Anarchy of Anarhie. We are hoping to stay fully outside of the World Assembly, instead focusing on our issues(if we have any at the time) and looking at other regions, as well as other countries. Everyone is always free to join, at anytime, and anywhere. Thank you for reading this, and I wish you all a merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
