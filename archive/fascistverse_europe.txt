Greetings, space travellers. You have entered the Fascistverse, an alternate history universe where the Second World War was won by the Axis powers. Right over there is the Sol planetary system, and the planet Terra. Looks familiar, doesn&#39;t it? But be warned, things are not as they seem. Land at your own risk!
