[B]YOU&amp;#39;VE BEEN TAKEN RIIIIGHT IN TO THE [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E]DANGER ZONE[/url]![/B]

You&amp;#39;ve entered Dangerzone Airspace. Feel free to land, we&amp;#39;ll provide you with burgers, french fries, and carrots.
You can reach me ([nation=short]Aurum Rider[/nation]) through telegram to get my skype. I&amp;#39;ve really ceased to care about alignment, so if you ask for an Endorsement, I&amp;#39;ll probably give one to you.

By the way. If you want to join the DZ Unit of &amp;#39;We don&amp;#39;t really care, we&amp;#39;ll raid anyway&amp;#39; message me about that too, and I&amp;#39;ll probably tell you to go join [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region] or wherever my good buddy [nation=short]Benevolent Thomas[/nation] is or something.

[nation=short]Benevolent Thomas[/nation] is great. So is [nation=short]Ambroscus Koth[/nation]
