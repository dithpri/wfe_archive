[b]Ambitions and hopes. That was what gave the skies the right to be. For long days and nights have the skies wish for prosperity and unity on this world that He created. However, unlike the skies, it was not meant to be. Now we are left to wait and hope for the skies to restore the prosperity that it so desired. One day, we shall all walk arm in arm as brothers in arms. But for now, the path is taken alone.[/b]

[i]&quot;So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.&quot;
