[i]
...Can&#39;t wait to meet you
So join the animatronic family
We open real soon
Try your best to hold on to sanity
Come get to know me
And you won&#39;t want to leave after tonight
Down here
We&#39;re lonely
And we would love ya to join us for a bite
Join us for a bite
Join us for a bite...[/i]
