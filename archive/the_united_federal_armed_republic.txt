The United Federal Armed Republic (UFAR) is a dominant, heavily militarized superpower born from the collapse of democratic institutions in South and Central America following global economic and energy crises. Originally formed as an economic alliance, the Federation rapidly transformed into a unifying military force that absorbed its member states into a centralized autocratic regime. The regime invests heavily in military-industrial development, propaganda, and advanced aerospace capabilities such as the ODIN and LOKI orbital weapons systems (before and after seizing them).
