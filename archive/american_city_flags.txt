Officially the American Box of City Designs, Emblems, and Flags (ABCDEF) but the region title was too long for NationStates.

[color=red]American city flags infamously feature some of the worst flags to be flown worldwide. However, not all of our city flag designs suck![/color]
[color=blue]In this region, we&#39;ll showcase some of the better city flags of the U.S. No seal-on-a-bedsheet copycats or weird MS Paint abominations are allowed.[/color]

[b]Technical stuff! Or informational stuff. Whatever you want to call it:[/b]
This region was made because 1. [nation]Osheiga[/nation] wanted to get a gold International Artwork badge and learned about &quot;card farming&quot;, and 
2. I like good flags and wanted to show some lesser known good ones through my alt accounts!

Most embassies will be accepted (at my discretion)!
