Officially the American Box of City Designs, Emblems, and Flags (ABCDEF) but the region title was too long for NationStates.

[color=red]American city flags infamously feature some of the worst flags to be flown worldwide. However, not all of our city flag designs suck![/color]
[color=blue]In this region, I&#39;ll showcase some of the better city flags of the U.S. No seal-on-a-bedsheet copycats or weird MS Paint abominations are allowed.[/color][hr][b]informational stuff:[/b]
This is a card farming region for [nation]Osheiga[/nation]! Most cards in this region I&#39;m willing to sell, so if you want to discuss buying anything you should telegram [nation]Osheiga[/nation] since I check that nation much more often than any of the nations here. Also, if you want to request embassies I&#39;ll most likely accept them.
