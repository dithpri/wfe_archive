The volcanic nature of the region leaves the land rocky and mountainous; and as such the many rivers, springs, and lakes cause in-numerous waterfalls to cover the land. Seeming to appear from the depths of the jungles, the waterfalls cause permanent rainbows at all times of the year, lending credence to the region&#39;s title of &#39;Paradise on Earth&#39;. The far edges of the forests open onto the great Central Plains that border and separate many of the central and southern countries from each other.
