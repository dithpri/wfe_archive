The Caribbean is a growing economic region especially since the departure of the American presence on Puerto Rico. The formation of the Federal Republic of the Greater Antilles has bolstered foreign investment and has catapulted CARICOM further into the international stage. This region has two dominant currencies, the West Indian Dollar and the Peseta Caribe&ntilde;a and both are recognized by CARICOM and have exact exchange rates.
