[color=666666][b]Northern Catalonia[/b] is a term that is sometimes used, particularly in Catalan writings, to refer to the territory ceded to France by Spain through the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. The area corresponds approximately to the modern French d&eacute;partement of the Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es-Orientales.

Northern Catalonia forms a triangle between the Pyrenees to the south, the Corbi&egrave;res to the north-west and the Mediterranean Sea to the east. 

The climate is of the Mediterranean type, with hot, dry summers and winters which are relatively mild, at least on the Roussillon plain where snow is rare.[/color][hr]
