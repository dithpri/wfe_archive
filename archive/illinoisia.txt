Welcome to Illinoisia!

Illinoisia is a vast inland realm founded after the unification of prairie clans, river merchants, and industrial city-states under a single banner. Known historically as the &#147;Crossroads of the Continent,&#148; it became a major cultural and trade hub due to its central position between northern forests, southern wetlands and western plains. Legends say the land&#146;s capital rose where ancient ley lines intersect, giving it both strategic and mystical importance.
