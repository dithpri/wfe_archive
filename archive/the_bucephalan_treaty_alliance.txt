The Bucephalan Treaty Alliance is one of mutual defense and economic trade agreements, under the leadership of the Bucephalan Empire (The Empire of Bucephala-Cael).
All are welcome, with the understanding that we will not be participating in the World Assembly, nor will we have any hierarchy in regards to leadership positions within the region. Each member is a sovereign and independent nation in their own right. The Bucephalan Treaty Alliance will not dictate resolutions, nor laws to member nations, however that does not mean other nations within the region cannot issue trade embargos and halt diplomatic relations with fellow members of the region, should their sitting government make it their policy.
