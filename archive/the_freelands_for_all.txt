[B][u]What Do We Do?[/u][/B]

[color=red][B]Well of course we promote freedom! But we also have other things that we do as well![/B][/color]
[color=blue][B]Raiding is something that we do! Raiding is where our army invades other regions. Then we gain Border Control and ban most if not all of the people there. Telegram [nation]Sky Pirates Ship[/nation] if you would like to be in the army![/B][/color]
[color=red][B]Another great thing that we do is have elections! At the last Friday of every month we will hold elections that everyone can take part in![/B][/color]
