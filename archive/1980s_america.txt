[i][u]&quot;Where there is no such thing as Snapchat.&quot;[/u][/i]

A region I founded for fun. It&#39;s the United States but during the 1980s. Set mainly in 1988.

National anthems because nostalgia:

This is not a rickroll.

This region is strongly libertarian, but anyone is welcome to join!

DEFCON: 5.
