&#39;Murica *Bald eagle screeches in the background to &#39;The Star Spangled Banner&#39; while watching the Dukes of Hazard, firing a 12-gauge down range, eating donuts, and doing wheelies in a jacked up pickup truck all the while watching football waving an American flag hi-fiving George Washington*

Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn&#39;s early light,
What so proudly we hail&#39;d at the twilight&#39;s last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro&#39; the perilous fight,
O&#39;er the ramparts we watch&#39;d, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets&#39; red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro&#39; the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
