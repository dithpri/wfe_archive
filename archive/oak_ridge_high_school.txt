Welcome to Oak Ridge High School! Made exclusively for students attending ORHS, this is a place to create and form your nation among friends. I&amp;#39;m just gonna drop these rules here...
1) Please do not spam! I [i]hate[/i] it when somebody posts something over and over, especially when they&amp;#39;ve been asked to stop.
2) Be nice and respectful (yes, even to the freshmen).
3) All new nations must send a telegram to [nation]Acornia[/nation] confirming their name and grade.
4) Only one nation per person.

Our Current WA Delegate is [nation]Mernation[/nation].

If there are any objections to map placement, just let me know.
