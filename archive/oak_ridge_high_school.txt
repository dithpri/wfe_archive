Welcome to Oak Ridge High School! Made exclusively for students attending ORHS, this is a place to create and form your nation among friends. I&amp;#39;m just gonna drop these rules here...
1) Please do not spam! I [i]hate[/i] it when somebody posts something over and over, especially when they&amp;#39;ve been asked to stop.
2) Be nice and respectful (yes, even to the freshmen).
3) If you can think of any other useful rules, send me a telegram. (This is my first time running a region)
Lastly, we need a WA delegate. Send your endorsements to who you want representing us!
If there are any objections to map placement, just let me know.
