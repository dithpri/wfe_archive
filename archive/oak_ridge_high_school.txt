Welcome to Oak Ridge High School! Made exclusively for students attending ORHS, this is a place to create and form your nation among friends. I&amp;#39;m just gonna drop these rules here...
1) Please do not spam! I [i]hate[/i] it when somebody posts something over and over, especially when they&amp;#39;ve been asked to stop.
2) All new nations must send a telegram to [nation]Acornia[/nation] confirming their name and grade.
3) This region was made ONLY for students of ORHS. Please don&amp;#39;t stick around after graduation.
4) Only one nation per person.
5) All nations, upon entry, have 48 hours to sign the following constitution.
