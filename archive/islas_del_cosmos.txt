The Islas del Cosmos are a beautiful tropical series of islands. The central and largest Isla is the seat of power for the region, Palenque. Verdant, lush jungles of tall trees, exotic plants and strange creatures call the island paradise home.
The city is built into the island, with the people of Palenque and the Islas preferring to coexist with nature rather than destroying the wonders surrounding them. 
To the northernmost area are the only mountains on the Islas, though there is little snow found even at the highest of elevations.
The islands which surround Palenque are smaller, but full of life with each island containing a population of half a billion. A few have deserts but most are moderate tropics with low humidity.
