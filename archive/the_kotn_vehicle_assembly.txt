Hey, [region]Kerbals of the North[/region]! It&#39;s your legislative branch! We&#39;re currently a WIP, but feel free to talk here and mess around until we&#39;re set up. You can also move your puppets here (especially officers, because then they&#39;ll be given a free office in this region) to mess around a little. Thanks!
