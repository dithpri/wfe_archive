The Imperial Confederacies is a region that only allows empires (and holy empires) and confederacies.
It is your choice! You can either be a WA Member or not, we recommend not.
nationstates.net/nation=theixa is a confederacy itself.
We allow ANY classifications, I recommend Corrupt Dictatorship, it&#39;s cool.
We allow anyone to recruit nations.
Sounds like a freedom region.
