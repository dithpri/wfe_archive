Welcome to Pro-Choice. The nations in this region staunchly support a woman&amp;#39;s right to choose, regardless of the circumstances. We oppose any attempt by governments, religious organizations, and misogynists to take that right away. We may come from different backgrounds and have different belief systems, but we all support a woman&amp;#39;s right to control her body.

We tend to be more liberal and libertarian minded on other social issues, but all viewpoints are welcome. Healthy and civilized debates are encouraged. Trolling, spamming, and griefing are not.

We are a neutral region and have no interest in raiding or defending. Please keep your squabbles elsewhere.

We hope you enjoy your stay here at Pro-Choice.
