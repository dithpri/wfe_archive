[quote=Laforeia;55840533]Message: Also, if you want to stay in the region after being eliminated, let me know

You&#39;ll still be eliminated, but without the ban-jection part so you can still chat on the RMB if you would like

I should have proposed this sooner but I think it&#39;s something we can propose for next competition as I mainly follow through list made in a  dispatch rather than the list of people by the region (especially since it includes nations like me or Liz who aren&#39;t participating)[/quote]
