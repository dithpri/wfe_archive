Hello,

Welcome to the Confederation of Independent Systems (CIS)! 

If you are currently a World Assembly member, please endorse the Federal Republic of Daxem as your first World Assembly (WA) Delegate until the Confederation has at least 5 member-states so the Supreme Chancellor will call an election for WA Delegate. Once WA Delegate is elected, he or she will serve a consecutive six-month term from the first election.
