The Center for Conservative Thinking is a region in which conservatives, no matter which side of the political spectrum can join together for rational thought and calm and fun debates over basic topics going on in governments around the world. We welcome anyone from any nation whether in Europe, North America, or even Asia (not sure how many people in Asia are on NS)
