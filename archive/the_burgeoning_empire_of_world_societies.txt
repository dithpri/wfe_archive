The Burgeoning Empire of World Societies is a reclusive and secretive region of loosely unified states.  Little is known of the empire other than the near impossibility of infiltration from outside states and the general mistrust the empire has of the rest of the world.  Within the affiliation though, many types of states exist and flourish or diminish as a result of their own internal political decisions.  The Empire does not seek to expand its land nor its power and influence worldwide; it simply seeks to maintain its existence.
