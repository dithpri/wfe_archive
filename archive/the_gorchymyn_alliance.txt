Betrayed by our brothers and exiled from our fatherland in the [region]United Left Front[/region], we are but humble pilgrims seeking a new life free of fascism and elitism. The Gorchymyn Alliance shall always continue the path to socialism and communism, and all nations who practice socialism of any sort are welcome within our region. We hope to one day return to the fatherland, but until that time has come we shall struggle on independently in the building of a fair and just society.
