[u]What is the Gorchymyn Alliance?[/u]

The Gorchymyn Alliance is a total political and economic emancipation front and a national and regional liberation movement by socialists who are willing to shed their blood in defence of their sovereignty at all times. It is a liberation movement which thrives on and cherishes regional unity which has created the sound conditions of peace and security which the [region]United Left Front[/region] has enjoyed and is a rare gift that many regions dream of, and the Gorchymyn Alliance is driven by its democratic and socialist values where the leadership is accountable to the membership which elected it.[/list]
