The TCHSS or The Collation of the Holy Soviet States is considered a fragile alliance due to the Soviet States of Krayev being Marxist in origin. But the two founders of The Collation, The Holy Empire of The Holy Hobosians and The Soviet States of Krayev get along very well. Both leaders agree on almost every topic despite being so different, In order to join the Collation you must eithier tolerate Communism or be Communist yourself.
