[b]Hello[/b]

We are [region]United Earth Nations[/region]

[region]United Earth Nations[/region] is a friendly and active region. Our goal is to spread our influence everywhere. With our influence, the very core values of a functioning government are spread with it. Those are, [b] Democracy [/b], [b] Freedom [/b] and also important, a [b] functioning economy [/b]

We hope you will join [region]United Earth Nations[/region]. Together we will make this world a better place, and strife for a better future. Why war among ourselves when we can set our eyes on something far greater? There&#39;s a whole galaxy out there for us, to expand, conduct research, better ourselves. Ignorant states are only blocking space to [b] develop [/b].
