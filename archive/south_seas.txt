[b]These are the South Seas, where [color=#FFFF00]Silence is Golden[/color][/b]

Nations in this region are expected to one simple rule. [b]Keep to your own.[/b] This region was founded to be a quiet place wherein on can rest or perhaps have a pleasant base camp to interact with the other Nations outside. Therefore, it stands to reason that Nations here shouldn&amp;#39;t pester those who don&amp;#39;t want to be pestered. You way converse if you wish, but there will be no racket here.
