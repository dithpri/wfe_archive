[b]Welcome to the ILF![/b] A multinational, multi-planetary, and interdimensional union (region) founded by the Bonnermannian DF to unite all peoples across the multiverse, and to especially, uphold the rights of the oppressed and to win the hearts of people and sentient creatures alike! With a [i]slightly leftist[/i] stance on politics, we dare to remain committed to our oath to protect the oppressed of this community of ours.

[color=red][b][i]&quot;United hand in hand, we fight! Divided and apathetic, we fall.[/b][/i][/color]

(this region is currently a work in progress, so I&#39;ll be temporarily not allowing new nations to join. see ya!)
