Glory to Difemanim!

Also:
[quote=unojoish_null;47392203]To all who didn&#146;t receive the telegram:
We thank you for visiting our [b]GLORIOUS[/b] puppet region! We really appreciate it! Although, we are a puppet region, so we are prone to raids. Thus, Order 826.1 is now in affect.
All Non-Puppet states will be kicked, a password has been installed, and after this all, I must clarify,
Our embassies will still be open for region to send a request. None of this is personal, just safety procautions.
GLORY TO UNOJO, and have a wonderful day! :)[/quote]
