Synth is a strange alien place where magic and monsters roam. The interesting thing about Synth is that all of its history happened all at once. Though nations reside within the same region, they may be thousands of years apart. Nations outside of each other&#39;s timelines are not aware of each other and their decisions do not affect the others.
