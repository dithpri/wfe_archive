We have more than one goal as an union....as a family, that is to not only to promote others to understand and enjoy anime but also to guide and help those who are new or experienced to success with their nation

We shalln&#39;t judge one upon the form of government they take on nor the ones they treasure and cherish, but rather judge them based they help others grow and discuss with others their state of mind regarding various subjects

We respect those with different opinions even though they may clash with our own, we are a family, everyone is different remember not two people are the same

Endorse whom you wish, but choose carefully because your decision will impact all the region

Invite your friends,weebs or not.(no dub watchers though jk:p)
