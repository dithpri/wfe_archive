This region is an experiment to see how many of my readers also play this game.

This region is for fans of the Geoverse, the name given (by me) to a collection of stories I wrote which chronicle my adventures in Equestria (because &amp;#39;Geo&amp;#39; is quite clearly short for &amp;#39;GeodesicDragon&amp;#39;). At this moment in time, there are 14 stories which make up the Geoverse &#151; eight normal stories (two of which were written by Crimson Star), three one-shots and three... more mature stories.
