This region is for fans of the [url=http://www.fimfiction.net/group/2004/the-geoverse]Geoverse[/url], the name given (by me) to a collection of stories I wrote which chronicle my adventures in Equestria (because &amp;#39;Geo&amp;#39; is quite clearly short for &amp;#39;GeodesicDragon&amp;#39;). At this moment in time, there are 25 stories which make up the Geoverse, all of which have received mostly positive feedback.
