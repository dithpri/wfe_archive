THE QORLD is a full universe, independently isolated from everything else ever. This universe is an infinitely large flat ocean, extending forever. Under the ocean is an underground that goes infinitely down. The 5th Agers&#39;s Listerine Realm, Purgatory, and the Qunitus zone are located underground. The ocean is dotted with huge supercontinents, two of which are important Under-the-Dome and Zombingerend.

It was isolated during the &quot;Meme Singularity&quot;, though it existed for some time before, and the mattress realm is the roof. Karda Nui is part of this roof.
