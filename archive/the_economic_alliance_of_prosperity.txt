The E.A.P. is a region dedicated to free trade and open diplomacy between its members. Founded by the People&#39;s Republic of Prosperon to gain allies in its liberation attempt in 1985, the EAP is a new region and one that is open to shaping and contribution from its member states. One of the tenets of Prosperan culture is that all ideas should be considered equal, and the E.A.P. will follow that philosophy as well. The constitution has been written, but with so few members it would still be ready to enact amendments. Our Alliance will stand tall amongst a world of tyrants and isolationists and be a shining light in a sea of darkness.
