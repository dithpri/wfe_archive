Costarrican liberal and socialist states begins with the alliance of two countries: the strong leftist Empire of Costadia and the anarchic Free People of Scientia et pacem. The motivation was the strong union between both states, which shared one common origin, Costa Rica. Their ideals of true social justice, equality, a society with freedom of thought and a cientific-based education unite them. Therefore, they hope that more nations unite under these ideals that will bring peace, equality, happiness and prosperity to the world.
