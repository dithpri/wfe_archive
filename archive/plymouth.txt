Plymouth is a city on the south coast of Devon, England, about 37 miles  southwest of Exeter and 190 miles west-south-west of London, between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west where they join Plymouth Sound to form the boundary with Cornwall. It has the largest operational naval base in Western Europe&#151;HMNB Devonport.

Built in 1815, Union Street was at the heart of Plymouth&#39;s historical culture. It became known as the servicemen&#39;s playground, as it was where sailors from the Royal Navy would seek entertainment of all kinds. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
