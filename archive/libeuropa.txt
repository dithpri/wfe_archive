The most varied region on planet earth. Containing everything from fjords to deserts. of the many countries in Libeuropa, some certainly stand out. The least developed country is Das dritte Nordreich, a horrible country with a retarded dictator who loves all minorities. 
The Republic of Zatania is infamous for its girl dictator who loves christian rock. The national anthem of this country &amp;quot;I hate satan&amp;quot; is written by the christian rock Nickelback impostors known as Nickelblack. The last country that stands out from the rest is Patswana, which is certainly is the most developed, and by far the best country to live in.
