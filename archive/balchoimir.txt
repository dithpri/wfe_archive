After the violent collapse of the Sovskoyska Union of Federal Republics on the 10th of May 2014, the region of Balchoimir has been in constant turmoil. For the time being the region is home to over 120 independent cities, communes, and nations. 

The Balchoimir Region Comittee was set up to counter instability and bring prosperity. It didn&#39;t work.

the notorious instability of the region has lead to many languages adopting the word &quot;Balchoimirist&quot; to symbolize extreme social and political discord.

Balchoimir is open to all, as long as you understand what we&#39;re about.
