[b][color=darkgreen]Southern Rhodesia[/color][/b]

[color=gray]Welcome to Southern Rhodesia, where the grass is green, and the food is plentiful. It was a much peaceful time back then, before the rise of Mugabe, the country that calls itself Zimbabwe today was considered the breadbasket of Africa.[/color]

[b][i][color=darkgreen]This is truly God&#39;s country,
With a beauty all it&#39;s own,
And from a core of courage,
A nation strong has grown.

That which we cherish most here,
Is a firm and friendly hand,
Because we are deeply proud of
Our rich productive land.

We raise our voice in thanks,God,
To your wondrous work of art,
That we have called Rhodesia,
From which we shall not part.
