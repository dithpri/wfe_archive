Welcome to Southern Rhodesia, where the grass is green, and the food is plentiful. It was a much peaceful time back then, before the rise of Mugabe, the country that calls itself Zimbabwe today was considered the breadbasket of Africa.

[b][i][color=dodgerblue]I was born in a land where the skies are so blue,
African sunsets, flamed bright golden hue,
Communities were strong, we cared, we shared;
Problems rallied us, loads together we bared.[/color][/i][/b]
