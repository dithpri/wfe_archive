[color=Red][b]Welcome To Southern Rhodesia/Welkom by Suid-Rhodesi&euml;[/b][/color]

[color=Grey]Rhodes and his empire were on the mind of early pioneers who headed off in search of adventure and a better life. But though the imperial highway may well have been intended to run from Cape Town to Cairo, for most of us it only went as far as just north of the Zambezi - for there was the Promised Land[/color]

[color=blue][b]&quot;I was born in a land where the skies are so blue,African sunsets, flamed bright golden hue,Communities were strong, we cared, we shared;Problems rallied us, loads together we bared.&quot;[/b][/color]
