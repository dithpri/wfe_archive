[b][color=skyblue]Southern Rhodesia[/color][/b]

[color=darkgreen]Welcome to Southern Rhodesia, wind to flow through the Red flame lilies, the Bateleur&#39;s call echoing through the canyons and rivers, the roar of Victoria falls as it flows eternally, in spite of all hardships. To walk along the Limpopo and feel its cool waters, the Inyanga forests and their mighty trees giving shade, the rolling plains and meadows of Kariba. Where white men and black men looked on each other as friends and countrymen.
