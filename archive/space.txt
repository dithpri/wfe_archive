[color=goldenrod]&amp;quot;It is known that there is an [i]infinite[/i] number of worlds, simply because there is an [i]infinite[/i] amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a [u]finite[/u] number of inhabited worlds. Any [u]finite[/u] number divided by [i]infinity [/i]is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be [B]zero[/B]. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also [B]zero[/B], and that [i]any people you meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination[/i].&amp;quot;[/color]
