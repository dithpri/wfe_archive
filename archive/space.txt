I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m paying CBS a monthly fee just to watch the new Star Trek series. I mean at least offer it as a season package that you can buy to own on Google Play and iTunes or something. Not that you really own media content that you buy to stream anyway. Do you realize your whole streaming media library is at the mercy of the company you bought it through? Even if it were to go on forever, what if future updates to to the app or the back end make it into something you no longer want to use? What happens when you die? Are our Google and iTunes accounts going to be inheritable assets now? Would you be able to break them up, or will your great-grandchildren be logging onto your account a hundred years from now to watch The Flash?
