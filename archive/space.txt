SPACE is a libertarian region open to nations of all types; the historic headquarters of the Pirate League and birthplace of the cosmo dragoon and death-dealing plasma death ray. Whether you&amp;#39;re looking for a place to call home or just passing through, enjoy your stay!

SPACE has a policy of neutrality, and cannot accept alliance requests. Embassies are accepted only from regions with which we share history. Raider and defender puppets are welcome to become natives, but these may not be WA members while here.
S
PACE is home to the Alliance of Taunt. Invaders will be taunted. Invaders who stay will be taunted a second time.

Regional motto: FREE SPACE!
