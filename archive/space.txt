[b]Welcome to SPACE![/b]

SPACE is a libertarian region open to nations of all types; historic headquarters of the Pirate League and birthplace of the [color=green]cosmo dragoon[/color] and [color=red]death-dealing plasma death ray[/color]. Whether you&amp;#39;re looking for a home or just passing through, enjoy your stay!

SPACE is a neutral region. Embassies are accepted from regions with which we share history; such as raiders, defenders, and those with roots here. Raider and defender puppets are welcome to become natives, but these may not be WA members while here.

SPACE is home to the Alliance of Taunt. Invaders will be taunted. Invaders who stay will be taunted a second time.

[b]Regional motto:[/b] FREE SPACE!
