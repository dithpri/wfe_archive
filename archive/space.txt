[color=green][i]Space is the void that exists between celestial bodies, including the Earth. It is not completely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust and cosmic rays.

[color=blue]&quot;Space is big. Really big. You just won&#39;t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it&#39;s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that&#39;s just peanuts to space.&quot; -Douglas Adams, [i]The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy[/i][/color]
