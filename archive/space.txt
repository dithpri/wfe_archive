[b]SPACE is closed![/b]

We&amp;#39;ve temporarily shut our doors in an attempt to limit outside interference while we determine the future of the region. Hopefully we&amp;#39;ll be back in business soon, but in the meantime feel free to watch us flop about like fish trying to find their way back to water. That wasn&amp;#39;t a very good space-themed metaphor. Something... aliens.
