[color=blue][b]Welcome to SPACE!

SPACE is a libertarian haven for pirates, cutthroats and other unsavory types. We discuss philosophy, pillage, and build weapons like the cosmo dragoon and death dealing plasma death ray. The Pirate League is always willing to accept new people, or as its enemies say, &quot;BLOODY PROLIFIC PIRATES!&quot;

SPACE is home to the Alliance of Taunt. Invaders will be taunted. Invaders who stay will be taunted a second time. 

Regional motto: Arrrrr. 
War cry: FREE SPACE!&amp;#8207;[/b][/color]
