Hi! Welcome to Semper Invicta where we take care of any country with any political ideology. We prefer people who veer towards the right but we will accept a few Socialists and Anarchists. All is welcome to help support the state and if you&#39;re wondering, yes we love Fallout 4! Great name, great game! Our motto is &quot;always invincible&quot; and we love to prosper as a region. Help us grow and join today!
Also...
1) No profanity please
2) Respectfulness is appreciated. Rudeness is abhorred
3) Don&#39;t ask to be admin straight away when you come in, you will simply be ejected.
4) No spam telegrams. 
5) The final golden rule... Have fun :)
