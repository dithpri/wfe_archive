This region takes place slightly in the future, after a war that took place for multiple reasons. This region is created for Rping purposes mainly, and the main message board can be used to roleplay war, aliences, and trade. Keep in mind that this takes place 30-60 years in the future, but only present day technology exists for the most part. New technology was created during the war, but most of it was destroyed. Korachia has been able to get as far as mars in space, but that&#39;s all. New technology can be developed in roleplay, but it has to be realistic and you have to have a good idea of how it works. Also, all technology has to be approved before being used by others.
