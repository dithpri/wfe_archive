                                     Welcome to the AOI!
     The A.o.I is an agency to hopefully boost industry. We will work to funnel industrial help.
     Rules:
     [b]There are none. Just be industrial and leftist :))[/b]

     Flag information:
The Yellow canton has no real meaning.
The two stars are for 1, Industrial workers. 2, Agricultural workers.
The White stripe means unification, and the red means blood of the lost.

                          Politics
     The Ruling party APOC (Agency Party Of the Commune) will dense the oppression of the working class.
     Free the workers!
