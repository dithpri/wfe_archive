[b] Alternate Modern World Region[/b]

The Alternate modern world region is a relaxed,friendly region that is based on our world. It is recomended that a nation who wants to join be based upon a real life nation. such as a modern Kingdom of France, or a surviving Dynastic China, or even a confederate States of america! If you would like to join, Please send me [nation=Celtic Britannia] a telegram asking to join :)
 
Please claim a spot on the map that is relative to your nation. So no kingdom of spain based in Cambodia... 

I hope you enjoy your time in this region! :D
