[color=darkgreen][b][i][u]Welcome to The Safehaven[/b][/u][/i][/color]

[i][b][colour=rainbow]This is a region designed as a safehaven for the Telican Nations who will undoubtedly need to seek refuge here once [nation=short]Joolsland[/nation]&amp;#39;s plan has been successful and the stupid council chair ([nation=short]Frogtopia[/nation]) has been fooled into agreeing with it. Any other nation is free to join, just send the founder or WA delegate a telegram and you&amp;#39;ll be let in.[/b][/i][/colour]
