Welcome to [region]The Yeet Army[/region]. We are a small force of casual raiders in the making.
If you find this place interesting, move to one of the alliance members and make a second nation here. The WFE was too small to include all the regions we have alliances with, so we made a dispatch so you can view it. It&#146;s attached to the WFE and updated with every new member that joins.

We adhere to site rules, so feel free to consult them here:

Officer status and powers granted by merit, not request. Requests may be submitted but will ultimately be reviewed by the Founder for approval.
