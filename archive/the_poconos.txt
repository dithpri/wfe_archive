The Poconos are a beautiful region of Pennsylvania. To the south is the Appalachian Trail, which connects Maine to Georgia. We are known for our abundance of nature, waterfalls, resorts, water parks, and many more! Everyone is welcomed regardless of political stance. This is a region with no active RP or discord so if you just want to do issues, farm cards, etc. this is the place for you. But, you can still communicate with people. If you are a WA member, please endorse Pocono to prevent any invader from conquering our beloved region. Embassy requests are welcome.
