[b]Welcome to the Region! Here, the year is 2215. The Earth has been abandoned after a super bacterial organism called &amp;quot;The Blight&amp;quot; killed off most plant life on Earth. Following bacterial killers later claimed the lives of millions as super viruses began to kill off mass populations.
