[b]Welcome to the Region! Here, the year is 2150. The Earth has been abandoned after a super bacterial organism called &amp;quot;The Blight&amp;quot; killed off most plant life on Earth. Following bacterial killers later claimed the lives of millions as super viruses began to kill off mass populations. In 2055, the Earth Government intitated the Operation: Universal Alpha, and began the colonization of space.[/b]
