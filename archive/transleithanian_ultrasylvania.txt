Beyond the River Leitha is the Last Wood, or so it seemed to the ancients who had trouble telling North apart from East. A region far removed from commerce, culture, and the pickled pigs feet trade, Transleithanian Ultrasylvania (the TLUS) is a stable region immune to frivolous things.

Flash meddling ideologies are NOT welcome. This includes any international movement (socialists, oecumenists, freemasons, &amp;c.) as well as more subtle attempts to &#39;modernise&#39; TLUS by empowering the blithering peasants, seedy clerks, and/or drunken aristocrats.

Historically diplomats have enjoyed no privileges in TLUS and therefore embassies do not exist.
