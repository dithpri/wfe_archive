Behind the river Leitha is a savage wilderness of trees, bandit camps, and second-hand clothing shops. Which specific evils lurk beneath the trees or above the clear-cut barren expanses?! Is there anything beyond the primeval forest that, even as you read, is being converted diligently into cheap charcoal?

Nobody really knows. Civilisation is not welcome in these parts (if by civilisation you mean banditry-by-the-ledger).
