We serve as the NationStates&#39; new liberation army.
We are the Malorussian Liberation Army.
We rebelled against the &quot;Kiev&quot; regime, which occupied our country
and killed our brothers and sisters.
We have left ZSU because we don&#146;t want to destroy our
people and dance to the tune of oligarchs and foreigners.
We believe that collaboration with the Russian army
will help us take our Malorossia back.
We no longer want to associate ourselves with the flag of a country that has brought us and our families so much pain and suffering.
We also hail from a region that is combating corruption, devoted to faith, and fight Russianphobia. This is not a hateful region. We merely want to reestablish Russian and Slavic pride.
Loyal to [region]Russian Armed Forces[/region]
