We&amp;#39;ve seen things you people wouldn&amp;#39;t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of The Black Riders. We watched mods&amp;#39; deletion beams glitter in the dark near Vaalbara. We saw empires rise and regions burn. All those moments will be lost in time...like tears in rain...

...but we aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere. We&amp;#39;ve been around the block more times than we can count and we&amp;#39;ve known each other for years. This is just another chapter in this big, crazy book called NS.
