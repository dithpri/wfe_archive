We&amp;#39;ve seen things you people wouldn&amp;#39;t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of The Black Riders. We watched mods&amp;#39; deletion beams glitter in the dark near Vaalbara. We saw empires rise and regions burn. All those moments will be lost in time...like tears in rain...but this is just another chapter in this big, crazy book called NS.

Musumi is basically a social club for a handful of friends to be snarky gits together while roleplaying in II and NS. You probably won&amp;#39;t be invited to join, get an embassy approved, or sneak into the chatroom unless we know and like you.
