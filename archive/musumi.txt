Musumi is basically a social club for a handful of friends to be snarky gits together while roleplaying in II and NS. You probably won&amp;#39;t be invited to join, get an embassy approved, or sneak into the chatroom unless we know and like you. Don&amp;#39;t badmouth Atl&eacute;tico, prepare your anus for techwank, mind the adorable anime girls that Nord keeps adopting, and enjoy the show.
