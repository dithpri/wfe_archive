Welcome to the [color=orange]Australian Outback[/color]! We are soooo remote we only have 4 nations! We are also home to the kangaroo, koala, and other unique species native to Australia. 

Australian Outback, so far, is just a region where people can chill in the heat and solitude of the Outback. I plan to one day, invite more nations and find a spot on the map.

Come relax where the ground is [color=red]red[/color] and the sky is [color=blue]blue[/color]!

(Telegram [nation]Kozy Koalas[/nation] if you want the nation password.)
