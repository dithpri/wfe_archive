The first planet from the star of Sulnara. Weyard is an artificial world inhabited by a species of people who are nearly genetically identical to humans, and are capable of using magic. They are known as the known as the &amp;quot;Jenei&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Adepts&amp;quot;.

Most of Weyard is a gaseous and heavy atmosphere, but there is a large floating landmass above it all, with very Earth-like conditions that are habitable for humans, and of course, the Jenei.

It is unknown who created the planet, but it is still obvious that it is not a natural installation by any means.
