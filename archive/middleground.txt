[i]Once, there was a man
He had been in regions before

One was open, free for all to use
But it didn&#39;t feel quite... home enough

Another was friendly, everyone was involved
However, they did not approve of &quot;unuseful&quot; messages

This man grew tired, aggravated, and lonely
He sought to bring an end to those un-including,
and an end to those hindering casual communication
