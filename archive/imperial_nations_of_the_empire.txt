I.N.O.T.E is a very safe region that is fair and does not have an overruling Leader. Nations in the region are allowed to govern their nation and do what they please without the federal goverment of I.N.O.T.E disturbing them. The goverment of I.N.O.T.E is broken down into 3 departments.
These are The Department of Security, Department of Logistics, and The Security Council.
