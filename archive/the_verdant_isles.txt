The [color=green][b]Verdant[/b][/color] [color=blue][b]Isles[/b][/color] is an [color=black][b]anarchist[/b][/color] region where everything is free and we all share in love in our beautiful archipelago :D

Looking for new members!

Please read the dispatch on the Verdant Isles International Union below this world factbook entry.

[i]Disclaimer from [nation]Kropotkinist Communes[/nation], Secretary of Defense and World Assembly Delegate: Fascists, monarchists, etc. will not be allowed here, as they are a major threat to our peaceful way of life. If you have concerns about the fact that a union member, [nation]The Free Graceless[/nation], has the &quot;Monarchy&quot; policy installed, please note that she and I know each other in real life and I can attest that that was a joke decision on her part. She&#39;s not actually a monarchist.[/i]
