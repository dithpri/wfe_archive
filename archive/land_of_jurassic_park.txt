This once prehistoric wilderness turned thriving region after discovery by Swiss geneticists, is open to all countries. Our primary industries are genetic engineering, other biotech, shipping, and meme manufacturing. We encourage scientific growth and research. All though we welcome all types of political ideologies (except nazism and anarchocapitilism) we encourage primarily leftism (particularly Trotskyist communism, utopian socialism, and market socialism), and it is only required that you are a democracy and not oppressive of your people. Also the protection of our prehistoric companions, dinosaurs, is necessary; since dinosaurs have become sentient members of our society in this region.
