The [url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International]Comintern[/url], was an organisation made by Lenin, from 1915 to 1943, and was disbanded by Stalin.[hr]
On June 1975, several attempts was made to rejoin the communist and socialist nations, with the signing of The Kommunistgorod Treaty, and paving way
for the [color=red]Communist Socialist International[/color](CSI).[hr]
In 1980, the CSI was established to  unite the communist and the socialist nation. The alliance now still stands, growing stronger and stronger each day. The alliance now looking for new nations to join. Could that be your nation?[hr]
