
Recently impeached and ejected Prime Minister Eric Chok of [nation]Roguiguez[/nation] has founded South Amerinc with the grace of Amerinc President Stewart. This separation was long awaited by the president himself who wanted this region. Unlike its neighbors to the north, South Amerinc is a free join region with elected officers rather than appointed officers. Everyone is welcome and recruitment telegrams are sent to recently ejected nations who were placed in [region]the Rejected Realms[/region].
