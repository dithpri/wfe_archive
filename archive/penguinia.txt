Penguinia is a region located near Antarctica, the ancestral home of our kind. Here, all Penguins are equal and we desire peace if possible. Our main enemy is the Puffins, who constantly tout their strength, but have done little to prove it. Despite this, there have been numerous wars with the puffins, which have resulted in Penguinia being their master.
