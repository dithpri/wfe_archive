The South African Republic (Dutch: Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, ZAR), often referred to as The Transvaal and sometimes as the Republic of Transvaal, was an independent and internationally recognised country in southern Africa from 1852 to 1902. The country defeated the British in what is often referred to as the First Boer War and remained independent until the end of the Second Boer War on 31 May 1902, when it was forced to surrender to the British. The territory of the ZAR became known after this war as the Transvaal Colony. After the outbreak of World War I a small number of Boers staged another rebellion and aligned themselves with the Central Powers in a failed gambit to regain independence.
