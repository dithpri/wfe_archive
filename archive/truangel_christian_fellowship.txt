Welcome to TCF! We are a small region comprised of friendly and creative nations, and we invite you to join our community. We&amp;#39;re primarily a region of Christian nations, though all are welcome.  Like most regions, we do have rules., but they are simple: No slurs against God or Christianity, no hate speech against any group of people and no obscene language or content in our forums or on our regional message board.

With that said, we hope you feel at home here and we invite you to let your creativity shine!
