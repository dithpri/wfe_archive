The Legend of Fornost is for all who seek glory, riches, and a place to call home! 
    Our region is broken into four major quadrants: The lawmakers, the enforcers, the workers, and the soldiers. Each quadrant has it&amp;#39;s own job to carry out. Check The Kingdom of XXDOOMXx&amp;#39;s fact book for a more in-depth rundown of the jobs and requirements for each quadrant. All new members are put into the worker quadrant but if you would like to apply for becoming part of a different quadrant then telegram XXDOOMXx. I hope your time in The Legend of Fornost is enjoyable!
