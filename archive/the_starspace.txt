A giant floating island with a shield dome over head. The island is circular with a 1,000,000,000,000,000 mile radius and a beautiful landscape. The star space is (or should I say will be) run by a council, consisting of the founder as the chairman, the WA deleget as vice chairmen, and all other officers as a council member. Also most officers will be chosen by poll. All Star space members will protect one other and be over all helpful. The Starspace will be run by 3 councils, the most powerfull council is the High Council. Then there is the War Council and Security Council. The Chairman of the War Council will also be on the High Council and the same goes for the Chairman of the Security Council.
