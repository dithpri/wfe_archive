A giant floating island with a shield dome over head. The island is circular with a 1,000,000,000,000,000 mile radius and a beautiful landscape. The star space is (or should I say will be) run by a council, consisting of the founder as the chairman, the WA deleget as vice chairmen, and all other officers as a council member. Also most officers will be chosen by poll. All Star space members will protect one other and be over all helpful.
