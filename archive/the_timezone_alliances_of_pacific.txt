&amp;quot;Power comes at the cost of Mercy&amp;quot; it is said. We are a new region, one power the delegate and perhaps a small activity profile, but a nation could want nothing more than security, freedom, and alliance though with less power of the founder. We promise you all of that.
No matter whatever your governance style or forum, love, live and laugh in this carefree region.
