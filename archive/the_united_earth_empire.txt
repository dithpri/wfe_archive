The United Earth Empire is a plan, a hope, a dream, not just a region. In the TUEE we strive for greatness, civil rights and equality but also expansion of our borders, blustering of our economies, something we all want right?
The plan is build a strong powerful region together one that with some effort can rival the north pacific and the World Assembly in every way. How will we do this it all depends on whether you choose to join this region or not but if you do join I promise we will all work together to not only be the strongest,biggest and the most famous region about but also to give you a chance at making history that will change the world, the chance to be part of a new region and a chance at absolute freedom!
