Welcome to [region]TR8R[/region], a gathering place for those who are loyal. Any traitors will be ejected.[hr][i]&quot;Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic lies to the galaxy while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance.&quot;[/i]
