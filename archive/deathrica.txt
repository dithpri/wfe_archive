The nations of Deathrica tenuously work for a single united purpose; to be the last persons standing. Through oppression, mass gambling, cancer, chaos, nuclear power and rampant warmongering, Deathrica seeks to become the only continent remaining. After the bones and ashes of all other lands fall into place, they shall form the arena that the nations of Deathrica will fight one another on. Only the worst will remain.
