[color=red]this region has been [/color] [color=blue] LIBERATED[/color] [color=red]by the Imperial Confederacy Defense Force, military of the [/color][region]Imperial Confederacy[/region]!

[color=green] as a new defender, we realize this is considered retagging. However, we could not find original regional WFE entries nor the original regional flags. We will gladly step down if someone more qualfied as a defender takes over. [/color]

This WFE is in the process of renovation. Please stand by.
