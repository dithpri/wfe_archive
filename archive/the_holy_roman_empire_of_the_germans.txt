This is a glorious day! For this region has been liberated from the evil of the black riders!

I have a message to the cowardice bullies that call themselves the black riders:
As long as you and your evil continue to bully small and weak regions, we will be there to liberate them. Where ever you move with the intent of doing wrong, we will be there.

To the natives of this region:
I happily give you all full control of your region. For this is your home, and you deserve to have it for your own.

One last statement to the black riders: if you don&amp;#39;t like what I have said here today, feel free to contact me via telegram at [nation]the hawk dominion[/nation].

MAY THE RESISTANCE LIVE ON!!!

This land has been liberated by [region]the Roma confederacy[/region].
