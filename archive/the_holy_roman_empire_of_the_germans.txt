The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation is a varying complex of lands that was established in 962 AD by Otto I, King of Germany, King of Italy, and Duke of Saxony.  But is considered to have existed since 800 AD when Charles the Great (Charlemagne) was crowned Emperor by the pope.  
  It&amp;#39;s also worth note that the title of Emperor must be achieved through election rather than through inheritance.  
((The Emperor will be the WA Delegate FYI))
