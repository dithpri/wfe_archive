The Imperial Socialist Union is a region dedicated to the abolishment of Democracy. For decades democracy has flooded our economic markets, but no more shall it be!! Our dedication to the cause has lead us to found the Imperial Socialist Republic. Our region is a sanctuary to those in refuge from the forces of democracy. Imperialist, Socialist, Communist are all welcome here in this world of political dominance.
