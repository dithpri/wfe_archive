The Farlands is a region dedicated to countries that would prefer to just have a place to live peacefully and without needing to worry about things like &quot;Regional Activities&quot; &quot;Roleplaying&quot; or &quot;Being Active&quot;. As such Farlands lacks basically anything other regions have, but doesn&#39;t have many rules to follow either, really just don&#39;t be a jerk is our only rule.

Join if you&#39;re into this sort of thing. If not, then don&#39;t. We are pretty easy-going here.
