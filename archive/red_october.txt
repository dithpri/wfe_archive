&quot;Comrades, this is your captain. It is an honor to speak to you today, and I am honored to be sailing with you on the maiden voyage of our motherland&#39;s most recent achievement. Once more, we play our dangerous game, a game of chess against our old adversary &#151; The American Navy. For forty years, your fathers before you and your older brothers played this game and played it well. But today the game is different. We have the advantage. It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets. Well, they will tremble again &#151; at the sound of our silence. The order is: engage the silent drive.&quot;
