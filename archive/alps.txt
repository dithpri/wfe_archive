[color=333333]The [b]Alps[/b] are one of the great mountain range systems of Europe stretching approximately 750 mi across eight Alpine countries from Austria and Slovenia in the east, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, and France to the west, and Italy and Monaco to the south.

The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe. Precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 11,155 ft, and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Paleolithic era.[/color] &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
