The Hadush Empire takes Dictatorship in its name. It is a (rp) violent region, which supports Dictatorship and anything related.

It does not follow Democracy, with an encouragement to Nudism, Conscription, et cetera.
The nation, Hadunatan encourages those who join, to follow the command and salute for the leader.
