Welcome all to the brand new [i]Supreme Thextonian Empire[/i]!

Consisting of only three close-knit nations, the empire controls a secluded cluster of islands, a map of which will be available for viewing soon. Empress Drew Thextone of the Empire of [nation]Thextonia[/nation], President Alex Liebermann of the Republic of [nation]Monsevoua[/nation], and Prince Dev Venkataraman of the Kingdom of [nation]Deverlands[/nation] have all come together to form one massive government to rule over their nations. Official documentation was recently signed and further discussions on our powerful alignment will continue shortly!
