[color=catalina]Welcome to Cherrytown, the home of coziness and warmth.[/color]
My view of NationStates is that it has gone too crazy. You can&#39;t say anything on the forum without being swore at and insulted in a condescending manner because of your views. So I made Cherrytown, where even the name is cozy. Here we have a nice view of life as:

[b]&quot;Only lived once enjoyed&quot;[/b]

And we also have a cool Asset Management side, led by one of my personally favourite puppet nations, Newasval holdings LLC, which you can be a part of and win us some &#39;noice ol&#39; kippers&#39; as people from London would say.

To finish this all off, I&#39;ll leave you with this quote from Woody Allen:

[b]&quot;Those who can&#39;t do, teach, and those who can&#39;t teach, teach gym.&quot;[/b]
