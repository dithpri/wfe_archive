[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Captured: 12.10.16[/I]

[color=red]The only union seen here is that of Fascist HATE, this region has been captured by the Mighty Anti-fascist Warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region], and will serve as a living museum against hate. 

Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
