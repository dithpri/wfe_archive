A military, diplomtic, and economic coalition of various nations founded in 1947 during the aftermath of the second world war. Various nations signed treaties in Vetrigrad, the capitol of the state of Ketracel, the oldest existing member and a co-founder. The treaties were intended to boost cooperation  among differing governments and foster trust to avoid another ideologic war.
