Each member of The Zodiac Alliance acquires a different Zodiac star-sign. This is what they are titled as. We are a free, fair and dominating faction, who wish to oversee the laws and rules of our galaxies. Our main objective is to expand our reach to the entire universe, hoping to gain power and ownership over every other race and rebel faction.
