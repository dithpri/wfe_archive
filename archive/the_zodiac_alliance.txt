Each Benevolent member of The Zodiac Alliance acquires a different Zodiac star-sign. This is what they are titled as. We are a free, fair and dominating faction, who wish to oversee the laws and rules of our galaxies. Our main objective is to expand our reach to the entire universe, hoping to gain a peaceful influence with other sentient beings.
