The Order of Dobrzy&amp;#324;/Order of Dobrin was a military order created in the borderland of Masovia and Prussia during the 13th century Prussian Crusade to &#39;defend against Baltic Prussian raids&#39;. The Order was created by Christian of Oliva, however in the face of the Order&#39;s lack of success in battle against the Prussians in around 1235 the majority of the Knights joined the Teutonic Order and in 1237 the rest of the Brothers were moved by Konrad of Mazovia to Drohiczyn to increase the military strength of that outpost. The Brothers of Dobrin were last mentioned when Drohiczyn was captured by Prince Daniel of Kiev in 1240.
