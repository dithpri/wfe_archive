[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region], [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region] and [region]Albion[/region].

With speed and precision, no region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut. All shall tremble in fear at the sight of our wings and talons!

This place reeks of Tyler! Time to do some spring cleaning!

Praise the Kaiser! Long live the Emperor! Glory to the King!

Congrats to the new TBR General [nation=short]Bob Moran[/nation]![/b]
