[hr][color=#0B0B61][b]Welcome to Rossferry, a democratic close and collective community based around an alternative-history themed nation RP. Hosting multiple unique nations, Rossferry provides the groundwork to implement a dynamic history with a non-contemporary global power balance between potentially dozens of player-created nations as well as a diverse set NPC nations.

We feature an in-depth world map, custom nations with stats determined by the staff team and yourself, as well as player progression.[/b][/color]
