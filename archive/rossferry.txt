[i][color=#0C9291]&quot;Oh great Rossferry, you shall be remembered forever. No matter how many years pass, the region that latest as a refugee nation that later grew into one of the greatest regions you could find that had working plumbing. May you be remembered forever, the good and the bad, the great and the worst, all that occurred here will be forever remembered for what it was and how it always was. Lest to forget.&quot;[/i][/color]

Also, USUC, this isn&#39;t a victory for you. We just grew stronger in a new form of region. It&#39;s like it wasn&#39;t a victory for America when the MiG-15 was retired for the MiG-17. Just got better, a lot better.
