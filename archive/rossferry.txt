We need more cowbell. How much cowbell? It&#39;s uncertain, but our cowbell levels a&#39;lackin. This region, in it&#39;s whole and true form, needs more cowbell. Don&#39;t believe me? I mean come on, do you hear that? NationStates is silent. What does that mean? We need more cowbell. Seriously, trust me, it only costs two livers (We&#39;ll steal the livers of [nation]Volitopia[/nation]) and a half Shilling. So, what do you say, more cowbell? Vote in the poll below.
