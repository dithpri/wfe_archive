Excer. It all started there. Excer is a wonderful country. However in the case of an invasion, it will need help. That&#39;s where Warhound Exceraea comes in. They are controlled by Excer, and were sent to found a region full of allies for Excer. The only thing nations here need to do is to ensure that they agree to defend Excer. In exchange, they will be protected by the might of all the nations in the region. Excer may control the region, but every nation is free to do what they wish. All we ask is loyalty to Excer. Other than that, you are free to do what you wish with full protection. Enjoy!
