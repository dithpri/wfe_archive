[u]Constitution of The United Nations of Gerald[/u]
In the sixteenth century, a fleet, led by Admiral Sailgoat, set sail, in which was a cog christened &amp;quot;Gerald.&amp;quot;  The fate of the Gerald was tragically cut short during a fearsome storm.  The crew stayed at sea longer than they should have, but the honor of weathering the storm was greater than returning home; they died stoically and without regret.

The central idea behind this newly found government is to remember Gerald.  The pursuit of honor and glory is something that is a noble enough cause to die for.  Our forefathers have lived and died for this rite and we will carry the torch into the next eternity.  We all have different backgrounds, but under the flag of Gerald, we will carry on as one.
