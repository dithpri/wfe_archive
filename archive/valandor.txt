&#147;Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don&#39;t we consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we&#39;re partisans of liberty, then it&#39;s our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!&#148;
