A nation filled with fond thoughts of Tobe, and a suave mix of communists and fascists. Everyone is welcome in the UDGT.

In this fine land of ours, the borders of our countries are close, yet the sides of each could not possibly differ any more than they do. In Kiravasta, the citizens enjoy the freedom to live their life as they will, yet in Lejellyville they have the security and careful shepherding that allows them to lead a correct life. 

This is just one example of our differences, but if one thing is the same for us all, it is our unwillingness to fund spirituality.
