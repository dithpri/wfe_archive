[color=red]========Welcome to Spokane========[/color]
Co-founder:[nation]Fairchild[/nation]
Supporting regions are [region]Foxtopia[/region] and [region]Tychrome[/region]

A region just for ambassadors where they can set international law much like the WA but with only partner nations! So if you are a founder or WA delegate, drop a puppet here as a ambassador and stay contacted with other participating regions, even form alliances! As united regions, we can discuss what proposals should be approved and what should be unapproved. It will take time to grow, so please be patient and don&amp;#39;t give up! Never give up! Once we have 15+ regional ambassadors, we shall set a government..... or whatever you think! Any questions? Just ask [nation]Allie Way[/nation]! [b]Join Spokane! The New World Assembly!![/b]
