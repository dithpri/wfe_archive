The New Communist International (Nova Komintern), also known as the Fifth International, is a Neo-Soviet-controlled international organization founded in 2023 that advocates world communism. The Comintern resolved at its Second Congress to &quot;struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state&quot;. The Fifth Comintern was preceded by the Pashkarov takeover of the Third International and of the creation of the Fourth Comintern by Zonorievite Elements.
