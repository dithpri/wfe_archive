[color=purple]The Creed of The Royal Knights[/color]
[color=red]As a knight I pledge my loyalty to The Royal Knights.
I recognize my right to sovereignty and the sovereignty of all member nations;
I recognize my right to have my voice heard;
I recognize the need to support all members;
and I know the need to act appropriately in the view of fellow knights and foreign nations.[/color]
