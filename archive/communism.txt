Communism is an economic system that calls for members of society to be productive in order to help their common man. Homo sapiens are inherently self-interested however, so fewer men are as willing to push themselves to productivity for the population&#39;s benefit than would do so for their own benefit. As productivity falls, the state must either use terror or force to motivate society to continue productivity, or watch as their own policies lead to shortages, unmet needs, and mass death.

Before it was defeated, communism killed nearly 100 million people.
Communism is hatred. Communism is murderous. Communism is behind us forever.

Never again.
