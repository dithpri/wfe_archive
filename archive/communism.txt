Communism is an economic system that calls for members of society to be productive in order to help their common man. Homo sapiens are inherently self-interested however, so fewer men are as willing to push themselves to maximum productivity for the population&#39;s benefit than would do so for their own benefit. As productivity falls, the state must either use terror or force to motivate society to continue productivity, or watch as their own policies lead to shortages and unmet needs.

The communist system has been more or less eradicated by capitalism, an opposing system that requires members of society to be voluntarily productive in order to obtain currency and voluntarily exchange it for needs and wants.
