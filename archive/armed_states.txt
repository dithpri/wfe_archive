The [region]Armed States[/region]

Freedom for the People, Restricted and Limited Government, Love of God and Country

The [region]Armed States[/region] lives by a simple code. The treasured belief in the God given Rights of all People and defending those Rights to the death! A major problem in the world today is the ideas that a &amp;quot;majority&amp;quot; of ignorant and uninformed masses may decide what is and is not lawful to do. In a short and simple sentence, what a person does in private, that does not violate the Right to Life, Property, or Freedom of other People, is not to be regulated, restricted, or limited in any way.

This Region lives by this code. Honor it, or prepare to fight till our last soldier stands.
