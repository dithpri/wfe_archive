The Gypsy Tabor has, once again, risen from the ashes of self-imposed nuclear purification (i.e. a while ago I forgot about this website for a month and the nation got deleted), but this time it has a way cooler flag.
The Taborite Directory is also back with a new coat of paint: from now on, the alliance shall be known as Totalitabor for its dastardly dystopian policies (i.e. it has hundreds upon hundreds of nonsensical laws that aren`t enforced in any way, shape or form).
