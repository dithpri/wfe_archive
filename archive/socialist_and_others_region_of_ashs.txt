On communism:
[I]&quot;In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right. We are witnessing today a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where the demands of the economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political order. But the crisis is happening not in the free, non-Marxist West but in the home of Marxism- Leninism, the Soviet Union.&nbsp;It is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens.&quot;[/i] -Ronald Reagan, 1982
