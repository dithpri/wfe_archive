Motto: &#147;From Shadow, Dominion.&#148;

A shrouded alliance of fascist, totalitarian regimes, The Legion of the Shadowstag stands as a monument to discipline, domination, and absolute control. Bound by the unbreakable Oath of the Shadowstag, the region&#39;s members reject weakness in all forms &#151; be it democratic compromise, economic dependency, or ideological deviation.
