Congrats you may have decided to join the GRAND German Ottoman Empire. Our Anthem is the USSR March anthem and our March anthem is Death to Vienna.
You must respect your higher ranks as well so try and be kind, if you are not you will be put on trail and if found guilty you will be sent to the brig (prison) Misspelling is not a problem here and actually it&#146;s highly excepted. 
Any flag ideas will be accepted tho we already have one, a vote may take place for a new one.
Thank you- 
Your glorious Supreme Caesar
