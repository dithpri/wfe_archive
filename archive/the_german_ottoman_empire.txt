Congrats you may have decided to join the GRAND German Ottoman Empire. Any other nation are available to join a Union, an example is the United Kingdom Commonwealth or the Poland-Lithuanian commonwealth. (And Example for us is the German Polish-Ottoman Fourth Reich Commonwealth, why Poland? CUZ ITS RIGHT NEXT TO GERMANY WHERE GERMAN OTTOMAN IS!)
You must respect your higher ranks as well so try and be kind, if you are not you will be put on trail and if found guilty you will be sent to the brig (prison) Misspelling is not a problem here and actually it&#146;s highly excepted. 
Any flag ideas will be accepted tho we already have one, a vote may take place for a new one.
Thank you- 
Your glorious Supreme Caesar
