A collection of Christ&#39;s Ambassadors to the world, striving to spread the good news and grow disciples, as well as have fun building governments that are totally feasible and not at all wildly out of control. Each member is allowed to have two nations in the Semicollective, and only one of them can be in an office at a time.

Founded June 14th, 2022, at the SICM conference.
A successor to the old &quot;Chi Alpha Collective,&quot; a region that collapsed due to a lack of leadership.
