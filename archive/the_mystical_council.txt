The Mystical Council is still alive and kicking! Where did everybody go, you ask? Well, a merge took place earlier this year with [region]Solar Alliance[/region]. Now you can find us in our new region at [region]The Mystical Alliance[/region]. These days, TMC is mainly used for puppet storage, self-isolating (if you&#39;re into that sort of thing), and as a military base, jump point, or spare region for TMA purposes.

[region]The Mystical Alliance Assembly[/region] is [region]The Mystical Alliance[/region]&#39;s legislative region.
