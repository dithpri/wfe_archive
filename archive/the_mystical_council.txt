Mission 1: To promote peace in our world, while recognizing our differences. Embassies may be built with any and all religious and role playing regions and defense will be provided to those regions when necessary. Regions with older embassies will be given priority in defense operations.

Mission 2: To develop a robust community of role players, defenders, and raiders who enjoy religious, environmental, and magical themes.

Mission 3: To develop a regional government based on these first two missions.
