[color=lightgreen][b]Welcome to The Mystical Council! Where the only thing we take seriously is the constitution! You can endorse whoever you want whenever you want! There are two positions on the Lunar Council up for reelection every full moon. Every member of the Lunar Council also serves as an officer![/b][/color] [color=lightblue][b]We are a region with silly role plays and a focus on regional government. This region is a political warzone. Interested in government? All residents are automatically enrolled in a legislative body called Sentagon.[/b][/color]
