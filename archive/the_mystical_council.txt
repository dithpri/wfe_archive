[i]At long last, the master work is done. Our sages and sorcerers have toiled endlessly and now The Mystical Council resides in a higher sphere, safe from outside interference.[/i]

[region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] has taken this region as an everlasting warning to others who would be as foolish:

[b]Raider Unity, Maintain a Founder, Sign a Treaty![/b]

Let it never be forgotten that this operation - Malice&#39;s comeback - was the largest operation in raiding history at the time, thanks in no small part to our allies who assisted in this endeavor. We hold this region as a trophy in tribute to their efforts. Thanks especially to [region]The Black Hawks[/region], The Sekhmet Legion of [region]Osiris[/region], [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], [region]The Communist Bloc[/region], and [region]Karma[/region], among others.
