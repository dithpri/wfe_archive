Welcome to the Mystical Council! As you enter our sacred gates, ask yourself, what would it be like to be part of a region with two systems of government? Imagine a divided government created by and for a divided region for the sole purpose of assuring an atmosphere of balance and harmony for nations residing therein. Once you have done this, come on in and help yourself to a nice hot cup of tea. :)
