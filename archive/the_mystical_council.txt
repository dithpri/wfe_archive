The Mystical Council was founded (9/18/14) many weeks after the invasion of &amp;quot;Mystical Council&amp;quot; by the Black Riders. Although the original purpose of Mystical Council is lost to time, I will declare this region to be of significance to spiritual seekers, religion enthusiasts, and avid readers of sacred and philosophical texts. Above all, this region&amp;#39;s purpose will put first and foremost the concerns of individual nations and their citizens. I disabled regional control to delegates in order to prevent another invasion by raiders.
