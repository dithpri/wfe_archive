Welcome to [region]The Mystical Council[/region] *Tumble weed rolls by...*

The merger with [region]Solar Alliance[/region] is over which means TMC is back to being an independent region again. Who should we merge with next?

Lunar Council:
[nation]Alistia[/nation], [nation]Exotic Lemon[/nation], [nation]Oakplumington[/nation], [nation]Parakka Northland[/nation], and [nation]Vedan[/nation]
