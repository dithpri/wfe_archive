Beware of the Mystibladuka..
No one&#151;no one knew..
The violets..
Those stupid violets in their robes and motorcyles..
No one, no one knew.
EVERYBODY IN THE COUNCIL STAY INSIDE AND LOCK YOUR DOORS
THE VIOLETS!
THEY ARE CAPTURING CITIZENS, SACRIFICING US TO THEIR GOD!
*The voice stops. You hear a shrill scream and gunshots. The line falls silent, but your brain is convinced that it hears the faint sound of a whimper.*
[color=red]*The speakers cut off to static.*[/color][/b]
