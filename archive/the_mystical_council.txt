[color=gold]Welcome to [region]The Mystical Council[/region]! We are a Lunar-Based Constitutional Representative Monarchy!
[/color]

[color=lightblue]The Lunar Council functions as the legislature, the Delegate serves as Emperor, and resident WA member nations are the Nobility. The Nobles elect members of the Lunar Council on election night (during the full moon) and they elect the Emperor based on endorsements. Non-WA members are considered Peasants. Although Peasants don&#39;t vote, they still serve an important role in the region by contributing to the region&#39;s culture and can stand before the Lunar Council to address grievances and may propose legislation.[/color]
