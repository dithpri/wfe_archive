[color=lightgreen][b]Welcome to The Mystical Council! You can endorse whoever you want whenever you want! There are two positions on the Lunar Council up for reelection every full moon! Every member of the Lunar Council also serves as an officer![/b][/color]

[color=red][b]WARNING - This region is not for those who like safety and stability. This is a highly unstable region with a high raid rate. Here, defenders, invaders, and RPers all live together - and [u]not[/u] necessarily in harmony!!! You might be seeking a seat on the Lunar Council or the Delegacy itself. Either way, good luck on your quest![/b][/color]
