Original [region]Calumet[/region] regional Historical Society and Experimental Station

[b]REGIONAL RECOVERY UPDATE:[/b] Unfortunately, we failed to refound the original [region]Calumet[/region] ahead of some apparent role-playing Nazis.

Calumet is located within the Lake Michigan basin. We are a part of [b][region]Chicago[/region]&#39;s [region]Illinois[/region][/b] southern suburbs. And we share a boundary with [b][region]Indiana[/region][/b].

[region]Calumet City[/region] has now become our new home in exile. CHOICES will remain in operation until further notice.
