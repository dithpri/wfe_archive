Like, we are comically evil. 
No interest in realistic policies or earnest simulation. Just absolute villainy.

Eviltopia is open to any embassy requests but we are much more likely to deny embassy establishment if your region seems to partake in mass acceptance/denial of embassies (or otherwise just constructs embassies for the sake of it). Our great region may be a joke but that does not mean [nation]Evilistis[/nation] will not pretend this is incredibly serious. Besides, it&#39;s incredibly evil to deny diplomatic requests.
