Beartaria is an idea that a nation starts with our own actions and our own production, then accumulates with our families, our neighbors and our communities. The Legends of Beartaria may refer to the decentralized cohesion of those with the highest moral intellect and dignified attributes in life.

Beartarian lands will spread across the world. We are not one nation, but many nations under the name of the bear.
