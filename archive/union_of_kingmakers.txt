[/b][spoiler=[b]Regional Anthem[/b]]Block the entrances, Close the door
Seal the exits, Because this is war, All gave some, Some gave all. But for what, I want to know
Carry on, Don&#39;t mind me. All I gave was everything. And yet you ask me for more. Fought your fight, Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life. What purpose does this serve. Freedom isn&#39;t free[/spoiler]
