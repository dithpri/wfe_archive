Hello, and welcome to the United Defense Directorate, a mutual defense alliance formed from members of the now defunct Crimsdale, Artica Doomingsland Alliance in 2008. While much of the leadership merged with Gholgoth, the UDD was the coalescing of all members who did not follow suit. It exists as a means of mutual technological advancement, open trade and defense. It is here that these powerful nations lay dormant, and it is here that the last members of CAD reside. We bide our time until we decide that the time has come to reassert ourselves on the world stage once again.
