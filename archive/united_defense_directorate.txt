The United Defense Directorate was formed by the newly resurrected Dominion of Ruthless Slaughter and the Covenant Nation of Shenyang. Its goal is to provide a utopia for its citizens, and a safe haven for ideologically similar nations.
Its members are generally welcoming and open to foreign involvement. We strive to be on the cutting edge of technology and use it to not only improve daily life, but defend the Directorate with almost cruel efficiency.
