[u][b]Welcome to [color=orangered]The Empire of Khaad![/color][/u]

[i]The only empire so powerful, a wall seen from space, was erected to keep it at bay![/i]
[/b][hr]Throughout the ages, men of all walks of life have tried to grab power by force, none more successful than The Mongols. The Mongols conquered most of Asia, the words largest continent, and owned, and maintained an empire measuring 9.27 million square miles. We at [B][color=orangered]The Empire of Khaad[/color][/B], wish to combine the fierceness, and military skill of the Mongols with the knowledge of capability of the today&#39;s technology, to create an empire and war machine, to stand the test of time.
