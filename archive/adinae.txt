[i][b]Welcome to Adinae, dearest Comrades![/b][/i]

-Adinae is a region of five core nations created by a student as an experiment in political science. Each of the core nations represents a certain ideological trend. Tho goal of this experiment is to see how each of these nations develop based on their ideas. Adinae will be the source of NS-based RPs, involving conflicts between the core nations; involvement in these RPs by the NS community as a whole is highly encouraged! You do not need to be a member of Adinae to participate in the RPs.
