On November 29th 2022, The Community of Exceptional Idiots decided life in Lazarus just wasn&#39;t for them.
It didn&#39;t take very long before they started to feel lonely and regretted leaving their region. But going back? No, they couldn&#39;t. After all, they were idiots.
And thus the Community of Exceptional Idiots created the League of Idiots. Any Idiot, big or small or exceptional, would be welcomed with open arms. 
There wasn&#39;t any sort of requirements to join. No IQ-requirements, no sensible policy requirement. In fact, the League of Idiots encouraged a rather &#39;laissez-faire&#39; behavior. For they believed that was the truest of freedom.
