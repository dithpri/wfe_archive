Their once was an evil region full of evil nations who bullied others and abused their power. They started a war with a good region full of good nations and they fought to destroy all goodness in the world. In they end the evil region was nuked and destroyed. In the ashes of evil a new region was formed. They were formed to stand for freedom, liberity, justice, democarcy, and goodness. When the evil region was wiped from the face of the world, many good nations came together to make this new region. The new region is called Radioactive Falloutland, named after what the land was like after the war was over. Now the land is purged of evil and is a great place to live and grow your nation. Good has triumphed over evil.
