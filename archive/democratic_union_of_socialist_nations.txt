The Democratic Union of Socialist Nations (DUSN) is a union of socialist and communist states. We want to build a democratic left-wing community where the people has the power through elected institutions. It functions with a single-party system, the Socialist Party of the Union (SPU) is the sole legal party, but it is accepting all factions of the left and elections are multi-candidate.

As the Union is at its beginning, the Founder will have executive authority until elections are held.
