Greater Possibilities is a Kaiserreich Cold War Scenario where players create their own countries without the restrictions on lore. The only undebated part of the timeline is a German Victory in the First World War. The player is tasked to use his/her creativity to draft a country within reason in the universe created by fellow players. 

Those seeking to play will be able to conduct war, diplomacy, trade, espionage, and other actions of a country. All chats in-character should be conducted as if the person is playing a representative of their select countries. 

We are always looking for staff. If you are interested please make it known!
