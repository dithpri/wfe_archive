[i]The Joint Systems Alliance (JSA) was formed by the Interstellar Federation of Magna Omega on December 31st, 2038 (Omegan Calendar) on the basis of bringing a sense of stability and unity to allied systems of the galaxy.[/i]

The JSA is proud to bear a commendation, given on Wednesday 19 May 2010 by the World Assembly&amp;#39;s Security Council for exemplary service in aiding in defeating countless enemies of the galaxy and other selfless actions over the years that it existed. May the Joint Systems Alliance live on forever in the hearts of all those that the members worked to serve and protect.
