A sprawling archipelago, where nations are free to grow in unity... or in opposition. It has been organized by the Federal Republic of the Nautilus Islands to be a place of great diversity, in peoples and in governments.

This is intended to be a region focused on roleplay, in the tradition of the old standbys (eg: The Underwater Bubble, Tareldanore, NATO, etc).

No fancy maps, Discord channels, offsite forums or the like here. Not yet, anyway.
