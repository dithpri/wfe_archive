A sprawling archipelago, intended to be a place of great diversity. Home to only one nation, [nation]The Nautilus Islands[/nation], but many peoples.

The region is a very peaceful and quite prosperous section of the globe, partly for it&#39;s resources and partly for it&#39;s people&#39;s respect for the land and sea. Among the natural islands, one can find floating cities in addition to farming and mining platforms, with technology keeping most of the actual islands pristine. The water is clear and the wildlife prolific.
