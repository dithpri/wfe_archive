Located in the North Atlantic, The Bermuda Archipelago gets it name from the proximity it shares with the tiny island of Bermuda, which rests just outside the regions borders. Each of our countries is wildly different in its history and culture, and each of them have their own way of life. We hope you enjoy your stay here, and Welcome to the Bermuda Archipelago.
