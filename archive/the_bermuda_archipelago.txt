Inside the Bermuda triangle lay a group of islands. These islands, this piece of ocean, is spoken of in lore so far back, it is unsure that they really exist. The people of these islands are in control of a vast array of advanced technology, and sometimes &amp;#39;borrow&amp;#39; stray planes and boats to &amp;#39;satisfy&amp;#39; some of their more, violent inhabitants. They remain untouched by the outside world  and few know what goes on inside the massive storm that is the Bermuda Triangle.  They have  been contacted by many using telecommunications, but only a small amount get a reply. 

This... Is the Bermuda Archipelago.
