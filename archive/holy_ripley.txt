~~ The Holy City of Ripley ~~
The entirety of Tippah County, located in Northeast Mississippi, declares its independence from the United States of America after years of chaos. A wall is built surrounding the county, so it functions in isolation. The leader finds itself to be none other than former South Tippah School Distric&#39;s Superintendent, Frank Campbell, after a military coup. Holy Ripley has control over Ripley, Blue Mountain, Walnut, Pine Grove, and Falkner, along with some territory ceded to them by Alcorn County.

The country is overtly anti-communist, anti-socialist, anti-democractic, and anti-integration.
