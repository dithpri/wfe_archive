The Universal Union is the Combine&#146;s name for their ultimate goal-to take over the multiverse. The Combine is a large empire, willing to do anything to achieve that goal. They have assimilated many species, such as striders and hunters, and they have begun transforming Humans, too, after the Seven Hour War.
