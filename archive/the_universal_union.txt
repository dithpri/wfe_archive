(Half-Life 2 roleplay region)
This is a region full of combine controlled areas, loyalists to the union, anti-combine rebels, alien planets, pro-combine paramilitary and collaborators. Our aim is to control the universe, earth&#39;s invasion was attempted but failed only leaving a small foothold on the planet in this region.

(Contains mostly fictional characters, for example Vortigaunts, Headcrabs and etc. There will not be a &quot;roleplay Gordon Freeman&quot; because we don&#39;t want the entire region to collapse because someone wanted to recreate the events of the game. Credits to Valve for making Half-Life 2 and making this region possible!)
