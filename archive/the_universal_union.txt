Welcome to [region]The Universal Union[/region]!

We are a community of nations dedicated to acting on the basis of real sociopolitical theory, and therefore gaining recognition as the most realistic of all regions. We are based, of course, off the European Union.

[B]Updates[/B]
We are currently hyper-focused on recruitment, as none of our ideas can be put into play with too small a community. A temporary government and constitution will be put in place, until optimized, or entirely redone by a democratically elected committee. Full power will be given to the WA delegate as soon as our region is secure.
