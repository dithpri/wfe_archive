The Africa

Ooga booga welcome to Africa. We share needles and we sit in the sun; weaving baskets while naked. Although our region is renowned for having high disposable incomes, we decide against living in luxury and spend our savings on praising the weather. We have many rich Nigerian princes who need to dispose of excess cash - however no one seems to accept their kind requests. Many blockbuster movies have been made in Africa - specifically Uganda - who are renowned for their intense and realistic films which depict the peaceful conditions of Africa. ~ ClassicBio
