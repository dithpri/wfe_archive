[color=blue]Bien venue au Bas-Canada! / Welcome to Lower Canada![/color]

Lower Canada is a puppet park where all nations are welcome. Stay a little while or make Lower Canada your home. No nation will be turned away - There is a home for everybody in Lower Canada! We are an independent, casual, neutral and tolerant region for all nation types. We only ask that you be respectful of others. Lower Canada is especially monarchist and eco-friendly!
