Bien venue au Bas-Canada! / Welcome to Lower Canada!

Lower Canada is a puppet park where all nations are welcome. Stay a little while or make Lower Canada your home. Although we prefer nations that are not members of The World Assembly, WA nations will not be turned away as everyone is welcome here in Lower Canada! We are an independent, casual, neutral and tolerant region for all nation types. We only ask that you be respectful of others. Lower Canada is especially monarchist friendly!
If you have any questions or suggestions please telegram Terre du Nord.

Merci bien mes amis!
