Bien venue au Bas-Canada! / Welcome to Lower Canada!

Lower Canada is a puppet park where all nations are welcome. Stay a little while or make Lower Canada your home. We prefer nations that are not members of The World Assembly, however, WA nations will not be turned away as everyone is welcome here in Lower Canada! Our only rule here is The Golden One, that is, be respectful of others.
If you have any questions or suggestions please telegram Terre du Nord.

Merci bien mes Amis!
