The Eternal Axis Federation is an alliance of right-leaning nations and a refuge from cultural and social degeneracy that plagues NationStates. The Federation is not a democracy, however your suggestions/discussion is always appreciated.

Politically-correct sentiment earns you an instant ban.
Welcome to the Federation.

- Joachim Str&uuml;p,
High Scholar of the Imperium of Straka
Supreme Chancellor of the Eternal Axis Federation
