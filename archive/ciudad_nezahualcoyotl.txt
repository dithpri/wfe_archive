[b]Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl[/b], is a city and municipality of State of Mexico adjacent to the northeast corner of Mexico&#39;s Federal District.

As of 2006, Nezahualcoyotl included part of the world&#39;s largest mega-slum, along with Chalco and Izta. Most of its population is poor and have migrated from other parts of Mexico. It also has a very high crime rate, in part due to &quot;cholos&quot; or gangs formed since the 1990s based on gang models in the United States, especially Los Angeles. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
