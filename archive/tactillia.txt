In the year 2000, Tactillia was invaded by the neighboring country of Brindor, which sought to expand its territory. The war lasted for five years, during which time the people of Tactillia fought bravely to defend their land. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, they were able to hold off the Brindorian forces with the help of Abernic, their mother nation. Finally, in 2005, a peace treaty was signed, and Tactillia was able to retain its independence. The war left scars on the region, but the people of Tactillia have since worked hard to rebuild and recover.
