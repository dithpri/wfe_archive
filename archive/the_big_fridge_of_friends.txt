There&#39;s a fridge. It&#39;s a big fridge. You open it. A friend waves at you from the bit in the door where you might put eggs/a small jar of mustard. &#39;Hello!&#39; he screams in a tiny voice, &#39;welcome to the Big Fridge of Friends!&#39;. You smile, for you know you are home. Friends behind the flickering light! Friends in the vegetable crisper! You shrink down, walk through to that section in the back which always gets covered in ice for no reason and you lie down to dream. Before you sleep, you have just enough time to curse the greedy systems of private property ownership that result in your bastard landlord refusing to replace your faulty fridge. It&#39;s been emitting hallucination-inducing gases and you have finally snapped.
