Are you tired of actually engaging in politics? Do you want to vote in the WA and make other important decisions in random intervals, only when you feel like it? Do you just want some friends and issues to answer?

If one or more of these apply to you, join up here. Casualland is a place where you can just have fun on the message board.

I look forward to seeing you here.
