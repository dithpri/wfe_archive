Ionia is an ancient region of present day nation of Turkey.

REGION
Another of [region=United States of America]&amp;#39;s group of Allied Regions, was referred to as [region=Royal Alliance] (because [nation=short]Royal House of Windsor[/nation] is my main caretaker nation) or by several other names over the years because of our former Invader/Defender status. We no longer participate in any WA functions. We basically collect regions.

This Alliance and Region is not affiliated with [region=The Royal Alliance] (if it still exists), [region=True North] or the many other puppet holders in this game.
