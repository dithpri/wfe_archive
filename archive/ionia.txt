[color=594020][b]Ionia[/b]

Ionia is an ancient region of present day nation of Turkey.

REGION
Another of [nation=short]Manitoulin[/nation]&amp;#39;s group of Allied Regions, sometimes referred to as [region=Royal Alliance] (because [nation=short]Royal House of Windsor[/nation] is my main caretaker nation) or by several other names over the years because of our former Invader/Defender status. We no longer participate in either or any WA functions. We collect regions, and operate thousands of puppets throughout the game.
This Alliance and Region is not affiliated with [region=The Royal Alliance] (if it still exists), [region=True North] or the many other puppet holders in this game.
