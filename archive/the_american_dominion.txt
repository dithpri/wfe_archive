The American Dominion, also called the American Reich by its many detractors, is an international organization of the client states of the Federal American Union. The Dominion was founded in 1943 after Canada&#39;s defeat in the second world war. Since then, the Dominion has come to encompass the former territories of Mexico (with the exception of Yucatan), Greenland, and the vast majority of the Caribbean. Its stated purpose is &quot;to spread the seven pillars of Americanism to all corners of the globe and defeat the Jewish conspiracy of communism wherever it may be found.&quot;
