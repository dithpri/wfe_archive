Hello, nation founders, and welcome to The Lands of Utopia! As a public region, anyone is allowed to join, and create their own Utopia. Many other regions say the exact same thing, and you can also make Utopias that aren&amp;#39;t in a region, but in this currently humble region, everything is tranquil, and is a nice place to hang out in.

My wishes is not to be the biggest region, or top ranking, or extremely popular. All I hope is that nations can come here to create a tranquil Utopia, and to relax from the busy hustle of other regions. Take care, and have a fun time building Utopia!
