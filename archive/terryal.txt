Welcome to the vast world of Terryal. Here legends will rise, tyrants cast down. It is a world of activity. And chaos.

The main fact book is free for any joined nation to post their reasons for joining, important events that happened in your nation that makes it renowned, or effects the world. Just send Thardania or I, Man In A Box, a TG and get our approval and you can put it up.

As for maps and geography, it is partly open. But Thardania will be taking care of all that until someone more experienced can. 

Currently we are few, so we will let most anyone join. As soon as we get more moderate numbers, we&amp;#39;ll add a password. 

Thank you for reading or joining, sincerely your 2012 Delegate, Man In A Box.
