A bunch of small islands collected together in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. The founders of the islands were lost ships that have found themselves unable to continue back to their home after a massive storm had torn their sails apart. The islands provided just enough land and food to thrive into a small settlement where now a few colonies have called the islands home, each islands being its own small country.

The islands cultures differ from each piece of land you visit, from thriving economical cities that base themselves on tourism, and the more quiet environmental and spiritual people that follow their old tribe like traditions.
