Invaded, but now back in the hands of loyal natives thanks in no small part to the efforts of Fleet Admiral Benevolent Thomas and the Renegade Islands Special Forces. We now officially thank them for liberating our region. We have received reinforcements from the aforementioned coalition group, so do not be alarmed by any unfamiliar nations. As a precaution against continued raiding, I am  banning the raiding nations that seized control. Thank you for your time.
