Hello, it&#39;s me, your friendly neighborhood delegate. Don&#39;t be alarmed by the Cabinet position changes, those will all be settled when the PM is elected. I am reverting the positions back to the ones in the Constitution, which actually have roles. You can find the list and job description in Chapter II, Part I, of the Constitution. I will be starting an amendment process. If you have something you don&#39;t like about the Constitution or the region in general, you can telegram me or Fashie. If we get a viable amendment we&#39;ll post it and let you vote on it.
Thank you,
