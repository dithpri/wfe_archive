Welcome to [b][region]Chisholm ELP Class Revised[/region][/b] and your re-elected WA Delegate [b][u][nation]fashie[/nation][/u][/b]. If you are rejoining, or just getting on, and don&amp;#39;t know what happened, please read the dispatch I have pinned below-CECR Times: Vol. 01-06. For the reasons stated in the dispatch, a password will be installed in the region. When this happens, telegram me for the password. Also give your real name, and connection to me personally. I will then give you the password. If you do not know me personally, or are in our ELP class/was(for you Mark), your are not welcome. I am sorry. We are also a part of WUTO. A dispatch explaining that is coming soon. Thank you, and have a great day in this awesome region!
