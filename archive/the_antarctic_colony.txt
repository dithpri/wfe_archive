Greetings, NationStates players! There is a new region just waiting for any players to join and be part of. Even though I am very new at this, I&amp;#39;ve seemed to have gotten down the basics and even a few of the optional items. Questions? Ask away! I&amp;#39;m sure that at least a player would have an answer and, if not, we&amp;#39;ll help you get that squared away. Comments/Concerns? Blog as you wish! I am here to make a comfortable experience for players of any skill, whether you just made your country, or you are one of the first people to play this game, we welcome anyone!!!
