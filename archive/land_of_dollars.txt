&quot;Everyone is a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing it is stupid.&quot;  -Albert Einstein.
Welcome to the Land of Dollars. Where freedoms and economy are equal and powerful. People don&#39;t see the light at the end of the tunnel because they are to busy worrying about the tunnel blocking the light. This reflects the idea people aren&#39;t thankful for what they have because they are jealous of what they don&#39;t. In the Land of Dollars money and wealth is spred out among everyone, everyone is powerful and equal just like our region. I hope you accept the Land of Dollars, because we accept even weak economies and when we get them we help them to build their economies.
