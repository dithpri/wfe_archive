Region closed.  Thank you all for being allies.

The Asmor Federation was a collection of Remnants from broken/fallen/collapsed nations, forming together in an alliance, or so was the dream...

This Region is now just a reminder. The Warlord of Asmoria himself is the only one to remain, forever remembering, forever in grief.

Book of Boba Fett, is cool
