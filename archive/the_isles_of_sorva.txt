We have a [url=https://i.imgur.com/rTvycwL.jpg]custom map[/url]. To join it, first, become a WA member, if you aren&#39;t one already. Second, send a telegraph to [nation]Kobasca[/nation], stating which number you would like to claim.
Any nations that have not claimed a spot on the map are assumed to exist on islands too small for the map, for roleplay purposes.
