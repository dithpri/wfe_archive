In a land dominated by corrupt regions designed to suck the resources from worse off nations, one stands out above the rest. Singularity may be a region dominated by cults (most notoriously &#147;The Cult of Milos&#148; and &quot;The Cult of Chadism&quot;) but it makes up for that fact by being the most economically free. Relying on donations instead of taxes, Singularity supports a libertarian perspective in the face of authoritarian regimes.
