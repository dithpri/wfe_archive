Hello, and welcome to The Universal Republic, the spiritual successor to Freelandia! We hope you like your stay here, and enjoy! It has been 31 days since the founding of The Universal Republic! (Founded Thursday, March 28, 2019)

UPDATE: Hey everyone, we are still alive. The only thing is that we&#39;ve got important news! The Slovadian Empire is getting their own Minecraft server, known by a former name choice of Slovadia, The Kingdom Of Sinoslov. I am hoping if this Alpha Test works, then I&#39;ll be able to add the following countries to my server and create the UNUR:
- PolandsRebirth
- Walmartian-Asdada
- And a nation outside the region, Jim Pickens Island
I will add further details soon. -J.A.R.
