Located far north or germany, the Snowridden island in the northern sea is a cold, desolate place to live, but the native Volkk are strong. However, the Volkk only control the southernmost part of the island. Large forests and frozen mountains will deter only the bravest nomads. Fishing is a very prosperous occupation, along with mining and wood cutting. Farming is difficult, but not impossible. A handful of active volcanoes still spot the landscape. Much of Schneegerritan is undiscovered, and awaits conquest and adventure.
