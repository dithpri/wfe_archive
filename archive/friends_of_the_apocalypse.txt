This region serves as the headquarters for the Apocalyptian government; any aggression towards any nation within will be met with swift retaliation.

The Apocalypse consists of the Fatherland ([nation]geodesicdragon[/nation]), as well as the following nations:

[list][*]The colonies of [nation]new apocalyptia[/nation], [nation]heralds rise[/nation] and [nation]new geotopia[/nation],
[*]The puppet state of [nation]riostes[/nation], and
[*][nation=long]the apocalyptian herald[/nation][/list]

Despite our reputation for aggression, we&#39;re actually quite nice once you get to know us.

Pretty much all embassy requests will be rejected; if we want one, [i]we&#39;ll[/i] send [i]you[/i] a request.
