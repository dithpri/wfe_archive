This region serves as the headquarters for the Apocalyptian government; any aggression towards any nation within will be met with swift retaliation. The other three nations in this region are Apocalyptian protectorates, and thus will be defended just as fiercely as any of our own nations.

The Apocalypse consists of the Fatherland ([nation]geodesicdragon[/nation]), as well as the following nations:

[list][*]The colonies of [nation]new apocalyptia[/nation], [nation]heralds rise[/nation] and [nation]new geotopia[/nation],
[*]The puppet state of [nation]riostes[/nation], and
[*][nation=long]the apocalyptian herald[/nation][/list]

Despite our reputation for aggression, we&#39;re actually quite nice once you get to know us.

Pretty much all embassy requests will be rejected; if we want one, [i]we&#39;ll[/i] send [i]you[/i] a request.
