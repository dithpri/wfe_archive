This region serves as the headquarters for the Apocalyptian government; any aggression towards any nation within will be met with swift retaliation.

The Apocalypse consists of the Fatherland ([nation]geodesicdragon[/nation]), as well as the following nations:

[list][*]The colonies of [nation]new apocalyptia[/nation], [nation]heralds rise[/nation] and [nation]new geotopia[/nation],
[*]The puppet state of [nation]riostes[/nation], and
[*][nation=long]the apocalyptian herald[/nation][/list]

Other nations in this region are Apocalyptian protectorates; they rule themselves, but we will defend them through military force if necessary.

Despite our reputation for aggression, we&#39;re actually quite nice once you get to know us.
