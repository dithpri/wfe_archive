The Union of Socialist Nations is exactly what it sounds like. It&#39;s a union of nations that happen to be socialist. All forms of socialism and communism are welcome in this region, except for Stalinism and Maoism, due to the fact that they tend to lead to millions of deaths through famine and purges. Also we don&#39;t take kindly to fascists here, for fairly obvious reasons.
