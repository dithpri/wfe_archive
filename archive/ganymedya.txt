Ganymedya is a reigon that houses numerous nations. Similar to the European Union, using the erai is not mandatory, but it would make life a little easier if a nation did use it. We house governments of all different types. And overall, we value our freedom. Remember: 1984 was a warning, not an instruction manual.
