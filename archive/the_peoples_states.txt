[b]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b]

This region is now a living museum against hate. It was targeted due to its representation of a hateful ideology, we cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.

[color=red]This region was home to the puppet master himself [nation]Noble Wolf[/nation] aka [nation]Felix Alfarth[/nation] and was being transferred to [region]The Greater German Reich[/region], before we stepped in.[/color]

Nothing of note was found in the Regional Message Board, but the ramblings of a mad Nazi chatting to himself...

If you would like to see [nation]Noble Wolf[/nation] getting owned please view the [region]GOLDEN NAZI REICH[/region] regional message board.
