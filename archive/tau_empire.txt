The planet itself is a hot, dry, arid world primarily covered in Savannah and scattered mountain ranges. The little arable land is covered with efficiently run collective farms managed by the Earth Caste. Cities rise into the sky, covered in white marble, in stark contrast to the Hives of the Imperium. No humans have ever walked on the streets of the capital, located on the equator, and Imperial scans are blocked by some Tau technology. At the centre of this city appears to be a heavily defended fortress, possibly the heart of the Tau empire, the high council of the Ethereals. T&amp;#39;au is home to a large moon known as Lu&amp;#39;val, which was the first off-world colony of the Tau Empire in 533.M37.
