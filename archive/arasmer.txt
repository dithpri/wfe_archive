Arasmer is a union of nations bound together by the laws and regulations of this very region. We fight together, we protect each other and we support each other.

Arasmer was founded on May 23rd, 2019 by Makko Oko. Makko Oko thought about founding a union somewhat similar to the UN and the EU because of all the raids. We can be the protectors of ourselves and our allies.
