Jesus Chatline was a live-streamed webcast series hosted by Richard Burnish and Steven Chilton, who promoted a fictional branch of Christianity called &#147;The Church of the Neon Bible&quot; as a satire of American televangelist public access shows, that ran from 2011 to 2012. The show was known for being inundated with prank phone calls from users on 4chan&#146;s /b/ (random) board.
