This is a new region that is open to all nations seeking stability, friends, and a place to call home. Please be respectful and friendly to each other!

Here in [region]Aachen[/region], we aim to create a community where anyone can feel welcome and unafraid to ask for help and advice, both in and outside NationStates. Beyond that, we strive to create a friendly atmosphere where casual conversation, and sometimes roleplay, can occur on the RMB.

Nations new to the game and/or new to [region]Aachen[/region] are encouraged to introduce themselves on the Regional Message Board; we&#39;re always excited to have guests and meet new people![/b]
