[nation]Shadonyafand[/nation] isn&#39;t on a mission currently.
[nation]Tilodaw[/nation] is on a mission to [region]Random Acts Of Kindness[/region]

Want us to journey to your region? Send a telegram to Wingfand! Tahlia Outcasts is currently trying to find a different region to be in, with not too many countries, puppets allowed (maybe), and a map so we could be in it. We&#39;re not really roleplayers, as we prefer to roleplay as something else that may be offensive to some people here, but we can try!

You can also ask Wingfand to draw you as a countryhuman. I guess it&#39;ll look okay-ish.
