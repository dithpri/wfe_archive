Welcome to the Union of Common Republics

Ages ago, one of the greatest alliances to the left was formed known as the USSCR. Having over 40 members, the alliance dominated leftist politics, proving to be a formidable foe to the right. Eventually however, she died, fading out of history. Those republics holding on to the Yuzarian ideology splintered into groups. No more, the Yuzarian Menace will rise again out of the ashes of her ancestor&amp;#39;s glory.
