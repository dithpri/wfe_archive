(Please Endorse Them!)[/color] [hr][color=ffcc00][b]Iris is an old region in Nationstates that has been through many founders over the years. Iris has finally returned to life after a long hiatus. The region is a peaceful settlement with the eye always watching over its people! Legend has it this watchful eye grants wisdom, guidance and protection of everyone it chooses to lead it.[/color][/b][hr][color=ffcc66][b][u]Regional Links:[/u]
