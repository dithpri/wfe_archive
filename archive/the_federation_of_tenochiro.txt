The Federation of Tenochiro, founded across multiple planes of existence is designed to bring nations together.

Matters of regional importance are dealt with by the Council of Swords, an organisation formed of volunteer nations.

The Council of Swords requires more nations to run effectively.

The Federation is currently still growing, we are actively recruiting but any further efforts are greatly appreciated.
