Liffor is an ancient and war-torn land. The leaders of the tribes battled one another endlessly throughout the generations. A millennium ago, the leaders of each tribe, haggard and weary of the endless conflict, came together to form a coalition. This provincial solution quickly led to the formation of the Liffor Confederation. Over the last thousand years there has been no incident of conflict between the independent nations within the region but their alliance remains strong. Although the people living in the region prefer to be referred to as either living in the confederation or in their separate nation-state, the age old name stuck, and almost all refer to the region as &amp;quot;The Land of Liffor&amp;quot;.
