Liffor is an ancient and war-torn land. The leaders of the tribes battled one another endlessly throughout the generations. A millennium ago, the leaders of each tribe, haggard and weary of the endless conflict, came together to form a coalition. This provincial solution quickly led to the formation of the Liffor Confederation.
