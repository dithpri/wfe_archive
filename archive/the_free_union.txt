Have you ever wished to join a region that consisted of the rights of free speech, freedom of protest, freedom of debate, and freedom of the pursuit of happiness? Well, this is the region for you!!!

The Free Union is a wonderful region where you can voice your opinion, discuss both real and fictional RPG events, and just talk, without heavy language, to other nations and spread your nation&#39;s views all while being in a friendly community. 

The Free Union would love to grow, to provide nations a home, and provide freedoms to our members. 

&quot;We Want YOU For The Free Union!&quot;
