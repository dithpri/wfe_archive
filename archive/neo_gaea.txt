[b]Welcome to Neo Gaea[/b],

A temperate climate world of vast oceans, lofty mountains, lush valleys and forests. 
A bustling mixture of tranquil and perilous cities and nations on innumerable landmasses.

A world where humans and non-human can mingle in multifaith and multipolitical, discussions. Start roleplays or kick back with fun and games.

The region will attempt to accept all as long as you do not break the rules. 

Each nation has their own freedoms, expressions and right to choose their own path and destiny.
