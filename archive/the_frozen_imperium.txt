The Imperium is a selection of islands of varying size in the Southern pacific ocean close to the continent of Antarctica. It is a democracy where a leader called an &#39;Archon&#39; (world assembly delegate) is voted in for 1 year and may appoint his or her own officials. However they must also rule along the emperor (founder).
