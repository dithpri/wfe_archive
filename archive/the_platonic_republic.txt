PIZZA IS THE HIGHEST PHYSICAL FORM OF GOOD. IT IS AN AXIOMATIC PRINCIPLE, SELF EVIDENT IN ALL LIFE FORMS. THOSE WHO CANNOT SEE THE PIZZA CANNOT BE GOOD CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC, FOR PIZZA IS THE GOOD AND THOSE WHO CANNOT CONCEIVE OF IT CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG. 

WE ARE NEOPLATONISTS.
