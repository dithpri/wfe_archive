Welcome to [region]The 1000 Continents[/region] where you can have fun playing against other rival nations and RP and become dominant.

I hope you&amp;#39;ll enjoy our new region! 

The 1000 Continents region&amp;#39;s relations with their neighbors to the southwest continents of [b]Red Europe[/b], [b]Slavica[/b] , and Austrovia are contentious, while relations with neighboring to the northwest continents of [b]Brititia[/b] , Hanoverreich, and [b]Skanivia[/b] are friendly. 



They are bordered on three sides by a huge continent called [b]Midgard[/b]. They are proud of their local heritage and what not. The Continental people follow the dominant religion of Panism. The Continentals are often troubled by a poor economy and constant wars. They are fond of their political leaders.
