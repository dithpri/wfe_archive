The original founder of this region was one of the worst Islamist fascists in NationStates. This is what his list of embassies was:

[i]The Brotherhood of Muslim Nations, the Greater German Reich, Australia, Coronis, Knights Templar, Islam, United Empire of Islam, American Nazi Party, Union of Nationalists, BLITZKRIEG, Nazi Party USA, and Berghof.[/i]

Well, he&amp;#39;s gone now, and we the anti-theocratic, anti-fascist [nation=short]Ujjanistani Occupation Force[/nation] has refouned his region now to prevent him resurrecting his despicable nation and reclaiming this place.

We are not Jewish, we just fly the Israeli flag as a symbol of our committment to fight the co-evils of Islamofascism and Nazism.
