[Color=red]Join the army, take up the rifle, learn to wield the lance, run down your enemy until their feet bleed and they scream in agony. We tare down the wall of our enemies. Enslave their women and children and conquer their lands. Wealth and fame, strength and power such are the rewards of the Uiska. You are the soldier, we are the legion![/color]
