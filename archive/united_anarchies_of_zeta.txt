In the radiant embrace of this newly forged continent, a beacon of progress and compassion shines brightly, illuminating the hearts and souls of its diverse inhabitants. We, the architects of this harmonious union, united by a shared commitment to the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, hereby proclaim the grand declaration of our extraordinary land. Within our borders, we have cultivated a fertile garden of tolerance, where prejudice and discrimination wither in the face of acceptance and understanding. We declare with a resounding voice that heterosexuality, in all its forms, shall find no shelter here. Let the sun rise and fall on our glorious union.
