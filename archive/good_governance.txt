[i]igg[/i] is Gameplay&#39;s first think tank. We aim to promote good regional governance through study, research and the dissemination of ideas, via publishing two types of paper.

[b]Policy Papers[/b] educate those involved in regional politics about the challenges their region faces, policies that could help solve these challenges, and an explanation of how those policies will work.

[b]Historical Papers[/b] educate those interested in regional politics and history about major regional incidents, their link to issues of governance, and what they can learn from it today.
