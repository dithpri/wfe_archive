We had no idea our llamas were so enticing to The Black Riders! Perhaps if we gave them business cards they would deign to catch their own ungulates and leave our poor guanacos to graze in peace. But it seems that they want to build embassies! YAY! WE FEEL IMPORTANT. WE ALSO LOVE GEESE. Geese are good. Geese are fun. Yum. I just LOVE trees. Don&amp;#39;t y&amp;#39;all? HAHAHAA! WE BAN BLUE PAINT! HA! Anyways, I hope that you own a cough-drop factory, because you&amp;#39;re going to need it when we finish making our scented candles. Great. Have a nice day, and remember to water your evergreens.
