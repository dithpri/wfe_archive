We can be both peaceful and violent when we want to be but our main priority is unity.

The rules are simple:
(1) You may not promote any other regions in here if they aren&#39;t our allies.
(2) You may not make beef with any regions or nations on but if you want do it on your own accord.
(3)Don&#39;t pressure the WA Delegate of our nation there will be polls for things he/she should do for us.
