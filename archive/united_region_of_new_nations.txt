The &quot;United region of new nations&quot; has one goal. Our goal is to provide a region with free and fair elections to new and underdeveloped nations. We all are united as one and help those who need it. If any of our members are threatened it is our duty to at least provide advice and aid and if not join the conflict with them. We all help each other so we can stand up and become the great nation we are all destined to become. Nations here have the opportunity to gain traction and eventually become superpowers. WE HAVE YOUR BACK!!
