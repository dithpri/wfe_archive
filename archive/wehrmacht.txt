Former WFE:

Yad Mordechai (Hebrew for &amp;quot;Memorial of Mordechai&amp;quot;) is named in honor of Polish Jew and partisan fighter Mordechai Anielewicz (1920-1943), leader of Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa (English for &amp;quot;Jewish Combat Organization&amp;quot;), which led to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943, where he died fighting the enemies of all humankind.

We have named the nation that conquered the Nazi military region here on NS in his honor.
