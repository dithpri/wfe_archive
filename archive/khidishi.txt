Khidishi is a not-so-distant world of red trees and many moons, on which thrives an alien species called [b]critters[/b]. They resemble earthly canines &#151; four-legged, furred, mammalian creatures &#151; yet they are very chimerical in appearance; horns, feathers, talons, hooves, extra tails, and quills are the usual. They have their own vibrant cultures and expansive civilizations on their world.

This region exists simply so I can socialize in the factions I am interested in even if they are not embassies with each other. Like my nation itself, I decided to theme it around the setting of [url=https://www.yar.la/]my webcomic[/url], though the webcomic takes place over a century ago (in Earth terms).
