We will prevail brothers. We are separate yet united. Warring yet peaceful. We have one goal that unites our many different objectives. We will expand, we will work with what we have. We are not discriminatory yet will banish those who are undeserving. We are made to be a joke yet also can be serious, anarchic yet organized. We are the world.
