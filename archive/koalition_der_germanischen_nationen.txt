  On the date of April 15, 2014 at the time of 6:25 pm, the Coalition of Germanic Nations was established under the direct leadership of Das Reich der Germanischen V&ouml;lker. This coalition will bring together any and all Germanic nations that wish to seek protection and prosperity among their Germanic brethren.
