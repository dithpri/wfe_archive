The Land of Finite Possibilities is just that, and though there are many possibilities, there are not endless ones (cause that would just be just silly).  It is a land of level headedness, strength and pizza.  The Land of Finite Possibilities (LFP) has the philosophy that everyone should do things our way (or not, but those are the only choices) and every man, women, or child should own a tiger or unicorn (but only one or the other, cause that is what finite possibilities is all about).  So if you believe in non-infinite options, come join our cause (or don&amp;#39;t, whatever).
