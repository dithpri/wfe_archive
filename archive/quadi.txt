The Quadi were a Suebian Germanic tribe who lived approximately in the area of modern Moravia in the time of the Roman empire. The only known information about the Germanic tribe the Romans called the &#39;Quadi&#39; comes through reports of the Romans themselves, whose empire had its border on the River Danube just to the south of the Quadi.
