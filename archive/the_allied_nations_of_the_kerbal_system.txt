Welcome fellow Kerbal! Here in the home of the famous, prospective, and sometimes dangerous Kerbal Space Program, we pride ourselves of our technological development and our &uml;advanced&uml; process of scientific trial and error. We constantly defend ourselves from our enemies and our arch enemy the Space Kraken. We allow our nations to freely choose their own government as long as it does not negatively impact their citizens&amp;#39;civil rights. All hail our mighty leader Jebediah Kerman!
