(For Non-Roblox Players)

Hello! If you don&#39;t play Roblox, download it. Play a game called &quot;Slap Battles&quot;. As soon as it finishes loading, grind for a balloony glove, which costs a lot. If you have it, fly to the portal under the lobby you spawn on. You normally get kicked, but at least you get a badge!

(For Roblox Players)

Hello! Welcome to this region. The official languages are English, Name 0ian, Brazilian, and Hungarian, to honor our former portal leader, Cheeky. Before it became a kickable portal, it used to be an actual portal... no one knows why it disappeared. Cheeky ball would say words, even one Hungarian sentence to convince you. Entering the portal brings you to MUGEN. Sadly it is gone... We learn everything in this portal.
