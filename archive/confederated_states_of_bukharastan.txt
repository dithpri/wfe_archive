Welcome, comrade, to [region]The Confederated States of Bukharastan[/region]! 

The CSB is a small region, with an active, friendly community on our [url=https://discord.gg/5j7jtAF]Discord[/url]. We do have a detailed constitution for those of you who are in to roleplay, but casual players will fit right in too.

We&#39;re open to all political views, communism to capitalism, liberalism to conservatism; and as such you are free to develop your nation however you want while you are here. 

We don&#39;t have all that many rules, because we believe in giving our members freedom. Just use your common sense, and you&#39;ll be fine.

Our WA Delegate is elected by the Politburo, so we require that you endorse the winning candidate; currently [nation]Botschos[/nation].
