A forum based text role play centered around, although not exclusive too, American politics. Players may become a military commander, politician, news anchor, tax avoiding businessman/billionaire, socialite or even the leader of a foreign nation.

We have a certain amount of forums where role play in each state of the United States can take place, with estates, and are always prepared to create more if we do not have a state that is vital for role play (the same applies to foreign nations).
