     The Non-Furry Feline Archipelago is a collection of island nations with relatively liberal ideals that would like to make it abundantly clear that they are not furries and do not condone furry actions. We just like cats people. The Non-Furry Feline Archipelago also wishes to make known that anyone who insinuates that their members are furries is wrong and is not to be trusted.
