[b]After eating some crumpets and drinking some tea, the UKAF and NPA set out in a mad dash to go tag as many regions as they could. Faster and faster they went through many regions. Once they had completed this task, [nation]Nimarya[/nation] rewarded us with some fish and chips. If you also want fish and chips, join either the NPA or UKAF today ~
