The community of [region]Deutschland[/region] refounded in February/March 2013 with friendly support from players from the region [region]10000 Islands[/region] and their organisation TITO. We temporarily moved here during the process. If you are playing NationStates in a founderless region, and are considering the option of refounding, you are welcome to read through the RMB here, which documents the process. If you have questions, you can contact us. Thank you to everyone who contributed!
