[B]A land rife with warfare and turmoil. [/B]Nations rise and fall in Despotania with the change of the seasons. Feuding warlords, manipulative theocrats, benevolent democracies, and imperialist invaders have all called Despotania home at one point or another- endlessly battling for small swaths of land. It was only recently, in comparison to the histories of other nations, that stabilized governments destined to last more than half a year began to establish themselves.
