[B]A land rife with warfare and turmoil. [/B]Nations rise and fall in Despotania with the change of the seasons. Feuding warlords, manipulative theocrats, benevolent democracies, and imperialist invaders have all called Despotania home at one point or another- endlessly battling for small swaths of land. It was only recently, in comparison to the histories of other nations, that stabilized governments destined to last more than half a year began to establish themselves. It remains to be seen if this trend is the future of the region, or just a brief departure before it inevitably succumbs to the void of anarchy once more.
