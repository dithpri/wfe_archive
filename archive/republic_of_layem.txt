[i]Ben appeared out of nowhere holding the flag Souls gave him[/i]

[b][color=#40BF00]&quot;Where is Everybody?&quot; [/color][/b] Ben wondered. Looking around he found the place all a mess from the past inhabitants. [b][color=#40BF00]&quot;Ugh, This place needs a whole lot of cleaning up to do and totally new management&quot;[/color].[/b]

[i]Ben decided to place the flag near a big rock.  Noticing he could scribble something on the big rock, he decided to leave a message for other generations to one day probably stumble upon. Long after Ben was gone.
