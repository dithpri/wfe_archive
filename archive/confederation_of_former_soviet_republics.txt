[b]&quot;The immediate aim of the [color=red]Communists[/color] is the same as that of all the other [color=#DCCF39]proletariat[/color] parties: formation of the [color=#DCCF39]proletariat[/color] into a [color=purple]class[/color], the overthrow of the [color=blue]bourgeois[/color] supremacy, conquest of political [color=green]power[/color] by the [color=#DCCF39]proletariat[/color].

[color=red]Communism[/color] deprives no man of the [color=green]power[/color] to appropriate the products of society; all that is does is to deprive him of the [color=green]power[/color] to subjugate the labor of others by means of such appropriation.

The [color=blue]bourgeois[/color] is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its [color=orange]slave[/color] within his [color=orange]slavery[/color]. Its [color=blue]fall[/color] and the [color=red]victory[/color] of the [color=#DCCF39]proletariat[/color] are equally inevitable.

Let the [color=blue]ruling[/color] [color=purple]classes[/color] tremble at a [color=red]Communistic[/color] revolution. The [color=#DCCF39]proletarians[/color] have nothing to lose but their chains.&quot;[/b]
