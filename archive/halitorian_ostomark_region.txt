A small region established after the fall of a much larger oppressive nation that once controlled this region and much more. The remnants of this once huge nation are fragmented and often hostile to one another as the vestiges of the old corrupt government attempt to collect as much land and power as possible. The Nation of Halitanour however is ruled by separatists from this old government, whilst still corrupt and giving little freedoms to its citizens it seeks to peacefully unite the small region it belongs to. This region shares its currency the Ostomark, While not necessary for joining the region it was implemented to promote trade and unity with the other Nations it has allied with.
