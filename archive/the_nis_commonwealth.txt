Welcome to the NIS Commonwealth!

The NIS Commonwealth, more commonly known as NISC, welcomes all nations, small and large. Our ultimate goal is to represent the people of the land fairly, and this can only be done through the unification of all members. Because of this, we believe that every member has an equal voice, and all are represented fairly in the NISC. 

We are a small region, and therefore a tightly knit community. We welcome all leaders, in the hopes of strengthening alliances and empowering every member nation to a position where all citizens are heard.
