Hello, my dear Slavic comrades.

Let me speak to you from the depths of my heart to the depths of yours. Let me speak to you today, my dear Slavic brothers and sisters. Let me speak to you before it&amp;#39;s late! Our people, our culture our traditions are being destroyed by the evil of American capitalism and imperialism, islamic fundamentalism and terrorism and German Nazism and neo-Nazism. Our glorious race is under a great thread. Those immoral, treacherous rats that want to rape our beautiful women and put them into slavery, those primitives that want to crash our culture, those slimy snakes, lizards, monsters need to be destroyed now. That is why I declare total war on them! Long live the Slavic people and the Slavic homeland!

Ura!
