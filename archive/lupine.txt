Cold and forbidding, this inhospitable region is home to a single nation: Thysa de Nordi Lexica. Known as Lexica to the locals, this small, surprisingly progressive country is economically strong and socially isolated. Due to the fact that a large part of the region is either snowy wasteland or foreboding cliffside, the citizens of Lexica are forced to turn inward for their enjoyment. Hence, education rates are high, and Lexica is home to some of the finest scholars north of El Amora.
