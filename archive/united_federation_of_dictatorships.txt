[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

Oh look at what we have here, some folks over at [region]The Anti Fascism Alliances[/region] are attempting to attack the proud region of [region]J o J[/region], this won&#39;t do. First, they attempted to attack us by refounding a spelling error, then they tried again when they took one of our former resident&#39;s abandoned projects. Both of these are laughable failures of &quot;attacks&quot;, and so now the professionals will get to work. We shall start with TAFA&#39;s history page, and snipe whatever they have left unguarded, and whatever &quot;allies&quot; have CTEd.

[hr]Property of [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation][hr]This concludes the initial strike on TAFA. A nice triple kill for the in-game kill feed. The rest of the regions are trash, so I&#39;ll pass on those. More to come soon![hr]
