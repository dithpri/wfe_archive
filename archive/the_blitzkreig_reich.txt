Anyone is welcome! Rules: no cussing on the RMB, and have fun!

Any former Auralians? As one myself i declare this region an Auralian refuge for those want to get away from Sygian! Even if you like Sygian still come! Once there is a minimum of 25 nations here we will set up the Role Play (RP) system.
