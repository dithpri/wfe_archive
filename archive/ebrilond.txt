A region meant to house my nation, Ebrilond. Ebrilond is a strong central democracy with zero tolerance to leftist politics, such as communism. A Royal Family also exists within the nation, but only holds ceremonial duties. The nation wishes to completely eradicate entities that support themselves as superior beings. The freer the market, the freer the people.
