A region meant to house my nation, Ebrilond. The regional flag which you can see at the corner is more like a screenshot of our Almighty Lord Elyenburgh VI who invented our ideology of bourgeocracy, which supports lower classes and poor people. Everyone matters within our nation and our main goals are to eliminate income inequality. The Royal Family only has ceremonial duties while a stable democracy with a voting system held indestructible exists.
