[color=red][u][b]Welcome, Cursed Wanderer.[/b][/u]

The Infernal Lands are always happy to see new arrivals.

Please, make your stay. If you don&#39;t, either way, you&#39;ll eventually be grasped by the fiery[/color] [color=orange][nation]Jaws of Inferno[/nation].[/color]

All that is necessary, should you choose to stay, is that you change your flag to that which the majority of the other nations are using (just Google &quot;Jolly Roger Flag&quot;), you try to be as authoritarian as possible (which is not a necessity), and you [b]EMBRACE THE HORDE![/b]

[color=red][b]THE JAWS OF INFERNO ARE BITING DOWN! PLEASE, INVITE YOUR FRIENDS AND AID IN THE ATTEMPT AT INFECTING THE WORLD![/b][/color]
