[color=cccccc]Former Founder: Polish Resistance

Former WFE: This region was established for Polish players, but was soon abandoned and left under the guard of a puppet which ceased to exist. It has now been refounded and protected by the Freedom and Justice Alliance in solidarity with all antifascists and antiStalinists to prevent possible fascist occupation.

Continually on and off the map for centuries, Poland is now here to stay!
