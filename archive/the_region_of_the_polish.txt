This region was established for Polish players, but was soon abandoned and left under the guard of a puppet which ceased to exist. It has now been refounded and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b] to prevent possible fascist occupation.

Continually on and off the map for centuries, Poland is now here to stay!
