This is not the original region called &amp;quot;The Feminist Front.&amp;quot; It was originally created by [b][nation]Radscum Hollow[/nation][/b], who lost it because she forgot to log in. (We never actually talked. We wrote her to try to open formal relations. It had only been two days since her last login. Then 26 more days passed, and her nation ceased to exist. [i]Cest la vie.[/i])

But it&amp;#39;s no problem, because [b]the [region]Femdom Empire[/region][/b] has come to the rescue, to refound this region and make sure it isn&amp;#39;t claimed by misogynists.

We&amp;#39;re closed for now due to lack of interest, but if you&amp;#39;d like to join, please contact [nation]Femdom Empire[/nation].

Thank you very much, and Femmepower.
