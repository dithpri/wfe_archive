[b]Congratulations![/b]

[i]The notorious anti-fascist furries in [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], along with their friends in [region]Thaecia[/region] and [region]Antifa[/region] (and a host of other lovely regions), have decided to pay this region a visit! We brought music, drinks and banhammers, requirements for every party. All are required to endorse the delegate and the Regional Officers, or they will be turned away at the door.[/i][hr]
