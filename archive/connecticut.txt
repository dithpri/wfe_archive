Welcome to all natives.  The name &amp;quot;Connecticut&amp;quot; originates from the Mohegan Indian word &amp;quot;Quinnehtukqut&amp;quot; meaning &amp;quot;Long River Place&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Beside the Long Tidal River.&amp;quot;  It was one of the original Thirteen Colonies that overthrew Great Britain in the American Revolution.  The highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain in the northwest corner of the state.  Forests, rivers, lakes, waterfalls and a sandy shore add to the state&amp;#39;s beauty.
