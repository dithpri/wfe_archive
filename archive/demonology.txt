[color=red][b]Captured: 5/30/21[/b][/color]

[color=purple][u]This region was some sort of demonic/satanic region. But guess what makes the capture better. You see, not only did this region belong to Satanic/demonic people, but this region was raided by [region]The Black Riders[/region], a old invading force, [region]Lily[/region], a raider region, [region]Peoples Revolutionary Armed Forces[/region], a communist region, and even by [region]the West Pacific[/region], which makes this capture so good. After all this raiding, they still found time to let it CTE, letting [region]The Holy Christian Empire[/region] conquer it.[/u][/color]
