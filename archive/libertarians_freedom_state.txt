So, you&#39;ve probably gotten a bunch of stuff like this, and I&#39;m telling you, you don&#39;t have to read this even though we want you to. But if you do, here&#39;s what you can have.

(o)voting on regional officers and delegate

(o)it&#39;s all the choice of the people, that means this region can be however you want it to be

(o)not all of our choices are libertarian, so again, more freedom!

(o)we don&#39;t suppress any posts on our Message Board

(o)we don&#39;t eject any residents

(o)we will listen to your thoughts
