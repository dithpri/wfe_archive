The Three Islands is a region that consisted, until recently, of three islands, Grynhilt, Uus and Sond. Grynhilt is a green island, with lush forest and a temperate climate. Uus, while cold and harsh, has recently seen an increase in tourism as the region&amp;#39;s main ski vacation spot. Sond is known for its wide sandy beaches along the rocky outcrops of its saltwater crater lake. Each island is home to several thriving cities, that although united under the High King of Grynhilt, still have a great deal of autonomy.

The Kingdom of Grynhilt was recently joined in the Three Islands region by the [nation]Ormest[/nation].
