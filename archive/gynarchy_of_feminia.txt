For too long have men ruled Earth. Thousands of years of death and decay have plagued society. Wars, famine, poverty, all caused by men vying for power. Women have been oppressed during this period of darkness.

The first steps have been taken to achieve this goal. With women the nobility and men the peasantry and slaves, we will finally achieve utopia.
