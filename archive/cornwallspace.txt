[b][color=#0000FF]Welcome[/color] to beautiful, sunny, Cornwallspace![/b]
Cornwallspace is the fantastical plane of existence in which Cornwallis the Great resideth. Enter this realm at thine own risk.

In the time when the material plane was just new, Cornwallis, the powerful sentient being wandered away from the material world and into the nothingness outside the borders. He then used his powers to create a universe from pure energy. Thus, a new realm of relaxation and purity was born.
He invited only the most pure and trustworthy humans and animals to inhabit Cornwallspace alongside him.
From these people, great nations were born, such as [nation=Bootslandia_the_Great].
