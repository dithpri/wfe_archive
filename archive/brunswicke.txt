[b][i]Welcome to [region]Brunswicke[/region], heroes![/b][/i]

After the death of the King of Armello, the undead attacked this peaceful village, formerly known as Southbank. With his fearsome strength and powerful magic, [nation=short]Brun Oakbreaker[/nation] defended the village successfully. In their gratitude, the villagers renamed their village Brunswicke in his honor and named him their official leader.

Some say though that the spirit of the old King still clings to the land. In a corner of the village&#39;s tavern sits an old fox who claims to be a mystic, her body and face often shrouded by a black cloak. Whichever Clan scores the most points will be able to meet with her and discover the truth about the King, something Brun would be very grateful for.
