Welcome to [color=red]No Commies Allowed[/color]. Where you come here, enjoy yourself, and [b][i]not spread your socialist ideals.[/b] jk[/i]
Any problems you may have encountered, please, talk to our respected founder, [nation]Casinia[/nation]. He can help you out as much as he can.
You can also speak to our WA Delegate, [nation]Huskana[/nation], he can also help out with any known issues. Endorse him, WA members, so that our true words can be spoken out for [color=red]NCA[/color].
If those two are unavailable, you can always talk to our Recruiter, [nation]Triggtopia[/nation], or our Vice Delegates, [nation]Greater Trumpsylvania[/nation] or [nation]Jahn Mayen[/nation]
Other than that, enjoy your stay! And remember the saying to live by, [color=navy]I am not a commie.[/color]
