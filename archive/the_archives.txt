The Archive seeks to back-up and Index Nationstates related data and content, both gameside and offsite. 

Many catastrophes such as the Data loss of the NS Wiki in 2013, as well as the more recent deletion of historical Zetaboard forums which occurred with Tapatalk&#39;s takeover in 2018, have threatened the preservation of over a decade worth of NationStates history. We seek to save it to the best of our abilities, so that the hard work of those of our past, is not forgotten.

Volunteers may begin immediately by using [url=http://web.archive.org/]The Web Archive[/url] to save important pages and content.

More information to come.
