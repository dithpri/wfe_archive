[color=blue][b]Have you ever deleted a dispatch accidentally? Ever had a computer crash and loose loads of work? Some things are so precious that you don&#39;t want to take the risk of loosing them.[/color]
[color=red]My nation will keep backup versions of any dispatch requested. Just telegram International Dispatch Archive the raw code of the dispatch and a copy will be made shortly. The copy can be withdrawn at any time. A small one off fee of 1 upvote for the Information dispatch is required. [/color][/b]
