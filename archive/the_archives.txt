[b][color=#99d6ef][u]Welcome to The Archives![/u][/color][/b]

This region serves as an info centre for our services.
You might be asking what those services are? Well like the name suggests it&#39;s archiving.
We archive [color=#99d6ef][b]regions[/b][/color], [color=#99d6ef][b]factbooks[/b][/color], [color=#99d6ef][b]flags[/b][/color], [color=#99d6ef][b]WFEs[/b][/color], and more!

We also offer anti-CTEing puppets which will sit in a region preventing it from CTEing.
