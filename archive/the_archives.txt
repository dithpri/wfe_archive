Archive stuff,
[B]If/should you wish to archive something, from Factbooks/Dispatches to Regions entirely, please Tg me [nation=noflag]Lorekeeper[/nation]. 
Alternatively, you can come to the [url=https://discord.gg/fsBVxh4gNz]Discord[/url], and [I]ping me![/I]

I will try to make sure it goes smoothly.

Nations are welcome to join The Archives and gain citizenship.[/b]

[U]I apologize, but embassy requests will have to be rejected, with exceptions of archival, due to how the archival process works.[/u]
