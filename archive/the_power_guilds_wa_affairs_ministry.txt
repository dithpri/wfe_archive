[color=#358dc6]Somehow, defying all odds, The Power Gulids managed to pull a sneaky on us and hide the existence of one of their government regions from our sight. Luckily, thanks to RMB searching and terrible opsec from the past, we here at the [region]Wonderbolts[/region] were able to uncover its existence and add another victory to our list of conquests against antifascism!

If you have any tips regarding regions like this that have slipped through the cracks of our intelligence office, feel free to telegram [nation]Newer Lunar[/nation] and we&#39;ll report back as soon as we can![/color]
