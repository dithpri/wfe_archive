The planet of Ejika is a small earthlike world. Some say it&#39;s the twin of Earth. Located in the Ebarido system, it is home to many human polities small and large. At the moment it has a nearly identical technology level as Earth does, although it is a richer planet. Ejika&#39;s only been recolonized once- this time. The world was shaped by the empire that built the lattice cities. The world sits near the outer edge of its habitable zone, a full 0.85 au out. The world was terraformed, as it didn&#39;t have any life at the time, which is why its climates are nearly identical to those of Earth.
