The Leaky Cauldron was a popular wizarding pub and inn located in London. It was the entrance to Diagon Alley and, indirectly, Knockturn Alley. The rear of the pub opened up onto a chilly courtyard that contains the entrance to both alley ways.

The pub was built by Daisy Dodderidge, the first landlady, in the early 1500s &quot;to serve as a gateway between the non-wizarding world and Diagon Alley.&quot; It had a bar, several private parlour rooms, and a large dining room.
