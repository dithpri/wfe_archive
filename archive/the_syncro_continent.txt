[hr][B]The Syncro Continent[/B] (also known as The Syncronian Continent or simply Syncro) is a region built on the concept of regional relationships. It matters little of what happens out of here, unless it involves one of us: what happens on Syncro stays in Syncro.

Founded by [color=#B80000][B]The Republic of The Island of The Roses[/B][/color], the objective of this region is to create a good role-playing experience, free of god-modding, powergaming and so on.

*Well, [i]not anyone[/i]: Fantasy, Satanic, Future Tech and over-all unrealistic nations are not welcome. This is a [i]realistic, modern tech to post-modern tech[/i] roleplay region.
