Welcome to the Brotherhood. This region was originally made to remain small between friends, however I&#39;ve decided to make it open to others. Upon joining, each new nation will be given the ability to choose their own title. Please note that you will only have power over polls, so don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting a bunch of power.

[b]Embassy construction is open![/b] Embassies with smaller regions are [i]preferred[/i], but all are welcome.

RMB is open for discussions, so feel free to post there if you would like. We are striving to be a social region with everyone we meet.

It is requested that you join the WA and endorse our current delegate, [nation]Potatolan[/nation], but it is not required.
