Welcome to the Brotherhood. This region was originally made to remain small between friends, however I&#39;ve decided to make it open to others. Upon joining, each new nation will be given a military title that is solely based on when you joined. Those who join sooner will get higher titles.

[b]Embassy construction is open![/b] Embassies with smaller regions are [i]preferred[/i], but all are welcome.

RMB is open for discussions, so feel free to post there if you would like. We are striving to be a social region with everyone we meet.

It is requested that you join the WA and endorse our current delegate, [nation]Potatolan[/nation], but it is not required.
