Through all of history there have been great rulers: Creaser Augustus, the pharos, the great biblical kings and judges. But why would any population want to be simply ruled over, like a bee hive, or dictatorship? What all people want is someone to lead them.we are united under the proposition of freedom from rule, and freedom to be led. And to choose these leaders and evoke them. Like the American forefathers of the 18th century, we all thirst for freedom from the rulers of the old order. if you wish for freedom and fairness come and be accepted. And always; lead, not rule.
