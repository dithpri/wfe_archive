A branch of Mann co. founded by the scout, who had some spare change. This is a commercialized region owned by former mercenaries, and thus regional decisions are made how said mercs would. Useless promotions and free hats are given to anyone with a good name/personality. In the spirit of Mann co, we sell quantum tape (which is literally impossible to remove), and heated pillows (which catch fire whenever you touch them), along with other useless and deadly products.
