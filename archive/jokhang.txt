The [b]Jokhang[/b] is in Barkhor Square in Lhasa, the capital city of Tibet. For most Tibetans it is the most sacred and important temple in Tibet. Pan-sectarian in some respects, it is administered by the Gelug school. The temple&#39;s architectural style is a mixture of Indian vihara design, Tibetan and Nepalese design.

The temple, considered the &quot;spiritual heart of the city&quot; and the most sacred in Tibet, is at the center of an ancient network of Buddhist temples in Lhasa. It is the focal point of commercial activity in the city, with a maze of streets radiating from it. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
