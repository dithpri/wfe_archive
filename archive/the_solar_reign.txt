Claiming succession to the old Solar Empire, the Solar Reign is the result of the long and bitter learning process, which was the SE&amp;#39;s war against the NLR. Undaunted and well resolved, the Solar Reign aims for several objectives: Peace, both at home and abroad, strength and unity.
Everyone and every-creature is welcomed to follow this our banner, as long as they accept the rule of Princess Celestia.
