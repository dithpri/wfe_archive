The Kerbol United Treaty Organization (KUTO) is a union of individual nations from the entire Kerbol system although mainly for our world, Kerbin, that works simply for diplomacy and statistics, no other advantage. 
Any nation is allowed to sign no matter what ideology, political status, world tension, etc. 
5 major world powers are chosen as leaders and every 5 years there is allowed a redraft, with the exception of if one of the leaders ceases too exist.
