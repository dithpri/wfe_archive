This is (according to Earth), A potentially habitable planet colonized by the Kirbieans, who, before landing here, were wandering the Milky Way Galaxy until the Blues (An alien species that told the US generals not to sign the treaty with the Grays, which they did anyway), invited them to the planet which they colonized. They have good relations with the Blues. (If you want to live on this planet, you have to be friendly to the Blues, who are native here!)
