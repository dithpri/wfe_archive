[strike]Whilst [region]The South Pacific[/region] remains under control of the rogue delegate Milograd all nations ejected and banned from their home are encouraged to seek refuge here. It is imperative that in this time of crisis the community remains together and does not allow itself to be destroyed.
The elected government of [region]The South Pacific[/region] will make regular updates from this region, so as to keep all citizens of TSP informed about the efforts to bring this to an end.
Any nations who have been ejected from our home, but not banned, please return. It is only via active resistance that we can win.[/strike]
