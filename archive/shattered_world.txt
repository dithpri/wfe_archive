Legends tell of a once brilliant and vibrant world, a thriving utopia with limitless resources, but as with all things it came to an end.

After the Great Shattering, the utopian world was broken apart and fragmented. The limitless resources dispersing into vast space, the docile creatures turned into ravaging beasts, and the survivors fought for what was left of the world.

Perhaps due to its broken nature, the Shattered world would often absorb the debri of the void. Every now and then out of the endless void come new visitors. Whether they become inhabitants of the Shattered World, or fall prey to the unforgiving environment, only time will tell.
