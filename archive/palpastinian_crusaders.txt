-Some trees flourish, others die. Some cattle grow strong, others are taken by wolves. Some men are born rich enough and dumb enough to enjoy their lives. Ain&#146;t nothing fair.

-The thing about happiness is that you only know you had it when it&#146;s gone. I mean, you may think to yourself that you&#146;re happy. But you don&#146;t believe it. You focus on the petty bull ****, or the next job, or whatever. It&#146;s only looking back by comparison with what comes after that you understand, that&#146;s what happiness felt like.

-What is better &#150; to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?

-It ain&#146;t no secret I didn&#146;t get these scars falling over in church.
