-If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop diggin&#39;.

-&#147;Love yourself a fire&#148;. It&#39;s one of the blessings; freely given to all. And yet, perhaps, not freely given. I am reminded of Prometheus. In many ways, Greek myths are best in explaining the very punishment that imbue our daily existence with their piquant tortures. Sure, we can have fire. And we can have the knowledge of fire. But with that comes the knowledge of everything&#133; We become like a god, because to be all powerful is to be all suffering. Yes&#133; thus, Prometheus gave us light, and warmth, and eternal damnation, and the awareness of our isolation for everything holy. Quite the conundrum, fire.
