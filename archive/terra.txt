[b]We believe a nation shares common ethnic ancestry, language, traditions, culture, and faith; and through right of jus sanguinis, regardless of a person&#39;s geographic birth by diaspora, they are part of the ethnic nation and must be declared citizens of the nation. 

We believe every nation must have a homeland for their ethnic group to provide protection against colonization, invasion, persecution, or racism, to facilitate the shared national social, and cultural life of a nation and its citizenry to retain its heritage

We refute civic nationalism and view [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=777481]Fundamental National Socialism for All Nations[/url] as the only viable political solution.
