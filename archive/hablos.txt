[region]Hablos[/region] is a region open up to all nations. We welcome everyone regardless of culture and ideology although we do encourage nations to be democratic (we don&#39;t force them to do so though).

It isn&#39;t mandatory to participate in regional affairs but some roles could be given to certain nations (if they want to have them and they show good practices).

We don&#39;t accept puppet nations for the time being.
