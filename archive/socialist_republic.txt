We have returned!  Not one step back!  We are socialist, for Slavic Unity, for a free, greater Palestine, for democratic, autonomous socialism worldwide.  How dare they attempt to delete us when we are innocent.

This is a closed region.  July 9th, 2014 the auspicious date of our return from being unfairly shut down without cause or right.
The free market is a joke, its not what you know but who you know.. proves it wrong.  Let us move to the next stage of history. TODAY!
