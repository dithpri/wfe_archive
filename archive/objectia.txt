A friendly group of allies where the sun is hot, the moon is beautiful, and strange lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep.

Alternately, a group of internet and real-life friends playing a game that might affect them for the worse or for the better. They might even see gray candy corn aliens.

Or a group of friends fighting for survival in a world that wants them dead.

It changes. We do not.
