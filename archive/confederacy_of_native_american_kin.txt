The CNAK is a collection of territories split off from what was once the midwestern United States. It&#39;s purpose, is to reunite the once-great Native American nations that European settlers so horribly treated centuries ago. Though the CNAK is completely open to any form of immigration, it is most specifically advertising of any kind of Native American descendants.
