The Promised Land is the land promised or given by God, according to the Tanakh, to the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob. The promised land was described in terms of the territory from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates river (Exodus 23:31) and was given to their descendants after Moses led the Exodus out of Egypt. (Deuteronomy 1:8)
