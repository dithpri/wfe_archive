The Promised Land is the land promised or given by God, according to the Tanakh, to the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob. The promised land was described in terms of the territory from the River of Egypt to the Euphrates river (Exodus 23:31) and was given to their descendants after Moses led the Exodus out of Egypt. (Deuteronomy 1:8)

The concept of the Promised Land is the central tenet of Zionism, whose discourse suggests that modern Jews descend from the Israelites and Maccabees through which they inherit the right to re-establish their &quot;national homeland&#148;.&#151;Wikipedia[hr]
