Welcome to the Last Strip of BACIN! The Last effort of several &quot;friends&quot; to create a successfully operating democracy. The Chancellor here is elected every month on the second. On the first of the month the World Assembly is elected. The chancellor controls every policy of the federal government. However he is accountable to both the World Assembly Delegate who is elected and the Supreme Court, whose justices are selected by the Chancellor.
