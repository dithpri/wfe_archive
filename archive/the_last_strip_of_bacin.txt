Welcome to the Last Strip of BACIN! The Last effort of several &quot;friends&quot; to create a successfully operating democratic region. In this region, we firmly believe in freedom of speech and in the processes of a federal democracy. The President is elected by the people every month.  Additionally, there is a restraining branch headed by the Chancellor which is also elected.
