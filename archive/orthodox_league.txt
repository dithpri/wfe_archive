In the land of Orthodoxy, faith was the law. It was a world where nations followed their religion with utmost devotion, living their lives in accordance with the teachings of their faith. However, with the rise of new religions, the Orthodox nations felt threatened. They decided to unite under one ruling nation, Partika, to preserve their way of life.

Thus, the Orthodox League was born. It became the bastion of faith, with Partika as its leader. The league enforced strict laws, ensuring that all its member nations followed the same religious practices. They shared a common goal - to keep Orthodoxy alive.
