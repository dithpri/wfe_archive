[u]The West Wing[/u] was a television serial drama which ran from 1999 to 2006. All nations with West Wing characters&amp;#39; names inside of them are invited to join this region. If you want to join this region, but aren&amp;#39;t a West Wing character, all you have to do is create a puppet that is. Here are some of the FUN things we do:

1. Roleplay West Wing episodes (West Wing time is assumed to be thirteen years earlier than real time)
2. CJ Cregg&amp;#39;s daily White House Press Core transcript
3. Regional Government:
[nation=short+noflag]Josiah E Bartlet[/nation]: President
[nation=short+noflag]CJ Cregg[/nation]: Press Secretary
Other positions pending.
