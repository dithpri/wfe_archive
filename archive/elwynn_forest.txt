Elwynn Forest is a vast woodland of stately hardwoods nestled just below the foothills of the Burning Steppes to the north. To the west are the dry prairie fields of Westfall. The idyllic Redridge Mountains lie to the east, and to the south, across the Jerod&#39;s Landing is where Duskwood is located.
