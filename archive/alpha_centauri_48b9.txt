Alpha Centauri 48B9 is an uncharted planet orbiting Alpha Centauri star system. It is a beautiful planet of oceans and jungles and any nation on the planet not abiding by their international law book is immediately sent back to earth via a generation ship. 

Feel free to land your country on one of the islands of our planet and set up shop, however you must respect other nations on the planet and keep your nation naturally beautiful else you&#39;ll be immediately deported back to somewhere where no one will care about you destroying the environment... Like Earth for example.
