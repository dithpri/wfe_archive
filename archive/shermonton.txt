Helloings!
Nationstates has a ton of diffrent Regions. Shermonton is a region with chill communities, role-playing, conversations, etc.! We don&#39;t have that yet, so make it happen! Although, there are exceptions, though. I will not attend on Weekdays (Nambelselzo). My timezone is east Toronto, around Montreal.
You know the rules, no swearing, discrimination, etc. (I will have a factbook posted).

Anyways, Hope you move Shermonton.
-Sincerely Nambelselzo
