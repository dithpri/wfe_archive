[b]Historical Fact:[/b] Dating back to 2010, Comis once achieved statehood within Illuminati under what was then known as the I.S.I.S Empire comprising of the four other states of [region]Illumina[/region], [region]Stonehenge[/region], [region]Imperialism[/region], and [region]Stronghold[/region].  Originally operated by [nation]Amerago[/nation], off and on over the years, the state fell into disuse, before it was eventually forgotten.  More recently Comis fell under occupation, before being liberated by [nation]Abraxim[/nation].  Today, Comis remains the only state restored under Illuminati.
