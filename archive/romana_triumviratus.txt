The Romana Triumviratus is the coalition of states who rule the Greater Latin region, a geopolitical region which spans the distance of Europe, Middle-East, and Saharan Africa. The Triumvirate enforces and creates security among the entirety of the Latin world including the Middle-East and Saharan Africa which has seen no conflict or religious war since being annexed by Roman Legionnaires in a swift campaign in 2020. 

We are solely a Security Coalition and do not impose any economic or social changes on states which join. 

The Capital city of the Coalition is centered in Geneva, Switzerland and the cultural Capital centered in Rome.
