The Tal Shiar is an elite intelligence agency. Its purpose is guarding the security of the alleged regions, both from the natives&#39; foreign enemies - most notably Raiders and Imperialists - as well as from traitors within the native population itself. Dissent and dissatisfaction with the status quo are met with severe punishment. This region acts as a command platform, so, no you cannot join.
