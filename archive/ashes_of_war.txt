[b]The Ashes of War RP region[/b]

The RP takes place in the distant future after a long-forgotten apocalyptic event destroyed the majority of known civilization. Players are encouraged to uncover this mystery, and grow their nations but must compete with other players. Currently, the RP is only focused on North America, and the major powers are: [nation]Neo Sierra[/nation] (The last bastion of America set on the West Coast, but ripe with corruption and instability), and Appalachia (Which is currently in a civil war between the loyalists of [nation]Unified North Appalachia[/nation] and the religious fundamentalists of [nation]New Southern Appalachia[/nation]). Along with these major powers, there are various minor powers set across North America waiting for their chance to pounce.
