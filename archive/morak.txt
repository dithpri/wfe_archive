[b][color=green]Morak was a forested planet inhabited by humans. The planet served as a secret mining hub for the Galactic Empire, which processed rhydonium in a secret refinery. Following the fall of the Empire and the rise of the New Republic, Imperial forces continued to operate on the planet. In 9 ABY, intending to locate the cruiser of Moff Gideon, the Mandalorian Din Djarin and the former Imperial sharpshooter Migs Mayfeld infiltrated the Morak refinery to extract the cruiser&#39;s coordinates from a terminal. In their escape, Mayfeld fired Boba Fett&#39;s cycler rifle at the shipment of rhydonium, setting off an explosion that destroyed the refinery.[/b][/color]
