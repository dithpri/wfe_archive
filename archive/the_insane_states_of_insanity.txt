[color=red]Welcome to the re-reformed [b]Insane States of Insanity.[/b][/color]
[i]Nations are free to come here when ever they want if they are feeling insane.[/i]

This region was reformed after the old regions founder, who was a [b]totalitarian dictator who oppressed the citizens of his region[/b] went inactive. Now the region has been re-founded and has a new set of objectives.

[color=green][b]This region can be used for[/b][/color]
[color=blue]- A launchpad for raiding operations[/color]
[color=yellow]- A puppet storage region[/color]
[color=blue]- A place for you to go insane and spam[/color]
[color=yellow]- A graveyard[/color]
[color=chill]- A place to chill![/color]

Anyone can do these things in this region, which accepts the existence of any nation on NationStates, whether they are involved in gameplay or roleplay, or they just sit in the background for 30 days until they go inactive and die.
