All nations within our region border are hard on crime and have their government expenditure higher on the Law and Order and Defense. The Insane States of Insanity are ruled by one Idealist Nation, the Empire of Hyperboles, and those who betray him will be obliterated. Every nation in the Insane States of Insanity must be eligible to vote for their WA Delegate and therefore must be members of the World Association. We will always look to improve relations with previous nation&amp;#39;s regions.

Our Mottos:

&amp;quot;One must be cruel to be kind.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Through much deliberation and hard delegation, information is obtained.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Only the strong can survive, may the weak be left behind.&amp;quot;

Respect these ideals...
