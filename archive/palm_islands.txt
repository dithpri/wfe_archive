Yes, yes...
The Palm Islands were once a prosperous and promising place, though a nonexistent founder and invaders have triggered the crumbling of a promising region...

Therefore we say respectfully say &amp;#39;Goodbye&amp;#39; to our old friend, and say hello to the [region]Great Paterey Federation[/region].

&amp;quot;I will never forget the sunset in a region which is promising.&amp;quot;
