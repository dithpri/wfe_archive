It was a-nineteen hundred and-a forty-one,
The Airborne Rangers had a-just begun.
Colonel O&#39;Darby was a-mighty brave,
So we buried him in a shallow grave.
I went across the river to a-Italy,
I jumped down and landed on a-Sicily.
I went across the mountains to Corregidor,
I jumped down landed yellin&#39; &quot;gimme some more!&quot;
I went across the water to a-Germany,
We went down through the pages of a-history.
I wanna be an Airborne Ranger,
Live the life of sex and danger.
Airborne Ranger,
Sex and danger...
