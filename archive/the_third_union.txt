A land of bad fansubs and rich memes, the Third Union became a self-governing dominion in 1867, while retaining ties to The Third Worlds. Economically and technologically, the nation has developed in parallel with Grandiose City, its neighbor to the south across the world&#39;s highest quality border. The Third Union faces the political challenges of meeting standards for varying quality improvements in ripping, editing, .veg replacing, and basically everything. The Union also aims to diverse memes and private jokes while maintaining its commitment to the ripping community.
