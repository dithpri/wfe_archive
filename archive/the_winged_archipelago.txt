The Winged Archipelago is an independent group of countries on a circular chain of islands far away from most nations. The climate varies as many of the islands are tropical, with the exception of the cold snowy mountains that form. New islands constantly pop up making this region the perfect place to claim your own non-bordered land ( Unless you share an island. ) Countries in the Winged Archipelago tend to stay out of violent affairs from the outside world. Smaller conflicts within the region rarely happen but nothing major breaks out. The Golden Assembly, a council exclusively for the Winged Archipelago, handles international issues inside and outside the region. With each country in the region having a representative.
