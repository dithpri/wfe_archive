The Consortium, NDAC for short, is a group of minor nations consisting of the rogue NORTHERN DRAENIAN ARCHIPELAGO, which physically broke off from the islands that make up today&#39;s [nation]South Draenia[/nation] a long time ago through a geological act of God and is now far, far away. Freedom is valued here above all.

The NDAC&#39;s legislative wing, the Archipelago Assembly, meets occasionally here.
