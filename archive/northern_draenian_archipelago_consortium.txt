The Consortium, NDAC for short, is a group of minor nations consisting of the rogue [b][color=red]NORTHERN DRAENIAN ARCHIPELAGO[/color][/b], which physically broke off from the islands that make up today&#39;s [b][nation]South Draenia[/nation][/b] a long time ago through a geological act of God and is now far, far away. Freedom is valued here above all. The NDAC&#39;s legislative wing, the Archipelago Assembly, meets occasionally. To this day, [nation=short]South Draenia[/nation] and its lost colony, [b][nation]Brocksland[/nation][/b] have honorary membership.
