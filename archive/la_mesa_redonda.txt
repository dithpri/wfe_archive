[b]I have been the ruler of NationStates for 80 years but never, have I been the ruler of my dreams. I have seen the gates of oblivion, gaping and spewing fire and destruction. I have seen the war machine of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] with my very eyes, but I was powerless to stop it. But you, I have seen you in my dreams, not as my savior, as my demise. You will complete your destiny, and join [region]The Black Hawks[/region].
