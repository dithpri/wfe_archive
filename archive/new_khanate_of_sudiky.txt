[b]| RULE BRITANNIA |

Tonight you have been a willing participant with [region]The Kingdom of Great Britain[/region] in our MARVELOUS journey in conquering all of Britannia!
With the help of our friends in [region]The North Pacific[/region], we planted our flags on your land, threw cookies at you, and sipped tea while heartily laughing!

We sure hope you enjoyed this little visit as much as we did!
