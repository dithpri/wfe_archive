Star Date: 1000 A.B.Y

Greetings Young One

It has been almost a thousand years since the fall of the Galactic Empire and chaos reigns across the galaxy. The once united empire, fractured into numerous regimes, each competing for supremacy. 

In this time of troubles, new leaders and ideas have come to the forefront, aiming to reforge the galaxy in their image. The light side and the dark, struggling once more in their fight for dominion.

By the will of the force, you have been chosen to lead one of the galaxy&#146;s many factions to victory.
Will you choose the path of the light, succumb to the dark or perhaps, forge an entirely new path for yourself?
