Why do we fight? because we are not free. 
Why are we slaves? because we are in chains. 
Why are we in chains? because we let others hold guns.

Death is Communist think of it. Old, young; Healthy, sick; male, female; white, Black. Death dose not care, no matter what you do, how you live. death is all ways there at the end of it all.
