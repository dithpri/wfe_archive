The East European Raiding Company (EERC) is a cyberstate that was founded in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns as a place to coordinate raids and roleplay attacks across different digital platforms. This region represents the official NationStates chapter of this organisation.

While also a place to simply chill and post on the RMB, the main goal of this EERC chapter is to raid opposing regions. The region that is raided is decided by a poll set up by the WA Delegate.
