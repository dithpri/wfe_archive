The year was 1850, mass revolts broke out across Europe. Churches burned down, estates turned to ruin, friend against friend, brother against brother. All moral decency lost. The kings and queens in the region knew they could not stand a chance, so they formed the Imperial Council. The council formed Her Majesty&amp;#39;s Royal Air force, His Majesty&amp;#39;s Navy, and The Imperial Army. This militarily was beyond anything Europe had ever faced. The rebels were crushed and the contentment was brought under the control of the council. Now empires are districts, dukes are mayors, complete armies are working as waiters and editors.
