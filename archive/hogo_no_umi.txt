This region, named Hogo no Umi, consists of 300,000 mostly inhabited islands of varying sizes surrounding the largest, Ichi Taikan. All of the islands and the seas themselves are considered the territory of the Empire of Ichi Taikan. The government utilizes many military outposts to protect the aforementioned islands, which are also home to several residential, commercial, and industrial complexes. Any other nation that enters Hogo no Umi will immediately encounter military force from the Empire of Ichi Taikan.
