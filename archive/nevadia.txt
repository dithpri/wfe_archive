Greetings fellow nations!
Welcome to [region]Nevadia[/region], a democratic frontier ought to give players from every corner a habitate where they can discuss, talk, trade cards or simply play.

#############################################
As protection from raids the government urges any nations deciding to join the WA to immediately endorse our WA-Delegate [nation]Free Coperations[/nation] This measure is necessary to keep us all safe.
However, you are all welcome to join the WA :)

Nevadia shall be a region in which the government serves the players not the opposite.
