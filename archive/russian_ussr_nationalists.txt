[color=red]We are very enthusiastic about RP, if you wish to join in on any of them feel free to do so. We don&amp;#39;t judge you how you RP, just request that you learn from other&amp;#39;s if you are not confident in your own skills. Everyone starts somewhere, why not start here?

You don&amp;#39;t have to be Communist to be here, in fact, if you are Capitalist then you are more then welcome to join, I personally promise you will not be prosecuted for it. I think it would add Character to the RP, so if you are Capitalist, Communist, Fascist, etc. you are Welcome here. [i]Just don&amp;#39;t expect a warm Welcoming from others[/i].[/color]
