The Neutral Zone is an archipelago far out at sea, thousands of miles from the nearest landmass. Nations of the NZ are known to have no strong feelings one way or the other when it comes to pretty much everything, politics included.

The Central Bureaucracy is the governing body of the Neutral Zone.
