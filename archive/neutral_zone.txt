The Neutral Zone is a region tucked away in an ocean in Central NationStates, far, far away from the nearest conflict. If an adventurer did manage to find the location of the NZ they would only be able to see it if they had no strong opinions.

Despite being neutral in the affairs of NationStates, raiding factions have attempted to invade the Neutral Zone numerous times. The NZ has officially defeated the Black Hawks in war and more victories are surely to come.
