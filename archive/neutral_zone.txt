[b][u][i]WELCOME TO THE NEUTRAL ZONE![/i][/u][/b]

The [b]Neutral Zone[/b] is a Christian region without a government-endorsed regional denomination. A wide variety of flavors of the religion are welcome. NZ is opposed to the corruption of Christianity and will not tolerate those who twist and abuse scripture to fit their agenda.

This region is [b]Anti-World Assembly[/b], as that international body is controlled by Satanists and Marxists who seek to murder unborn children in the name of Satan and Karl Marx. All member nations of the World Assembly are deemed complicit in the murder and trafficking of children for Satanic rituals.
