The Kiwi islands are a group of 23 islands in the pacific. They are perfect for farming Kiwis (the fruit and the bird). The islands are a natural oddity because they have everything to the power of 23. For instance, the islands&#39;s number of water sources vary from 23 to 279,841. The biggest island is also 279,841 kilometers big, almost a quarter of the size of greenland.
