Discovered by what was once known as &quot;The ATLISS Corporation&quot; or now known as &quot;ATLISS&quot;, The Range is a planet with an &quot;Asummed&quot; infinite surface area, many laws of physics were broken finding out these claims were true. The Range from ground to satellite observance exhibits all known types of Biomes, elements, and some earth-homed fauna/flora. This range is seen as a place for anyone to call home as it can hold/support an infinite population, it also can wreak havoc on the international economies as the presence of infinite resources could send inflation rates higher than ever before seen possible. Depending on your view this could be bad business, or the start of a new era of civilation~
