[b]Brought to you by [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their friends from the [color=130a65]Autumnal Court[/color] of [region]Caer Sidi[/region]!

Some friends set out on a moonlit night,
To make sure the reindeer were tucked in tight. 
No snow nor clouds could get in their way, 
as they rode on their magic sleigh, 
To make sure all was good and well,
So Christmas would just be swell.[/i]
