We flew to these lands on giant Gandalf eagles, but unfortunately the caught the flu and died, so could not take us back. Now we are trapped on these Islands, trying to keep ourselves alive. The fire in our hearts was ignited with the deaths of our beloved friends, and out of the embers, a single Hobbit rose; his name Bilbo. He urged the people the fight the evil forces blah blah blah dark riders. Bam modern world it&#39;s okay we are still terrible also no jesus for you because bilbo liked jesus.
