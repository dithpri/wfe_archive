This region welcomes any nation who share the the same values. We are socially conservative and protect the right of free speech. We are a politically 
socialist region and even support communist nations as well. But we do not ban religion in any way. Moreover we thrive to give every citizens the chance to succeed. We also thrive for equality but also recognize the biological differences between man and woman. We are against and ban any social political activism like LGBT and Feminism for we value the sanity of our citizens and do not want to see our youth be indoctrinated through propaganda leading to the destruction of society. Finally human rights is out number one priority, no matter what race or religion those communities represent.
