None

The first roleplay is going to start when we are ready.

If you want to be part of the RP you can tell me where your country should settle in.
Example:
Nation - Bolmen Empire
I want to settle on the south of the island.

I will hopefully update the map as soon as possible if a submission is readied in this forum.
