[b][region]Northern Arctic[/region] ecozone covers 1.5 million square kilometres, or about one seventh of our [region]Anglo Celtic Isles[/region] colony of Canada. It is the coldest and driest part of the country where winter nights last for days or even months, and average annual temperature is as low as -3&ordm;C. Permafrost is present everywhere in this ecozone and can extend downwards for over a kilometre.
