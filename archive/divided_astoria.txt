The continent of Astoria was settled by a variety of Europan powers in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Those colonies were largely consolidated under Betonian control by 1750 and by 1800 they had gained their independence.

Factionalism and regionalism prevented a union of the newly independent colonies but several thriving states have established themselves and enjoy a peace that, while not without tensions, has seen no major armed conflicts since the 19th century.

The major players are [nation]Astoria[/nation], [nation]Freeholders[/nation] (whose official title is the Confederate States of Astoria), and [nation]Rocky Mountain States[/nation].

Several minor states also exist: Texas, California, and Columbia.
