&quot;The Coatlition of Nations Against the Children of Xerxes&quot; This is a region for the nations against the insidious Cult known as the &quot;Children of Xerxes&quot;, a &quot;religion&quot; which worships a type of Crab or Crab-like gods. All those who wish to either fight against their faith, or defend their own, I encourage you to join. All religions are welcome here, as long as you wish to crush these Heathens. This Holy War will be won, and we shall celebrate with many a feast of all kinds of crustaceans!
