Our region is a co-operative alliance between Marxist-Leninist states. We reject liberalism, and actively fight imperialism. By banding together small socialist states, we can stop the imperialists from robbing the people of their wealth and resources. We actively reject classic liberalism and fascism in all forms, and will unite against them. As such, all nations within the bloc must uphold the tenets of Marxist-Leninism or be forced out of our protection. Free trade and private property are tools of capital and are to be abolished and rejected.
