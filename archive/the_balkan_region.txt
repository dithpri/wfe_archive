[centre]THE BALKAN FEDERAL COLLECTIVIST STATES[/centre]

Following a recent coup from the [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], a new state has emerged in the Balkans; one known as the BFCS (Balkan Federal Collectivist States). The BFCS also has begun a large-scale militarization effort, in order to prevent others from being able to fight against our region. The BFCS is also incredibly unstable, due to the eternal presence of Ethno-nationalism. Nothing is certain about the BFCS&#146;s future, but one thing is true: there is no hope under the Grey Moon.
