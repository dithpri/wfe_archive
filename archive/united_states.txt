Welcome to United States, a fair and balanced region where all opinions are tolerated as long as you follow the rules.  Immigrants are welcome although they must behave themselves.  Do unto others and we will get along great.  Free pie is available at the Welcome Desk and our bathrooms are clean and cool.
