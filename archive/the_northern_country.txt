Welcome one and all! To The Northern Country!

This region is all about Elections, Role play, and just having a lot of fun!

You can communicate with friends on the RMB. This is also where role play will take place.
We will hold elections for the offices of WA Delegate, President, and Ambassador every two weeks.
The Northern Country is a diplomatic and well organized region, and I hope you enjoy your time here in the Northern Country!
