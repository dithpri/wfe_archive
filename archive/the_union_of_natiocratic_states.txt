Natiocracy is a regime of national rule in one&#39;s own state, exercised through the power of all socially useful strata united in professional and class organisations.

This political doctrine was developed by Colonel Mykola Stsiborsky of the Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic Army in the 1930s. It became the official ideology of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) after the Second Grand Assembly in 1939.&nbsp;
