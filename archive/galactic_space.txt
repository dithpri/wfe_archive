galactic space is a place where worlds are connected.
if you would like to add a galactic link propose an embassy!
of course there are things that you have to understand. [b]your region has to be from another planet. or another universe. you get it[/b]
if that is [color=red]false[/color] then we are forced to [color=red]deny your entry[/color]
if this is [color=green]true[/color] then we will [color=green]happily accept you![/color]


- extra info -
this is a link in space. the delegate has no reason to have power. so they don&#39;t
if you want to moderate the link just ask. 
there are two types of positions. 
[color=purple]multi mods:[/color] they inspect multiple links
[color=violet]link mods:[/color] there job is to inspect one link.
there are reasons why we would [color=red]cut a link[/color]
that can be because: [color=red]the region is toxic, it has a provable bad reputation, etc[/color]
