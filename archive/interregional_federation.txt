[color=Indigo][b]Hello ma bois! 
The IRF is back open for the bidness.
Anyone who wants to join, can. Though parties are allowed, they are condemned.
May all nations be united under the indigo nation.
No regional government has been set yet, but it shall never fall into a fascist/dictatorial state. Democracy, Representative Ruplic, and &quot;Controlled Anarchy&quot; are the current options for government.
Fascists will be considered terrorists.
SUPPRESSION OF ANY POSTS IS ILLEGAL. PEOPLE GUILTY OF THIS CRIME WILL BE JUGDED BY THE FOUNDER.
