[b]The Interregional Federation, or IRF for short, is a neutral, safe region for any nation* (see bottom for details).
If you plan on committing a crime, I would suggest you first look over the judicial system** (see bottom for details). This region may soon merge with [region=Axolotlum], [region=High Quality], and / or [region=The Second Ridge of Badgers].

*An exception regarding those who wish to spread fascism, who will be considered terrorists. Anybody who actively tries to harm the prosperity of the region or destroy the views of this region are automatically put into this group.
**Regarding those who are of the aforementioned group: You, as a terrorist will not have any trial be held until such laws change.
