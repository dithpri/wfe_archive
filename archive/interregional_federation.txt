[color=Purple][b]Hello ma bois! 
The IRF is back open for da bidness.
Anyone who wants to join, can. Though parties are allowed, they are condemned.
May all nations be united under the [/color][color=indigo]indigo region.[/color][color=purple]
Only WA nations can hold offices (with the exception of polls).
No regional government has been set yet, but it shall never fall into a fascist/dictatorial state. Democracy, Representative Republic, and &quot;Controlled Anarchy&quot; are the current options for government.
Fascists will be considered terrorists.
SUPPRESSION OF ANY POSTS IS ILLEGAL.
