[color=Black]The Interregional Federation is a welcoming region. When people start moving in, a constitution will be formed and it will become a democracy made up of people from multiple regions. The region&#39;s color is [/color][color=Indigo]Deep Indigo[/color].
[color=black]This is an open region that anyone is welcome to join. 
[hr][/color][color=Indigo]For now, elections will be the first Wednesday of every month
[hr][/color][color=Darkgreen]Talk to [nation=Jowowwo] or [nation=Militarization Inc] for any information needed. If you want an office you must first run it by the current Delegate and then the Founder. We do this to ensure the safety of our region.
