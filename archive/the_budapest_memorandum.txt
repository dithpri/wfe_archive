Under [region]The Budapest Memorandum[/region], Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. pledged to &#147;respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.&#148; The memo reaffirmed their obligation to &#147;refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.&#148; The signatories also reaffirmed their commitment to &#147;seek immediate&#148; UN Security Council action &#147;to provide assistance to Ukraine &#133; if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression.&#148; These assurances upheld obligations contained in the U.N. charter and the [b]1975 Helsinki Final Act[/b].

Ukraine, in turn, gave up the nuclear weapons within its borders, sending them to Russia for dismantling.
