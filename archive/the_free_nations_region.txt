The Free Nations Region is a region that welcomes all Nations. Our Founder and Executive Officer is Crystalsummer. There is plenty of room and opportunities here as we continue to grow, we will create more offices. Some rules before you join 
1. We encourage people to debate and have fun but there will be no abusive language allowed or against anyone.
2. It is recommended that you join the WA but we don&#39;t enforce it but we do follow the WA rules.
3. You can only hold one office at the time.
That&#39;s it with the rules have fun and enjoy the region. We have several embassies coming along and several opportunities.
