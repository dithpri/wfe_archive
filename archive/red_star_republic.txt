The [region]Red Star Republic[/region] is a collection of leftists who believe that [b][i]NationStates[/i][/b] should be free of capitalism and fascism. We welcome all those who wish the same. [color=red]Many leftist regions out there have active raiding/defending operations. I hope that this region will be used as a jump/move point in those operations.[/color] If you are a member of the World Assembly, I ([nation=short]Oburon[/nation]) encourage you to endorse [nation=short]TrotskyFever[/nation]. Don&amp;#39;t feel any pressure, though.
