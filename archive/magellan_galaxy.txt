Welcome to the Magellan Galaxy!

Magellan Galaxy is very far from where many nations are. We are 17 million light years away from Earth, so not many people visit this place very often right? Yes. It would be very nice for you to stay and keep company. Dont worry, we have hotel spaceships you can stay on!
