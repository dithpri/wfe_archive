A message from the WA Delegate:
[i]&#148;When I came to the GOC, I came because it was an active community. Everyone here gave it the spark that made the GOC what it was. My eyes were opened to ideas and values I didn&#146;t think people had. There was debates, Roleplay, and general communication. I made friends here. Even though I don&#146;t know what they look or sound like, where they live, and who they are, I am proud to call them friends. But natural selection, if you will, has decided our time was up. It was a massive 117 days guys, and I hope you all find a new, greater purpose.&#148;[/i] - [nation=long]vipru[/nation]
