The Atlantis is a secret area that has been recently rediscovered and is ready to be settled. We welcome all nations that are friendly and would like to help out their fellow members. We do not have any requirements to join our hidden corner of the world at this time. You are free to run your country as you feel that it should be ran. If you would like, you can join The World Assembly. At this time we do not have a Delegate, but I would like to get that changed as soon as possible.  

Thank you, 
Emperor Charlie
The Empire of Tigville
