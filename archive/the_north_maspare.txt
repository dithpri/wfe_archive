The North Maspare is a peninsula mainly consisting of small dictatorships.
The only democratic country in the North Maspare to this date is the Republic of Genubria. The North Maspare has a relatively cold climate, and the most northern parts of the peninsula lies within the northern pole circle. The typical Masparian has got a broad chin, blue eyes, and practically any hair colour. Masparians enjoy a game of friendly ice hockey, but the rivaling countries Krakobranzka and Rley has become such deep enemies that they are on the brink of a war.
