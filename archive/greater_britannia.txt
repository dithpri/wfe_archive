Greater Britannia wishes all nations to enjoy their life in our glorious, beautiful island, and good luck on your conquests!

~Britannia Rules the Waves~
BRITONS WILL NEVER BE SLAVES!

A small but growing region, and we hope our fellow Britons can help us expand the empire out from our Island, across the waves, throughout the world, and into space!
