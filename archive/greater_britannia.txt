The original region by this name CTEd. I was worried the Greater German Reich would refound it and, as they often do, write a bunch of bull in the WFE about how they conquered it.
Well not on this Jew&amp;#39;s watch, so I refounded it myself to prevent those goose-stepping... [i]dudes[/i]... from doing so.

(And I want to state for the record that I notified numerous British-themed regions about this, and one even got back to me and said they would do the refounding, and I even waited two hours after the original region CTEd for them to do so, but they totally flaked, so I had to do it myself.
Well, like it says somewhere in the Talmud, &amp;quot;If not me, who? If not now, when? If not here, where?&amp;quot; So here we are.)
