Today&#146;s Gospel presents us with the healing of a leper (cf. Mk 1:40-45). To the sick man, who implores Him, Jesus answers: &#147;I will; be clean!&#148; (v. 41). He utters a very simple phrase, which He immediately puts into practice. Indeed, &#147;immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean&#148; (v. 42). This is Jesus&#146; style with those who suffer: few words, and concrete deeds.
