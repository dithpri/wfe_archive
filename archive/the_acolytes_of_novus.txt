This region is made by newbies, for newbies. This region is controlled by a Governing Council. Governors are appointed for one month by executive decision of the Chairman of the Council. The Governing Council may appoint other officers to help support the operation of the region. The Council Chairman, who also serves as our World Assembly Delegate, is democratically elected and has the responsibility of exercising the authority vested in the Council.
