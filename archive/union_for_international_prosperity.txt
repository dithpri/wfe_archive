[region]Union for International Prosperity[/region]

[b]Welcome to the UIP[/b] - Union for International Prosperity! We welcome [i]democratic[/i] and [i]authoritarian[/i] (not totalitarian) states alike, both [i]left[/i] and [i]right-leaning[/i], in our fight against radicalism and totalitarianism. Our goal is mutual assistance between member states, and a constant fight against radical anarchists, communists, and even national-socialists. Make the world a safer place! I am refounding this region after a long time. I had this region on an old account. So what are you waiting for? 
[b]Join now, and together we will build a brighter future![/b]
