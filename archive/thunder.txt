&amp;quot;Among ordinary people, there is now a pervasive sense that politics can no longer make a difference in their lives, as reflected in common perceptions of deadlock, incompetence and corruption among what seems an increasingly self-contained and self-serving political class, united in their claim that &#145;there is no alternative&#146; to them and their policies. One result is declining electoral turnout combined with high voter volatility, producing ever greater electoral fragmentation, due to the rise of &#145;populist&#146; protest parties, and pervasive government instability.&amp;quot; - Wolfgang Streeck
