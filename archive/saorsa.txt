&amp;quot;government is best which governs least&amp;quot;-Henry David Thoreau

This region promotes the simple ideology that self reliance and responsibility are the pinnacle of success and that individual freedoms should be in the forefront of the minds of it&amp;#39;s leaders. Such was the philosophy of the founding fathers of the US as well as many revolutionary thinkers in the Transcendental era. These great minds discovered the truth that government, as an institution would inherently be corrupt and that a proper system of checks and balances is essential to the preservation of social and economic freedoms. We propose a modest government that relies on a laissez-faire system of economics and a democratic approach to social issues.
