[color=red]Welcome all to the Empire!  A proud region is fit for anyone!  A forum will be up and running soon (if this interests anyone).  If anyone is interested in any seats of the government please send me a TG or state it on the message board.  The seat of Vice Emperor will be handed to the WA Delagate.  A set of rules and the powers of each seat will also soon be up.  Other then that please make yourself comfortable enjoy the stuffed mice and sherbert![/color]
