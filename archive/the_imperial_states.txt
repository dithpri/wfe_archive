[color=blue][b]Welcome to the Imperial States[/b][/color] This is a place where all people can chill, have fun, discuss views, [b][color=blue] and grow community.[/color][/b]

[b]We include all people of all walks of life[/b]. Whether you be [b]ejected/ banned from a region[/b], or if you are just bored and want a [b][color=violet]good time[/color][/b], this is the place for you. We like to think of ourselves as a [color=grey]neutral region[/color] but we will [color=blue]defend regions[/color] to spread  freedom and liberation or [color=red]invade regions[/color] to hold off a belligerent region attacking weaker regions- the best defence is a good offence.
