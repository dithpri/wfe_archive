Well it&#39;s been a fun year guys. We showed the RIA that we can make a living empire. We had some [color=gold]GOLDEN DAYS[/color] and we had some DARK DAYS. Some of us left to create their own region and some stayed. Thank you to Max Barry for this game. Special thanks to [nation=short]Shizensky[/nation], [nation=short]Timwopo[/nation], [nation=short]The United Philippine Empire[/nation] and all Imperial Citizens for making this enjoyable.
