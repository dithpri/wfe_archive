Welcome to the [b][color=blue]Imperial League of Nations[/color][/b],

As a subregion of [region]The Grand Imperial Alliance[/region], the Imperial League of Nations is an international alliance dedicated and designed to build peace and prosperity between nations. ILN members have no legal obligation one to another, but instead are united by language, history and culture, and their shared values of [b][color=blue]democracy[/color][/b], [b][color=blue]human rights[/color][/b] and the [b][color=blue]rule of law[/color][/b]. 

These values are enshrined in the [b][color=blue]Treaty of Nations[/color][/b] and promoted by the [b][color=blue]Goodwill Games[/color][/b]. The ILN is strictly realism-based (earth and human-like), and realistic modern-tech roleplaying but aims to provide opportunities for new and established members alike.
