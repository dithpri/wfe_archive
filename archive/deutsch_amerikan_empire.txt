In 1943 the Nazi Empire (NSDAP) reached Moscow and London, ending the war in Europe. In North America, the group known as the American Nationalist Party staged a coup and with massive public support, succeeded. The former United States was renamed to &quot;Deutsche-Amerika&quot; and allied with the NSDAP in Europe.

Since 1943 &quot;Deutsche-Amerika&quot; has annexed all of Canada, and most of Mexico and Cuba. Our nation is by far the biggest in North America, and the most powerful.
