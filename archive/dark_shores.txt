&quot;Creating&#151;that is the great salvation from suffering, and life&#39;s alleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much transformation.&quot;
- Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra

This is my land, my rules, my happines and my suffering! No Gods and no rulers for me! I am a furious wolf and a loner. Indeed, i am the creator of my own values!
