[b]The Region of Uniting Conquerors is a region that intends to control as many small regions as possible through the use of infiltration (raiding comes later, when we actually have the size) and unite them all for the benefit of all of them. To control these after taking them over, usually a WA member of this region is given control of the conquered region. It does not intend to destroy regions, but help them.
