We&amp;#39;ve gone though much. SPIN was the beginning, the middle and now the end. 

What is left is the true tomodachi&amp;#39;s, the ones that really stuck together. 

Perhaps someday, there will be more.

We sign this pact, to re-create our fallen region. 

With a fresh start and open heart, we have begun a new page in our history.
