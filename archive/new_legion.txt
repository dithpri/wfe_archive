Welcome to New Legion, a Roman-inspired region, with a strong government, and an even stronger people.
Here you can choose your own story, you can be a firm believer in the Baloominati, a powerful politician, or perhaps even a slave. Join one of our RPs, or if none of them interest you, make your own, the possibilities are endless, if you want them to be.

&#147;Fight with honour, or fight against it.&#148;
