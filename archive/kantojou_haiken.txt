Never come back, Black Hawks. I&#39;m in control, and I&#39;m stealing your flag as punishment! If any other raider regions even [b][i]dare[/i][/b] follow in their footsteps, I [i]will[/i] be taking immediate action, and I will steal your flag as punishment.

[b]Anyway, with [i]that[/i] out of the way...[/b] This is a crossover region, combining Pokemon, Zelda, Touhou, Len&#39;en, Kemono Friends and Azur Lane.
