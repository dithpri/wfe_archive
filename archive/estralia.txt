Founded in the recent years Estralia, once Cridasia, was a war torn land that has seen a large number of casualties. Once a communist state, the Democratic rebels lost many for the freedoms they wished for. Hatred for the name spoken in the land, they decided it was time for a fresh start. New land means new problems, but with help, a small group in the area of Estranica,many others have joined into Estralia with helps to build the beautiful nation back to the formal glory it held so long ago. Peaceful in nature, they seem like a country of small weak armies, they are known for there loyalties of the army. Not afraid to attack when pushed,but tend to find ways to keep things calm and free. Glory to Estralia!
