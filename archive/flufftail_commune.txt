Welcome to [region]Flufftail Commune[/region]
A warm, fluffy region built by and for dog girls, comrades, and friends of all stripes. This is a peaceful, left-leaning space where softness and solidarity go paw-in-paw.

We believe in:  
&#151; Worker cooperatives and direct democracy  
&#151; Universal floofcare (fur, healthcare... same thing here)  
&#151; Trans joy, queer safety, and neurodivergent inclusion  
&#151; No landlords, no masters &#151; just cuddly autonomy
