[b]Welcome to [region]Flufftail Commune[/region]![/b]
A warm, fluffy region built by and for dog girls, comrades, and friends of all stripes. This is a peaceful, left-leaning space where softness and solidarity go paw-in-paw.

We believe in:
&amp;#9733; Worker cooperatives and direct democracy  
&amp;#9733; Universal floofcare (fur, healthcare... same thing here)  
&amp;#9733; Trans joy, queer safety, and neurodivergent inclusion  
&amp;#9733; No landlords, no masters &#150; just cuddly autonomy
