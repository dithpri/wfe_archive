The [b][i]Imperial Federation RP[/i][/b] is a region simply dedicated to the votes of both members and non-members (we understand other nations want to have their own region dedications) molding the way the [i]Britannian Imperial Federation[/i] is shaped through the course of history, beginning in the [i]1970 Cold War Era[/i]. You [b]DO NOT[/b] have to join this region to participate in the polls, discussions, and so on! We encourage you, even if you do not plan to stay in the region, to come and participate in these activities to further the history of the [i]Imperial Federation[/i] timeline, and furthermore the new world!
