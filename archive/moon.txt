[b]December 1st, 2022. On this date in history the black hawks successfully pulled off our greatest scheme yet, with the help of our friends in [region]Lone Wolves United[/region], [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region], [region]The Communist Bloc[/region], [region]Osiris[/region], [region]Islamic States[/region], and [region]Hartfelden[/region], [region]Lily[/region], as well as a little help from some yellow alien things, we successfully stole the moon! 

It was a tough battle, and many soldiers were banjected to ensure it would happen, but after weeks of fighting, we did it. It shall remain as a trophy sitting on our desk until it reverts back to its original size.[/b]
