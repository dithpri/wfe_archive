The Republic of Ezo (&amp;#34662;&amp;#22839;&amp;#20849;&amp;#21644;&amp;#22283;, Ezo Ky&amp;#333;wakoku) was a short-lived separatist state established in 1869 on the island of Ezo, now Hokkaido, by a part of the former military of the Tokugawa shogunate at the end of the Bakumatsu period in Japan. It was the first government to attempt to institute democracy in Japan, though voting was allowed only to the samurai caste. The Republic of Ezo existed for five months before being annexed by the newly established Empire of Japan.
