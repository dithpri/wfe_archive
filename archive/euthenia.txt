Welcome to Euthenia. We are a neutral region which are all controlled by one nation, New Euthenia.

[b][color=green] All these nations are controlled by New Euthenia. If you have an issue with them, then please don&amp;#39;t hesitate telling me, New Euthenia. [/b][/color]

The region might become founderless. If it became founderless, then that&amp;#39;s because New Euthenia moved to a new region. If the region becomes founderless, then there will be no more passwords. Why am I saying this? Because I, New Euthenia, might want to join regions that aren&amp;#39;t dull and boring just like this.
