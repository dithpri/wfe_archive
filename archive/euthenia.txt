Welcome to Euthenia. We are a neutral region which are all controlled by one nation, New Euthenia.

[b][color=green] The region is only reserved for [nation]New Euthenia[/nation],[nation]the Second Euthenian Republic[/nation] and [nation]Euthenesian Republic[/nation]. [/b][/color]

[color=green][i][b][u] STOP SENDING RECRUITMENT TELEGRAMS TO US, PLEASE! OUR COUNTRIES ARE ALL RUN BY NEW EUTHENIA!!! [/u][/b][/i][/color]

The region might become founderless. If it became founderless, then that&amp;#39;s because New Euthenia moved to a new region. If the region becomes founderless, then there will be no more passwords. Why am I saying this? Because I, New Euthenia, might want to join regions that aren&amp;#39;t dull and boring just like this.
