Orrin&amp;#39;terath was originally settled by ten very different nations that have decided to work together in their own separate ways. Some are more serious, while others are seen as wayward jokes. Newcomers to the continent are placed on small islands while the ten founder nations determine what is to become of them.
The continent has roughly 2.5 million square miles, and is divided into territories: The Northern Reaches, Palivarth Island, The Midland, and Umbraxon.
