A political region established by the Great Celestian Monarchy in order to grow the power of totalitarian states and simultaneously increase the influence of Great Celestia&#39;s ruler. Refuses contact with all states that do not have similar politics. Despite being referred to as Empire(s) plural the political region is actually just a single empire in which the founder/emperor along with their government have supreme authority. The Empire of Misery does not devolve any power to its provinces although member states can govern themselves freely. The Empire does allow &quot;sub-empires&quot; to exist within it hence why it is referred to as the Almighty Empires. Its government isn&#39;t elected, rather it is chosen entirely by Celestia.
