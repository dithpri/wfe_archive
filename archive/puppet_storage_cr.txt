Puppet storage for my puppets, the Canadian Republics.

I want to give a little back story though:

Back a while, I just made one nation, the Canadian RepublicS of Natives. I uppercased the S in Republics to emphasize it. So, this made people believe that I had multiple friends/puppets for the nation, and I didn&amp;#39;t. So a month later I decided to make all these puppets. The one I used to found this region was made later on, in a Region-wide war. 

You now have knowledge of why I have this region, and why I have so many puppets.
