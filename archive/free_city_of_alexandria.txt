[i]I cried out:
&#147;Anyone who hears,
Rise up from your deep sleep!&#148;

And the sleeping one awoke and wept
Wiping bitter tears saying
&#147;Who calls me?&#148;
&#147;Where has my hope come from
As I lie in the depths of this prison?&#148;

&#147;I am the Providence of pure light,&#148; I replied,
&#147;I am the thought of the Virgin Spirit
Raising you up to an honored place.
Rise up!
Remember what you have heard.
Trace back your roots
To me.
The merciful one.
Guard against the poverty demons.
Guard against the chaos demons.
Guard against all who would bind you.
Awaken!
Stay awake!
Rise out of the depths of the underworld![/i]
