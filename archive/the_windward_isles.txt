[color=blue]The Windward Isles is a developing but promising region that is open to any and all new nations! We are welcoming and (mostly) friendly. We encourage potential RP, but it is not the focus of the region. There is a regional constitution being developed that will ensure equal contribution and equal rights for all nations involved. There is also a regional map and regional government in place! [/color]
