Veism is a very ancient faith, first revealed in the darkest days of humanity by the Prophet of the Most High, the honourable Eyur.

This region serves as a monument to the Veist Faith, and the Veist ethic of the Seven Honours:
    1.  Honour the LORD your God, for They created you 
    2.  Honour other people, for they are all your family 
    3.  Honour the Creation, for it is a delicate treasure 
    4.  Honour Knowledge and Wisdom, for they have been revealed to us for our benefit 
    5.  Honour Truth, do not deceive others for personal gain 
    6.  Honour Yourselves, for you are of the lineage of the Most High 
    7.  Honour Justice, in all that you do
