[i]We are a group of nations with varying interests and agendas, though we all seem to be Left-Leaning College States at heart. No matter what your interests are, whether they be political satire, roleplaying, or laid-back slacking, we don&amp;#39;t have it (unless it&amp;#39;s slacking). The most notable feature of the plains is the giant pile of paperwork, which we assure you has absolutely nothing under it. We welcome you and all your people to the Plains of Karim. [/i]
