People of the the BRA live freely and decide what they want to do, unless an executive or voted laws prohibits them. The IFGU can order raids on other regions, but that will not happen very much. The BRA has a regional constitution commanding the nation participants to have a large military and lead with an iron fist, but in all honesty that is just a recommendation.
