Hey you!

Yea you! 

This is our recruitment message. ()

But since we don&#39;t have &quot;stamps&quot; we will have to do it this way. If you are a raider... COME RAID US. 

We don&#39;t have a WA delegate, and I promise not to kick out ANYBODY. If you become WA delegate, I give you power to border control, executive, the WHOLE BONANZA. EVERYTHING!!!

And if you are just a nation looking for a quiet region to settle down in, THIS IS THE REGION YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. 

I just ask that you dont kick out Scotty Dog Hills, or PuffinPiper. 

Join our region. There isn&#39;t even a password
