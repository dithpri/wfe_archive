Gastonia is an economy based nation bent on creating the perfect utopia for everyone. Gastonia was founded and named by King Gaston I of Former-France in 13c, during the Middle Ages. Based on the wealthy capital fort constructed entirely of Cobblestone, Gastonia is a recreation of it&amp;#39;s famous history. Most of our major buildings are almost entirely constructed of Cobblestone in dedication. Our mission statement is to be all that we can be and create a perfect world of Cobblestone for all to enjoy.
