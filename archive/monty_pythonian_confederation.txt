Welcome to The Monty Pythonian Silly Confederation
&quot;Well, it&#39;s nothing very special. Try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations&quot;

We are a welcoming confederation of nations, allowing any nation willing to be jovial and respectful. Any kind of nation can join, even if you don&#39;t like Monty Python or are themed in any way towards Monty Python. Please be respectful of other nations, but rude jokes are allowed. There is no historical background because that would be too silly.

If you have a problem seek one of the members of the region with authority.
