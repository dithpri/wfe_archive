[color=red]The Russian Revolution of 1917 began in the city which was then named St. Petersburg with the storming of the Winter Palace, and the city was renamed Petrograd, and after Lenin&amp;#39;s death in 1924 was renamed Leningrad.

When the Nazis invaded the USSR in 1941, Leningrad and it&amp;#39;s inhabitants endured the longest siege in history lasting 871 days before victory.

The Nazi region &amp;#39;[region]The Greater German Reich[/region]&amp;#39;, glorified that siege in this region, insulting the memory of lives lost, thanks to[/color] [color=green]Tosev 5[/color] aka [color=red][nation=short]Pandemicia[/nation] of the United Defenders League, who refounded the region on the behalf of the GGR, which explains alot about the UDL.

[b][region]Leningrad[/region] has been liberated by [u][region]The Red Fleet[/region][/u] and is again dedicated to the lives lost in the siege of Leningrad.[/b][/color]
