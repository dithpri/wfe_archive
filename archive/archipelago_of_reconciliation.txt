An alliance of nations who were once at war with each other. The seas around the islands have been disputed for the past 3 centuries, and now finally peace has been achieved and the violence and ended. We currently do not accept in new nations, a state that may or may not change in the future. Anyone attempting to break the peace is subject to be kicked out of this alliance. Be reminded that no embassies will be established unless at a time of conflict, we are a neutral region.
