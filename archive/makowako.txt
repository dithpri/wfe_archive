Welcome to Makowako! We&#39;re a brand new region planning to have both a casual and serious experience.
The region is themed around Hawaiian culture and pirates, and we plan to host political debates where anyone can express their views
on certain topics, such as controversial topics like Democrat vs Republican.

We also plan to host game nights every sunday.
The game nights will be mostly at midnight to and more late hours.
