&amp;#127796;[b][color=blue]Aloha! Say hello to [region]Makowako[/region]![/color]&amp;#127796;
[color=black][i]03/28/2021[/i][/color][/b]

Welcome to Makowako! We&#39;re a brand new region planning to have both a casual and serious experience.
The region is themed around Pirates, and we plan to host political debates where anyone can express their views
on certain topics, such as controversial topics like Democrat vs Republican.

Makowako was founded by Huri in the aftermath of various events that happened in their past region.
Please endorse our WA delegate [nation]Kyuna Oka[/nation]!
