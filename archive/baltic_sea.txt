[color=003366]The [b]Baltic Sea[/b] is a mediterranean sea located between Central and Northern Europe. It is bounded by the Swedish part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, the mainland of Europe, and the Danish islands. It drains into the Kattegat by way of the &Oslash;resund, the Great Belt and the Little Belt. 

The Baltic Sea is connected by artificial waterways to the White Sea via the White Sea Canal, and to the German Bight of the North Sea via the Kiel Canal. The central part, also called the Baltic Proper, is bordered on its northern edge by the Gulf of Bothnia, on its northeastern edge by the Gulf of Finland, and on its eastern edge by the Gulf of Riga.[/color] [color=666666]&#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
