Baltic Sea, German Ostsee, Swedish &Ouml;stersj&ouml;n, Russian Baltiyskoye More, Finnish It&auml;meri, Polish Morze Ba&amp;amp;#322;tyckie: Arm of the North Atlantic Ocean, extending northward from the latitude of southern Denmark almost to the Arctic Circle and separating the Scandinavian Peninsula from the rest of continental Europe. The largest expanse of brackish water in the world, the semi-enclosed and relatively shallow Baltic Sea is of great interest to scientists, while to historians it represents the economic core of the Hanseatic League, the great medieval trading group of northern European ports. The many names for the sea attest to its strategic position as a meeting place of many countries. --Encyclopedia Britannica
