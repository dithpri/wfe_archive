The region of Astalan an Elya is a greenland-sized continent, covered in pine-tree forests and heavy snow during winter. In the north and center several chains of mountains cut through the land. The region was uninhabited before the colonisation of the Kingdom of [nation]Ahswar[/nation]. Ruins still dot the forests, as remnants from a long bygone civilisation. The untamed wildernis over Astalan an Elya lures brave adventurers into the depths of the forests, where roam the Shadow Stags and the occasional dragon. Astalan an Elya is one of the few places where magic is still strong, and it plays a big role in the lives of the Elyians.
