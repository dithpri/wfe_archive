No one can reach the continent Antichtone itself, which lies beyond Antarctica/Pacific Ocean; any ship or airplane will reach the aether screen and will go around this landmass, without realizing it; the same thing will happen close to the North Pole, at a certain latitutde (the expeditions of Peary/Cook). Antarctica is actually Atlantis, the island-continent. Admiral R. Byrd discovered that Antarctica has lakes, forests, hills covered with vegetation far inland.
