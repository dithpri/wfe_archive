Welcome, fellow war junkies,  to your new regional home! This is a region mostly used for the nations that believe war, power, and alliances are the key to survival . But, we do accept people who think outside of this eccentric lifestyle, should they want to join. We ask that if you are currently a member of the World Assembly that you [u]endorse our WA Delegates.[/u] Thanks for choosing us, and we know you will enjoy your stay with us as [b][region]The Iron Fist of SJR[/region][/b]

[color=orange]To join this great region, contact [nation]Xethia[/nation], Founder, or [nation]Samidommialand[/nation], WA Delegate via Telegram[/color]
[color=red]No Members of [region]The Peacemakers of SJR[/region] are allowed because they are a crude and frankly cheap throw off of us.[/color]
