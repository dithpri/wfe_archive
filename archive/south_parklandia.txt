A land of creeks, streams, wave pools and dog parks; the region of South Parklandia is bordered by the rival region of Bethel Parklandia to the west, the hill people of Pleasant and Jefferson to the east, and the mysterious region of Baldwinnia to the north. South Parklandia has recently divided into a land of many territories, each with it&#39;s own government, population, and sovereignty. Will these new nations cooperate for the betterment of the entire region? Or will they oppose each other, and fight for control and dominance of each other?
