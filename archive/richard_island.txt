[b] Ehhh... what a mess. PEOPLE OF RICHARD ISLAND. Dominion of Jacland has officially moved to [region]Nelborne Union[/region] and we request that all Richard Island nations migrate to this new one![/b]

I apologize for no discussion or warning. That was dumb of me. Anyway, we want you guys to migrate there. There are a couple reasons why we have chosen to make a new name for us.
