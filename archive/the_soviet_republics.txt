Welcome to the mighty Soviet Republics! Our nation has been through strife, fear, and oppression for years. Through a mighty revolution started by our glorious leader, Tovarish Stalin, our mighty region began. Once we were free from the evils of the monarchy that led us we began to pursue stronger interests. Our united region is expanding at a rapid pace and will one day be feared and respected across all boards. We are dedicated to the spread of our ideals, releasing the workers of the world from the capitalist oppression that runs rampant throughout the world. May we all dedicate our time, our passion, and our people to the mighty cause of Communism.
