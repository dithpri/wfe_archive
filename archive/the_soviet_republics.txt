Welcome to the mighty Soviet Republics! The Republics are a region based entirely in the lands of the USSR, and any potential land they may have gained in the time period of 1939-1955. The Region is centralized under the authority of Mikhail Stalin, with each nation given control primarily over how they deal with inter-nation trading within the region. Officers are appointed to oversee these nations.
