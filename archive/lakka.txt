Located in the far north and partially within the arctic circle, the region of Lakka has sat for centuries.  In the days of old many of the early clan were warlike and from these places many viking ships raided neighboring regions.  While other tribes prefered the seclusion which was provided by the vast subarctic wilderness.  Through the centuries alliances, and eventually nations were formed.  Now those days are long gone and in more recent times these diverse northerly nations have come together to create a relatively stable and productive region, renowned for its extraordinary natural beauty.
