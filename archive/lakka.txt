Located in the far north and partially within the arctic circle, the region of Lakka has sat for centuries.  In days of old many of the early clans within the region were warlike and from these places many raiding ships carried warriors which pillaged places in neighboring regions.  While other tribes prefered the seclusion and peace which was provided by the vast subarctic wilderness, choosing instead cultures centured around family and hearth.  Through the centuries alliances, kingdoms and eventually nations were formed.  Now those days are long gone and in more recent times these diverse northerly nations have come together to create a relatively stable and productive region, renowned for its extraordinary natural beauty.
