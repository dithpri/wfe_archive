Welcome to glorious [region]Nordic Skyrim[/region], home of the Nords and many other races. We welcome you to our region, and hope you have a few spare Septims for some great Nordic Ale! We do not accept embassies without telegramming the founder. Please be considerate of this region. Also you must worship Talos and the 9 Divines. Thank you!
