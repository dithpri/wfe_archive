hello and welcome to the communist commune, the most communist of all the communes! there are many places to start your nation here. from the crater plains, where if are lucky you may see pieces of Mir and sputnik burning up in the atmosphere. or in the desolate tundra next to the gorgeous vodka falls. and best of all every Saturday is karaoke night! so come to the commune where its party time all the time! (or at least between the strict curfew hours)
p.s these are not my actual views on communism. i am a member of the cpusa. (communist party of the USA)
p.p.s in soviet Russia nationstates plays you!
