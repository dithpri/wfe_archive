12/20/17 --  While our Illustrious Founder was busy with matters philosophical, intellectual, and meditative, those of us who must deal with the nuts and bolts of regional affairs have been setting up shop under the benevolent gaze of His Radiance.

Please endorse our candidate for WA Delegate:  The People&#39;s Republic of Jabberwocky.

We welcome those of any and all philosophies. Ours is a peaceful region; we&#39;re far too tiny to be aggressive anyway.  We need people to help us develop the technical stuff: RP, maps, forum. WE NEED RESIDENT NATIONS. Imagine your swift rise to power.
