A united federation of similar thinking Nations. Founded in 2029 after Russian forces were pushed out of Europe. In the void left by the Russians many micro nations and city-states arose but none lasted, so to try and create lasting peace the U.N. officially recognized the eight largest (even if one was the puppet if another) to establish borders. Now the year is 2045, four of the eight founding nation have fallen and tensions are high, as a new &quot;Legion of Nations&quot; arises people can only hope for the best. Two new nations have joined the Federation from the remains of the Swiss Alps as a sign of peace in a broken world.
