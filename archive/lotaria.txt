A government as spread evenly as the blades of a lotus flower. 
A Security Blade, to keep us safe: Border Control and Communications. 
A World Assembly Blade, to keep us involved: World Assembly and Communications 
A World Relations Blade, to keep us connected with other nations: Embassies, Appearance, and Communications
A Public Relations Blade, to keep you informed and active: Polls and Communications
And a founder, to act as a stem.
The goal is to run so perfectly together, that the stem is hardly needed. Are you down for the task?

Next Goal:
Design a New Flag
