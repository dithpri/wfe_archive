[b][color=red]Welcome to North Laurentia![/color]

Located in vast regions of North Laurentia (Present Day North America). From the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, to the beaches of the West Coast, or the icy tundras of British-Columbia. We may be culturally and locationally different, but our region pulls all of us together.

We introduce new ways of living, new religious beliefs and the blessing of living in such a vastly different region. We welcome our neighbors with a cup of coffee and the breathtaking views of the alpine vistas or the gorgeous sandy beaches. North Laurentia allows people with diverse culture, beliefs and ideas to live peacefully among others. Civil Rights, Equality, and Political Freedom and very much valued.[/b]
