Not fond of the whole corrupt region idea?

South Riddle is based upon this idea. We believe in freedom, peace, and acceptance. We do not just tolerate differences, we accept them. We are not known for just one religion, sexual orientation, belief, or anything else specific. We do believe the world is too corrupt, if you hold these same beliefs, you may have just found your new home. This is a free independent region based upon freedom and happiness. Now to join, is your choice.
