The Leap Year Straits was created in antiquity and, for a peculiar reason, only on the 29 February does the rocks that conceal it form small gaps to allow tiny canoes in. This time, we have gained the rocks&#39; trust and are now the guardians of the strait, so that the rocks do not need to conceal it any further. Every leap year, we thank the rocks for this wonderful strategic location that we can now use as a jump point.
