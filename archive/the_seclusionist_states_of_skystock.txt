We are Skystock. Tired of being oppressed by the United States Union, we set off into the sky to create a more perfect union to express our own beliefs as we see fit. We consist of the provinces that have been annexed into Skystock and flown up into the sky with us. Father Skalmstock has led us to a better life and future, where we can practice and express ourselves as we see fit, as long it&#39;s regulated by the guard and Father Skolmstock. We must not break the commandments by which Fathers Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin set forth for us. Long live Skystock!
