The Region of Erden, is a vast, lush awe inspiring place, much coveted by foreigners, traders and explorers alike,
Since the days of old the roots of the people who inhabit this bountiful Garden of Eden have held strong, whatever disaster or dismay might occur:
currently the Region is controlled by two primary powers; the Praetoria and Hussaeria these two Regional Powers extend far and wide, with many different peoples under their banner.
However times are uncertain and a storm could be brewing to wreak havoc on the lands of Erden, as it once was in the days of old;
Wars, Dismay and terror could reign true again, 
Welcome to Erden, Welcome to your Destiny.
