The Harrowstorm Monarchy is the collection of lordships, fiefs and holdings held by House Harrowstorm and ruled by Lord Tytos Harrowstorm. The Monarchy and its lands and assets exist only to further the Harrowstorm Family, politically, economically and defensively, with House Harrowstorm existing only to maintain, protect and ensure the prosperity of it&amp;#39;s lands and family, the House and the Lands being mutually reliant on each other for survival and advancement.
