Welcome to the Mountain Sea Parallel, a land of peaceful nations that lie nestled between pristine blue sea and brilliant silver mountains. We are a people of equality and union, working together as one power to defend our beautiful region. Once a place of neutrality, we have since taken a peaceful stance against all raiders, particularly the black riders. Due to a few rude nations, any nation who wishes to join, telegram either Westerbush or Hevic. Enjoy your stay!
