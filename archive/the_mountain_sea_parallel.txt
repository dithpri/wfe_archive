Welcome to the peaceful land we call home. The Mountain Sea Parallel is a unique, safe, cheerful place, unknown to the terrible plague that is war. We stand proud, between brilliant silver mountains and endless turquoise sea, and delegates meet regularly from each nation, preserving unity in a world torn apart by death. We stand firm in our ground against all raiders, and as such no raiders, now or ever, are allowed entry into our region. The region promotes a common currency of the Paralex, and every nation abides by our laws and stands proud with our anthem. Any nation who wishes to become a member can simply message our founder or delegate for access. Welcome, and enjoy your stay!
