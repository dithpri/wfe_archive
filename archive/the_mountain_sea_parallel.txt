Welcome, friends, to The Mountain Sea Parallel. We encourage you to admire our stunning views of both mountains and the deep turquoise sea, which just so happen to run parallel to each other. In the land between you will find peaceful nations of all shapes and sizes, coexisting in friendly ways. Please no attacking or using profanity of any sort, and enjoy your stay!
