[b][color=scarlet]This region is now under the control of an original governing member.[/color]

Originally a new and rising region allied with The Eternal Knights (TEK), the founder was soon declared &quot;Delete On Sight&quot;, granting the WA Delegate power. The WA Delegate led a revolution against the region&#39;s original government, allying with The Association of Imperialism (AOI) during TEK&#39;s and AOI&#39;s ongoing cold war. The revolution was won with the support of AoI by three endorsements, ending both the cold war conflict and the revolution.

Later, the revolution left to a new region, leaving this one to die, thinking it was long forgotten.[/b]
