1. Under my delegacy the natives will be safe and allowed to stay if they so choose.
2. Religion is very subjective so it is ok to disagree, but blatant disrespect for the Christians here or Christianity in general will not be tolerated.
3. The regional government of The Christian Republic will be given the password to this region.
4. The regional government of The Christian Republic may also give the password to people they trust.
