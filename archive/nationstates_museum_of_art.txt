[color=#b80000]Grand art based puppet collection for when NS Cards S3 is finally released on the 12th of March 2022. Now you can say to your friends that you own the Mona Lisa, The Starry Night, The worlds most expensive sculptures, The lost works of dozens of great artists and so much more. The collection will be constantly growing until i get bored of NationStates and or the site limits me from making any more puppets.
