Macaronesia (Portuguese: Macaron&eacute;sia, Spanish: Macaronesia) is a collection of four volcanic archipelagos in the North Atlantic Ocean, off the coasts of the continents of Africa and Europe. Each archipelago is made up of a number of Atlantic oceanic islands, which are formed by seamounts on the ocean floor whose peaks have risen above the ocean&#39;s surface.
