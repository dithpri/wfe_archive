The Tyrian sea is a large body of water surrounded by continents and filled with archipelagos. This region is intended for RP with a tech level of more or less modern-day. The Tyrian Sea is understood to be at some indeterminate point in the real world. Nations here can communicate with real life nations if they have the means for long range communications, but having a large impact outside the Tyrian Sea is not the point. For this reason, countries set in the same places as real life ones must adopt a new position for RP here. Other nations will not get involved in the Tyrian Sea, but RP can include commentary or diplomatic visits from them.
