[b][color=#000061]Welcome to [region=The Smoking Section]! This used to be an outpost of [region=The Black Riders] before they collapsed. It was a gift from Raideron, and used to be the Engine behind all tag raiding operations before [region]Nugut[/region] came along. Riders came and went. Beyond, they fought. Now, they all rest in peace.

Home of Raideron. May Raideron be with you![/color]
