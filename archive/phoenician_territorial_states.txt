The PTS is a society consisting of the allies/vassal states of the Rep. Of Phoenicia.
The group is open to all, *but they must comply with regional laws of the ROP.
The ROP itself is not responsible for the content of this group, as that is given to another department, being the Phoenician Department of Public Affairs, which is a third-party menifesto state inside the ROP. [b] Remember: group is open to all*[/b]

This group itself acts as sort of a secondary WA, except more exclusive to the nations tied to the ROP. Tied meaning relevant and or allied. Requests for changes, wether in the laws or interactions, etc. can be discussed in the board, but recommended over Telegrams.
