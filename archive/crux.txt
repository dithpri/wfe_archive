[b]Crux[/b] is a constellation located in the southern sky in a bright portion of the Milky Way. It is among the most easily distinguished constellations, as none of its four main stars has an apparent visual magnitude greater than +2.8, even though it is the smallest of all 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for cross, and it is dominated by a cross-shaped or kite-like asterism that is commonly known as the Southern Cross. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
