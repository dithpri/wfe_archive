[b]Welcome Home.[/b] We&#39;ve been waiting for you. 
The forces of the Architect have called upon you!
Don&#39;t worry, the Architect has called upon all of us.
We know, you desire something more... real.
The world seems so boring, so dull, I know!
But now you are home, just where you need to be 
to change the world, and change all destiny.
