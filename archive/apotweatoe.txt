APOTWEATOE: A Piece Of The World Exercising Allodial Title On Everything.

Everyone is entitled to an Allodial Title on anything they own unless it is part of essential public interest to the Region.

Items of public interest to the Region include such things as public buildings and public transport and public justice enforcement.

Allodial items include your land and your property and of course your possesions, all of which require proof you own it be that through purchase or transfer from a previous owner.

All Nations in this region must accept this.
