Since the creation of fire and mankind&#39;s first roasts, humans have worked to improve upon what they eat. In this region, every nation strives for the best cooking (food quality) and to make the region the culinary center of the world, no matter how libertarian or authoritarian the governments are. Good food brings people together and warms the soul, even if it&#39;s in a prison holding people for wearing the color pink.
