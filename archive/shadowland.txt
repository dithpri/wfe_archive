Shadowland is a region where leaders are unafraid to step up and take control! Sure, it&#39;s true that some black market activity is quite common. Oh, and many positions of power within our region are psychologically unstable and morally troubled. Don&#39;t let that bother you! Here in Shadowland, we value roleplay very much. Enjoy plotting ways to micromanage your nations and discuss real events in NationStates!

Although Shadowland is meant for somewhat evil nations to join, we do NOT seek to raid or offend any other regions. We do not look for any outside trouble whatsoever.
