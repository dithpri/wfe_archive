[b][color=darkblue]Perfect![/color]

Your friends from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] came to your region to help some new hawkies discover their wings! Your region made a nice spot for them to aim for and they hit it perfectly! The observing hawks became very, very, very happy seeing the young hawkies find their wings
