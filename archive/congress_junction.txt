Congress Junction is currently the largest space station in our section of the Milky Way galaxy, near the Gas-giant Saturn. It is a meeting place for these respective powers: The Cornian Legion, Pine Forests, Nerving, and N.O.F.
It is a place of peace, and not one of war. Battles shall be held elsewhere. The station is open for: Messages of Diplomacy, Lawmaking, Messages of War, and Trade. 
This region was created to keep law in the solar-system after the disbandment of Kornlund Dominica, an interplanetary warband.

Durch den Beitritt dieser Region, das schw&ouml;re ich meine Loyalit&auml;t zu Supreme Nation Cornfeeld und acknowledge, dass ich mein Versprechen nicht zur&uuml;cknehmen kann.
