[b]Welcome to [region]The League of Based Nations[/region]. The League was founded March 11, 2020. All of our nations are based.[/b]

[b][u]If you are just joining us...[/u][/b]
* Make sure you are apart of the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly.[/url]
* Once you have joined the World Assembly, you can [b]endorse[/b] someone in the region.

[b][i]What&#39;s endorsing?[/b][/i]
* Endorsing is basically your vote to who you think should be the [b]delegate to the World Assembly[/b]. You get one endorsement.
* The current World Assembly delegate is [nation]Maesgwyn[/nation], and has been doing a great job.

[i][b]What now?[/i][/b]
* Talk on the forums, vote on any polls, or comeback later once you have more issues to grow your nation. It&#39;s up to you.
