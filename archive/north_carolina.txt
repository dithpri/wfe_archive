[b]Welcome to the Old North State![/b]

[i]Carolina! Carolina! Heaven&amp;#39;s blessings attend her! 
While we live we will cherish, protect and defend her; 
Tho&amp;#39; the scorner may sneer at and witlings defame her, 
Still our hearts swell with gladness whenever we name her. 
Hurrah! Hurrah! The Old North State forever! 
Hurrah! Hurrah! The good Old North State![/i]
