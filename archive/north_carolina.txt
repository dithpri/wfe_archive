The region for the residents of North Carolina interested in casually playing NationStates.

The North Carolina Toast:

Here&amp;#39;s to the land of the long leaf pine,
The summer land where the sun doth shine,
Where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great,
Here&amp;#39;s to &amp;quot;Down Home,&amp;quot; the Old North State!
