[u]Original use[/u]
In 1855, the term &quot;Unholy Alliance&quot; was used for Western European alliances with the Ottoman Empire against the interests of Russia, Greece, and most of the Balkans. It was an ironic reference to the original Holy Alliance created after the Napoleonic War in 1815 by Tsar Alexander I of Russia.
