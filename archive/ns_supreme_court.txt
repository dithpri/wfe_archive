The application process is simple. Send [nation]Chief Justice Elmander[/nation] a telegram, stating the issue. We will then decide whether or not the case is [i]Criminal[/i] or [i]Personal[/i]

Criminal cases will be the more important cases. Charges will be brought against the accused, and unlimited witnesses called from either side. Sentances are severe.

Personal cases will allow a maximum of 2 witnesses from each side, and will only use the Chief Justice. Lesser sentances will occur, and cases are usually solved within 24 hours.
