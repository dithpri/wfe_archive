The application process is simple. Send Chief justice elmander a telegram, stating the issue. We will then decide whether or not the case is Criminal or Personal

Criminal cases will be the more important cases. Charges will be brought against the accused, and unlimited witnesses called from either side. Sentances are severe.

Personal cases will allow a maximum of 2 witnesses from each side, and will only use the Chief Justice. Lesser sentances will occur, and cases are usually solved within 24 hours.
