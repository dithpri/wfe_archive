The rolling green hills stretch out before you, the wind whispering through the untouched grass makes the land seem to dance. In the distance, [nation=noflag]A Herd of Cows[/nation] wanders by. One of their number looks up at you as they meander on, it makes eye contact, it blinks its warm honey-gold eyes and lets out a low moo before lowering its head down to graze some more.

These are the greener pastures; a paradise for all who would find peace.
