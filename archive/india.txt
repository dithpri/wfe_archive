[color=orange]Founded on January 24th 2011, India is a region born to cater to primarily South Asian players on NationStates. However, in India we follow the policy of &#39;Atithi Devo Bhava&#39;, and hence we welcome players from around the globe. Our aim is to provide a platform to South Asian players to progress in this game.[/color]

We welcome each and every nation to [region]India[/region]. Come and join us in this beautiful journey!

[color=maroon]From the tea gardens of Assam to beaches of Kerala, we have a diverse range of nations which mirror the rich cultural diversity of India. As they say, [region]India[/region] is a perfect example of unity in diversity.[/color]
