[color=red]The Union of Soviet Socialist Nations is the Communist movement that states that all nations and all peoples are equal and every man may find work and be paid according to their work. The USSN stands up against taxing the poor more than taxing the rich, and is against heavy tax cuts based on charitable donation. Join the Worker&amp;#39;s Paradise and become a free people today.

The people produce, the people fight, the people deserve more. Those people loyal to the Motherland are the most valuable assets. Any man who fights against the Motherland is a fool. A man reaps what he sows, he deserves a price to all of his actions.

Every man is equal. Every man must work. Every man must fight. Every man must be free.[/color]
