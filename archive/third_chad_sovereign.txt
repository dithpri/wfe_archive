[b]MESSAGE FROM THE CARTAGROPHER[/b]

Welcome all to the Third Chad Sovereign! Unfortunately, due to a loss of interest of our players in our current RP, we were forced to end it at the RP year of 1897. The RP began in 1890 and, despite running three RP months to one IRL day, was quite a while. It was a great run, but allas, all things come to an end.
