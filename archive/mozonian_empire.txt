Located in the largely in the Pacific and Caribbean the Mozonian Empire is made up largely of occupied islands rather than large tracts of continental land. The Mozonian Empire owns many islands around the globe giving the easy trade access to all six major continents. Not all islands are integrated as some remain independent but are vassals under Mozonian rule, but they have access to all the same rights as a Mozonian state holds and maintains the right to have their own government.
