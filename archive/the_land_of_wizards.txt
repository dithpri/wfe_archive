This is The Land of Wizards.  Where everyone is powerful.  There shall be no discrimination here, but we shall have gentle debates.  As this is still a forming region we are not very developed.  But that shall change as time passes.

Starting debates will include:
Who will the delegate be?
Will the delegate have regional control?
What next?

So don&amp;#39;t miss out on that.

That is all for now... Enjoy!
