The Northern Regions of Tamriel is password locked but anyone who wishes to join needs to only send a request to the WA Delegate and the password will be given to you. After a new nation joins the password will be changed. This is to prevent raids. In this way we consider ourselves a public region. Also when you join the region please endorse our real nigga [nation]Astamen[/nation]
