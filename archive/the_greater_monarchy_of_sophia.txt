The Greater Monarchy of Sophia is a region founded by Harrian and it&amp;#39;s rightful King (me). It employs a system in which the current Monarch is voted in as opposed to gaining power through being of Royal blood. We are both capitalist and communist, but are, however, anti-fascist - so Nazi&amp;#39;s beware!
We are a miniscule region currently consisting of just a few nations. If you want to join us, find the button somewhere... I&amp;#39;m not actually sure where it is.

Thank you, and farewell,
- The High King of Harrian and Ruler of the GMS.
