Welcome to the [b][region]St Abbaddon[/region][/b] WA Office, this region exists solely so I can put up &quot;How should I vote?&quot; polls without using up the poll space in St Abbaddon if there are other polls going on there. 

[color=crimson][b]Votes by WA nations outside of St Abbaddon will be discarded. [/b][/color]

Feel free to discuss WA legislation on this RMB. Posting is open to all nations in St Abbaddon, the region&#39;s password is &quot;WA&quot; (no quotation marks), and is on the region only to prevent accidental moves when people in [b][region]St Abbaddon[/region][/b] proper view this page.
