After the fall of Ballstopia from Denouttish isolation and the collapse of the Greater Mizdonian Co-Prosperity Sphere from the end of the Mauvais dynasty, the people of the region were confused and left to self-governance. They longed for the &quot;good old days&quot; of Dennoutish-Mizdonian cooperation and mutual benefit. Their calls were answered with the election of a new Dennoutish emperor and the return of order in Mizdonia. A formal alliance was then declared by ambassadors from the Denouttish and Mizdonian states. Hand in hand, they venture forth into the future in hopes of returning to their former glories.
