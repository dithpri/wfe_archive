[colour=#42bff4]The International Government for Aviation (IGA) is a World Assembly recognised international government, established to help countries, airlines and other groups of the NationStates community share their skies to their mutual benefit. Normal countries, aviation authorities, corporations and others from the NationStates community who share an interest in aviation are welcomed to join. The IGA is essentially the United Nations, but for airlines and the aviation sector.[/colour]
