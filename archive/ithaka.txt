Keep Ithaka always in your mind.
Arriving there is what you&#146;re destined for.
But don&#146;t hurry the journey at all.
Better if it lasts for years,
so you&#146;re old by the time you reach the island,
wealthy with all you&#146;ve gained on the way,
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.
Without her you wouldn&#39;t have set out.
She has nothing left to give you now.

And if you find her poor, Ithaka won&#146;t have fooled you.
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,
you&#146;ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.
