welcome

[b][color=1199FF]A Turanic Fascist Region. We are a Khaganate under [nation]Nordic Peoples Reich[/nation]. Siberia is the ancestral homeland of all the Ural-Altaic people. We are a great warrior race who once struck fear into the hearts of all &quot;civilized&quot; peoples who opposed us - from the Romans and Byzantines in the West to the Chinese in the East. Now, the time has come for us to rise again.

We are Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, Shinto, Taoist, and Tengrist - but we all share the same core values.[/color][/b]

[b][color=EE2400]No recruiters, embassy collectors, Communists, or ANTIFA. Marxism is the great enemy of the Turanic people.

We stand against the communist Chinese genocide in East Turkestan.[/color][/b]
