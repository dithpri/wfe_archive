Welcome to Nightvale 

All hail the Glow Cloud! ...Excuse me, I don&amp;#39;t remember what happened there. 

Loyalty to Nightvale is mandatory upon residence, as decreed by the City Council, as is loyalty to the City Council, as decreed by the City Council. Join us as we screech together in unison the facts, and more importantly, our government mandated beliefs. 

So gather around your blood-stone circle and prepare for infection from the sheriff&amp;#39;s secret policy. Failure to comply might result in an unscheduled visit from the hooded figures. 

Goodnight Nightvale, Goodnight.
