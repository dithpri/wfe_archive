A region oft described as a &amp;#39;Strange Place for Strange People&amp;#39; by its enemies.
We know who these enemies are, and can assure you they are lying. You can tell a lot about people by using spy cameras and a team of agents to investigate every private facet of their life, so we know these things.

Our Regional motto: &amp;quot;Today is a new day. Tomorrow is a used and refurbished day. Then two more new days. Then an antique day that we must treat very gently.&amp;quot;
