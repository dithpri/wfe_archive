Welcome to Albino Smurfs! Being a Smurf with Albinism is not required for entry. We are a democratic region with a functioning government that will hold elections for WA Delegate and Grand High Minister (because Prime Minister is too mainstream) every 2 months. The first elections will be held when the region reaches a population of 10 active nations.[i] ENDORSMENT OF THE CURRENT DELEGATE IS[b] MANDATORY [/b]FOR ALL WA MEMBER NATIONS TO PREVENT INVASION.[/i] We are an open-minded region that accepts people of all political viewpoints and we value debate. Have fun!
