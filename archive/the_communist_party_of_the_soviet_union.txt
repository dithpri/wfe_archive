This region has been conquered by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of Anti-Stalinism. This region will now serve as a memorial for all Soviet citizens murdered under the brutal dictatorship of Joseph Stalin.


The regional-password protection has been lifted and is open to all Anti-Stalinists everywhere. Communists that are against genocide are allowed in but we ask that all stalinists refrain from entering.
