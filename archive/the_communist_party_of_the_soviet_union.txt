This region will serve as a memorial for all citizens of the world killed under Joseph Stalin&amp;#39;s brutal and totalitarian regime. Out of respect to victims, we will allow communists but stalinists will be banned from entering the region

The WA Delegate is trusted with adminstrative powers but if there are any attempted raids on the region by stalinists or other enemies then administrative powers will be revoked.
