The Union was founded on March 31, 2017 in the wake of the impending nuclear disaster caused by the &quot;Nuclear Scoreboard.&quot; For maximum safety and deterrence, Alexander Tee (the 39th President of Corono66) signed an executive order releasing Coronot66 from the GGMA (Good Good Mines Alliance) as it failed to appropriately create and design a nuclear deterrence commission in a reasonable amount of time.  The Union is dedicated to protecting liberty, democracy, and freedom from tyrannic oppression. The Union&#39;s primary goal is to protect member nations from oppression from nuclear armed nations and regions.
