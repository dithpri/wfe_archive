The Empire of Sawstovakia was once a vast and massive empire, but in the 1960s and 1970s, it slowly began to release its colonies under the rules of the World Organization Committee.

It does however continue to hold its small yet vital colonies like Sawstovakian Indochina and Sawstovakian Guinea.

Password is Sawstovakia if you decide to make a colony and want to RP (I guess) Also, I may not be very active so try to join while you can.
