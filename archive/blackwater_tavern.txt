Welcome to Blackwater Tavern, founded in 2011 (approx) by [nation=short]Savaer[/nation]. It served as a meeting place for raiders after the downfall of [region=The Old Raiding Club]. It has been quiet for a long time, but is now reopening under the management of [nation=short]Kshrlmnt[/nation]. Embassies will be created primarily with raider regions; if you wish to construct one, please contact [nation=short]Kshrlmnt[/nation] with your raiding credentials.

While Blackwater Tavern is under construction, drinks will be provided courtesy of [region]The Bar on the Corner of Every Region[/region].
