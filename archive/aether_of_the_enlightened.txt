The Aether is a place for those who seek progress and enlightenment.
The people of this land live their lives to the fullest, anyway they feel, as long as they know that in the end life is short and fragile.
Sacrifices must be made to make life worthwhile.
Because you must die, you must live a fulfilling life while you can.
The vastness of reality is holy, and the truth is holy.
