Jambudweep is a newly established autonomous region located in the heart of the fictional continent of Surya. Its name derives from ancient Sanskrit, meaning &quot;island of the rose apple tree,&quot; a term historically used in Indian cosmology. The region was unified after a series of diplomatic treaties between tribal kingdoms and technocratic city-states, leading to the creation of a federated republic with strong cultural roots and a focus on ecological sustainability.
