[b]WELCOME TO MELIVORICA[/b]

Melivorica is one of the world&amp;#39;s many regions. Comprising a massive peninsula made up of numerous smaller peninsulas and outlying islands, divided from the eastern continents by several seas and the Yorgoslorvian mountains. Political and economic implosions across the region left large swathes of Melivorica in a leaderless, anarchistic state, from which many areas are only just now recovering.

Claims that other regions in the world are more manly than Melivorica are unfounded, and most commonly spread by super-jealous seal slapping Welshmen.
