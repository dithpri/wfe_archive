Formerly founded in February 2014 by my main nation, [nation]Divine Spirit Mausoleum[/nation]. This region was later abandoned and Sado was reclaimed by the evil Fascists and later, Communists.

Now, after over 5 years after being abandoned by the previous occupants, this region is once again reclaimed under my control since 2023. 

This region is a part of the greater Divine Spirit Multiverse AU which also controls [region]Gensokyo[/region], [region]765 Production[/region], and [region]Love Live[/region].
