[b]Number 15: ERN Raid. The last thing you&#39;d want in your NationStates region is to be raided by Europeia. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A trigger uploaded a link anonymously to discord showcasing this region without a delegate, with the statement: &quot;This is the target&quot;. Admittedly, we used puppets.
