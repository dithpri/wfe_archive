We, the Napax region, will stay loyal to our region until we draw our last breath.
They demoralise their own faction and stain the Napax&#146;s reputation with their pessimistic attitude.
During the time of defeat, their countenance shows displeasure, but they do not stop there. Their words are like poison. They are not of the Napax, but are little fragments of negativity. They show no pride for their region. As I do not accept anyone else other than our region! They are traitors, quitters, and naysayers. We do not need that in the region. Since the Alliance is tainted with these members, then I will not be a part of that. I&#39;m a part of the Napax region, but with dedicated members who cares about the well-being of their region
