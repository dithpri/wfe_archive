Hello there. We are a small group, hoping to flourish soon.

Tyrannical leaders are welcome, in fact, they are encouraged to join! We will however accept any to join us in our quest for rewards and fame. Please join the forums, and partake in roleplay, where the council will discuss matters, and troubles, as well as skirmishes between one another.

As for a state of power. As founder I am forever in complete power, but officers will be the top of the polls as we vote each 6 months for a new delegate, and two officers.

However grim it may seem out there, know that your fellow tyrants are at your side.

This was the Lord of [Nation=short]Revundalihk[/Nation], signing off!
