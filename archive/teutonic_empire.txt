The [region]Teutonic Empire[/region] is an eclectic German Reich themed region, loosely based on the German Empire, the medieval Crusader orders like the Teutonic Order, Deutschordenstaat, the Schmalkaldic League, the Holy Roman Empire, and Prussia. [b]We are proud to be the largest crusader themed region on all of Nationstates![/b]
