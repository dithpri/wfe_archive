The [region]Teutonic Empire[/region] is an eclectic German Reich* themed region, loosely based on the German Empire, the medieval Crusader orders like the Teutonic Order and Deutschordenstaat, the Schmalkaldic League, the Holy Roman Empire, and Prussia. [b]We are proud to be the largest crusader region on all of Nationstates![/b]

*[i]Reich is best loosely translated to mean Realm, and does not specifically refer to an Empire or Third Reich.[/i]
