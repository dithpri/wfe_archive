The Phoenician Alliance, also known as simply TPA, is a region- more or less- that contains the allies of Republic of Phoenicia. Religious tensions are a major concern to the well-being of this region, as the founder, ROP, is located quite inconveniently betwixt Syria and parts of Israel.
The ROP formally understands the nature of these issues, and would like to point out that in no way, does the ROP support a radical group of either side. (More information will be available shortly)
