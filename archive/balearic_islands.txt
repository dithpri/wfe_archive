The [b]Balearic Islands[/b] are an archipelago of Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.

The four largest islands are Majorca, Minorca, Ibiza and Formentera. There are many minor islands and islets in close proximity to the larger islands, including Cabrera, Dragonera and S&#39;Espalmador. The islands have a Mediterranean Climate, and the four major islands are all popular tourist destinations. Ibiza in particular is known as an international party destination, attracting many of the world&#39;s most popular DJs to its nightclubs. The islands&#39; culture and cuisine are similar to that of the rest of Spain. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
