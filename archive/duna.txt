The main capital of Duna is &amp;quot;The City&amp;quot; as it is called. The first colonist arrived sometime after the terraforming bots finished making Duna livable .&amp;quot;The City&amp;quot; was built out of the ship the first colonists arrived in, and sometime after they arrived a drought came. It almost destroyed them if they hadn&amp;#39;t found the blue mola fruit in the Dunar caverns. The mola fruit kept the colony alive until supplies and people could travel back and forth more easily from other worlds.
