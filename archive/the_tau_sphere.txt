The [i]Tau Sphere[/i] is a hidden space-time bubble - basically a tiny isolated microverse. It is located deep inside of subspace. The [i]Tau Sphere[/i] is extremely inaccessible, even for advanced space-faring civilizations and thus is a perfect sanctuary - as it is almost completely unaffected from the universe and its dangers.

The [i]Tau Sphere[/i] is controlled by [b][nation]-The Tau Empire[/nation][/b].
