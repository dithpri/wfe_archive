[region]Greater Qiqis[/region] is a small, free region where anyone can have a huge impact. We allow anyone to do anything and will support you to reach your goal. We are thinking of starting roleplays so if you are interested in that then please join. All people, no matter the ideology, are allowed to reside here (so long as they don&#39;t break the rules). 
Be sure to endorse our future delegate, [nation]Qaast[/nation]!
At the heart of our region is meritocracy. Those who do good receive our points currency (The Qiqi Bahi)
1 Qiqi Bahi is equivalent to 1% extra in an election, but they are very hard to get. For example, if we are being raided and someone saves us, they will receive 3 Qiqi Bahi. Supporting nations who are losing their status to raiders is 1 Qiqi Bahi.
