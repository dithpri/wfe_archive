The Coalition for Collective Cooperation was founded by the Republic of Molopovia in 2020, by mandate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ratified by President Tarlishak. All member states of the CCC are obligated to collaborate in the faction&#39;s economic and security interests, by investing at least 1.5% of defense funds into the CCC, as well as fully opening economic trade, imports, exports, and international travel, to each other. The Coalition aims to achieve a peaceful utopia with good standards for civil rights, all across the world.
