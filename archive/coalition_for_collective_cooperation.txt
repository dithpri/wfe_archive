The Coalition for Collective Cooperation (CCC) aims to foster a global sense of unity and cooperation in the interest of upholding the common good for all, regardless of identity and origin. After a long period of dormancy, the CCC lives once again to continue undertaking its noble mission. Member states of the CCC are entitled to receive foreign assistance from other members so as long as they also contribute to giving foreign assistance to other fellow members. Mutual development is our most sacred goal!
