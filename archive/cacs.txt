The Coalition of Able Conservative States, previously known as the Coalition of Anti-Communist States is aimed at maintaining a stable peace between the members of the CACS but also any foreign power that may be perceived as a threat to our great nations. Initial methods of conflict resolution will of course be diplomatic, but if need be the armed forces of the CACS will apply the full force of military power, with troops deployed across the globe at any given moment. The CACS will use any form of hostile deterrent possible to attain peace.
