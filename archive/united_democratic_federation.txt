Hello, welcome to the United Democratic Federation! The United Democratic Federation (hereafter UDF) is a small region founded for a group of people to enjoy their time in. Upon our foundation we had the goals of establishing a stable region which would steadily grow to support a thriving community with events and activities. However this goal is slow coming for us, and we encourage all who wish to help shape a region to their liking to join us and help us bring activity.
