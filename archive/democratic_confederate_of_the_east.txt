The [region]Democratic Confederate of the East[/region] (DCE) is a new region founded on democracy, security, and unity. As a Frontier, we ensure that our World Assembly Delegate ([nation]Dudennal[/nation]) is chosen by election, not appointment, keeping power in the hands of the people.

Nations may be assigned officer roles based on their strength and activity until our community grows, at which point full elections will shape our leadership. While we strive for peace, we stand ready to defend our members and their sovereignty whenever needed by means of [i]war.[/i]

Join us to help build a democratic, active, and secure future.
