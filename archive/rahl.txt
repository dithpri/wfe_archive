It is the natural right and responsibility of the Lords and Ladies of the User Created Regions to shepherd and guide the Game Created Regions and the directionless players &quot;native&quot; to them.

As the word of the Creator states;

[i]&quot;Founders can administer their region as they see fit, but Delegates must spend &quot;influence&quot; in order to perform some actions.&quot;[/i]

Due to the inherent perfection and stability of UCR security, and the inherent chaos and disorder of GCR security, a higher form of culture has been established by those who would venture out of the primitive and primordial &quot;feeder&quot; regions. 

It is the solemn duty of the Userite Noble to bring forth an Enlightenment of UCR culture and values in the otherwise lawless GCRs.
