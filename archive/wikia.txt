&quot;If Wikipedia is the encyclopedia, then Wikia is the rest of the library.&quot; - Splarka

Wikia, similar to its predecessor and sister project Wikimedia, is a wiki-hosting site that was founded by Jimmy Wales in 2004. Though the name of the product was changed to &quot;FANDOM powered by Wikia&quot; in late 2016, the company name has remained &quot;Wikia.&quot;
