During international emergencies (ex. Z-Day), it is Ryrenorrian tradition to chicken out and retreat into the safety of the Thal Faldir, a natural barrier that had kept us safe for ages. It&amp;#39;s almost like a nice little hidey hole, only it can fit 900~ million people inside! How convenient! Now that we have taken in our share of refugees, we&amp;#39;re officially shutting our borders off to the public until November 1.
