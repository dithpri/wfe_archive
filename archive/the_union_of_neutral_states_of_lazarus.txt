Hello! I Created this region as a way to temporarily remove oneself from the boiling mass that the current civil conflict that is Lazarus. I for one am sick and tired of trying to be twisted and pulled in directions as both sides are nearly in a civil war over this issue. what this region is, is a temporary haven for those in Lazarus who simply enjoyed being there before everything went up in smoke and this region will act as a neutral haven from either side of the conflict until things settle down and the State of emergency is lifted at which time i believe those who do not want to be involved in the conflict can reintegrate back into Lazarus proper.
