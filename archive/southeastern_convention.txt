The Southeastern Convention was made out of spite of being associated with rebellion and religion. While religion is welcome here, it has not and will not be the foundation of the Convention.
The 5 Rules:
1. Be Respectful to ALL members
2. If you are removed from the region because of a post or action towards another member, it is up to that member to forgive you and propose to allow you back in
3. NO matters in real life should affect the region. In here, we are our countries, not people.
4. Recruiting is allowed, as long as the new member can be trusted to follow these rules.
5. Any amendments to these rules must be put to a public poll.
