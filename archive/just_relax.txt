Just relax in this great nation with lots of paradise, and great coconut juice! Need to take a break from a nation/region? Come here for a nice relaxing break. Being invaded? Well try and make sure raid doesn&#146;t happen. It is a place that doesn&#146;t get involved with war AND it&#146;s a place that asks people what they think before making big decisions. It&#146;s also a good place for puppet storage. Anyone is welcome!(except raiders) All embassies accepted!
