Just relax in this great nation with lots of paradise, and great coconut juice! Need to take a break from a nation? Come here for a nice relaxing break. Being invaded? This place is safe.  It is a place that doesn&#146;t get involved with war, and isn&#146;t a raider or defender. It&#146;s also a good place for puppet storage. anyone is welcome!(except raiders) All embassies accepted!

[nation]Melons[/nation] is assistant of the month!
