Hi there!

Drop by with an anonymous puppet and let us know why you think that you are a NationStates addict and how you cope with it. And why are you addicted to it at the first place?

[sub]Or tell us why you think you don&#39;t suffer a gaming disorder even though you have 300 nations in which you loggin daily every 3 min 30 h a day! Is this game really that good? (A part of me thinks it is, probably not the healthy part).[/sub]

Don&#39;t expect professional help. Don&#39;t expect any help! But....

You are not alone.

[sub]and to acknowledge to oneself that there might be an issue doesn&#39;t harm, right?[/sub]
