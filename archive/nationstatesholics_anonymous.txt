[color=blue]Addicted to NationStates? [/Color]Then swing by with an anonymous puppet!

Maybe share why you think you are? How do you cope with it?

[sub]Or tell us why you think you do NOT suffer a gaming disorder despite having 300 nations in which you log in daily every 3min 30h a day![/sub]

Is it worth it? [Color=blue]Is this game really that good?[/color] [sub]A part of me thinks it is, probably not a healthy part.[/sub]

Don&#39;t expect professional help. [Color=red]Don&#39;t expect any help![/color] [sub]Which you probably anyway don&#39;t seek.[/sub] 

But....

[Color=blue]You are not alone.[/color]

[sub]and to acknowledge to oneself that there might be an issue doesn&#39;t harm, right?[/sub]
