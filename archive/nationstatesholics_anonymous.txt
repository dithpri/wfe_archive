Hi there!

Send an anonymous puppet, or [I]not so[/I] anonymous puppet to this region and let us know why you think that you are a NationStates addict and how you cope with it. And why are you addicted to it at all? 

Or why you think you don&#39;t suffer a gaming disorder even though you log in every 3 min 20 h a day! Then let us know, is this game really that good?

Don&#39;t expect professional help. Don&#39;t expect any help. (At least not from me).

But. You are not alone.
