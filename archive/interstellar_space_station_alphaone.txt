The Interstellar Space Station - Alpha 1 (ISS - A1) is, as the name describes, an interstellar space station, that is roughly the size of the Earth&amp;#39;s moon. Defended by high-energy particle accelerators, and powered by fusion reactors (With a fusion energy gain factor of Q = 47), this space station is capable of sustaining life indefinitely. The ISS - A1 is also equipped with a tesseract, which allows for the warping of space-time. These space-time warps allow for the space station to move quite freely around the universe. This &amp;quot;teleportation&amp;quot; requires massive amounts of energy, which restricts the frequency in which the station can warp to 20 hour intervals.
