The Union of Osacrist States are the old states and territories of the Empire of Hisam. The first country to come out from the empire was the Sovereign States of Osacracy (SSO). It was the country that began the rebellion. The second country, the Western States of Osacracy, was the country that marched its troops on the capital of Hisam thereby ending a bloody civil war.
