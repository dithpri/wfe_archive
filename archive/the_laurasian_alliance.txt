Regional Anthem

The Heart of Laurasia

[color=blue]Laurasia, land of the free
Home of the brave
Set off the fire works
Let your banners wave

From sea to shining sea
All across the land
Let people of all races
Come to together hand in hand

United we stand, 
Divided we fall
Let&amp;#39;s put aside our difference 
Once and for all

Thanking God for our freedom
Let&amp;#39;s make a joyful sound
In the heart of Laurasia
Let love always be found.[/color]
