[b]Hey there traveler, I have but one question for you:[/b]

[i]Did you ever imagine how it would be to be nobility in a galactic empire? Nothing the sort of the Galactic Empire from SW, or the Imperium, but something small, yet big, with many planets to be granted, and moons, and so on. We are a work in progress, so if you want to help shape the region, join in![/i]

[b]Well, traveler, if thats the case, then this is the region for you! We&#39;re brand new, but we hope to expand and form a community of like-minded people![/b]
