[b]Hey there traveler, I have but one question for you:[/b]

[i]Did you ever feel the urge to just, for a short while, proclaim yourself ruler of a grand nation, or see yourself as a noble back in the Victorian age, ruling over vast lands while entertaining various peoples from all over the world in order to keep and expand your domains? Or did you just wish you could take part in some noble activities that are obsolete today?[/i]

[b]Well, traveler, if thats the case, then this is the region for you! We&#39;re brand new, but we hope to expand and form a community of like-minded people![/b]
