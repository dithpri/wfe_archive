Dorne is the large peninsula which makes up the southern-most part of Westeros, and is one of the constituent regions of the Seven Kingdoms. The lords of the ruling House Nymeros Martell style themselves &quot;Prince&quot; and &quot;Princess&quot; in the Rhoynish fashion.

The Martells rule from their capital, Sunspear, outside of which sprawls the shadow city. Dorne is the hottest region of Westeros. The region is rocky, mountainous, arid and dry, and features the only desert on the continent. -- [url=http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dorne][color=990000][b]Dorne[/color][/url][/b][hr]
