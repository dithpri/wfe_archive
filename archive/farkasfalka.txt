[hr][b]Farkasfalka is an order; an edict per say. Our purpose is to study and preserve the ideology of decreeism, and the faith of Christ. We are recruiting nations that are experienced in raiding, or even nations that are eager to learn the trade. Regardless, they are all expected to follow the oath. One day when we are mighty again and have a proper military, we will strike back and defeat our enemies!
