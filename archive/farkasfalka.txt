[b]Farkasfalka is an order; an edict per say. Our purpose is to study and preserve the ideology of Decreeism, and the faith of Christ. Farkasfalka also participates in raiding, and is experienced and skillful in doing so. We also believe in the mutual benefits that being an active member of a region provides. The nation giving to the region and the region giving back by provides a platform for the nation to share its ideas and allows for the nation to prosper.

Every day we strive to better ourselves so that as a region we are more efficient altogether. Our dream is to spread our ideas of a better society across the world. That dream [i]shall[/i] become reality.
