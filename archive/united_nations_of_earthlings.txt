[b]This is a old region founded in 2017 by [nation]Argentinstan[/nation]. Since then it has had multiple members come and go, but unfortunately it was abandoned by the summer of 2018. The community has, however, moved on to [region]United Forum of Nations[/region] as a successor region[/b].

[u]This region was refounded as a landing page for those who may have missed the UNoE. Unfortunately the old RMB is likely lost save for a few screenshots scattered around the Internet.[/u]
