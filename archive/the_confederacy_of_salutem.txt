The Confederacy of Salutem is a great place for people who want a small community, where you can interact with people you know and are comfortable around. Please, endorse the other countries in the region if you are able. A request to be made officer will be considered after viewing activity in the region, treatment of members of the region, and length of time spent in the union. We encourage democracy in our union- so any appointees to higher level positions will need a confirmation of a simple majority of the nations in the region.
