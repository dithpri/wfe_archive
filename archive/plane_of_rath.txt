An artificial plane created by the Phyrexians to help in their invasion of Dominaria and was the setting of the Tempest block expansion and Nemesis and Planeshift expansions. This plane&amp;#39;s creation seems the most mechanical of any artificial plane, having been &amp;quot;built&amp;quot; slowly by syphoning mana from a core of energy through a Stronghold that acts as a factory and turning the energy into flowstone (tiny nanobots) which spreads like lava outward from the stronghold, slowly forming a planet.
