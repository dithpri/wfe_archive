Qguinm. 
The dimensional jungle, where both questions are answered, and made.
where arcane secrets are kept, and sometimes exploited.
where there is no set and stone definition for good and evil.
in Qguinm some people find refuge, and some people find a dystopia...

But some people don&amp;#39;t care about relics, or arcane secrets, or dystopia in general, so feel free to test your wit against the squirrel god in a game of fire, sword, leviathan. Or challenge death to a game of tennis &amp;#39;cause ya feel like it.&amp;#39;- kyle.  (he&amp;#39;s got a really good Backhand)

We&amp;#39;re a lovecraftian themed region, who try&amp;#39;s to take itself not too seriously. 
So seriously, welcome to Qguinm!
