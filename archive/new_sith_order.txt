The One Sith, also known as the New Sith Order, was a Sith cult founded by Darth Krayt - known as the [nation]Dragon of the Sith[/nation] at some point before 30 ABY on Korriban, the ancient Sith burial world. Conducting itself according to Krayt&#39;s Rule of One, this new Sith cult was heavily-organized and bureaucratized in contrast to the earlier two-member Order of the Sith Lords or the infighting of the ancient Sith Empire. Most of the followers were trained from birth and were inculcated with a sense of absolute loyalty to the order, sported a red-and-black tattooed appearance, and carried lightsabers with a yorik coral-styled hilt design.
