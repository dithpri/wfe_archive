[color=blue]Welcome to The United States of H-land[/color]
[hr]

H-land is a region where we pride ourselves on our philosophy of Neutrality. The administration of the region permits residents to have any type of government they want, whether it is an anarchy or psychotic dictatorship. We are officially a pragmatic, centrist democracy though most of our residents do not even have democracy. Our motto is &#147;Hail H-land&#148; and our National Plant is the &#147;rose&#148;
