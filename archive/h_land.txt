[color=Purple]Welcome to The United States of H-land[/color]
[hr]

H-land is a region where we pride ourselves on our philosophy of Pragmatism. The administration of the region permits residents to have any type of government they want, whether it is an anarchy or psychotic dictatorship. Our motto is &#147;Hail H-land&#148; and our National Plant and Animal are the &#147;Indigo rose&#148; and &#147;H-landian Lion&#148;
