Ruled in a unique socially experimental way.
The grand ruler lives the high life while the serfs sacrifice simple pleasures for the greater good.
Taxes are abolished,instead the state looks after all the money.
Not what Jobby created but what he intended

Here in Yorkshire we tell it like it is, but we are a peaceful lot. We are a proud nation with a great deal of history.
We are a diverse lot, but despite that, we do our best to maintain happy relations with other members. Invaders we don&#39;t need, we have nothing here for you.
Please respect our traditions.
We are Yorkshire.
