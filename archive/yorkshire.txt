&amp;#127804; Welcome to Yorkshire
&amp;#129668; Ruled in a unique socially experimental way
&amp;#127913; The grand ruler lives the high life, while the serfs sacrifice simple pleasures for the greater good
&amp;#129689; Taxes are abolished, instead the state looks after all the money
&amp;#128302; Not what Jobby created, but what he intended

Here in Yorkshire, we tell it like it is, but we are a peaceful lot.
We are a proud nation with a great deal of history.
Anyone can reside here, preferably Yorkshire folk, but we are open to everyone.
We are a diverse lot, but despite that, we do our best to maintain happy relations with other members.
Invaders we don&#39;t need, we have nothing here for you. Please respect our traditions.

We are Yorkshire.
WA members, please endorse our delegate: &amp;#129372; &amp;#128018; &amp;#127807; Crazymonkeyjungle
