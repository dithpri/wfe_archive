Here in Yorkshire we tell it like it is, but we are a peaceful lot. We are a proud nation with a great deal of history. 
We are a diverse lot, but despite that, we do our best to maintain happy relations with other members. Invaders we don&#39;t need, we have nothing here for you. 
Please respect our traditions. 
We are Yorkshire.
