The region of Yorkshire though not the biggest in Nationstates, is the largest  county in England. We never cause anyone any trouble and wish we could be treated in the same way. Anyone can reside here, preferably Yorkshire folk but we are open to everyone. Please mind your manners and respect this region. Thank you.
