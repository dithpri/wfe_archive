Welcome to Yorkshire, one of the oldest regions in Nationstates. We are not the biggest but we are very proud of our heritage. We get invaded but still remain intact, never ever giving in to the invader rabble. Nations are very welcome to visit our region and indeed get a complimentary glass of Nettle tonic on arrival.
