Welcome to Yorkshire, not a big region but one of the oldest. Nations are welcome to come and go as they please but  introduce yourselves and leave a message or two. Yorkshire folk love a bit of banter, the more you say the more we reply. Invaders? We have entertained most of you and have rarely been rude, so thanks but no thanks. Regards to all Jobby.
