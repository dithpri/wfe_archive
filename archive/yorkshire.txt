[b]The raiders of the world are here to [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=WA_past_resolution/id=424/council=2]Violate The Law[/url] with [i]Malicious[/i] intent. [/b]

Do [u]YOU[/u] feel protected knowing that the Security Council has your back? 
Is protecting you from &#147;external military forces&#148; like us? 
Has pledged to &#147;Prioritize the best interest of the region over that of their members?&#148; 
[i]Wait, what? [/i]

Well, in our opinion as an international community of Caretaker Raiders Administering Protection, it&#146;s in the [i]&#147;best interests&#148;[/i] of this region to have a new delegate, regardless of what the members want! [b]Congrats![/b]

[i]Sincerely,[/i]
