[url=https://discord.gg/MmufQRk]Discord[/url][/b][/color][hr][color=e6e600][b]The region of Yorkshire though not the biggest in Nationstates, but it is the largest county in England. We never cause anyone any trouble, we are humble, and wish we could be treated in the same way. Anyone can reside here, preferably Yorkshire folk but we are open to everyone. Please mind your manners and respect this region. We are very sad at the loss of Mejobsworth, may he rest in peace. Thank you.[/color][/b][hr][b][color=3385ff][u]Question of the Day[/u]
