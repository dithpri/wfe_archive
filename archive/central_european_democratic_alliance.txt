CEDA, (The Central European Democratic Alliance) is a loosely connected alliance between countries who share similar views in democracy. We strive to protect, preserve, and aid all nations in CEDA. Although not required, we suggest you are also a member of the World Assembly, as to make CEDA&amp;#39;s presence known.

CEDA is managed by its Regional Council.
