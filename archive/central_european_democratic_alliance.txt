(CEDA) 
The Central European Democratic Alliance is a loosely connected alliance between countries who share similar views in democracy. We strive to protect, preserve, and aid all nations in the CEDA. Although not required, we suggest you are also a member of the World Assembly, as to make the CEDA&amp;#39;s presence known.
