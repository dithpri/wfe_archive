It is with heavy heart that I announce the end of the Fort Triumph project. I&amp;#39;ll leave the forum link here for posterity&amp;#39;s sake and I&amp;#39;ll leave the region open for you guys to use as you find new homes. I will make it my mission to find you a new home that matches your needs and personalities if you ask for my help. For the rest of you, I recommend moving to [b][region]Renegade Islands Alliance[/region][/b]. They are good people.
