Sorry for the disappearance everyone, I am making an attempt at getting active once more and will try harder to be online more. We haven&amp;#39;t really accomplished a great amount at this point of time and we&amp;#39;re already facing tribulations. Now is the time for us to come together as a region and discuss our options and the steps we take next. Feel free to freely discuss either on the forum or here on the RMB. This region is not just me, nor is it just the forum staff, let us all come together to get progressing once more.
