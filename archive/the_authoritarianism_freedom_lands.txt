Democracy has shown time and time again to be a slow, chaotic, and overall horrible process which in the end, evolves into a civil war. Due to these reasons, which both the founder [nation]Hentar[/nation] and the delegate [nation]The Barbradian Republic[/nation] have experienced, we have created the region Authoritarianism Freedom Lands to create a safe and stable government. Nations of all types are allowed, as long as they do not try to become delegate.

To keep safety in The Authoritarianism Lands, all nation must endorse [nation]The Barbradian Republic[/nation] or they will be banned.
