Camorras Islands! An island forgotten by time right in the middle of the Pacific. We are a colony of pirates and nothing more.

[i]  - Pirates
- Mercenaries  &quot;Territory - ultra marine of the Crown of Campinass &quot;
- Rebels
- Fugitives
- Storytellers and jokes

&nbsp; &quot;Here on this island is a good place to die in peace or live the little of your life drinking sour wine          [/i]
