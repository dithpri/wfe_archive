Run your nation however you feel like it, I don&#39;t care. We&#39;re not doing those things where we take the game outside of the game and have an rpg thing and our own website. Just run your country how you want to and don&#39;t take it too seriously, and we&#39;ll be fine. This region is about checking your state whenever and then doing something else, not making your life about running your nation by playing a bunch of outside games to pretend that what happens playing that other game will actually force you to do things one way on this site.
