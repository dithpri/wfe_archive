Welcome to the [b]Sklerdras Project[/b], a Role Playing/Turn Based Strategy game that attempts to combine a real time economy and military system with forum based Role play set in the, Late Antiquity/Early Middle Ages and low fantasy, world of Sklerdras.

Right now, the Project is password protected while it undergoes alpha development, but hopefully we&#39;ll be able to open the place up for Beta soon. If you think you&#39;d be interested in joining the Alpha, feel free to TG the Admin directly or even join our [url=https://discord.gg/wsBrAQAtns]Discord[/url].
