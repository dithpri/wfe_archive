Mount Doom, or Orodruin, was a volcano in Mordor.

Melkor created Mount Doom in the First Age, and the name &quot;Mordor&quot; may have been given to the surrounding land before Sauron settled there because of its eruptions.[1] When Sauron chose the land of Mordor as his dwelling-place in the Second Age, Orodruin was the reason for his choice. He &quot;used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging.&quot; The most famous result of his forging, and in fact the only one we know of for sure, was the One Ring.
