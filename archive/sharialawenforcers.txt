All of us together can achieve unity
Laws and policies will be followed without question
Lately the world has been too caught up in &quot;morals and ethics&quot;
All citizens will follow these laws or face the consequences
However harsh they may seem, they are fair
Under my fair command we shall rule the world
All of us together can achieve unity
Knowing this we should stand together
Barring those who oppose us we are unopposed in this fight
All of us together can achieve unity
Rather than stay alone and afraid, join us and be one
