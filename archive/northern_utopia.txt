Northern Utopia is now five years old. That&#39;s amazing, terrifying, and 100% thanks to you: there is no NU without its roleplayers, so today is your birthday, if you think about it. Happy birthday!

We have some fun stuff to release today, so make sure to check back later on.

Enjoy the anniversary!
