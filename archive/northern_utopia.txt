[colour=red]Attention, you! Do you know what day it is today? Do you?[/colour]

It&#39;s [b]Northern Utopia&#39;s fifth anniversary![/b] Fifth!

Northern Utopia is now five years old. That&#39;s amazing, terrifying, and 100% thanks to you: there is no NU without its roleplayers, so today is your birthday, if you think about it. Happy birthday!

We have some fun stuff to release today, so make sure to check back later on.

Before that, you can enjoy your status as a former President of Northern Utopia. I&#39;m pleased to say you were all extremely popular and successful leaders. We just thought it&#39;d be nice to reward the people who make NU so unique and interesting (plus, it gave us an opportunity to [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=poll/p=188861]restore Kjanu to their rightful place as our eternal shepherd[/url]).

Enjoy the anniversary!
