Partition is a colony world of the Unified Earth Government located within the Outer Colonies. Though Partition bordered on the fringes of many key UEG trade routes, the colony had remained undetected for centuries. Sometime after the Great War, the UNSC Diadochi crashed on the surface. Her surviving crew lived amongst the ruins of the ship for years until rescue teams finally discovered them inhabiting a thriving community. Within weeks of the crew&amp;#39;s rescue, colonial officers would declare Partition to be suitable for Human habitation. Partition&amp;#39;s location along the UEG&amp;#39;s newest and most secure space lanes would ensure its growth as a political, economic, and military power.
