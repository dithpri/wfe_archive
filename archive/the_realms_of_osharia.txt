Freedom and peace, that&#39;s what Oshira stands for. However, our Oshira also knew that in order to know good, you had to know evil. Perfection is never achievable but we strive to be the best we can and set aside our differences. When you join Oshira, you become a mentor to others, spreading the world with diversity and acceptance. You don&#39;t just make peace, you become peace.
