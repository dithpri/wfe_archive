The region is 1,348.20 mi&sup2; and it has 3 parts of it: Jongvale, Aramore, and Eastcliff. Eastcliff has many jobs to offer. Aramore is the best place to be, even if it has low employment rates, it has many freedoms and rights. Jongvale is the worst place to be because it surrounds itself with the JIA (Jongvale Invasion Area). The JIA Is a place where if you try to cross it, you will be gunned down. In all, El Birrete is a great place to be.
