Welcome to the Brotherhood! Here you can find, hopefully, a welcoming and warm community. The region won&#39;t be massive at first, but I hope for it to grow into a full community. 

For the sake of RP, this region is a series of connected planets that are all either close to each other, or have some method of long-distance travel to keep everyone connected.

Feel free to send any questions you might have in a telegram to  [nation]Legannius[/nation]

I do hope that you enjoy your time here at the Brotherhood of Leonia!
