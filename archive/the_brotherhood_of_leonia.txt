Welcome to the Brotherhood! Here you can find, hopefully, a welcoming and warm community. The region won&#39;t be massive at first, but I hope for it to grow into a full community. 

[i]We&#39;re all planets in the same system, just as we are pawns in a game. Insignificant, yet possibly the strongest that you could find.[/i]

Feel free to send any questions you might have in a telegram to  [nation]Legannius[/nation]. He&#39;s not doing anything too important anyways, so give him something to do.

I do hope that you enjoy your time here at the Brotherhood of Leonia!
