[color=brown]Welcome to [b]Guinea-Kiribati[/b] a rapidly changing region[/color] 

[color=blue]If you are looking here because we sent you an Embassy request you can accept with confidence, although this region has only existed since the 8th of June 2020 our sponsors have been around for many years and it&#39;s safe to say we will outlast many of our Embassies. We would (not unreasonably) ask you to look after your own region so we couldn&#39;t take a thread in your forum or send an ambassador to you, if that is a deal breaker then we are probably not for you, otherwise we hope to exchange Embassies with you soon.[/color]

[color=green]An unofficial test region, other test regions are available[/color]
