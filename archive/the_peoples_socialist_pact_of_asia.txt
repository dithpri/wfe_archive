[b] The People&amp;#39;s Socialist Pact of Asia [/b]

     [i]&amp;quot;Truly Great people of Asia, so equal are our nations! May our enemies quake in their boots due to our great power! May our people live to serve our causes! May our allies admire our great states and look to us as an example of greatness!&amp;quot;[/i]

- President Hideki Miyoshi of Japan

We are a group of (mostly) Asian based nations who have common ideas when it comes to Government, War, Ideas ect. Whether your Communist, Socialist, or just hate the idea of Democracy and Capitalism your welcome here. We will work together smoothly and efficiently to work on Policies, Propaganda, and to maintain [i]&amp;quot;peace&amp;quot;[/i] (hahahahahaha).
