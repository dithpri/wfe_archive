The Warped Federation of Madeira is founded by a group of wildly dissimilar rulers who are nonetheless committed to being a little bit warped...

We are a region living on the outskirts somewhere in obscurity and much as we are grateful if any other region passing by wants to invite us to exchange embassies, our policy is to decline and maintain our seclusion.

Please do accept some of our delicious warped madeira cake by token of our gratitude.
