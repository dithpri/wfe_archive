[i]&amp;quot;Home to the Elite Knights of The Cathedral, they fear no-one, true raiders. Allied to all raider, enemy to all fenders. We fear no one and everyone fears us.
Fenders shall perish under our mighty swords and shall be sent forth to the fiery hells of the Rejected Realms&amp;quot;[/i]

[b]No more! Churches here and there are being demolished by gangs of workmen and their images burnt. 
Many Knights have been hung, the others flee to the closest Cathedral![/b]

To the infamy of Debugistan, Amossio, Groznia and the others.
