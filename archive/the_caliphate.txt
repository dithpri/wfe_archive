At times in Muslim history, there have been rival claimant caliphs in different parts of the Islamic world, and divisions between the Shi&amp;#39;a and Sunni communities.

According to Sunni Muslims, the first caliph to be called Amir al-Mu&amp;#39;minin was Abu Bakr Siddique, followed by Umar ibn al-Khattab, the second of the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs. Uthman ibn Affan and Ali ibn Abi Talib also were called by the same title, while the Shi&amp;#39;a consider Ali to have been the only truly legitimate caliph.
