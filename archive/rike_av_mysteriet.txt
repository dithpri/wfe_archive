And I watch the sky and the ocean,
And I study they gentle face --
Its lines of sweetness and power, 
Thy type of they strong Norse race.
Let the abyss glow with lightning and flames, 
an empire of color that mocks words, 
with scorching shafts it attacks the eye, 
it is as though a sword pierced it -- 
for the distant deep below remembers the waves 
of Hell&amp;#39;s strengthening river of tears, 
the glittering mask conceals only torment,
the empty gaze which freezes one&amp;#39;s blood.
