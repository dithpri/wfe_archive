Welcome to Ohaymarque !
Negative creates negative, people who mock others usually create negative stigma for themselves which triggers unpleasant decision making &amp; they don&#39;t realize they hurt themselves. It&#39;s counter productive. My advice is - walk away, don&#39;t read negative about you . Think positive ! Raiders may take the chance of swoop in to take region, but I will always be here!
