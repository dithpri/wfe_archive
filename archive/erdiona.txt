A just another region in NationStates. Members take the game fairly seriously, but everyone&#39;s just here to have a good time. I invite you to share any thoughts, ideas, or questions you may have regarding Erdiona and it&#39;s nations interactions with each other. Please stay respectful toward other peoples opinions (if it&#39;s&#39;s even that serious) and welcome to Erdiona! 

P.S. This region exists primarily for new players, but anyone is welcome to join.
