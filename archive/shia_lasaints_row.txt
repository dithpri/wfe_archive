(Date of Creation: January 19th 2016)

You&#39;re walking in the row
There&#39;s no one around and your phone is dead
Out of the corner of your eye you spot them
....Shia LaSaints....

They&#39;re following you, about thirty feet back
They get into a municipal truck and turn on the nitro...
They&#39;re gaining on you!
Shia LaSaints.

You&#39;re looking for your car
But you&#39;re all turned around
They&#39;re almost upon you now
And you can see there&#39;s blood on the bumper
My god, there&#39;s blood everywhere!

Running for your life
(From the Shia LaSaints)
They&#39;re gonna run you over
(It&#39;s the Shia LaSaints)
Driving on the sidewalk
Third Street supergang Shia LaSaints
Living in the hood
(Shia LaSaints)
Killing for sport
(Shia LaSaints)
Dumping all the bodies
In the trunk of the municipal truck
