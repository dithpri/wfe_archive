In my view all communist, socialist and anarchist left generally states should unite around the regions of interest. These regions should be combined in one international. The presidents of the united international will have to establish the Management Board which will decide on the international acts at the end of the joint decision should be forwarded to the chairman of the main international, who will carry out the given decicions 

So join the combined international and start building a true democratic united movement


That&#39;s the basic principles of the combined international.
