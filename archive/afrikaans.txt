[color=orange]Afrikaans is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Southwest Africa, and to a lesser extent, Bechuanaland and Southern Rhodesia. It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers in what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century.[/color]
