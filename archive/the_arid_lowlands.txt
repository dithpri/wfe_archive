[b]Welcome to The Arid Lowlands[/b]

A scorched and unforgiving expanse where the sun burns without mercy and the wind carries more dust than hope. Once a forgotten industrial graveyard, this barren region now teems with decay, corruption, and raw survivalism. Toxic fumes rise from abandoned factories, and rusted pipelines cut across cracked earth like veins of a dying beast.

At its heart lies [nation]The Bottoms[/nation], a ruthless frontier where might makes right and justice is dispensed from the barrel of a gun. In this lawless land, power is earned through violence, cunning, and an unflinching will to dominate. Welcome to The Arid Lowlands &#151; where civilization ends and the savage begin.
