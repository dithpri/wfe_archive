This is a new region that I hope to turn into one of the best out there. But, everyone has to start somewhere.

Recruitment is [u]necessary[/u] at this stage. Just send anyone you see a telegram, asking them if they would be interested in joining. If you have any questions about recruiting or any suggestions, send me a telegram.

The only reason that I barred the Delegate from Regional Control was to prevent an invasion, so do not worry about this, it is only temporary. Also, endorse who you want. I will not require any specific person to be endorsed.

[color=blue]Future Plans:[/color]
Once we get enough members, a government system will be set up, such as Head Recruiter, Head of Defense, ect. and a system of voting for all regional actions will take place.
