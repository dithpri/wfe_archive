To whom it concerns, [i]Polad[/i] is a Region that was once founded peacefully by Pollandeu. 
But unforunately, the founder is gone. The region was well maintained under Moh&#39;s hands for 2 years till it ceased in peace. All of what&#39;s stored about the region is destroyed, what&#39;s left of Polad is within NS Dossier and Wayback Machine. 

Now, the name is offically the nickname for the homeworld of Moh, Poladia. In short terms, the name will be used to carry pollandeu&#39;s legacy.
