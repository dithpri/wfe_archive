If you believe that the consumption or practice of eating a specific food should be banned and perish in the faults of society, please consider joining the Union of Dictatorial Republics.
&quot;The nature of yielding balsam shall tremble at an Anti-Balsamic Revolution!&quot; -Anti-Balsamic Dictator
Under our brilliant philosophy and contributions to national and international thought, the people shall unite under the Flag and their Dictator, and spark a revolution to ban a food that the people deem as, &quot;unethical and inhumane,&quot; and shall be, &quot;trembled at a revolution!&quot; 

Long live the Dictator and his mighty Republics!
