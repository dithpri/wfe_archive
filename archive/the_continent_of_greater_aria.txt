Greater Aria is a vast continent renowned for its mystery. Indeed, many nations are thought to dwell within Greater Aria, but they tend to keep their contact with the outside world minimum. 

What we do know is that Greater Aria contains the warlike nation of Kinbokiir, ruled by its militant expansionalist government, which has absorbed many of its lesser neighbors and appears to be continuing its conquest. The Nomadic Peoples of Modoy were once their victims, but have recently won their independence, and now roam the vast expanses of Greater Aria.
