Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. It comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe is known for its many wars, discoveries, and cultures. In the early 1900s, a nation in Central Europe known as the &quot;German Empire&quot; fell after its enemies defeated them, leaving the country in shambles. A new nation rose to power a few years after the German Empire known as the Third Reich.
