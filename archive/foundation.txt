The great new galactic empire has been set by the Foundation. Billions of worlds bow down to the one true power of the universe. The great Harry Seldon has given us his plan to reach new heights for humanity. 
[b][i]A round table of the most prominent psycho-historians rules over, this vast galactic empire.  [/i][/b]
The Foundation is the first attempt of humanity to change the known political models by putting in charge a scientific ruling class, without establishing a hierarchy. [i]Every member of the round table only speaks according to his position. From number one downwards. [/i]This is the only benefit of being first.
In the middle of the table a tetraract computer stores and helps develop new mathematical formulas by the psycho-historians.
