Tellus, the third planet from the Sun after Apollo and Aphrodite, is the only known planet to harbor life at this time. Home to a multitude of species with vast differences its predominate, though not most numerous, species is humanity. These &#39;humans&#39; are divided into nations, tribes, families and states of which there are many. [Modern-esque technology base, no magic but light science-fiction elements are acceptable]. Tellus is still a work in progress.~
