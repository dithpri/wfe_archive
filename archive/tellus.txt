[b][color=crimson]Many Tribes,[/color] [color=goldenrod]One World:[/color] [color=navy]Tellus[/color]

[color=chocolate]Tellus is a regional community with a vision for one inclusive world in which our many different tribes are respected and valued. We insist upon the right of nations to collectively define broad international standards and upon the right to self-determination for all regional natives throughout the world. We will work to advance and protect these rights through the World Assembly and direct action to defend native communities.[/color][/b]
