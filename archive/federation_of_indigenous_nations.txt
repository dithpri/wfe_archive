The Federation of Indigenous Nations (F.I.N.) is an organization directed to helping fellow indigenous nations across the world, primarily in North Asia &amp; The Americas. All indigenous nations are allowed. The interest of this region is to maintain preserving our culture, language, environment, etc. while simultaneously embracing modern technology. We will be united upon a common interest. No one tribe should be declined, unless they go against our principles in this region. Please be reminded that the F.I.N. is not a defensive alliance.

Founding Members:
[nation]Chukchi[/nation]
[nation]Itelmens[/nation]
[nation]Potawatomi[/nation]
[nation]Siberian Yupik[/nation]

Although mostly a small organization, we have hopes to expand this to other native tribes.
