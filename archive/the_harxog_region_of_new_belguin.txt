Welcome to the Truly New World
    
Our nations are located along the southern coast of Africa or in the Indian Ocean.  Thanks to extremely active plate tectonics several familiar places are gone and have been replaced by new landmasses. Aggressive colonization of the new lands allowed for new nations to take root in the area and form a new political sphere of influence and stability.  

Some of these new islands can be leased from the region by contacting the offices of Grand Duke Davros of Zalawi
