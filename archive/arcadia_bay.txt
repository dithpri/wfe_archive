[b][color=green]Arcadia Bay[/color][/b] is a picturesque seaside town in [b][color=#0080FF]Oregon, United States[/color][/b].

[color=green]Arcadia Bay[/color] was originally inhabited and founded by Native Americans, as mentioned by Ms. Grant when she speaks of the settlers living peacefully with one another after their arrival.
Its main source of commerce was fishing which - according to a fisherman - is no longer feasible due to the Prescott family&#39;s business practices.
