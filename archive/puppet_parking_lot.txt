Puppets... puppets... they&#39;re simply all around. All. Around. Sometimes you just want to try out something new... how about being the cruelest, most authoritarian government NationStates ever had? Or maybe the most environment-orientated, peace-loving democracy you could ever be? Or maybe just being your own self, ruling however you want to rule, without giving a care to all those &quot;Top 1%&#39;s&quot; and yaddle.
Well, that&#39;s what puppets are for.
Usually, puppets are parked in weird places, like maybe a user&#39;s main region. Then it doesn&#39;t really do much, which is simply making the region look huge but really tiny.
But in Puppet Parking Lot, you can do just that!
