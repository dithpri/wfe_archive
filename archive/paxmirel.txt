Welcome!
Paxmirel is a region dedicated to peace.
It is newly established, so its destiny is yet to be set. In the future, some features may be a map, a forum, roleplay, games, and a formal government. 
For now we will start by gathering members and establishing a friendly atmosphere. 
Feel free to join, just send a telegram to the nation Virzora, and the password will be sent to you. The great thing about it is it is completely new, meaning everybody can have a greater impact on it! :)
