We are open to ideas and new voices. We are a regional empire with the leader, formalized as the Cinncinatus, High Engineer, Emperor/Emperess of Monarchs, Delegate, of The States, and It&amp;#39;s Citizens, and It&amp;#39;s People: S/He who walks alone, who is subject to the people, sensitive to all, and without ambition or figurehead status.. We are a mixture of Feudal Japan, the Mongolian Empire, Germany under Bismarck, and the Byzantine Empire at all of their heights.
