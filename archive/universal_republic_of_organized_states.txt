[color=purple]The UROS (Universal Republic of Organized States) is a group of hard working and dedicated nations that combine together to create international agreements, treaties, and even wars to establish a functioning new world. We are open to nations of any ideology, size, or experience to join UROS, and have a Discord server for both ease of communications and some RP. We also feature an earth map and of course statistics to maximize both realism and your experience here. Talk to our Founder [nation]Narnagaesia[/nation] or our Vice Delegate [nation]East Malikay[/nation] about establishing relationships and embassies in UROS.
