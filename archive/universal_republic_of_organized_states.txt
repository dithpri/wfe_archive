[hr][color=green]The UROS (Universal Republic of Organized States) is a group of hard working and dedicated nations that combine together to create international agreements, treaties, and even wars to establish a functioning new world. We are open to nations of any ideology, size, or experience to join UROS, and have a Discord server for both ease of communications and some RP. We also feature an earth map and of course statistics to maximize both realism and your experience here. [/color]
