[b][color=#a10b00] [nation]Der Fuhrer und Reichskanzler[/nation] leads the Germanian nations to freedom from religious and secular humanism though the destruction of irrelevant history to create a bright future

A future of renewal, a return to science, the principles of blood and soil, a profound belief in the interconnection and preservation of ecological systems, and the Designer of all.
Our Reich Faith and Religion is intertwined in our worldview.

The parasitism of humanism will be extinguished throughout the Reich and will not be permitted a foothold within it. Threats to the Reich from within or without will be incinerated.
