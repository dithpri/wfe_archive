The Imperial Lands of Omnia Videns comprise several large landmasses and thousands of smaller archipelagoes, all under the purview of the Empire of Omnia Videns and subject to its laws, customs, and military defenses. All lands within the Empire share a robust underground/underwater public transit system. The Empire seeks to unite all islands via man-made land bridges, allowing for unobstructed terrestrial travel.
