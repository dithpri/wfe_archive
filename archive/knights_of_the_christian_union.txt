As Europe&amp;#39;s multicultural elites manage to devastate Western Europe culturally, the younger generations of Europeans begin to search for answers.

We look to what our forefathers did in times of great turmoil and realize that the only way we can save Europe is to embrace the principles of out ancestors. 

Principles of 

[b]S[/b]trength
[b]H[/b]onor
[b]S[/b]acrifice
[b]M[/b]artyrdom 

In this we have no choice. We must again embrace these principles or see our culture and our people perish.
