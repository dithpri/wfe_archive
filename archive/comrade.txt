The term [b]comrade[/b] is used to mean &quot;mate&quot;, &quot;colleague&quot;, or &quot;ally&quot;, and derives from the Spanish term camarada literally meaning &quot;chamber mate&quot;, from Latin camera &quot;chamber&quot; or &quot;room&quot;. 

Political use of the term was inspired by the French Revolution, after which it grew into a form of address between socialists and workers. Since the Russian Revolution, popular culture in the Western World has often associated it with communism.
