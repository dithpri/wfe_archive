The Third Coming and Resurrection of All and Him,
The Sun and Air is Him,
Breathe and Bask in Him.

The Third Coming here not for time being
The Third Coming of the high being
The Third Coming nigh being

And come it will, join us to purge and ablute
The souls of yourselves,
And let glory burn sin
And let mercy absolve in aggression
And let the world submerge Wrong in the unstoppable tide of Right
And let the world win Him, at the Third Coming.

Praise!, praise be to and do praise Him and all.
