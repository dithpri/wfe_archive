[b]&amp;quot;Granted that the 19th century was the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy, this does not mean that the 20th century must also be the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy. Political doctrines pass; nations remain. We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the &amp;#39;right&amp;#39;, a Fascist century. If the 19th century was the century of the individual, we are free to believe that this is the &amp;#39;collective&amp;#39; century, and therefore the century of the State.&amp;quot;[/b] - Benito Mussolini
