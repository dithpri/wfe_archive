The North Atlantic Empire is for nations willing to gain worldwide recognition in the World Assembly. We believe that all the nations should be able to work together to achieve our aims, and to listen to each other&amp;#39;s problems.

We will be a mighty region in the North Atlantic, and will be a force to be reckoned with in the future.

We do have a map of the region, but it is a work in progress. If you wish to own a part of the map, just send a pic of your nation, or you can ask to border it with another nation. Here, we accept RP Wars and everything else.
