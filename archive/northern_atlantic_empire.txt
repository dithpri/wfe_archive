The North Atlantic Empire is for nations willing to gain worldwide recognition in the World Assembly. We believe that all the nations should be able to work together to achieve our aims, and to listen to each other&amp;#39;s problems.

We will be a mighty region in the North Atlantic, and will be a force to be reckoned with in the future.
