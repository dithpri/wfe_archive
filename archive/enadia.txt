Past leadership will never have control over us again. Past leadership was gone for a little more than a year, just to return and wreck havoc. Never forget why ties have been cut and why our years of work were removed from their control. We will rebuild back better and learn from the tragedies that have occured, causing the community to lose everything. A weight has been lifted and new knowledge has been provided thanks to those of international communities. Under new leadership, our community&#39;s safety shall remain the number one priority.
