[u][b]Phoenix Ashes :[/b][/u]
A small, peaceful community made of french/english speaker isolationists. We love peace and integrity more than anything, but won&#39;t hesitate to fight back if attacked.
Though it shouldn&#39;t happen, as being a little group and having upgraded security makes us one of the safest places to be around here.
Updates for the region are yet to come, but don&#39;t hesitate to tell the region&#39;s officers about anything you would like to do with us: we are here to help you and have fun together while making this place even better every day.
Have fun everyone !!
