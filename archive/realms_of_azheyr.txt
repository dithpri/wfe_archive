[b]Realms of Azheyr[/b] is a roleplay centric region. We aim to use roleplay to create worthwhile and interesting interactive stories where players may test their creativity and writing skills. We try to focus on [i]cooperation[/i] instead of competition. Roleplaying isn&amp;#39;t the sole subject though. Gaming, debating and just chitchat - there&amp;#39;s a section for those too. 

Our government is democratic with a written [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/Azheyr/topic/9056730/]Constitution[/url] - each citizen has the unalienable right to quantifiable input via voting.
