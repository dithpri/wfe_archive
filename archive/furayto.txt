The region of Furaito is a vast and diverse land, with people harder and stronger than the environment. The region is divided into two primary nations. Valyrita, hidden among the harsh jungles and mountains of the North, a land crawling with Dragons and those fierce enough to tame them. To the South, Jamundo, a harsh land shrouded in freezing deserts and nearly constant darkness, a place where Giant Hawks roam free.
