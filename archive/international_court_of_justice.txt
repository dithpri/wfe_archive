When in the pursuit of justice, this region was founded to operate as an arbitrator to those international, interregional, and intraregional conflicts. The opinions will be constructed based on international, regional, and national laws. Any nation or region may bring a case against another nation or region for the purposes of resolving the conflict, and these cases will form the precedent for future decisions.

We also welcome nations who wish to serve as justices.
