&quot;We will sho u da wae-we also like kraft mac&#39;n&#39;cheese.&quot; -JustForkMyShortsUp, 2018

The Union of Idiotic Meme Lords was created on March 5, 2018. It was made to bring peace to the nations that chose to partake in the union. Founder JustForkMyShortsUp created the region with some help from Little Political Freedom. Although the name would imply idiocy, this is actually one of the most advanced regions, with Pizza Delivery being a finer point.

The region consists of nations that are secondary to main nations. Main nations go to the Union of Leftist States.

In the UoIML, we strive to be a better, more unique nation from all the others, and people do say we are special.
