DOWN WITH DEMOCRACY

THE POWER MUST BE HELD BY ONE

Here in the The totalitarian States of Byzantine we believe in the downfall of democracy and the rise of autocracy. we think that a strong economic and military strong community is the key to peace and harmony in a debased and failing world.
We are a Friendly and Talkative place where all things are possible and all people can be brought in the light of The totalitarian States of Byzantine.
Don&#39;t forget to endorse our WA Delegate and our glorious Dictator.
