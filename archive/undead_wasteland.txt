[b][color=#8c0101][u]Welcome to the undead wasteland.[/u][/color][/b]
[hr]
[b]This region exists because people in Z-Day may be pro-zombie, but are susceptible to attacks from assault squads and cure missiles.[/b] This is to protect those who hold zombies dear, and also because there are people who are comprised entirely of zombies 24/7, and this is a refuge for those who want to have their zombies co-exist peacefully with other zombies. The living are welcomed, as long as they don&#39;t disturb the peace.
