Westeros Asunder is an alternate timeline starting in the Year 300 AC and in which the Dance of Dragons never happened. Our tale opens during what has become known as the &quot;Tears of Dawn&quot; following the close of a 10-year winter during which the Blue Fever ravaged much of the continent. It is uncertain as the Iron Throne sits empty, the Great Houses have succumbed to the sickness, and the North remains locked in winter and silent to all in the South.
