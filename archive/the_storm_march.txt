Welcome to The Storm March, 

We are a loose association of states that work together to preserve democracy, freedom and economic prosperity for all. We share common cultural, historical and ethnic ties and the millitaries of the region often work together to promote peace and security in the region and near by states.
 
The Storm March has a common currency that is used and the regional assembly is working on formalising an agreement to allow freedom of movement and goods within the Storm March regional area, which is expected to be formalised at the end of 2013. The Storm March regional assembly sits on the banks of the River Tarth in the  city of Kalmar.
