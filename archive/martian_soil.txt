Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere. It suffers from electronic destroying fines, fierce katabatic dust storms and debilitating low gravity. It is a dry world, with no liquid water on its surface.

However, Mars was officially colonized in 2083 by explorers from a series of UNMA sponsored landings. While it has seen home to many outposts and science bases, a mass exodus of this scale has never been attempted. Only time will tell what fate awaits these brave colonists.

DIVISIONS: Mars is largely unclaimed, save for the landing zones occupied by UNMA robots, equipment and materials.

UNMA STATUS: The UNMA is unopposed on Mars.
