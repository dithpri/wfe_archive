Trump is a sadist who doesn&#39;t care about you, or America, or even his own family. His only loyalty is to himself. He is completely devoid of honor and integrity. He is incorrigible. He believes the rules that govern others in society don&#39;t apply to him, thus he never learned to comport himself as an adult. He is a failure in business who inherited what money he once had and has long since lost it all. And he is a physical coward. Like most people who talk tough, he is all talk. In the face of danger, he will always show the white feather, but he will never hesitate to put others in harm&#39;s way to achieve his self-serving ends. And also, he is in deep financial debt to Vladimir Putin and other Russian elites, so he will always put them first.
