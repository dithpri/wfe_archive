Welcome to the [region]The Galaxy[/region], which is quite a small place, despite its name. (Probably like the galaxy on Orion&amp;#39;s belt in Men In Black.)

It is a free land, but easy to conquer. If you are a raider, we welcome your presence and hope you will be kind while ruling us with an iron fist.

We have free candy! (Although we don&amp;#39;t know where we hid it...)

Embassy Requests Welcome!
Please endorse the WA Delegate, [nation]Ideaofcreation[/nation]! Thank You.
