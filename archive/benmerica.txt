[b]Benmerica[/b] is a region for conservative, capitalist, or fascist nations. That said, we welcome all nation types (except for communist dictatorships and non-human nations, which will be put on a direct one-way flight to [region]The Rejected Realms[/region]). The official language of the region is English, but nations can have their own languages as well.
