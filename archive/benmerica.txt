[i]We are the world&amp;#39;s greatest single region
We are strong, we are proud, we are free!
Come and join us today in our legion
To our great God, we will honor thee!

We have hundreds of years of tradition
Not to mention our rights and our laws!
Imperialism is our ambition
Dominating the world is our cause!

Every one of us men is a hero
Who will fight till their very last breath!
Or the foe&amp;#39;s been reduced to a zero
Either way, we are not scared of death!

We will all rather die than be treated
With a yoke on our necks like a slave!
We swear that you&amp;#39;ll not be defeated
O Benmerica, home of the brave![/i]
