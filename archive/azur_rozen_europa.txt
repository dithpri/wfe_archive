[b][color=blue]&quot;Rozen der Hoffnung. F&uuml;r das Vaterland.&quot;[/color][/b]
[hr]A region to contain a multitude of ideas and projects that seem to go nowhere.
[hr][i]A group of witches sit around a table, sipping coffee and tea and dining on cookies and cake. They laugh and talk amongst themselves. Scattered around are various crystals, fragments of reality. They peer into these crystals, holding different ones high and examining the reflections inside, all while laughing and talking and discussing.

The table sits in a grey, ashen landscape. The perfect backdrop for the witches&#39; games. Off in the distance, a sea crashes along the shore. A sea of tiny crystals. A sea of stories and realities.

It is an endless Walpurgisnacht and the witches&#39; revelry never ends.[/i]
