A loose confederation of nations under the protection of the High King/Queen of Gaels, and accept him/her as a head of state either as a figurehead or a true power in the local government.

The benefits of joining the Commonwealth are as follows:

1: A guarantee of protection from the High Monarch of Gaels.

2: Access to Royal Gaelic Military technology and training.

And more will be considered as we develop.
