The Union of Sovereign Nations, shortened to the Sovereign Nations, is a region aiming to unite Role-playing sovereign nations that are interested in spreading Liberty, Equality and Freedom, or LEF. If you would like to join us in spreading LEF and helping each other, then join the Sovereign Nations! We can Role-play in most time periods, though the region is mostly built around Modern and Post-Modern Tech.
