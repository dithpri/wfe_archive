[b][color=005694]Loyalty and Unification[/color][/b]

[i]Unexpectedly, total war between [nation]Cisselania[/nation] and [nation]Transselania[/nation] has broken out once again. With neither side willing to compromise, the [region]Unification Committee[/region] is an attempt to persuade them to reconcile. Among the chaos, several other powers have decided to plant a knife in the back of the already shattered [nation]Selanese Empire[/nation]. Will Selania restore its former glory under a strong unifier, or will it be permanently forgotten from the people&#39;s memories?[/i]

[b]This region is NOT for your embassy collection fantasies. Any unwarranted embassy requests will be rejected.[/b]
