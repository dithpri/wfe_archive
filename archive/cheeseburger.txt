Talking. Squabbling. Chucking people off of cliffs. That&amp;#39;s pretty much what happens here. [color=red]Chee[/color][color=lightgrey]seb[/color][color=blue]urger[/color] is a place full of [color=red]c[/color][color=orange]o[/color][color=yellow]l[/color][color=green]o[/color][color=blue]r[/color][color=indigo]f[/color][color=violet]u[/color]l individuals of all shapes and sizes - cheerful, intelligent, vicious, depressed, some everything at once. Pariah or messiah, otaku or jock, kawaii shota boy or hot Catholic school girl, all are welcome in [color=red]Chee[/color][color=lightgrey]seb[/color][color=blue]urger[/color].

So pull up a chair, beware of the cliff (and Nord too, he glomps!), and make yourself at home.
