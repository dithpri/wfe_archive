The Northern Democratic Union of Nations is a region that accepts all nations that seek to have a voice and an opinion. Joining The Northern Democratic Union of Nations would have already made you one step closer to that. To have a voice in your nation and your region is great but having a voice in the world is even better. To do this it is advised that you join the World Assembly if you decide on joining the region.
