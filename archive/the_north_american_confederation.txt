The North American Confederation

The North American Confederation was founded after The Deseret Civil War of 1881. The resulting conflict ended with the formation of a separate Deseret Nation called the Nation of the True Deseret. The Heads of State along with 25 delegates from their respective nation form the Confederation Council and the Confederation Congress. The purpose of the N.A.C is to ensure the safety of the nations on the North American Continent.
