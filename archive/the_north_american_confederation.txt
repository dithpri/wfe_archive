The North American League

The North American League was founded after The Deseret Civil War of 1881. The resulting conflict ended with the formation of a separate Deseret Nation called the Nation of the True Deseret. The Heads of State along with 25 delegates from their respective nation form the League. The purpose of the N.A.L is to ensure the safety of the nations on the North American Continent.
