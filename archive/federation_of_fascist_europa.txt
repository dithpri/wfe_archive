Federation of Fascist Europa.

Independent Nations of Europe with each of their respective identities intact.

Under the leadership of Germany, the Fascist Federation of Europe seeks to unite Europe under military cooperation only.

Every nation within the Fascist Federation must have laws oriented towards promoting Volksgemeinschaft, a single state super-culture, and some form of Hitler Youth type academies for young ones.
