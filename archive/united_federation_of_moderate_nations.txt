Founded in the cold winter of December 2017, The United Federation of Moderate Nations provides a haven for those that prioritize the needs of the people, the good of the needy, and the stewardship of the planet. We welcome all nations and all founders who live and rule by the principles of tolerance, respect and unity.

We invite you to take your place here in our young, modest region to shape it as your own. Start an RP, become a member of the World Assembly, or get involved in regional politics - the choice is yours!
