n February 2011, the city was the scene of violent protests. There were reports of the military and mercenaries being sent to &amp;quot;likely trouble spots&amp;quot;, sections of the city being cordoned off, killings, and the destruction of the homes of those suspected of anti-Gadhafi regime sympathies. At least 200 people were killed in the protests against the government.

On 21 February, the city was taken by Gadhafi opponents, who founded the National Transitional Council days later. It was the site of the turning point of the 2011 Libyan civil war, when Libyan Army forces hoping to score a decisive victory against the NTC in its de facto capital attacked Benghazi only to be dealt a crippling defeat at the hands of the French Air Force on 19 March
