[b]Day 71: A whole lot has happened since the cave incident for us. First off, Sean and Matthew are still gone, and Danny may or may not still be in the cave. Or he might be dead. I like to be optimistic, so I like to believe he died a quick and painless death. My group is now focusing on survival. We have built a sort of camp town and most of us hunt or fish or even gather water. Survival is starting to look like an option for us.[/b]
