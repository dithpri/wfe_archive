[b]Day 55: I have been observing Sean for a while. While it is amusing to note that he has not, in fact, gotten any better, he is also starting to annoy me. I can&amp;#39;t understand a single thing he says and does. His favorite activity, at the moment, is to look at his reflection in a pool. He stares at it with disbelief and wonder, as if he cannot understand why there is a reflection or if someone who looks like him is staring back. He has spent hours doing this.[/b]
