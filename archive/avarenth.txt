[b]Day 10: The creature has released its grip on my shoulder and pounced onto Jonathon. He thought it was adorable and tried to give him kisses as it latched its teeth onto his metal hand, rather ineffectively since it can&amp;#39;t bite through metal. Also, we found a gun. Which is great cause we have needed a weapon besides Jonathon&amp;#39;s metal hand. Unfortunately, Conner left it on a rock and a slime ate it... Much to the slime&amp;#39;s surprise, and our horror, it appears slimes can fire guns whenever they hop... We are running from it...[/b]
