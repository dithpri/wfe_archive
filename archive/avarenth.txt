[b]Hello Avarenthians! I have returned! It&#39;s a miracle, it&#39;s a complete surprise, it was a [i]horrible[/i] decision! I had adjusted to life without NS and now I am back. I can feel the addiction settling in even now as I write this. What have I done? Stupid. Anyway, order is restored and democracy will be enforced ASAP.[/b]
