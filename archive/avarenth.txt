[b][color=lime]AGN&amp;#39;s troops are at the border of Avarenth. Upon closer examination, it is obvious that only solders from Daniel&amp;#39;s and Ben&amp;#39;s nations have come. They look forward steadfastly at the large Avarenth army right in front of them. Upon this they see they are clearly outnumbered 20 to 1. They do not flee though, instead, they marched straight to their deaths with their heads held high.[/b][/color]
