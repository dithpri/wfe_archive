[b]Day 12: We read over the page that we found. To our amazement, we realized that it was in Matthew&amp;#39;s handwriting. We decided that he and Sean must have been keeping a day entry journal of their own while separated from us. But what we read upon that page did not bode well, and I&amp;#39;m scared about what&amp;#39;s happened to them. And beyond that, having read that ominous text, I&amp;#39;m afraid about what&amp;#39;s going to happen to us if we stay here much longer...[/b]
