Tired of being ejected by crazed psychotic dictators for no good reason? Join us. We are nice, friendly people who won&amp;#39;t kill you. Maybe...
Depends on what day it is.

[b]Day 17: It seems the monsters don&amp;#39;t enjoy light or fire. They stay just outside of its reach. It is the only reason we are still alive right now. The weapons and armor were too old to be usable at all. They practically crumbled when we picked them up. We scavenge for food and water during the day and try not to be killed at night. Things are getting worse. I fear it is going to rain soon...[/b]
