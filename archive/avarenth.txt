Tired of being ejected by crazed psychotic dictators for no good reason? Join us. We are nice, friendly people who won&amp;#39;t kill you. Maybe...
Depends on what day it is.

[b]Day 14: We are running. They are getting closer and closer. Personally we decided to flee and risk torture because torture sounds better than death to us. Of course, we decided it before we entered this dark forest. Now, maybe a quick death wouldn&amp;#39;t be so bad. We have no idea what to do. Certain death is behind us and probable death is in front of us. Fatigue is getting to us. If we don&amp;#39;t escape now, I doubt we will make it.[/b]
