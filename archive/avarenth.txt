Depends on what day it is.

[b]Day 28: We should have stayed in the town. To be honest, I have no idea what happened. We were just traveling and the next thing we know is we are tied up in a cave. Didn&amp;#39;t even see who got us. I can here hushed voices that seem to echo throughout the entire cave. Jonathon and Daniel are gone right now, taken by the unknown captors. I can only imagine they are being tortured and interrogated. I am trying to reach the arrow in my back pocket. If I can get it, we can get out of this mess.[/b]
