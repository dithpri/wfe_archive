[b]Day 58: Sean is getting better now. He is not longer completely stupid, but, instead, he is a mindless servant with no free thought of his own. Actually, he could be getting worse. I don&amp;#39;t care. Sean is now more fun then he has ever been. I know, taking advantage of him in this poor state might seem to be wrong, but he is enjoying himself. At least, when I tell him he is having fun while he gives me a foot massage.[/b]
