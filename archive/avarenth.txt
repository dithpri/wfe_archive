[b]Day 24: Jonathan and John got into a fight over an apple today. After Jonathan won, John went insane and lost a fight to a tree. We found Sean&amp;#39;s arm, or someones arm, next to a map, the map depicts landmarks in the area. If they are correct, a village with an X over it is not far right from a big rock. Maybe Sean and Matthew are there. There is a word scribbled on the map, but it is in a weird language. We think it says cannibals. We should ask the village to translate it.[/b]
