[b]Day 9: On our long journey, Conner said he found tracks of some type of creature and, for some weird reason, we started following them. I think we lost our common sense or something. After following the tracks for a while, we came upon a cave. The open cavern gave off a menacing aura that made us jump back. We stood frozen in fear, for it seemed like darkness itself resonated from there. Then, in less than a second, a monster leaped out and bit into my shoulder. His teeth sunk into my flesh as I cried out in pain.[/b]
