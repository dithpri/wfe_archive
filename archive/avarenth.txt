[b]Day 27: It is time to move out. I decided to keep the arrow just as a potential weapon and to study it more, though, I doubt I will discover anything of great importance. The search for Matthew and Sean is back again, but I can tell any further attempts will be futile. I hate saying it, but I can tell it is what everyone is thinking. After a couple more days, we will probably stop looking for them. We choice a path to take and we started down it.[/b]
