[b]Day 15: I don&amp;#39;t know how we made it this far. Sean and I don&amp;#39;t have a clue as to how we managed to stay ahead and keep ourselves alive all this time. Good news, we found a hut in the middle of the forest to stay in. I don&amp;#39;t know why it is here, but it showed signs that human life lived here before, albeit a long time ago. We still hear the rhinos stampeding around and we also hear, oddly, gunshots as well. Hunger and thirst are our main problems now and we have yet to find a solution. I wonder if slimes are edible...[/b]
