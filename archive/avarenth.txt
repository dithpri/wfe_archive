[b][color=blue]&amp;#39;There was a man who would wreck his car nearly every time he drove it. When finally asked by a policeman why he couldn&amp;#39;t drive well, he said &amp;quot;Oh, I can drive well, officer. It&amp;#39;s just that my Driver&amp;#39;s Ed. teacher told me not to be wreckless with my driving.&amp;quot;&amp;#39; ~ Matthew (Yup, this is a pun he created; sent it to me on Wednesday)[/color][/b]
