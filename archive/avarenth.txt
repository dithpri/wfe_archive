Tired of being ejected by crazed psychotic dictators? Join us. We are nice, friendly people who won&amp;#39;t kill you. Maybe...
Depends on what day it is.

[b]Day &amp;quot;I lost count because it is hard to track days when you are in a cave bound by rope&amp;quot;: I just got out. Heck if I know how it all happened. We were in the for a while and they kept interrogating us. All of a sudden it was my turn and things went crazy. Arrows, or spars, whizzed by as they hit our captors. One happened to cut the rope that bound my hand, but it did give me a pretty nasty cut as well.  I ran back to the room where everyone else was, or I thought I did. I am lost now...[/b]
