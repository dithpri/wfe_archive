[b]Day 8: We made some great progress today. We ran into some new monsters- slimes to be specific. Boy, was that fun. Daniel got trapped inside one and we spent most of the day looking for ways to get him out. Finally, we threw the slime, with him still in it, into the lake. Don&amp;#39;t know why we didn&amp;#39;t think of that before. Jonathon told us he had a dream in which he wielded an incinerator cannon and he blew us all up. We all decided to stay away from him while he was asleep...[/b]
