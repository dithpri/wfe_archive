[b]Day 53: I have spent weeks in this cave. At least, I think I have. Time is not something that is easy to calculate when in total darkness. I have kept myself alive by forcing to eat things I would rather not speak of. The goblins seem to be following the orders of even darker creatures that come up from the dark pits of the cave.[/b]
