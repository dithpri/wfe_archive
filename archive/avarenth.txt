[b]Day 25: The town was a dead end. No one was there and it looked as if it had been that way for a long time. All it did was show us that intelligent life once lived here. Of course, now it doesn&amp;#39;t. Other than us, I guess. All in all, it just makes me feel worse. Life once lived here and it was intelligent. Then what the heck happened to them? I have a feeling that the cause of their demise is the darkness we felt before.[/b]
