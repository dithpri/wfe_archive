Tired of being ejected by crazed psychotic dictators for no good reason? Join us. We are nice, friendly people who won&amp;#39;t kill you. Maybe...
Depends on what day it is.

[b]Day 19: The rhinos ravaged the hut. We barely got out alive. The metal stick was utterly useless against the stampede. It didn&amp;#39;t do anything against the thick hides of the rhinos. It really only agitated them as Sean hit them repeatedly. So now we are running again. We do have some good news. The rhinos ran back the other way. We don&amp;#39;t have to deal with them anymore.[/b]
