[b]Day 75: For the past few days we have been working on our camp-town diligently to ensure that it is completed soon. We finally finished it just yesterday and have been taking a break since then,putting the camp to good use. Next, I believe we should build some kinda defenses. Who knows what else is out there? I plan to not only fight them next time, but beat them as well.[/b]
