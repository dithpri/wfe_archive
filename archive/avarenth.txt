[b]Day 26: We discovered very little in the ghost town that was of any use. I doubt Sean and Matthew came through this way, for the town seemed undisturbed before we came here. In a group discussion, we decided to stay here for one more night to rest up before we head out to search again. Although no one liked the town, we figured it was safer here. I did find one interesting thing. An arrow was lodged one one of the sides of the houses. It looked recent, like it had just been used a few days ago.[/b]
