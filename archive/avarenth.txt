[b]Day 16: Matthew and I are inside the hut to try and protect ourselves from the onslaught of rhinos about to come down on us. We hear a bubbling noise coming from the floor. We pull away the rotten floorboards to discover a vat full of some sort of molten metal. There are casts for weapons and armor around... We might actually be able to defend ourselves...[/b]
