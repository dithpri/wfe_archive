Depends on what day it is.

[b]Day 20: It is Thanksgiving, or, at least, I think it is. The hunt for Sean and Matthew is still on and we still have no clue as to which way they went in the forest. Best clue we have is a bunch of sticks bundled together in an attempt to make a fire. There are no footprints to follow thanks to the recent rain and I fear that whatever got Sean and Matthew might be coming after us. I don&amp;#39;t really have much to be thankful for, other than the fact that at least some of us are still alive...[/b]
