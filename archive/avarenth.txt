[b]Day 59: Sean being my personal slav- I mean, my new best friend is going great. We are now making great progress each day in building a shelter. Sean doesn&amp;#39;t need breaks as long as you don&amp;#39;t tell him he does. I am worried that the berries effects are wearing off even more. He actually asked me a question out of blue today. &amp;quot;Does this unit have a soul?&amp;quot; he asked. I think I need to make him eat some more. For the good of every one, of course.[/b]
