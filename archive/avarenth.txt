[b]Day 54: Sean ate some berries he found in the forest. He said, and I quote, &amp;quot;I need something to eat. I can&amp;#39;t take it anymore. Must have food.&amp;quot; I, for one, decided to not take that chance and, instead, watched what would happen. It was indeed amusing. Sean&amp;#39;s face first became expressionless, then it became one that was clueless and devoid of intelligence. &amp;quot;Mitatur, shony!&amp;quot;, he exclaimed with foam rushing out of his mouth. We shall see if the effects are permanent.[/b]
