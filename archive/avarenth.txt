[b]Day 60: I totally forgot which berries Sean ate. Deciding to try and find it anyway, I looked in the forest hoping that, if I saw it, I would remember. Unfortunately, I couldn&amp;#39;t remember at all and I contemplated on whether or not to just feed him some berries and hope for the best. Of course, when I write it down, it makes me sound heartless. I guess Sean will just have to regain his intelligence. It is probably for the best.[/b]
