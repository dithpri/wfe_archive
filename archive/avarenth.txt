[b]Day 18: The rain is pouring down as we work on making new weapons in the basement of the hut. The ones we found may have been old and unusable, but the forge isn&amp;#39;t. The only real problems is our lack of experience and knowledge in the field of forging. The only successful thing we made made is a metal stick and even that is crude and ineffective.[/b]
