[b]Day 76: So, Sean decided to try and get back at me for &amp;quot;taking advantage&amp;quot; of the berry situation. It was really kind of a lame comeback. He decided that the best way to get back at me was give me some random berries to eat. I ate them and fell down sick. Apparently he hadn&amp;#39;t considered the fact that it might be poison. Anyways, I am stuck in bed, poisoned with a poison we don&amp;#39;t know about. If I ever live through this, Sean is going to pay...[/b]
