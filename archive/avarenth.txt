[b]Day 7: It has been a week since we came here. I can&amp;#39;t believe we are all alive. Well, we don&amp;#39;t know if Sean and Matthew are. The problem is, I can feel the dark presence following behind us as we move forward. The constant presence doesn&amp;#39;t help us as we move along. We stumbled into some of those rats today. Jonathon made great efforts to try and slap them with his new hand. He only ended up slapping himself. It made us all smile and I could feel some of our spirit come back, if only for a second.[/b]
