[b][color=003399]Welcome to the Pacific Republic!
Founded June 11th, 2016.[/b][/color][hr]We have risen from the dead.....yay

Welcome to our little region that our residents love and would enjoy new nations to move in. Not many elections are happening but hopefully there is going to be more. You can enjoy chatting with your friendly neighborhood nations or just snooping around our history, or other things here, if your into that. BUTT(ha-ha get it) we would like no cursing or anything offensive being said here, unless necessary...........Anyway just...like I don&#39;t know...stick around and maybe, just maybe you&#39;ll like it here to.
