In 1787, the world saw the birth of a nation - a nation that, for the first time, attempted to limit its own government as much as possible while providing its citizens with the greatest amount of freedom. But within our changing world today, we find that more and more nations, as well as extremist groups, are becoming a greater threat. The lack of education of freedom and fundamental liberties has left our world&#39;s citizens vulnerable to attacks from intellectuals will ill intents. That is why, the United Nations Complex (UNC) is the government of governments. And, as is the motto of the United States of Arkanios: Strength through freedom. Unity through transparency.
