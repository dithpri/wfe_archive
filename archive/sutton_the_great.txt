Hello. This is Zoe. I presume you all received the same telegram, but I will rephrase it.
Only one nation in the region is allowed to be in the World Assembly. I don&#39;t know why. The telegram suggests we might be shut down because of it. But I suggest we all resign and have Mr Stevens stay as our World Assembly member. I assume that means I will no longer be the WA Delegate, but that isn&#39;t important.

So please do resign from being a WA member.
Thanks you.
