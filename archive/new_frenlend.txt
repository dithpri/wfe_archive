New Frenlend, a 600mi by 600mi square carved out of the various small islands that make up Canada&amp;#39;s most northern region. Yes it&amp;#39;s very cold and there are massive snowstorms that come every so often; but with recent breakthroughs in fourth demensional infrared grid plane computer technology, environmental weather stabilizers, and a small mass relay; the weather in New Frenlend can be turned from the icy cold tundra into four seasons via an elctronic radio signal and computer algerithem. At the moment New Frenlend is small and mostly uninhabited, but with the help of other nations moving and helping here; New Frenlend could grow to become a powerful region with massive influence in Nation States.
