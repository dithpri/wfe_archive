The UDSR is an independent supranational union with democratic socialist tendencies. The member states in the Kalmar Union should be inoffensive centrists or democratic socialists. To be eligible to apply to become a member state, a nation must be one of these. The leading state will be elected by the other member states. The World Assembly Delegate of the Union is to be determined by vote from representatives from each member state.
