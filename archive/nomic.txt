[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic][b]Nomic[/b][/url] is a game that differs from almost every other one, because it is played by changing the rules. Named after nomos (Greek for &#39;law&#39;), it was created by Peter Suber as a physical game, claiming to be modeled on modern government systems. However, it has been since adapted to be played online, with some online Nomic games spanning over a decade.
