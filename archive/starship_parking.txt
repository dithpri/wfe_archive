Hi! Over Here, You can Rent Starships, Park Them(leave puppets here), if you&amp;#39;re in StarFleet!

Renting a nation means you get a starship nation to do what you want with it, but if you change the pass or do something against the rules, you&amp;#39;re
Banned, gotcha?

Main Nation: [region]starfleet starships[/region]

Anyway, Ask Shojan for the pass!
More Starships on the way!

Have Fun!
