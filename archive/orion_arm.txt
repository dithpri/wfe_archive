The Orion Arm is the arm of the Milky Way containing the planet Earth, but this region is not restricted to Orion specifically! Join Orion if you wish for some semi-serious space rp. To protect this region from invaders, it is permanently represented by Eperkor.

The region uses FT:FTL for RP purposes and an [url=http://s13.zifboards.com/Orion_Arm/index.php]offsite forum[/url] that all new region members must register themselves on.

Since Orion Arm is a [b]very[/b] new region, it is still being worked on. New members are welcome to contribute to its building.
