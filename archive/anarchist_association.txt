The Anarchist Association (AA) is a group of nations with one common goal: freedom for all. This freedom is something that must be spread throughout all the nations on this damned planet. This means force will be applied. When this freedom is obtained in nations, their nations will have to have strict laws on hard crimes, such as arson and murder. Certain crimes however, such as rape and violence will be allowed, for they do not kill people. But if you are caught after curfew you will be executed on the spot, for we need some rules to establish this freedom. 

Enough about the rules, lets get into your recruitment! Contact Incustoditus for recruitment. The AA will come out strong in the long run, you can trust my word!
