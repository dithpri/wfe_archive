The Anarchist Association is a new region for nations whose governments do not interfere with their citizens&#146; rights and freedoms. 

This is an alternative to the old, stale regions with too many people and offers a fresh, exciting way to get involved.

At the time of the Association&#146;s start, Pargbai is a new country that is trying to figure out the rules of this game, and invites other new nations to join!
