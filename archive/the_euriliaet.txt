The Euriliaet refers to an alternative universe, whereby another continent, that is, Eurilia, is situated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Do note that the Euriliaet may refer to other nations which are a result of this... alternate timeline. These include other states all over the world, including ones in the Baltic, Caucasus and even space aliens (because why the heck not?). 

This factbook needs working on; however, since the world will end up looking like a lopsided potato if Eurilia did exist, there is little sense in making it sound logical geographically.
