The Wild North is a diverse landscape, from mountains and forests to rivers and valleys. Often hit with harsh snowstorms in the winter accompanied by temperatures that can drop to -30 degrees below, the population are hardy and brave. Blue-collar work (mining, logging, manufacturing, etc) is the most common form of work, and is the backbone of the nation, as well as military service.

The summers are often wet and mild. Hunting, fishing, and other &quot;survival&quot; skills are taught to almost every young child. The nation has the mindset of &quot;strong vs weak&quot;, in that if you choose to be weak, you will be left behind. Only the strong survive.
