Formerly a unified nation, the Muffin Republic was shattered in the Great War of the Muffin when rebels from the autonomous region of Badnamistan overthrew the federal government claimed all land west of the River Francisco in the name of Badnamistan. They declared their regional governor, Willis IV, the Immortal Emperor of Muffin, but he only holds functional authority over areas conquered during the revolution.  Most supporters of the former Muffinian government fled to the now independent autonomous region of Malenomenia, but many other entities also claim sovereignty over areas of the former Muffin Republic.  Badnamistan, however, is internationally recognized as the successor to the Muffin Empire.
