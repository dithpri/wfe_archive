&quot;The Fascist conception of the state is all embracing&quot;
- Giovanni Gentile, the co-founder to Fascism

The Revolutionary Communist Alliance was successfully destroyed on the 21st of November, 2018 (AEST). The Red Threat has once again been utterly crushed by the might of the Fascist powers for the sake of the Nationalist cause. 

I would like to thank the two following regions:

The Iron Confederacy 
(Link: https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_iron_confederacy) 

and

The Fifth Empire
(Link: https://www.nationstates.net/region=fifth_empire)

It was due to their military service that led to this victory against the scum that Communism!

The Revolutionary Communist Alliance shall remain in the military occupation of the Iron Confederacy until further notice.

Glory to the Fascist Cause!
