In December 2014 this peaceful region was cynically invaded by combined WA nations from [region]The North Pacific[/region] , [region]The South Pacific[/region] and [region]Europeia[/region] in what was euphemistically described as a &amp;quot;training exercise&amp;quot;

The experience caused such distress to the inhabitants that the region was abandoned by them and they relocated to Grand Fandom Alliance

This region has been refounded by The Reef Hounds as a lasting reminder of the insidious acts that the aforementioned regions are capable of.

In February 2015 the region was subject to a &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; raid. 
Therefore regional controls have been suspended to remove the region from the invasion cycle.
