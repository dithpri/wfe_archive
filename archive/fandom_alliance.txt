In December 2014 this peaceful region was cynically invaded by combined WA nations from various regions in what was euphemistically described as a [B]&amp;quot;training exercise&amp;quot;[/B]

The experience caused such distress to the inhabitants that the region was abandoned by them and they relocated to [region]Grand Fandom Alliance[/region]

This region has been refounded by The Reef Hounds of The West Pacific as a lasting reminder of the insidious acts that &amp;quot;The Great and The Good&amp;quot; are capable of.
