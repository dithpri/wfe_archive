Welcome to The Alliance for Democratic Freedoms (ADF) is a groundbreaking international initiative aimed at strengthening the bonds between free and democratic countries worldwide. Born out of a shared commitment to the principles of democracy, human rights, and individual freedoms, ADF seeks to foster collaboration among nations that uphold these core values. In a world where authoritarianism and threats to democracy persist, ADF stands as a beacon of hope and unity.
