Welcome back! The new region is just a temporary setup, but head over to  http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;t=239079 to start role-playing with the former Peschici nations (as well as any new nations). Tell everyone from old Peschici that we&amp;#39;re all playing again. I love you.
