[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were enjoying their morning in their favorite tea shop, the [color=#005A00]Jasmine Dragon[/color] when they heard an awfully loud noise coming from outside the walls of [region]The City of Ba Sing Se[/region] as curious as they were, they knew they were safe in the city. They all knew that there was no danger. They sipped their tea peacefully, tuning out any noises they heard, knowing for sure and certain that there were no nukes in Ba Sing Se.
