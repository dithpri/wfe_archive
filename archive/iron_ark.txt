Formed by the Federal Republic of Phignus in 10/12/21

A newfound region where discipline is highly exercised with Phignus at its center. The region is open for a nation that is treating its citizens with propriety, but at the same time, is willing to grip them by the neck without hesitation. The region&#39;s gates are open for those who are part of the World Assembly, but the region will remain sailing as an &quot;Iron Ark&quot; in the middle of the seas.

Oppressed? Shackled? Suffocating? I, the leader of Phignus, do not care. Any form of law and authority, no matter how beneficial or detrimental, is a shackle at its core. Human Rights Law is a glorified name for a pitifully small restriction of freedom.
