We have one goal, a goal to preserve one of the greatest and most censored ideologies of our time. Right-Wing Populism. 

We will do whatever is necessary to protect our nations cultural identities from foreign ideas and people, and we will take care of our people, for it is our humble duty. Though we prefer democratic nations join us, we do allow authoritarian nations to join, for we believe that sometimes the most perfect democracies can appear as tyranny.
