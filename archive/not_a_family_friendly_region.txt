[b]Welcome to NFFR! (our existance is disputed, but we do exist!)[/b]

[i]Former land and home of &amp;#127350;&amp;#127358;&amp;#127347;, nowadays a wasteland of sin and death. Anime is now rampant, there&#39;s raiders and the ocean is full of plastic! yep a great place to live, I must say, but anyway I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t give a sh#t about any of this, so let&#39;s get to the point. If NFFR is to be a great region again (which never was and it might not even exist.) we need your help, there&#39;s 7 needles. why 7 in the first place and why they&#39;re needles you might ask? well it&#39;s a long history which I can&#39;t bother to tell ya, but basically if you want to restore this hell for some reason, pull each of them and hOOraY yoU Have savEd Us I guESS, but really NFFR is never coming back together like ever.[/i]
