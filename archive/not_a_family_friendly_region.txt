This region is now under control by the Pan-European Alliance, we&#39;re only making changes according to [nation]Colin Advance Wars[/nation]&#39; wishes and restore his rightful place to NAFFR. Apologies for nearly letting this slide, we&#39;re going to ensure that this region not only adheres to Colin&#39;s policies but also our own. This is not considered [b]raiding[/b]. If you wish to return your region to what it used to be, ask the officer from [nation]Sturmdrungen[/nation] first.

Otherwise, welcome to NAFFR, home to what used to be one of Colin&#39;s main regions. A light-touch approach to religion has returned to Europe and NAFFR as promised, but don&#39;t use it for violent means.
