Historians of the Wild West have written about the mythic West; the west of western literature, art and of people&#39;s shared memories. The phenomenon is &quot;the Imagined West&quot;. The &quot;Code of the West&quot; was an unwritten, socially agreed upon set of informal laws shaping the cowboy culture of the Old West.Over time, the cowboys developed a personal culture of their own, a blend of values that even retained vestiges of chivalry.
