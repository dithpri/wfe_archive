The League of Philosophy was founded by Giuseppe Croce in 1919. It was an organization of international philosophers, intellectuals, scholars, and writers that was intended to promote principles and ethics that are often called Croceist philosophy.
 
Croce called for a &#147;renaissance of modern philosophy&#148; and developed it in modern liberalism with economically and socially conservative beliefs. The League was disbanded in 1943 by Benito Mussolini. However, it was revived after the fall of Fascism in 1945. Today, the League of Philosophy is part of the International Croce Society. Croce is the founder of modern Croceist philosophy.&nbsp;
