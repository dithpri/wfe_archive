The League of Philosophy was founded by Giuseppe Croce in 1919 who opposed the rise of fascism, socialism, and communism of the time calling them the most dangerous ideologies of mankind. 
It was an organization of international philosophers, intellectuals, scholars, and writers that was intended to promote principles and ethics that are often called Croceist philosophy.

Croce called for a &#147;renaissance of modern philosophy&#148; and developed it in classical liberalism with economic and social conservatism.
