The [b]League of Philosophy[/b] was founded by [b]Giuseppe Croce[/b] in 1919. 

It is an organization of international philosophers, intellectuals, scholars, and writers that was intended to promote principles and ethics that are often called Croceist philosophy.
 
Croce called for a &#147;renaissance of modern philosophy&#148; and developed it in classical liberalism with economical and social conservatism. 

The League was disbanded in 1943 by the orders of Benito Mussolini who saw it as a threat to his regime. 

However, it was revived after the fall of fascism in 1945. 

Today, the League of Philosophy is part of the International Croce Society and what is revived numerous times throughout the history of its existence.
