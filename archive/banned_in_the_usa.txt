We&#39;ve got white-collar people trying to grab our style
Saying we&#39;re too nasty and we&#39;re 2 Live
Corrupted politicians playing games
Bringing us down to boost their fame
They must be joking, thinking we will fall
But they&#39;re like flies movin&#39; the wall
We stand tall from beginning to end
With the help from fans and all our friends
Freedom of speech will never die
For us to have, our ancestors died
Don&#39;t keep thinking that we will quit
We&#39;ll always stand and never sit
We&#39;re 2 Live, too black, too strong
Doing the right thing, and not the wrong
So listen up, y&#39;all, to what we say
We won&#39;t be banned in the U-S-A!
