Each and every nation within the CGC aspires to be corrupt in their own special way. The founder nation, Big Money Central, aspires to become a corrupt capitalist nation that favours the rich and discriminates the poor and where big corporations dominate the markets and feed off low income citizens for profit. Hopefully many more nations will join the CGC in the future, and eventually reach our goal of accomplishing total corruption.
