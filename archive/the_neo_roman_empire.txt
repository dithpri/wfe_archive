After the end of the war. The world was unified under the rule of the Emperor. Thus his dream of unified world became reality. Now, in our greatest hour he began his noble and just crusade across the stars. No world will be beyond our rule. Nations we encountered have become allies and they have pleated their armies to our cause to rid the galaxy of the evil communists, democracies and alien species that threaten our existence. Our vast fleets and armies are ready to continue our founders legacy.
