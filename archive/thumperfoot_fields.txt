[b][i]Welcome to [region]Thumperfoot Fields[/region], heroes![/i][/b]

Beneath the earth across these fields lies a vast network of burrows and tunnels that serve as homes for countless numbers of the Rabbit Clan. Due to its location, Thumperfoot Fields is in dire need of protection from a variety of threats and so [nation=short]Elyssia the Wardress of Warrens[/nation] has come to keep watch over the land.

To protect her fellow rabbits, Elyssia wants to build a great wall around the fields and start expanding their underground settlement onto the surface. However, she&#39;s having trouble convincing them that it&#39;s the right choice as living underground has kept them safe. Whichever Clan scores the most points will convince the other rabbits, become Elyssia&#39;s ally and claim the region!
