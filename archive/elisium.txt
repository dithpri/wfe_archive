[color=#990000][b]Welcome to Elisium, a new region dedicated to both character and nation based roleplaying as well as a fun community![/b][/color]

[HR]

Elisium is based on the ideas that an RP region should actually roleplay, and that realism should serve roleplaying rather than the other way around. The region is Soft-MT, applying general MT standards while not going as far as to close off interesting RP ideas for realism reasons most of the time. The region is also meant to be on the smaller side, prioritizing a community over a region with dozens of members but no feeling of closeness.
