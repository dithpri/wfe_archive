Elisium&#39;s Industrial and Economical Community
Representing free and independent nations, and bearing in mind the good and interest of both these nations and the population of the entire Elisium, we are establishing an international organization that, through its activities in the sphere of industry and broadly understood economic issues, builds international bonds of cooperation and friendship, it will prevent conflicts and aggressive behavior between states.

We are convinced and sincerely hope to extend this cooperation to other nations and states.
