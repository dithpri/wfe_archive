The Confederation of Imperial States is, as the name suggests, a Confederation of Empires, Monarchies, Colonies, Protectorates and other nations that make up, once owned, or currently do own empires. Our goals are to preserve empires which may be threatened by new-age ideals, and ensure that territories remain owned by empires, protecting each other from the demands of communist or anti-imperialist nations who demand all nations release their territories, and to ally with other imperialist nations with similar interests.
