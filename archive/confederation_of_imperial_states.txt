[b]The Confederation of Imperial States[/b] is a collective assembly of like-minded imperialist nations and colonies who come together from a common need for security and comfort to rule our empires and defend our common interests.

We are an old region that has suffered from raiders and other issues in the past, but we have not let that hinder us. Shortly, we intend to be back on an even better RPing schedule. Some events are even being planned out now.

Feel free to join - you are always welcome here. We are currently rebuilding after several repelled invasions and a temporary lack of leadership, so any new members will be happily welcomed. If you wish to help contribute to the resurgence of an old region, come over and be welcomed.
