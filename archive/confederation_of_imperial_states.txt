Rebellion. Mob Rule. Oligarchy. These ideas threaten us. They threaten the very foundation of divine rule, asking all who rule to place their faith in the hands of lesser men, all lacking in virtue, much less the capacity to rule!

We are the Confederation of Imperial States; a Confederation of Empires, Monarchies and Protectorates. We seek to preserve and advance the righteous order of monarchy and noblesse oblige, today threatened by such new-age ideals as liberalism and mob rule.

Our Confederation is dedicated to the protection and preservation of divine rule from the demands of communist or anti-imperialist separatists. Let it be known: ours is a Confederation of Power and Strength.
