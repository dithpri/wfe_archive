Named after the second king of Nevarish, Octavius II, during the reign of which the regional mainland south-east of Nevarish was liberated from the tyranny of the Darish Empire.

The region&#39;s liberated peoples formed many nations, turning the now named continent of Octavia into a diverse land with an optimistic future.

Now, the Octavian people have shaped the continent in such a way that no evil-doers shall rule the land again. The future looks bright for Octavia as it&#39;s nations (some of which are now republics) are working together to ensure peace, democracy, equality and liberty for its people.
