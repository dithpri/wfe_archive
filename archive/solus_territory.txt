A place that has beautiful wildlife and prosperous people. It is fairly hidden from others by a magical force field protecting those within. The god that maintains it is Jeremy the Cow god. He brings life to those who have lost hope and takes it from those who haven&#39;t. If they have never lost hope they are not worthy of being in the presence of Jeremy.
