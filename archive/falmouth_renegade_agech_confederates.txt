In this world of treasure and pain, of lust, fame, fortune...and darkness...there stands a beacon amidst a pile of sludge. Where culture is as treasured as an immature rant at a degenerate, where the barfly is a romantic commodity, where the cosmic ballet reaches it&#39;s &#39;microcosm of moshpit-inspired lude degenerate state of drug induced frenzies of rank self-belief and subconsciously fascist meanderings on a wild ride...that place: FRAGECH Confederates. Welcome. Eat my muffin, MDK.
