The Royal Commonwealth of Nations is a political and cultural alliance of nations that recognise the British monarch as their head of state. It comprises territories and countries that were once part of the British Empire but have since achieved independence while preserving a symbolic link to the monarchy. These nations collaborate on shared values such as democracy, human rights, and economic development, whilst encouraging mutual support and cultural exchange. The Commonwealth highlights unity, respect for diversity, and common interests among its member states, despite their differing levels of political autonomy.
