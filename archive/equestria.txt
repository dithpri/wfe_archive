A blossoming region full of various Equestrian nations, this region seek peace and acceptance. Originally founded by [nation]Makrtopia[/nation], and now managed by its major World Assembly delegate, [nation]Untspah[/nation]. Equestria welcomes and invites anyone wanting a new home or a second chance with open arms. 

[i]To new nations: Be certain to join the World Assembly, and once you have, [b]don&amp;#39;t forget to endorse our regional delegate[/b]. Not only does this help strengthen them, it helps prevent hostile take-overs and invasions.
