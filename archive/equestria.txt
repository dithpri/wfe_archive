Tell a friend

[color=DA70D6]Yes we have returned! We did such a good job last time that nobody raided you for two years, yes yes we appreciate the gratitude all part of our region protection plan. Just here to renew your subscription free of charge![/color]

[color=orange]This raid brought to you by your fluffy friends at [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and our company of dashing villains from [region]The Kingdom of Alexandria[/region], [region]The Universal Allegiance[/region], [region]Arda en Estel[/region], [region]The Mafia[/region], [region]HYDRA Command[/region] and [region]The Order of the Sword[/region]![/color]

[color=DA70D6]To maximize friendship, please endorse the delegate and all RO&#39;s. Folks not being friends risk being un-invited to the party, and no one wants that![/color]

[color=orange][i]Reminder: Rule-breaking of any sort by any side will not be tolerated.[/i][/color]
