[b][color=#310061][region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] may not be the biggest region, but they do have a colt following- one which persists through all their attempts to stirrup trouble. Now, in recent times, detractors have tried to knock them off their high horse, but all attempts to rein them in seem doomed to fail! Tonight, their mane event is [region]Equestria[/region], a region that seemed just a bit too stable for their tastes, and so it got accidentally razed while Malice and friends were foaling around- truly a nightmare for the poor equine natives.
