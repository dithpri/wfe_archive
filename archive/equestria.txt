[Color=navy][b]It&#39;s a ca[i]sass[/i]trophe![/b][/color]

A blossoming empire full of various Equestrian nations, this region seeks peace and acceptance. Originally founded by [nation]Makrtopia[/nation], and currently managed by its major World Assembly delegate, [nation]Untspah[/nation], Equestria invites and welcomes with open arms anyone wanting a new home or second chance.

To new nations: [i][b]Please, be certain[/b][/i] to join the World Assembly, and once you have, don&#39;t forget to endorse our regional delegate. Not only does this help strengthen them, it helps prevent hostile take-overs and invasions. [i][b]And we don&#39;t want those to happen again, do we?[/b][/i]
