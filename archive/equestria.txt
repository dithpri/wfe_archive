A blossoming empire full of various Equestrian nations, this friendly region seeks peace and acceptance. Originally founded by [nation]Makrtopia[/nation], and currently managed by [nation]Untspah[/nation] as well as [nation=Dragoria], Equestria invites and welcomes with open arms anyone wanting a new home or second chance.

To new nations: [i][b]Please be certain[/b][/i] to join the World Assembly, and once you have, don&#39;t forget to endorse [nation=Untspah], our regional WA delegate. Not only does this help strengthen them, it helps prevent hostile takeovers and invasions, which we unfortunately have a sordid history with. [i][b]We don&#39;t want any more of those to happen again, do we?[/b][/i]
