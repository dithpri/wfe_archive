The Realmia region was founded during the Sigmaslav era by the influential leader Sigma Cryper III. Under his leadership, three new continents were discovered: Realmest, Realmia, and Realme. These lands together are known as the Realmia, representing a diverse and expansive area that emerged from exploration and discovery. The founding of the Realm marked a significant milestone in the region&#146;s history, laying the groundwork for its cultural and geographical development. Sigma Cryper III&#146;s legacy as a pioneering explorer and leader remains an important part of the region&#146;s identity today.
