[b]Are we real nations, or are we hallucinations...[/b]
Welcome to the Halluci Nations! The place where &quot;nations&quot; rejoice!
The Halluci (Pronounced Ha-loo-see or preferably Hah-luh-kai) Nations is a group of satire nations where their leaders can talk about matters that otherwise actual nations would not want to cover, stuff like the decrease of rights, the crash of their economy, or simply establishing weird and unconventional laws.
So if you wish to become a psychotic dictatorship and to be even MORE psychotic, come on down to the Halluci Nations!
