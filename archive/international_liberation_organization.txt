The International Liberation Organization is an alliance of nations opposed to the barbarism of capitalism-imperialism. We support a wide array of Anti-Imperialist ideologies, but &quot;anti-imperialist&quot; ideologies supported by imperialist puppet states (i.e. Wahabbism from Saudi Arabia) are fiercely condemned. We call for the liberation of all nations from the yoke of imperialist control, and we endorse all movements against this imperialist control, including, but not limited to:

All Palestine Liberation Efforts (especially PFLP and DFLP)
Hezbollah (Lebanon, Syria)
Houthi Alliance (Yemen)
New People&#39;s Army (Philippines)
FARC and ELN (Colombia)
Syrian Government
