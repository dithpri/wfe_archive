The Alpaisne Mainland (pronounced: Alpine) is a smaller, northern continent, and some outlying regions, we are known for our Majestic Pines, High Cliffs, which tower over the waters edge, the many wolves and other creatures which inhabit our forest and mountain regions, and a general &amp;quot;Do-It-Yourself&amp;quot; outlook on life.
