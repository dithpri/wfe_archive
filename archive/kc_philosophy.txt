KC philosophy gathered together to solve the worlds problems. They thought of many solutions. They liked this concept: thinking. They decided that instead of actually solving anything, they would just think a lot about it. Instead of making the world a better place, they began making irrational decisions just to see what would happen when thinking wasn&#39;t enough. Their nations began to crumble under their neglect, but they came up with some cool ideas that never amounted to anything. Fun times though.
