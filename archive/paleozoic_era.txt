Navigating the Carboniferous Period jungle, you find yourself immersed in a primeval world where towering lycopods and colossal ferns create an impenetrable green canopy overhead. The air is thick with humidity, and the ground beneath is a tapestry of fallen foliage, bustling with giant millipedes and voracious predatory spiders. Swampy pools reflect the dim light, where amphibians like the Eogyrinus silently patrol, their elongated forms barely disturbing the surface. High above, early flying reptiles glide effortlessly through the humid air, adding an air of prehistoric wonder to this ancient, teeming landscape.
