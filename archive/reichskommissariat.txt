[b][i][u]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/u][/i][/b]

This is the third [region]Antifa[/region] &quot;museum&quot; that has been occupied as part of the [b]ANTI[color=red]FA[/color] Museum Seizure[/b]. It is a previously Nazi region, so that makes this capture even better. It will now become a territory/occupied region of [region]J o J[/region].

[hr]Property of [region]J o J[/region][HR]Update 7/7/20: Some goofy goobers from [region]The Anti Fascism Alliances[/region] refounded a spelling error, mistaking that region for this one. Nice try.[hr]
