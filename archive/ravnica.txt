IMPORTANT NEWS:
THE LIST will work as follows. On each Saturday, a poll will be created. This poll will allow each Ravnican to vote for a nation that they wish to add to THE LIST. If less than three nations are on THE LIST, additional nations will be chosen by a &#147;random&#148; number generator, until there are three on THE LIST. When the polls close on Monday, a telegram is sent to nations that are on THE LIST, and they are given until Friday to compose their arguments for why they should stay in Ravnica. The polls will be unused during this time. On Friday, 3 new polls will be posted. The poll results here will be taken into account before a final decision is made.
