OVERVIEW SECTION:
The region of Ravnica is a glorious region that is controlled by New Lyev. Ravnicans keep to themselves, preferring to take care of their own issues before putting themselves out into the world. We are home to multiple dictatorships, almost no forests, and very small amounts of human rights. While people (and I won&amp;#39;t name any names) have tried to take over in the past, the mighty empire of New Lyev quickly crushed their rebellion, and reimplemented total control over the region.

RECENT NEWS SECTION:
New Lyev has been resurrected. Chaos and anime references will no longer rule this region.
