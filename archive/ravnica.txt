With the destruction of so many nations our region has been plagued with misfortune. The once great nations that gave birth to this region have almost all but faded from existence. I emphasize almost. The Empire of Orbital Knights hereby takes the burden of making our region what it once was. Fear not! Those of us who remain will only grow stronger with this trial. Rise my fellow Ravnicans! The time has come for us to achieve greatness! My allies will be rewarded with positions as officers, my enemies will tremble at my feet! Let us strive to improve ourselves, TOGETHER!

His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Basileus Vers Astrum
