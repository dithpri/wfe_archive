The region of Ravnica is a glorious hell on earth, governed and policed by the Senate of New Lyev. Ravnicans keep to themselves, preferring to take care of their own issues before putting themselves out into the world. We are home to multiple dictatorships, almost no forests, and very small amounts of human rights.

Due to an influx of random people who I don&amp;#39;t know the identities of, I have created a new policy. Please send a telegram to New Lyev explaining who you are. If such a telegram is not received before Friday, March 20th, you will be ejected. If you&amp;#39;re reading this after being ejected, send me a telegram.

So far, the only person who has not confirmed their identity is BingBangBongi. So get on that.
