[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and the pirates from [region]The West Pacific[/region] decided to pay a visit to the shrine!

What shrines would such a group visit together? 
The answer is simple. 
[Colour=red]The Shrine of the variance gods[/colour]

We gave offerings and sacrifices, but the variance gods refused to heed our call, instead teleporting us to your region
