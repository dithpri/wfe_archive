Welcome to the Soycima region. There are some things you will need to know about our beautiful lands, or as locals call it, heaven. Soycima does not tolerate human rights and any kind of free speech against our beloved governments and supreme leaders or as locals call them, Gods. We believe in racial purification and eugenics. Our nations are on a &quot;crusade&quot; against democracy and believe that democracy is poison to humanity. Use of military force is the popular choice amongst the people for common problems(street fights, kids skipping school, loud coughs of the elderly that cause public disturbance and so on...) Long live Soycima and enjoy your stay!
