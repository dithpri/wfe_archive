[b]Poor Jekrehnot. A former propaganda minister for [region]The Greater German Reich[/region] who attempted a restoration of the GGR&amp;#39;s glory days. Not that they ever had any, but oh well. He later supernova&amp;#39;d into a ball of anger, thus his permanent removal from the game.

Jek&amp;#39;s only attempt at fixing anything in the GGR will now be a tombstone to him. Brought to you by the [region]Regional Defense Committee[/region].
