The &amp;#39;Confederation of the Sovereign States of Pandyssia&amp;#39; exists as an effort to increase the quality of life on the continent. This loose grouping of independent states is designed to increase cooperation between states, as well as reduce conflicts (both within the continent, and across continents) with greater ease. Independence of states is encouraged, and so the confederation itself holds little power without its members enforcing the unanimous decisions of the group.
