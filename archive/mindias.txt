[b]Mindias[/b] is a region that exists on a flat piece of paper, in space.

The region can move up and down through the surrounding continents and can move around on any planes of existence (space, time, or both).

This fictional world currently exists in reality. 

It doesn&#39;t make sense, but I assure you it does.

I don&#39;t even know how.

Basically this region is a place of permanent peace.

All the land is flat, all the stars are round and bright, and all of the animals are tame.

There.
