That Other Region has a live and let live kind of philosophy. All are welcome so long as they don&amp;#39;t cause trouble with any of our nations. That&amp;#39;s pretty much the only requirement. That Other Region doesn&amp;#39;t try to impose any kind of lifestyle or ideology among your nation. What you do in your own country is your own business.
