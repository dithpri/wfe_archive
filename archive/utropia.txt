The region Utropia or as some would call it the Mapocracy of Utropia is a simple digital governance formed by the community.
The world the Mapocracy forms itself around is also called Utropia, a planet that  bases itself in the 1920s along with a dying universe that was formed by the Apostles of Everything for magic and empires to sing![/td][/tr]
