The Royal Territory of Skandar  
A vast continent. Dominated by the lands of mystery, is it filled with corruption or is it not?, a mountain filled with mines, are the mining companies corrupted? or is it not? the land is a symphony of ancient civilization, dictated cities, and industrial facilities, Nature Institutes, and Farming Towns
