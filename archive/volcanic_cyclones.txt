Anywho, enjoy the scenery and have some some free coffee for 15 cents.

[color=red]I would prefer curing nations rather than destroying zombies.

- Gorski
- Crowbar
- Desuenos
- Ian (whichever acct is deemed his main)
- from there we cure zombies going from oldest nations to newer nations since older nations have a larger population[/color]
