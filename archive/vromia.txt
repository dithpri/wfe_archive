A region of free-speech, oppression, map making, real world and role play oriented discussion all packed into one fledgling region. Political and religious discourse of all kind is encouraged. Official region role play wise, technology levels from the year 2200 is the max though there is no minimum of advancement (or lack thereof). There is a map, the [Nation]Syndicalist Unions of Terron[/Nation] owns the map and can be contacted if nation placement is wanted. I as the founder highly value freedom of speech on the regional message board and will be lenient to otherwise &quot;offensive/problematic&quot; discussion topics and wording. All views are welcomed and wanted in our civil debates on the regional message board so long as you do not convey your message via spam.
