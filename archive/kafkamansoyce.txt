[b]Welcome friends![/b]
This is a sanctuary that we have created so we can play together. [i]Without actually talking all that much. ;)[/i]
We do not take kindly to those that disturb the tranquility. We have basic common sense rules... If you have ideas on how to improve our region, or if you just want to talk to us (Not that that will happen much) we will try to answer as soon as possible on the message board and direct you to messaging the person that has the most relevance to what you are suggesting or want to talk of, so we can keep notices to a minimum.
That is all... We are not very social... Wish the best upon you.
P.S. If you know what this region was named after you are our new favorite person.
