[b]Animal rights imply that the interests of animals deserve some attention, regardless of, whether they are beautiful, useful to humans, are there any value for people (as well as a mentally ill person has certain rights, despite the fact that he often doesn&#39;t do any good, sometimes it is burdensome to others). Based on the above, it should be recognized that animals are not our property, their life itself is valuable, so we do not have the right to use them to meet their needs. That is, a person should not eat animal meat, wear their fur and skin, put on them experiments, use them in entertainment.
