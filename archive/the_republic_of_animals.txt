[b][color=crimson]The Republic of Animals is a free, proud country that was once &amp;quot;Animal Farm&amp;quot; which was once &amp;quot;Manor Farm&amp;quot; We adopt the ways of Old Major, our original founder and great leader! We are free from man, and his oppressive ways. We hope that one day you shall join us in the revolution! [/color][/b]

We honor the seven commandants of [b][u]Old Major[/b][/u], which goes as follows:

[color=darkblue][b]Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
No animal shall wear clothes.
No animal shall sleep in a bed.
No animal shall drink alcohol.
No animal shall kill any other animal.
All animals are equal.[/color][/b]

[b][u][color=DarkGreen]Let us liberate the world and rid it of evil! For The Republic of Animals! [/Color][/b][/u]

Our Great Leader: [nation=short]Napoleon The Pig[/nation]
