The Insurgent Progressives is an alliance of states that cherish the values of Robert M. Follette. Member nations strive to uphold ideals of progressivism, organized labor laws, and a moral, honest government. 

Welcome to the [region]Insurgent Progressives[/region]! Please endorse [nation]New Coruscia[/nation] for WA Delegate when you join!

If you wish to hold a leadership title, please join the region and send [nation]New Coruscia[/nation] a telegram. After we have enough member nations, we will have elections for vice-president, secretary of state, and chief justice. (These positions will, of course, require a constitution, which will be created with more member nations.)
