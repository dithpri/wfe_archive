[color=000066][b]The American National Socialist Party[/b]

[list]Note:[list][hr][I]Personally, I do not support nor condone the American National Socialist Party, nor am I aware that if it may exist or not. The concept of some moron willing to submit to some crazy moron just makes no sense to me. To each there own, I guess.[/I][hr][/list]
This region is occupied by [region=United States of America] (an [nation=short]Elliston[/nation] Region)

It seems that a moron does not like us to use the American Stars and Stripes. Personally, I think that he&amp;#39;s and idiot. maybe a Nazi. Don&amp;#39;t know, don&amp;#39;t care. I am flying a new flag for all those Neanderthals out there. It is a throwback to the Viking raiding era over 1,000 years ago. Not too sure on the actual colors, but I like it.[/list][/color]
