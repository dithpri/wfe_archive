A neo-tropical, hot part of the world; Cabrallera is located near Central and America. Named after Portuguese explorer Alvaro Cabral, this lost subcontinent was once major field of play to many colonial powers, which set here their colonies. Later, the colonies rebelled, and gained independence. Now, hundreds of years after the independence wars, Cabrallera still is a place where powers - this time Cabralleran and foreign - play for their interests.
