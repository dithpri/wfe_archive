I [nation]coleslawsvile[/nation] have recently seized the position of WA delegate. I do not plan on making too many changes at first, but I do plan on keeping it to the peoples choice within the poll system. If there are any legitimate complaints and or concerns please telegram me and I shall handle it in an orderly fashion.
