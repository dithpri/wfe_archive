Integral to the mission of socialism, the Socialist Confederacy is a grouping of all forms of socialist nations together against the threats of capitalistic imperialism for the sake of the world. We will put an end on global exploitation and the destruction of the environment through any means necessary. Authority and war are the tools of the revolutionary socialist against the sickened world torn apart by the bourgeoisie greed for wealth and capital. 

We are new and looking for fellow communist, socialist, marxist, or syndicalist nations of all kinds of authoritarian/liberal scale to join our efforts to change the world.
