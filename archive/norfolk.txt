[b]Norfolk is a County of [region]Englaland[/region]

By the 5th century the Angles, after whom East Anglia and England itself are named, had established control of the region and later became the &amp;quot;north folk&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;south folk&amp;quot;, hence, &amp;quot;Norfolk&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Suffolk&amp;quot;. Norfolk, Suffolk and several adjacent areas became the kingdom of East Anglia

It is time for all English to come together from across the globe and build our new [region]Englaland[/region] together. It is time to come home.

[region]Englaland[/region] Victorious!
