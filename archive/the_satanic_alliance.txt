This region was established to allow Satanism to be represented alongside the other religious themed regions.

As would be expected of us, outside that issue our members are left to their own devices.

The Satanic Alliance does not actively encourage members to join the World Assembly. After all, we are not about being the majority. We do not currently have a Delegate. However, if someone wants to represent our interests the delegation is open.

We are currently home to [b]4[/b] players. Activity stamp: [10.09.14 [nation]Hexland[/nation]]

Our Message board is now open to all nations in regions who hold an embassy with us. Discussion is encouraged. Keep in mind you are in our territory here. It will be moderated appropriately.
