[b][color=green]Welcome to the Conquered Region of Peaceian![/color]

Founded sometime in the year 2004, Peaceian became a haven for Defenders and was once home to many famous old-school Defenders like Chin-Chilla and Giant Cheese Weasels. However it was Peaceian&amp;#39;s membership in the dishonorable Forum Destruction group the [i]Red Liberty Alliance[/i] that cast a shameful shadow upon what would have otherwise been an civil and respectable region.

In it&amp;#39;s declining years, Peaceian choose to become a Protectorate to the Imperialist Defender group known as the [i]Founderless Region Alliance.[/i] In the end though, Peaceian could not escape its fate and was refounded by the lovable-raiders of [region]Lone Wolves United[/region]!
