[color=blue][url=http://rcbanda1810.deviantart.com/#/d5bknoy]Christik&iacute; Nisi&aacute;[/color][/url] is a large archipelago in the eastern ocean.  Ownership of the region is contested between the vestiges of former colonies and the oppressed native population.

The region houses a diverse climate and landscape.  The cold north is mountainous and rugged, dominated by mining.  The deserts of the central islands are mineral and oil-rich.  The southernmost islands are tropical, and enjoy a rich biodiversity.  The islands of the southwest, however, are monopolized by a vast megalopolis, with no natural landform left untouched.

Large swathes of [color=blue][url=http://rcbanda1810.deviantart.com/#/d5bknoy]Christik&iacute; Nisi&aacute;[/color][/url] remain unclaimed.
