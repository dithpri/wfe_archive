Eastern Merkopa was once the heartland of the&nbsp;Markian Empire, and has been the centre of many conflicts, migrations and civil wars.

The&nbsp;Markian Empire&nbsp;was an ancient, massive nation spanning the entirety of Eastern Merkopa in Suzerain. Once dominant over the Sordish, Agno, and Valg tribes, and under the leadership of the Mark, the sheer enormity of the Empire, combined with increasing civil unrest, led to its eventual collapse.

 Many of the modern Merkopan states are formed from the descendants of these tribes, and its legacy still extends to the present day.
