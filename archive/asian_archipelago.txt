Top 5% in the world for niceness and cheerfulness!

Asian Archipelago was founded in 2015 and featured on the NationStates World page in 2016. After three years of inactivity, it was re-founded in 2020 by a puppet of the original founder, The Republic of Li Qing. 

At our peak, we have had over 20 Asian-themed nations reside in the region and multiple embassies. We hosted 2 interregional soccer tournaments and have hopes to host more sports and other RP events.
