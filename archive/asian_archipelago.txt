Welcome to Asian Archipelago!
[b]WA Nations please endorse [i]de facto[/i] delegate [nation]Li Qing[/nation] to ensure our nation&amp;#39;s safety![/b]
We are a home for Asian nations (particularly East Asia). We want to [b]bring Asia to the [i]forefront[/i] of NationStates.[/b]
(Most of us have or have had socialist governments, but [b]we are OPEN to Asian nations with almost [i]any[/i] kind of government.[/b] HOWEVER, as you may have guessed, [b]anyone affiliated with Fascists or Nazis is [i]not[/i] welcomed here.[/b]) 
We fled from a formerly very prosperous region which, however, was raided, with all the nations ejected, and the remaining ones powerless. Although we are a small region, we are still interested in expanding our role-playing, and forming ties with other regions, so come check us out!
