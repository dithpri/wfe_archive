Welcome to Asian Archipelago!
[b]note: founder [nation]Li Qing[/nation] is not a resident but retains control of this region.[/b]
[b]Also, this region is [i]temporarily inactive[/i] due to the pressures of academics; embassies will continued to be maintained though.[/b]
We are a home for Asian nations (particularly East Asia). We want to [b]bring Asia to the [i]forefront[/i] of NationStates.[/b]
([b]We are OPEN to Asian nations with almost [i]any[/i] kind of government.[/b] BUT, as you may have guessed, [b]anyone affiliated with Fascists is [i]not[/i] welcomed[/b]) 
Although we are a small region, we are still interested in expanding and forming ties with other regions, so come check us out!
