Asian-themed nations of different sizes and ideologies are welcome to this region. [b]However, Fascist groups are not welcomed.[/b]

Our region was once quite large, with nearly 20 nations, but a [i]lot[/i] of them were admittedly puppets of the founder (me). All of the nations ceased to exist save for a 1 or 2, but they also left the region, and our region ceased to exist. Stupidly, I also changed the passwords to many of my puppets and have forgotten the passwords to them all. But this one nation of mine has returned, and more might return.
