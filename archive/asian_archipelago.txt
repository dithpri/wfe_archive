Welcome to Asian Archipelago!
We are a home for Asian nations (particularly East Asia); most of us also currently have or have had a socialist government.
(But yes, we can still be democratic. We are not oppressive, and we do not or wage wars for selfish causes. AND [b]this does [i]not[/i] mean that we are closed to Asian nations with slightly differing politics.[/b] However, as you may have guessed, Japanese nationalists and Fascists are [i]not[/i] welcomed here.) 
We fled from a formerly very prosperous region which, however, was raided, with all the nations ejected, and the remaining ones powerless. Although we are a small region, we are still interested in expanding our role-playing, and forming ties with other regions, so come check us out!
