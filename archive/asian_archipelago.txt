Welcome to Asian Archipelago!

We are a small region of nations who are united in their desire to [b]bring Asia to the [i]forefront[/i] of NationStates.[/b] 

Our region was much larger and more developed before, but it was raided for 2 days by a region affiliated with DEN. Thanks to a benevolent defender force, though, it has been taken back. We hope to fix our infrastructure and restore normal activity soon.

All Asian nations of different sizes and ideologies are welcome to join this region. However, [b]Nazis, Japanese Nationalists, and other Fascist groups are not welcomed.[/b]
