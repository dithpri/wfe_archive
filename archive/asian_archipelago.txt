Founded in 2015 by Li Qing (me), CTE&#39;d in 2017, refounded twice in 2020 by the founder&#39;s puppets ([nation]Muralos[/nation] and, this time, [nation]New Zhengguo[/nation]).

[nation]Muralos[/nation] is my main nation now, and it is currently part of [region]Osiris[/region] &#150; honestly, I really like that region, though the community of OG Asian Archipelago (with ~20 Asian-themed nations, sports, polls, etc.) was so unique and I wonder if it might be replicated in the future.

Having a puppet sit here (in Asian Archipelago) is better than having the region periodically refounded by raider groups, in my opinion. It also lets me kickstart regional development should I get the motivation to do so! Can&#39;t do that when a raider group is in charge.
