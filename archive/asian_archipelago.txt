[b]Asian Archipelago[/b] - bringing Asia to the [i]forefront[/i] of NationStates.
Top 5% in the world for niceness and cheerfulness!


We are a region founded in 2015 and featured on the NationStates World page in 2016; after three years of inactivity, we re-founded in 2020. [nation]New Zhengguo[/nation] is a puppet of the original founder, Li Qing. At our peak, we have had 20 Asian-themed nations reside in the region and multiple embassies. We also hosted 2 interregional soccer tournaments, with hopes to become a more established sports and RP-ing region; polls to allow non-WA nations to decide the WA delegate&#39;s vote on key positions; and an official region website.
