[b]Welcome to [region]Asian Archipelago[/region]![/b]

We are a region of nations who are united in [b]bringing Asia to the [i]forefront[/i] of NationStates[/b], whether in sports, culture, or industry.
[b]All Asian nations of different sizes and ideologies are welcome to this region.[/b] However, [i]Nazis, Japanese Nationalists, and other Fascist groups are not welcomed.[/i]

Our region was once larger and more developed, but it was raided by a region affiliated with DEN. Thanks to a defender force, though, it has been taken back. We hope to restore our infrastructure soon.

Although we are small, we are still looking to expand our role-playing and our relations with other regions. If you&#39;re interested please send us a telegram or join our cause!
