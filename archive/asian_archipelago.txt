Our region was once larger and more developed, but it was targeted by a raider group. Thanks to a defender force, though, it has been taken back, and we hope to restore our infrastructure soon.

Although we are small, we are still looking to expand our role-playing and our relations with other regions. If you&#39;re interested please send us a telegram or join our cause!
