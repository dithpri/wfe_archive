Welcome to Asian Archipelago!
[b]note: founder [nation]Li Qing[/nation] currently resides in an embassy region. However, he retains control of this region.[/b]
We are a home for Asian nations (particularly East Asia). We want to [b]bring Asia to the [i]forefront[/i] of NationStates.[/b]
([b]We are OPEN to Asian nations with almost [i]any[/i] kind of government.[/b] HOWEVER, as you may have guessed, [b]anyone affiliated with Fascists or Nazis is [i]not[/i] welcomed here.[/b]) 
Although we are a small region, we are still interested in expanding our role-playing, and forming ties with other regions, so come check us out!
