[b]Asian Archipelago[/b] - bringing Asia to the [i]forefront[/i] of NationStates.
[b][color=green]Top 10% in the world for compassion, niceness, and cheerfulness![/b][/color]

Asian Archipelago was founded in 2015 and featured on the NationStates World page in 2016. After three years of inactivity, it was re-founded in 2020 by a puppet of the original founder, The Republic of Li Qing. 

At our peak, we have had over 20 Asian-themed nations reside in the region and multiple embassies. We hosted 2 interregional soccer tournaments and hope to host more sports and RP events.
