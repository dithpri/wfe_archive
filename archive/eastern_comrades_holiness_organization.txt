The nations of ECHO vow to protect one another from harm, whether it be physical or otherwise. We vow to respect one another&#39;s governmental ideologies, and to keep one another afloat in dire times. Finally, we vow to keep one another accountable for our nations&#39; condition, our citizens&#39; survival, and our own spiritual well-being.
