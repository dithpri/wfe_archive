[b]The Continental League[/b]

TCL is a conservative/traditional, democratic, casual region. We will have a democratic election every four months for the Continental President. This region is looking for active participants.

For the time being all regional affairs will be held in the RMB. More coming soon.

[b]Main Rules[/b]
-Nothing that would upset the mods or break NS rules
-No communists, facists or  extreme leftists. (All others are okay)
-If you have the national policy banner &#147;Socialism&#148;, there&#146;s a good chance you&#146;ll be ejected.
-All religions are welcome

[b]Election Schedule[/b]
The next regional election will be in late July 2021. There can be an election sooner if people want one.
