[b]The Continental League[/b]
[i]Est. Feb 26th, 2021.[/i]

TCL is a conservative/traditional, democratic, casual region. We will have a democratic election every four months for the Continental President. This region is looking for active participants.

For the time being all regional affairs will be held in the RMB.

[b]Main Rules[/b]
-Nothing that would upset the mods or break NS rules.
-No communists, facists or  extreme leftists. (All others are okay)
-If you have the national policy banner &#147;Socialism&#148;, there&#146;s a good chance you&#146;ll be ejected. Unless, you have other conservative policies to balance it.

[b]Election Schedule[/b]
The next regional election will be in late July 2021. There can be an election sooner if people want one.
