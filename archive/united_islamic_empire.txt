This region was a &amp;quot;conservative yet slightly liberal region. The area [was] best know for it&amp;#39;s diversity, and [its] ability to solve political problems with ease.&amp;quot; It has now been refounded and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] to prevent likely [b]fascist[/b] misuse.

As the award-winning show [i]The West Wing[/i] put it, &amp;quot;Islam is to Islamic extremism as Christianity is to the KKK.&amp;quot;
