The area [was] best know for it&amp;#39;s diversity, and [its] ability to solve political problems with ease.&amp;quot; It has now been refounded and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] to prevent likely [b]fascist[/b] misuse.

[u]United Islamic Empire is being evacuated and closed down as part of [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=blackgreenwhite/detail=factbook/id=54439]Operation &amp;quot;Get Organized Down There!&amp;quot;[/url] If any antifascist/anti-Islamophobe of hatred wants this region, please contact [nation=short]BlackGreenWhite[/nation].[/u]
