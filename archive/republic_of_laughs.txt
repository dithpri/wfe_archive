[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] has a new Trigger Hawk! To celebrate the occasion, the new trigger hawk, CPL [nation]Raiding Peoples[/nation] decided to plan something fun, something never seen before in raiderkind! The spelling shotgun. After lots of set up, and beating a fair few fendas on the way, the word was spelt! And the FIRST RAID done by CPL [nation]Raiding Peoples[/nation] had some to an end. If you [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]join us[/url], maybe you too could someday do your FIRST RAID!
