[hr][hr][b]The Blades of Conquest[/b] were formerly one of the strongest and most influential raiders of their time. They survived major power shifts and a few refoundings. Today this region is all that remains of a once great power. The people may be gone and the region may be barren, but the memories of our great friends and even greater victories shall remain in our hearts forever. To any former Blades reading this fight hard in memory of your brothers, and may your Blades always stay sharp![hr][hr][b][color=orange]Final Conquest Counter: [/color]47[/b]
