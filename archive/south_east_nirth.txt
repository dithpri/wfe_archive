[b]The unanimous declaration of the South Eastern States of Nirth,[/b]

[colour=blue]When in the course of human events, 
it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, 
and to assume among the powers of the earth,[/colour] 
the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature&#39;s God entitle them, 
a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

[colour=red]Thus we believe,
People have certain Inalienable Rights including 
Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness.
All Men are created equal.
Individuals have a civic duty to defend these rights for themselves and others.[/colour]
