Atlantis was once an ancient civilization known widely around the world but due to the European colonization, Atlantis was almost completely wiped out. Over the years, Atlantis rebuilt their civilization and in 2024 these islands were discovered by humans via satellite imagery.

Now, Prismora is leading the Lost Islands of Atlantis with one goal, to keep the oceans safe.
