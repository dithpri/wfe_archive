[i]This region is a silent reminder of what happened on an unrecorded day when the original region of [region]Democratica[/region] was invaded by [region]The Black Riders[/region].[/i]

We will never forget the countless lives that were lost fighting [region]The Black Riders[/region]. The natives fought hard, but they were quickly overwhelmed. In less then a week, all those originals were lost forever.

[b]But one day, we will rise. We will conquer those who have taken so much from us, and invade THEM. They will pay. They will pay for the countless regions that have been invaded. How much people had given up on the game altogether because of some overbearing, arrogant losers decided to ruin them. Join us, and then we will rise again.[/b]
