The very first [url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;t=249521]Quarterly World Summit[/url] is currently being held. It will last a week, until Monday 8th of July. Please post there. We are also forming a regional government, which will more likely be the government/ruling body for the [i]Embrace Realism![/i] movement. We&amp;#39;d like to remind all of you that the Embrace Realism! movement IS friends with the Screw Realism! movement.

Founders: [nation]Arkolon[/nation] and [nation]The Jonathanian States[/nation]
