The first Quarterly World Summit will be held soon. We hope you can participate. We will discuss foreign relations between our countries, as well as trade, politics and crisis-solving. The location for the QWS has not been defined, and countries are encouraged to advertise, or at least propose, their country to host the first QWS.
