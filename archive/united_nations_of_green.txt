The United Nations of Green, a prospering state with firm laws suggesting environment comes first. Any Nation whom makes a law suggesting otherwise, will be punished. We are Democrats, meaning you can vote or impeach a president. The president of The United Nations of Green can change these rules, and the rest of the Nations have to follow. If a Nation doesn&#39;t like the rules of the president, they can vote for impeachment, or they can start a revolution, and engage in war.
Each Nation has to do a pledge of allegiance every day, &quot;We Will Endure!&quot;
