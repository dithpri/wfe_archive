This region has been seized by the righteous forces of Jakominich, and this region has now been claimed for [region=The Holy Reich of Bunicken]. Christianity and Communism are not able to be mixed. Communism is an ideology that is totally opposed to religion of any form, and many Christians died because of this hateful ideology 

The people of this region have been liberated from the tyrannical boot of Communism, and have been given freedom and liberty. The straggling communist forces have been crushed, and the Kaiser&#39;s flag flies high over the ruins of Christian Communist Rome. The treasures of the region have been taken as plunder. The flags and books have been taken as trophies. Let all Communists tremble before Bunicken and her forces!
