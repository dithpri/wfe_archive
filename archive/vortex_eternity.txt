|| Side note, for roleplayers only. On facebook a clan of elite roleplayers are starting up, very few members have joined though. If you are an elite roleplayer and wish to join on facebook with the other elites, please send a message to Darkeela, where you will be tested to see if you are worthy. If you are interested in learning, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to let me know that either. ||
