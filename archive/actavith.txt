[b][u]Welcome to Actavith![/u][/b]

    Actavith is a continental planet, with an approximately 8.562km radius, revolving around the Helios solar system, which belongs in the Orion arm of the Milky Way galaxy. After &quot;[i]the Great Event[/i]&quot;, which has resulted in all the colonial properties of the United Nations of Earth gaining independence, Actavith was split into multiple nations and federations, some of which sought a lot of ambitious goals, from society reforms, to world peace and some even seeking world domination! Scary!...
    The year is 2618 and our post-colonial nations are now looking forward to a better future. Can they build a civilization that will survive the test of time?
