Welcome close freinds and colleges, to The Order of Nations (TON)! The region looking to influence and shape the world into a new one.

To those of you who are part of our region, I congratulate you on meeting our standards. But to those who wish to join us, send me or our communication director a telegram and we will see if you meet our qualifications. We are very happy to accept any embassies but any regions looking to establish embassies must consent to our &#147;Mole Embassy Program&#148; (MEP) where a mole will be implanted in your region for research purposes. We swear not to meddle in polls or anything like that.

Thank you all ever so much.
