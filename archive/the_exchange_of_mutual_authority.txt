&amp;quot;I have noticed that even people who claim everything is predetermined and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road. &#133; One cannot base one&amp;#39;s conduct on the idea that everything is determined, because one does not know what has been determined. Instead, one has to adopt the effective theory that one has free will and that one is responsible for one&amp;#39;s actions. ...A society in which the individual feels responsible for his or her actions is more likely to work together and survive to spread its values.&amp;quot;
