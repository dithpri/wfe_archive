AFIN is a roleplay region set in an alternate timeline of our real-life world. We have many exciting events in the works. Currently, we have a fully functional and well-updated map and a discord server. If you&#39;re interested in joining in on our fun, join the region and discord to get started with your map claims. We hope to see you out there.
