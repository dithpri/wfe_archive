This region is the homebase for all the saffron hearts around the world. We assemble here to discuss plans and strategies about how we can protect our people from threats to their well-being and how we can best advance the cause of our people.

This region also aims to provide a safe space for us to chill out after draining efforts in pursuit of the objectives of this region and also to bond with one another and develop high morale and unit cohesion, something which we will require very badly in our challenging and massive task.
