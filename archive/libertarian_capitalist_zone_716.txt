1) [color=red][b][region]Libertarian[/region] has been invaded![/b][/color]  The password for [region]Libertarian[/region] is &amp;#39;716&amp;#39; without the apostrophes.  Nations wishing to enter the region are encouraged to do so.  I am asking nations to hold off any attempts to liberate the regions while multi-region negotiations are ongoing.

2) [color=blue][b]I am withdrawing the embassy with [region]Libertatem[/region] for participating in raids.[/b][/color]  It is my belief that a libertarian should not engage in wars of conquest, even against a hated enemy whose practices are immoral and barbaric, if the inhabitants do not wish to be invaded or liberated.
