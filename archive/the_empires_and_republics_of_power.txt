Welcome to [region]The Empires And Republics Of Power[/region], a member of [region]Bloc Brigade[/region]!

We are having a bit of a Delegate problem, so I, [nation=noflag]New Zander[/nation], have decided that we are changing the way that we are doing endorsements. From this point onwards, any WA member can only endorse [b]ONE[/b] other WA member.
The exception for this is the WA delegate. You can endorse the Delegate and one other member. The Founder can also endorse as many people as they like 
We will give you 1 week to comply.
