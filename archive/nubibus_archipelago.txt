The [color=purple]Nubibus Archipelago[/color] is an island chain of fairly large islands with many narrow waterways separating them. Quite a few events have happened recently, such as terrorism, imperialism and the ongoing race to explore the galaxy. Nationtypes include Communists, Dictators and Democracies, although all are (mostly) welcome.
