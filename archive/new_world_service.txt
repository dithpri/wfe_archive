The [region]New World Service[/region] is an organisation founded by the [nation=long+noflag]Albanian Anarchy States[/nation] to protect those who join the organisation, and settle conflicts within the organisation. The Service will also connect to other regions and defend them instead of preventing a conflict between them and whomever they are having a conflict with. Whatever region the New World Service is connected to, the Service will have an embassy with that region. Ideologies will not interfere with connections to other regions. This goes the same for the members, ideologies of members will not interfere with them joining or not.
