Best-looking train station in NY.  If you are visiting the city for the first time, come in through Grand Central Terminal and not that dark and miserable rat tunnel that is Penn Station.  

Unfortunately, GCT is full of tourists and other wildlife that stop randomly to take pictures, don&#39;t know where they are going, walk too slowly, and make your morning commute annoying.  Pro-tip: The fastest way to get across the main concourse during rush hour is to dance, shifting a few steps forward, backward, or sideways at a time.
