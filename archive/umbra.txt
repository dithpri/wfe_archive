Umbra is a relatively obscure, shadowy region of the Nation States that comprises the Infallible Sea, its surrounding coasts, and its islands. 

The name Umbra, meaning dark or shadowed area, adequately defines the small region that lies southeast of the West Pacific and of the Europeia mainland, east of the Northern Isles, and north of the South Pacific national waters in just a vague enough location to ward off direct invasions.
