[b]Welcome to Sonnel, a fantastic ([i]albeit inactive[/i]) planet within a far away solar system.[/b]
[hr][color=red]Sonnel is the third planet in the solar system of Trallena, and many nations, including ones on nearby or linked planets, are under its sphere of influence.[/color]
[hr]Any and all questions can be answered by either our Embassy Leader, [nation=Drawkland] or the Beta Delegate [nation=Xhayparia]. Don&amp;#39;t ask [nation=The_Confederacy_Of_Nationalism], he&amp;#39;s a troll.
