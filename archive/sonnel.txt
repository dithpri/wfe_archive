[b]Welcome to Sonnel, a fantastic ([i]albeit inactive[/i]) planet within a far away solar system.[/b]
[hr][color=red]Sonnel is the third planet in the solar system of Trallena, and many nations, including ones on nearby or linked planets, are under its sphere of influence.[/color]
[hr][color=green]It&#39;s that time of year where everything starts to resemble Xhayparia! Cold, barren, and unloved&iquest;. Oh yeah, and snow.[/color]
[hr]Any and all questions can be answered by the Cancerous League, [nation=Drawkland], [nation=Xhayparia], and [nation=The Confederacy of Nationalism].

[i] So, why is the RMB dead? Facebook Messenger m8. We use it.[/i]
