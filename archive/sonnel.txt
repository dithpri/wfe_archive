Seriously? This has been like 4 raids since January now guys. We aren&amp;#39;t even founderless! Whatever, you don&amp;#39;t see me giving damns around here. This region is practically dead except for the people in the regional government. But you can&amp;#39;t attract active people unless you have active people. &amp;quot;I need experience before I can get experience?&amp;quot;
