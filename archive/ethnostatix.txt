[b]THE MOST UNLIKELY ALLIANCE[/b]

[color=blue]A region made up of nations that are uneasily peaceful with each other, but due to finding more uses in allying than detonating nuclear weapons at each other, the nations of radically different beliefs form this region. [/color]

[color=red]Consult the Nationstates rules on how to conduct within the region, as the main goal is simply to keep all members noses clean with the big boys in charge.[/color]

[b]Please feel free to role play between all nations, as this is part of the fun of Nationstates.[/b]
