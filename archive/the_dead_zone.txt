Like a cancer upon the Earth, the Dead Zone is rapidly expanding, and with it, the Robotic Menace. What was once grassy plains and great forests is now a jungle of entangled wires and pools of acid. The sky is black with ash and smog spewing from the megalithic factories that create the drones and titans that make up their great artificial army. Some seek out the Robot Menace, hoping to be made immortal through the mechanization process. More are forcefully assimilated into the Machine. The Great Powers avoid it like a plague, and where there was once the Steppe of Shmeckstaine, there lies the Core, the seat of power where Magnus Machinus reigns.
