A region of ocean and scattered islands where navigation equipment becomes inoperable. Twenty years ago, the Machine Emperor fell in battle here, and ever since the area has been blanketed by nanomachine clouds impenetrable to contemporary surveillance equipment. Of the explorers, thrill-seekers, and government agents that have ventured into the Dead Zone, those who return report, &quot;There&#39;s nothing here.&quot;

...Seriously though, there&#39;s nothing here.
