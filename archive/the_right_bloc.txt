[b]The Right Bloc[/b] was a region formed by a dissatisfied rightist in the explicit name of opposing [b][region]the Communist Bloc[/region][/b]. The region quickly was rendered irrelevant and fell into disrepair, its original founder ceasing to exist. Eventually, the region itself fell into disrepair and ceased to exist, allowing the People&#39;s Revolutionary Air Force to swoop in and claim it. It now stands as a trophy of TCB.
