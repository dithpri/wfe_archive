Taiwan has been and always will be independent. The Republic forever!
The citizens of the Republic are proudly 100 percent Lutheran Christian.
This is the Second Taiwanese hegemony, established on Christmas Eve, the same day that the Fourth Republic was formed.
The First was The Republic of China.
The Second was The Republic  of Taiwan-Taloo.
The Third was The United Republic of Taiwan.
The Fourth (being the current one) is The Taiwanese Republic.
May this Republic last forever and ever.
Amen.
