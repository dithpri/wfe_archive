[quote=ericistanism_co;55065070]If I had 100,000 I would use buy a purple s class with 24 inch chrome rims, and a bunch of purple suits, and slapping lessons. I then use my pimp money to invest in the cartel, and start selling cocaine in the streets of detroit, then, quit the dope game and start rapping about my time as a pimp and a drug dealer. I would die a violent death before the age of 35.
