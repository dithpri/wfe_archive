The Sylvan System is host to an F-Class Star, slightly larger and more massive than Sol, located 743.89ly away from Sol.

The system holds two Habitable planets, in a binary orbit. Alpha Sylvanis, and Beta Sylvanis.
Alpha Sylvanis is a world with strong magnetic field, causing unusual, ring-like mountains to form from the dense, rare-earth metallic Crust.
Beta Sylvanis is a Primal world, having had a significantly longer period of tectonic instability, it is just starting to settle and cool, with the first naturally evolving plant and animal life evolving alongside it.
