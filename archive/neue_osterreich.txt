[color=green][b]Welcome to the most beautiful and prosperous region of the world, where freedom and culture flourish under the shade of snow-capped mountains.

Welcome to a land rich in history and traditions, where the strength of our victorious armies interpenetrates harmoniously with the hard work of our skillful craftsmen.

Welcome to the land where icy rivers plunge into a warm fishy sea, where the people are friendly and joyful.

Welcome to the land generous of beverages and delicacies, peaceful land safe from the violences of the outer world, where the good folks is always welcomed, with a stool by the fire and a cup of hot Gl&uuml;hwein. [/b][/color]
