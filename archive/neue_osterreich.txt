Welcome to the wonderful region of Neue &Ouml;sterreich!

Austria was known for its noble history, diverse culture and environmental beauty, but our open and welcoming land was invaded and destroyed by foreign tyrants and ruthless raiders.

That&amp;#39;s why we, refugees of our former homeland Austria, have founded this new, democratic, free, peaceful and moderate homeland.

So grab a seat by the fire and try a cup of our famous gl&uuml;hwein in the marvellous region of Neue &Ouml;sterreich!
