Democracy is installed and strictly enforced. 

Nations attempting to subvert the law, criticize, convince, undermine, or nations of the old regime will be ejected on sight.

Beware of imperialists and so called &#39;traditionalists&#39; who try to convince you to move out, remember, they opposed the Democratic Revolution no matter how much they try to claim otherwise.

Nations recruiting out of this region will be reported.

A new forum is being constructed.
