The Confederation of Peoples Republics, is a loose confederation of likeminded states. Its ideals are as follows:

1. incorporate slightly more private enterprise, without fully wiping out the public sector (maintain some control)
2. democracy is a waste of time (people are idiots)
3. civil rights are important (people should have a say where their hard earned tax money goes)
4. bigger government (surveillance)

The aim is to become a benevolent dictatorship, a government of the elites, by the elites, for the people.

We are but a fledgling region, but together we can make the Confederation of Peoples Republics great!
