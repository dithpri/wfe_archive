Welcome to a region that exists right at the very intersection of a group of seven interuniversal time zones. 

Only four such zones are known to exist in the cosmos. 

If you&amp;#39;d like to be part of a community where time runs 7x faster than &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; and an entire week passes in a day, feel free to move in!
