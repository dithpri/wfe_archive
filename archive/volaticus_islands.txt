Kept afloat by three separate generators, these 18 flying islands, have many waterfalls, mountains and wildlife preserves, each generators powers 6 islands, so if more than 18 nations move in, we can create more islands. being floating, we can observe the world with a watchful eye. 

Our regional space program has made new leaps in man space flight, including the Gravosphere(tm) generator, which keeps our islands floating indefinitely. and can also simulate earths gravity and atmosphere on distant planets to keep our people safe.
