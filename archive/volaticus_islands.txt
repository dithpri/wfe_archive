Kept afloat by two separate generators, these 12 flying islands, have many waterfalls, mountains and wildlife preserves, each generators powers 6 islands, so if more than 12 nations move in, we can create more islands. being floating, we can observe the world with a watchful eye. 

Our regional space program has made new leaps in man space flight, including the gravoshpere(tm) generator, which keeps our islands floating indefinitely. and can also simulate earths gravity and atmosphere on distant planets to keep our people safe.
