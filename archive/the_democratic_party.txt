You can try, but we can not be overtaken. DEN forces have recently invaded the Democratic Party, but failed. We are strong and united. We thank the nation of [nation]Chancellor Foosh[/nation] for informing us on time.

The region will be closed due to region invasions and tensions. For access to the region please inform the region founder or its officers for further information.

The Democratic Party is for registered democrats only, unless given permission to enter by its officers. We are looking for WA Delegates so please stop by and ask for further information.

We are Open for constructing embassies with other regions so please feel free to leave a proposal.
