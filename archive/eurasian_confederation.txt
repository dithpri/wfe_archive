Across sea-meadows measureless I go,
 My wagon sinking under grass so tall
The flowery petals in foam on me fall,
 And blossom-isles float by I do not know.
No pathway can the deepening twilight show;
 I seek the beckoning stars which sailors call,
And watch the clouds. What lies there brightening all?
 The Dneister&amp;#39;s, the steppe-ocean&amp;#39;s evening glow!
