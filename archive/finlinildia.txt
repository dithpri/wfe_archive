Hello there! it seems you wonderned upon Finlinidia this is a region in scandinavia although it&#39;s pretty small here (and new) maybe you could settle here and possibily make history, this region has historical roots tied to [nation]Finlinind[/nation] although the name has always been hard to pronouce by forgieners,but this colssol nation held all of the land in modern day Finlinildia, we would have nothing without them, thanks for moving here and we hope you enjoy your&#39;e stay!
