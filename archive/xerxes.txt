Xerxes currently consists mainly of the founding nation: Kickstarter.

Xerxes is a lovely tropical rainforest, which (when deforested), leaves serene grasslands. which are firm enough to build on, but also fertile for agriculture. There are also a variety of natural and man-made landforms/scapes.

See you in Xerxes!
