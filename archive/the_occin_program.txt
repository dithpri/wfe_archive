In 4-6-3-47993AUK (around 22,300 BCE in earth years), the war between Hadrox and Zenupes, the leaders of two rival organizations of planets throughout many galaxies, ended in a decisive victory for Zenupes. In his place, he founded the Council of Universal Order. In turn, they founded The O.C.C.I.N. (Obsidian Collection of Civilized &amp; Intelligent Nations) Program. This program would make contact with planets Civilizations lost contact with during the war, as well as any new planets, provided they were technologically advanced enough to have invented their own means of interstellar travel OR contact with the Council of Universal Order through advanced communications technology.
