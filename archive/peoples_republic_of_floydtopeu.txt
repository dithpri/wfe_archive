Oh, say! can you see by the dawn&amp;#39;s early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&amp;#39;s last gleaming; 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O&amp;#39;er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly        streaming?And the rocket&amp;#39;s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was  still there: Oh, say! does that star-spangled banner yet wave O&amp;#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 
we welcome you with open arms.
