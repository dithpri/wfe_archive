A diner on the roadside of the highway between Heaven and Hell, sitting dimensionally parallel to the world that mortals inhabit. An overlay, if you will; much like a projector slide laid over another to create a single picture of mortality and immortality; damned and saved. These are the gates to the Afterlife.
