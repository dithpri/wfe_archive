The Democratic Republic of Norova (Rep&uacute;blica Democr&aacute;tica de Norova) is a small country in South America. Founded in 1821 after a bloody revolution against the Spanish, Governor Rodrigo Jos&eacute; &Aacute;vila Ortega de la Garza declared himself president of the former colony. Although officially a democratic country, the country is really a hereditary absolute monarchy. Apart from two insurgencies during the Cold War that succeeded in overthrowing the Ortegas for a few years at a time, the Ortega dynasty has ruled the nation with an iron fist for the past two centuries.
