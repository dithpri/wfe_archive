Guidelines on shootposting: Let me just shed some light on this. I could care less about bandwagons, or replies to users with just a single reaction picture. But when you post a new comment (a new thread) at least type out some kind of conceptual context. Don&#39;t just post a picture and be done because there are tons of possibilities to how to perceive it, and its hard to follow

shootposting is a really vauge moot term that can be thrown around anywhere. Its impossible to completely filter out shootposting. The best we can do is add a minimum guideline. It beats saying &quot;Dont shootpost&quot; and have a dozen opinions flying around of what shootposting is. I rather have something concrete to follow.
