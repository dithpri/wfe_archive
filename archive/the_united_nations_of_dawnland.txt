Welcome, traveler~
We are the United Nations of Dawnland. Drawn together by a belief in limited government, free economics, personal freedom, responsibility and a strong national defense, the United Nations of Dawnland welcomes people of all race, color and creed.

We were founded by plucky Pilgrims who forged a new life in freedom. We are looking for strong, independent countries to become allies. Together, we can grow in prosperity and resist evil ideologies.
