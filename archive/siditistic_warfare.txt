In the time of warfare, nations free from chaos &amp;amp; whatnot flee from being involved in petty squabbles of others. 

If you wish to not be involved in World Assembly, Invading/Defending raids or just want to sit down &amp;amp; enjoy the game for the fun that it is...this is a place for you! :D
