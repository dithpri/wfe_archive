[color=blue][u][b]The Cooperative Union Government-In-Exile[/b][/u][/color]

The Cooperative Union Government-In-Exile are the rightful claimants to [region]The Cooperative Union[/region]. Since 2014, the Cooperative Union has been occupied by different regimes throughout the years. Various efforts by the natives have created successor regions that have suffered the same fate, such as [region]The League of Reformed Socialist States[/region] and [region]The New Cooperative Union[/region].

The Government-In-Exile of the Cooperative Union calls for the liberation of the Cooperative Union from the hands of [region]The Red Fleet[/region]. This is not an act of so-called &quot;Leftist Solidarity&quot;, this is an occupation of the natives&#39; homeland.
