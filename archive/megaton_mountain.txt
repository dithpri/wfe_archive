The region of Megaton Mountain and its surrounding territory, a landscape of lush forests and year round fall foliage, was born from a commune consisting of radical leftwing rebels who narrowly escaped from a failed socialist revolution in its former affiliated region, Lazarus. The elected leaders of West Clocktown, the central hub, located near the summit of the smallest mountain in the range for which the region is named, and the overwhelming majority of like-minded citizens are radical with a tendency towards Trotskyism; in the meantime, their goal is to create a livable region that promotes ideals of equality, liberty, and camaraderie.
