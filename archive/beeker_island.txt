[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to Beeker Island![/b] Where we worship [nation=B E E K E R]! Did you know that [url=http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3569/beekergirl1.png]Beeker[/url] is both from from the future and invented the toaster oven!? Here on Beeker Island we use Beeker&amp;#39;s hair as currency and sleep with a blow up doll replica of Beeker if he looked just like Ronald Reagan. [/color]

[color=darkred][i]For our nightly ritual we gather outside of Beeker&amp;#39;s window, whispering [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlL5RcJWNPE]I love you, you love me[/url] as we cut ourselves and watch Beeker sleep.[/i][/color]
