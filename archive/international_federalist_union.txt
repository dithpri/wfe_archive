[b]At mid-day on Sunday, [region]Europeia[/region]&#39;s ERN went on a stroll through the woods. A very enthusiastic walk. 

Along the way, the Navy stopped by a few Regions and filled them with cheers and good news. Grand Admiral Kazaman and Midshipman Klatonia left 7 Regions with nothing but smiles on their faces on this glorious Sunday!
