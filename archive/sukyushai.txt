This particular Region is in another solar system from Earth.  It will be made up of nations on one or more of the worlds in it.  Those particular nations will be decided on over time as needed or desired by the founder, and this region&amp;#39;s nations will only include nations that the founder allows to be in it.  The same rules that currently apply in the following regions will apply here, as well, in fact:  [region]The North Atlantic Ocean[/region], [region]The Promised Land of Israel[/region], and [region]Judah[/region]!  [b]NO RECRUITERS EITHER!  NO EXCEPTIONS![/b]  That is all.  [nation]Zhaugil[/nation] out.
