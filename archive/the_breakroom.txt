[b]Welcome to [region]Lands End[/region]&#39;s state-of-the-art break room![/b] Here all employees can relax, eat their lunch and wash away all the stress from working at a global scale corporation. That&#39;s it... let all your negative vibes wash away in our brand new hot tub. We have a luxury snack bar and a magic genie to grant all your wishes (and also happens to be super hot).

This region is intended for Role-playing nations from Lands End to experience a gameplay type different from that of our largely non-RP region. Don&#39;t worry if you are not from Lands End. All are welcome. Our RP topics will vary widely, and will possibly be chosen by... You of course! Who says work can&#39;t be fun? Jump in! 

[b]Please do not move your main nations here. Use embassy posting or a puppet[/b]
