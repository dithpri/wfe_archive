We are a Democratic Region, where you can do what you want, endorse anyone and generally just mess about. We have no limits, but we are mainly left wing friendly, but everyone&amp;#39;s welcome. The founder gets the control of defending the region from invaders, but the WA delegate has the majority of the power. (Including defence).
