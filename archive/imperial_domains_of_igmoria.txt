In this region, all member states are considered subordinate to the Empire of Igmoria. Do not think that you will retain your sovereignty when you join as you shall forever be considered an Imperial Province when you do. All members shall refer to themselves as Provincial Regulus and prostrate themselves to the Igmorian Emperor. All Regulus shall be heard regarding Imperial matters but the final decision shall lie on the Emperor alone. Think carefully, for total and complete loyalty is required from aspiring Regulus.
