[b]The International Security Alliance[/b] is an intergovernmental military alliance. The ISA was created after the realization of major threats to democracies in the world. The alliance was established so that no one nation stood alone against this threat. The organization constitutes a system of collective defense. Whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party.
