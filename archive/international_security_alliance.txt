[b]The International Security Alliance[/b] is an intergovernmental alliance. The ISA was created after the realization of major threats to nations around the globe. The alliance was established so that no one nation stood alone against a threat and lead nations toward a path of peace. The organization constitutes a system of collective defense. Whereby its member states agree to mutual defense in response to an attack by any external party on a member.
