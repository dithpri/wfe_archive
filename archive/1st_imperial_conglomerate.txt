The Imperial Conglomerate comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the Imperial Conglomerate. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by American Rednecks between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. By now the Imperial Conglomerate held sway over about 458 million people. The empire covered more than 33,700,000 km2 (13,012,000 sq mi), almost a quarter of the Earth&amp;#39;s total land area.
