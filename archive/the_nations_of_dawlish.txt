We are a group made up of mainly Queendoms(its only polite to let women go first) and Kingdoms that are ruled separately and freely by their own monarchs. If there is another nation that would like to join that is not categorized likely then we may be able to change our allegiance requirements. If so, then contact the Queen of Luthivira for your application. 

We would like to invite any Nations to join us. We operate mainly on peace and welfare of our people so we would like you to be of like mind, but it is not necessary. We accept that some do what they must for their countries even if they do not see the injustice of it. We will however brook no intentional cruelty. You will be removed from the Nations of Dawlish if this happens.
