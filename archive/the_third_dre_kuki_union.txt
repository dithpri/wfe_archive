The Second Dre Kuki Union consists of many different, yet united states. 
All are semi-independent but pledge loyalty to the central government of Dre Kuki. 

The Union, which works in a similar but more &quot;controlling&quot; manner than the EU, handles the foreign affairs and imposes federal laws upon each state.
Founded by the goons of the North East, it is made up of loosely connected states which form together under one system, one banner.

The Federal Government is based in the heart of the Union, in the capital of Dre Kuki City, where the Union Senate convenes.
