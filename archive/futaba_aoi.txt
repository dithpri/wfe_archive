[color=purple]The plant Aoi (precisely, futaba aoi), sacred to the Kamo Shrine, grows on the forest floor and consists of a pair of broad, heart-shaped leaves that spring from a single stem. It is known as Heart-to-Heart. This region is one that I wish to grow into peace and friendships among its members.[/color]
