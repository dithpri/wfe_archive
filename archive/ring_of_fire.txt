The Pacific Ring of Fire (or just The Ring of Fire) is an area where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. In a 40,000 km (25,000 mi) horseshoe shape, it is associated with a nearly continuous series of oceanic trenches, volcanic arcs, and volcanic belts and/or plate movements. The Ring of Fire has 452 volcanoes and is home to over 75% of the world&amp;#39;s active and dormant volcanoes.  It is sometimes called the circum-Pacific belt or the circum-Pacific seismic belt.
About 90% of the world&amp;#39;s earthquakes and 81% of the world&amp;#39;s largest earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire.
