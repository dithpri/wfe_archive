We have immigrated to the region around the Orion nebula portion of the Milky Way Galaxy. We believe in defending our region, building better weapons, and playing jokes on each other- not necessarily in that order. The Region is run by 5 Councillors. 1 of them bring the Supreme Councillor, the other, the Grand Councillor. and the last 3 are normal Councillors elected by the Pact Nations.
