We are the survivors of a Raid by the Black Riders. We have immigrated to the region around the Orion nebula portion of the Milky Way Galaxy. We believe in defending our region, building better weapons, and playing jokes on each other- not necessarily in that order. The Region is run by 5 Councillors 1 of them is the Supreme Councillor, the other is the Grand Councillor and the last 3 are normal Councillors elected by the Pact Nations.
