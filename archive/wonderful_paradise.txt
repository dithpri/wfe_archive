[b][u]Greetings members of the region

Due to inactivity of the region, certain members have proposed an abolishment of the Constitution and National Congress and pursuing of a directly centralized government.

Certain ideas that have come forth include:

&#149; dissolving of the United Republic and establishment of a peaceful, non threatening, WA Delegate run region, with the current delegate heading for the rest of the regions existence.
&#149; dissolving of the region (everyone moves to wherever they want)

Please provide feedback, thank you[/u][/b]
