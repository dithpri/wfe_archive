[color=003366][b]Timor[/b] is an island at the southern end of Maritime Southeast Asia, north of the Timor Sea. The island is divided between the sovereign states of East Timor, on the eastern part, and Indonesia, on the western part.

As the nearest island with a European settlement at the time, Timor was the destination of William Bligh and seamen loyal to him following the infamous mutiny on the [i]Bounty[/i] in 1789. It was also where survivors of the wrecked HMS [i]Pandora[/i], sent to arrest the Bounty mutineers, landed in 1791 after that ship sank in the Great Barrier Reef.
