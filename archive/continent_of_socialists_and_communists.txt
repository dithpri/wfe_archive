This is the great land of the greatest socialists of all time, such as Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong, Vladmir Lenin, Karl Marx, and Pol Pot. We believe in social equality and welfare, we have strong militaries and don&amp;#39;t waste all of our tax dollars on the military. Civil Rights and Political freedoms may be low, but it makes up when you know you are protected and can have the greatest powers in all of Nationstates in one region.
