Ferrum Autem Piscium (meaning The Iron Fist) and its nations are all about politics, rising and conquering.

However, as any good region leader knows, in order to conquer you need allies. The Iron fist is very open to allies. Ask and you shall receive.

The Leader, Praefectus Dion, is a benevolent and considerate (perhaps not modest though :/) leader open to ideas about the government.

Elections are held once 5 have requested one. The default WA Delegate is The Empire of Fremoore.
