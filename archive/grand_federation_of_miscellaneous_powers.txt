[i][b][color=#BF0000]PRAISE BE COMRADES[/color][/b]

[b]For too long[/b] we have faced relentless oppression from greater powers. [b]For too long[/b] we have been censored, unable to express our principles to the world. [b]For too long[/b] we have been silenced, with the emphasis on [b]SILENT[/b].
Rise up my brothers, and cast aside the shackles of those who exploited us. [b]We must[/b] shape our own destiny. [b]We must[/b] shape our own ideals. [b]We must[/b] shape our own society.

Glory to the world. GLORY TO THE [b]GFMP![/b][/i]

-Vladimir Glenin, General Secretary of The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Glenistan
