Welcome to the [b][color=red]Kingdom of Macedon[/color][/b], where great conquerors are born.

Our homeland is situated in the northeastern corner of the Greek peninsula. Our ancestors achieved hegemony over Greece and conquered lands as far east as the Indus River. 

There are two modern Macedonian peoples, one of Hellenic heritage and one of Slavonic heritage.
