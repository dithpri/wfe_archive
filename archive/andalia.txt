[b]WELCOME TO THE REGION OF [color=green]ANDALIA[/color]![/b] [hr]

We are a human, modern tech, roleplaying region with a focus on realistic world-building. We follow a full-immersion policy, meaning there are little cultural references to the real world; all nations, cultures, and religions are unique! [hr]

[color=green]We hope you consider joining us![/color] If you are interested in joining, send [nation]Parlin[/nation] or [nation]Volthar-Oberia[/nation] a TG, or apply to join [url=]here[/url].
