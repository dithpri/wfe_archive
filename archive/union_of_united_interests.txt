This semi-global alliance was originally formed under the pretense of mutual defense, free trade, and general cooperation. Though their ideas different, all nations within the UUI understood that to stand alone, would be to die alone, in a world controlled by the greedy and powerful. Through years of conflict involving Western powers, these few nations managed to retain their independence and began growing their infrastructure and economies. Though battered and bruised, each nation within the Union have grown into respectable nations with bright futures.
