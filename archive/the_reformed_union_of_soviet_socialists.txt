Hello and welcome to The Reformed Union of Soviet Socialists! Our region is run by a council called the Tribunal. The Tribunal members are [nation]Mordande[/nation], [nation]The Fing Motherland[/nation], and [nation]Rulden[/nation]. If you have suggestions for legislation, feel free to contact the Tribunal Officers, so long as your a resident here you&#39;re opinion matters! We will have party purges to help in the removal of puppets, spies, and annoying nations. Capitalists will be immediately ejected and banned.
