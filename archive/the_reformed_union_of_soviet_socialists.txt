[color=Red][B]CARPE DIEM PROTOCOL ENACTED[/B][/color]
-
&quot;Jocelyn, how close are you to enacting the protocol?&quot;
&quot;I just did. Barker, you secured the door?&quot;
&quot;The door is sealed. So now that the dumb program is on, what now boss?&quot;
&quot;Reports say Graham is still alive and is rebuilding the old Mordande War Clans, you know what that means.&quot;
&quot;Krozin? You don&#39;t seriously think he survived the dissident uprising... Do you?&quot;
&quot;I served in his personal bodyguard detachments, he could handle himself in a fight. I doubt a couple rebels would be much trouble for him. If Graham and his comrades survived, who is to say Krozin didn&#39;t?&quot;
&quot;If you say so boss. Any ideas where to look Joce?&quot;
&quot;...... I&#39;ve got an idea, but it may take us a while to get there.&quot;
