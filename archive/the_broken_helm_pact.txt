Welcome to The Broken Helm Pact, a rugged and tactical region forged from the ashes of fallen empires, collapsed systems, and broken promises. Here, resilience is currency, cleverness is law, and survival is just the opening play.

Member nations of the Pact are bound not by blind loyalty, but by mutual respect for strategy, independence, and second chances. No gods, no kings &#151; only plans that work.

Known for its high tolerance of experimentation &#151; from economic models to cultural traditions &#151; The Broken Helm Pact is a safe haven for the displaced, the daring, and the dangerously well-prepared.

Whether you&#146;re building from rubble or rewriting the rules, if you know how to plan, adapt, and endure, you belong here.
