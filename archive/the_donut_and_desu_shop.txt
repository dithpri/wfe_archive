As you wander into the shop the smell of hot fresh donuts fills your senses.  The counter overflows with all kinds of magical goodies like apple fritters, frosted ringed, and bear claws.

While you select your poison you notice a long line of pumps under a massive scrolling marquee that states &amp;quot;Get your Desu here!&#148;  You notice famous names from Corona to Guinness.  You also observe some of the more unusual names like &amp;quot;Theakston&amp;#39;s Old Peculiar&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Old Thumper&amp;quot;

The owner of the shop is selective about it&amp;#39;s customers.  Strangers may be shown the door.
