The Pharaocracy of Kemti dominates the Stoneworks and Papyri Industries of Kemti Major, while the GDP consists of the usual Mummy Mausoleum construction companies, with a high employment level per capita.  Our Citizens are well-educated, moderately healthy, and have a 90% Employment status.  Our Pharaoh rules effectively from within his Titanium Palace, also home to a legion of Scribes and Mage-Priests.  We are peaceful with some distant Corporate Empires, and seek only peaceful trading with the outside world.
