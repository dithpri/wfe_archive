[color=darkpurple][i]&amp;quot;But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 3/4, there&amp;#39;s no such thing. Is there?&amp;quot;[/i]

[b]Welcome to Platform Nine and Three Quarters! Wherever you&amp;#39;re going, we hope you enjoy the journey.[/b]

Platform Nine and Three Quarters was the first home of the [b][region]Spiritus[/region][/b] Defense Force, until it was seized and destroyed by disgruntled former Vice-President Cormac Stark in October 2013. Fortune has recently allowed [b][region]Wintreath[/region][/b], an offshoot region of Spiritus, to reclaim this region as a memorial to a more innocent, carefree time for many of those who launched operations from this base. A time when fun and friendship came before politics and conflict, and the sky was the limit...

[b]Hail Platform! Hail Wintreath![/b][/color]
