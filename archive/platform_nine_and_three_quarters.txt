Platform Nine and Three Quarters was the first home of the Spiritus Defense Force, until it was commandeered and left to disappear by disgruntled former Vice-President Cormac Stark in October 2013. Fortune allowed Wintreath, an offshoot region of Spiritus, to reclaim this region as a memorial for those who launched operations from this base. The region would again change ownership in July of 2014 when Denth Kasten, then Jarl of Defense for Wintreath, would be given ownership of the region by [i]His Most Royal Majesty[/i] the King of Wintreath.[/color]
