Crazy we may be, but not as crazy as our sister-region where the flying bunnies are pink! Just hold onto your tacos as you move about outdoors ....

This region was founded by Reading Rabbits as a jump-off point after Crazy Pink Bunnies With Wings&amp;#39; founder, Female Soup, ceased to exist. Once that Region had collapsed and been re-founded by Rehoboth-in-Middle this region stayed. Reading Rabbits disappeared, and the region was invaded and violated by various knavish rogues, so the reverse process was used to collapse and re-found it.

Prospective residents please apply to the founder with reasons for wishing to enter.
