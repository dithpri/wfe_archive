The Union of Glory is a strong and proud region. We support the rights of our member states, and we encourage competition. We especially encourage competition that our founder finds humorous. 

This region is a constitutional monarchy and welcomes anyone, including invaders. Competition strengthens us all. Fight, fight back, and win. To the victor goes the spoils.
