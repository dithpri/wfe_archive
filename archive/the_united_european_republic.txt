The United European Republic (UER) is a superstate encompassing most of the European continent. It was formed after Supreme Leader Juncker ran for president of the European Union on a platform promising rapid federalization, winning by an overwhelming landslide margin. The UER&#39;s 21 federated states pride themselves on their social liberal political ideals, with open borders, free trade and equal rights for all.
