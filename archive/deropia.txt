Earlier this year, a dear friend and comrade Ceased to Exist. This was his puppet storage region, and his friends at the North Pacific Army decided to not let it die. We hold this region now as a tribute to him.

Deropia: you were a light to us at the NPA, and a dear friend. When you return, we will accept you with open arms.

Sincerely,
The North Pacific Army.
