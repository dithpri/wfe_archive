When multiple countrys, all of whom are part of the region known as &quot;The New Found Comintern&quot; had seemingly simultaneous revolutions, the newly created assortment of nations decided to unite in order to fight against their oppressors! Of course, not ALL of the countrys that are a part of this region were once part of that horrid region, just the founders of it. Anyone who wishes to fight against the New Found Comintern may join! We stand for freedom and capitalism!
