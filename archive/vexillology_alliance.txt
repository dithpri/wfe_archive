[colour=#002653]Hello, fine nation, and welcome to [region]Vexillology Alliance[/region]!

We&#39;re a kind, accepting, endorsement happy region currently looking for officers to appoint. If you&#39;re willing to join us for the long run, then I&#39;ll be more than happy to appoint you as an officer. 

Otherwise, we&#39;re a flag based community for vexillologists, vexillographers and vexillophiles alike. Even if you&#39;re not someone too interested in flags, you&#39;re welcome to join us. If you&#39;re new to the art of vexillology, we&#39;ll even teach you some things. 

For now, just come on in, make yourself at home, and join us as we try to become the largest vexillology region in all of NationStates![/colour]
