[color=green]Hey you, despotic tyrant, 
Darkness lover and enemy of life,
You scoffed at powerless people&#146;s groans; 
And your hands are tainted with their blood.
You embarked on empoisoning the allure of existence 
and sowing prickles of grief in its horizons.

You will see! Don&#146;t be deceived by springtime, 
Shining sky and morning light:
For in the wide horizon lurks darkness&#146; fright, 
Thunder rumble and stormy winds.
Woe betide you, for flames are underneath ashes. 
Who grows prickles reaps wounds.
Have a look there&#133; where you cut off 
The people&#146;s heads and the flowers of hope;
You imbibed the heart of the earth with blood 
And made it drunk with tears.
The flood, of blood, will wipe you away, and the flaring gale will eat you up.[/color]
