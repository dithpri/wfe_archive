[color=black][b]Welcome to[/color] [color=green][i]DUBAI[/i][/color][color=black], a US-backed city-state of steel, glass and sand dreamed up by dictators and built upon the backs of the corpses of slaves from the Indian subcontinent in order to be a debauched fun-in-the-sun playground of the sociopathic super-rich and tyrants alike whilst being a sponsor and weapons-supplier of ISIL and Al Qaeda.[/color][/b]

[b][color=black]Whose tyrant kidnaps and imprisons his own children when they try to flee his grasp, and launches a campaign of intimidation against wives who dare to leave him.[/color][/b]

[color=green]
You embarked on empoisoning the allure of existence 
and sowing prickles of grief in its horizons.[/color]
