The Matriarchy of St. Adelaide of Bellic is a Matriarchy modeled after the miracle worker. When Adelaide young, she entered the convent of St Ursula, Our Lady of the Capitol, founded by her parents in Cologne, where the Rule of St Jerome was followed. About 980, her parents founded the convent of Villich, supported by a manor at the confluence of the Rhine and the Sieg, opposite the city of Bonn, on the site of a Frankish cemetery and what appears to have been a proprietary church, modern archeology has revealed. Adelaide was &quot;redeemed&quot; from the convent by exchange with a parcel of land and became abbess of this new convent, initially established as an unusually late example of a community of canonesses.
