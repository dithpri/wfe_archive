Greetings from the I.F.A. 

Our focus is to agree to enhance the human freedoms that all people deserve.
All people should be equal. No matter race or gender.
The I.F.A. strives to set a good example of how basic freedoms should be handled.
If you share these ideals, then we&#39;d be obliged to have you join.
