A group of humanoids were expelled from their planet earth and saved by a cosmic storm that landed them on a similar planet in another distant solar system.  This group established their settlement on an uninhabited island.  They had sent out reconnaissance missions to evaluate the natives. They appeared intelligent, but not as developed. No contact was established- instead the alien humanoids to this world quickly found the resources to develop an invisibility cloak whilst recording and monitoring the developments of the native humanoid societies.
