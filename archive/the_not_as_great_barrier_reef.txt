[color=green] Hello, and welcome to the [b]Not As Great Barrier Reef![/b] [/color]

This is where all sentient aquatic life reside. Whether they have evolved to live on land or still prefer the ocean as their home, this region accommodates for these sea creatures that have a passion for politics.

[color=purple] This region accepts nations that feature aquatic life as its main population. [i]Since this is a non-serious region, no ranking prerequisites (such as environmental beauty) are required. [/i] [/color]

Please bear with the barren landscape of this region; it&#39;s brand new.
