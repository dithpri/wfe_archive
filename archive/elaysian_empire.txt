&amp;quot;After the establishment of Genedyne as a Protectorate of the Kingdom of Elaysia, Queen Joanna III determined that founding a region was the appropriate step to take.  The Elaysian Empire is the result of that decision.  Though founded to support the protectorates that rely on the Kingdom of Elaysia, any nation may submit themselves and enjoy the benefits of a free trade alliance and mutual defense agreement.  The Elaysian Empire has a common currency agreement, currencies from other nations can be exchanges at any convenience store in the Empire.&amp;quot; - Foreign Minster Alexa Loring
