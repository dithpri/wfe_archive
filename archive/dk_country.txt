[b]This region has been taken by [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] with the combined might of [region]The New Inquisition[/region] and [region]The Land of Kings and Emperors[/region].

No region is safe from the imperialist juggernaut that is the UIAF. Tremble in fear as we march by!

Sorry [region]The Black Riders[/region] no detag from fendas, we are just tagging over this one for ya!

Praise the Kaiserin! Long live the Emperor!

We took this region with force and we had one lone [nation=short]Isidor C Stark[/nation] losing all his balloons from shells while driving off from the bake off in [region]Albion[/region]![/b]
