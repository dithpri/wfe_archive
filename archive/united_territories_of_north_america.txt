[Color=blue]Welcome to the United Territories Of North America![/color] [Color=green]The UTNA![/color]

This region was originally a memorial to the original UTNA. Founded in the spring of 2014, by a group of players with a dream. And that dream, was of a North American continent in a perpetual state of never ending warfare. The UTNA lasted a good three years before fading into obscurity. 

In 2020 the UTNA was reformed agin by a combined group of former members and new residents. Like a Phoenix the UTNA has risen from the ashes! Long live the United Territories of North America!!!
