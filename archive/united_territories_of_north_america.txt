[Color=blue]Welcome to the United Territories Of North America![/color] [Color=green]The UTNA![/color]

This region is a memorial to the original UTNA founded in the spring of 2014 by a group of players with a dream, and that dream was of a north american continent in a perpetual state of never ending warfare. The UTNA lasted a good three years before fading into obscurity. Perhaps one day the never ending cycle of violence and terrible warfare in the UTNA will continue once more, but for now the stench of death still lingers across this long ruined hellscape, no life could possibly survive here anymore.
