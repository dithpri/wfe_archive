The Elder Scrolls is a game series developed by Bethesda Softworks. The development of TES began in 1992, when Bethesda Softworks decided to shift the focus of their upcoming Arena from arena combat into role-playing. The team, pulling influences from Ultima Underworld and Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, released the massive, open, but ultimately derivative, first-person RPG The Elder Scrolls: Arena in 1994 for DOS PC systems. The game began a tradition of games based on the principles of &amp;quot;being who you want and doing what you want&amp;quot;. To date, there are five titles in the main series of the game. TES I: Arena, TES II: Daggerfall, TES III: Morrowind, TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim.
