The Fruktig Islands are a chain of islands that are filled with a rich history based around fruit. Originally the islands were sparsely populated and only the Native Fruktigites who had a belief around the divinity of fruit which caused them to be used in many rituals and foods. The arrival of the Baninians led to a merge of native Fruktigite cultures and Baninian culture as well as the development of The Federates states of Baninia and a few other nations.
