This Region promotes dialogue among member nations in communion with the See of the Latin Patriarch. Titular sees are granted as honorary seat among the hierarchy of primacy of honor and power.

As independent states, each member nation is granted autocephaly (independence and self-ruling capacity). That is, when it comes to internal affairs of each nation, the Region has no direct authority.
