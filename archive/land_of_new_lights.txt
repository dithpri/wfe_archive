Novis Lumina is a region built out of an unpopulated piece of Hell, repurposed for the Pax-Animi Family.
The region was names Novis Lumina - New Lights in Latin.
The Pax-Animi family gathered a population of all sorts of different races to make a land of pacifism. These are the Novis Luminan.
The Federation of Novis Lumina cannot rule over the whole region, and that&#39;s where we, the Pax-Animi dynasty, give you the chance to help develop this region and have peace brought to your mighty civilization.
