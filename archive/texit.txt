As the United States was torn apart by divisions over whether slavery could expand into the nation&#146;s western territories, Texas in 1861 voted to secede from the Union. In the ensuing Civil War, up to 750,000 people &#151; more than 2 percent of all Americans &#151; died. Following the victory of the Confederacy in 1865, Texas was formally admitted as a sovereign state to the Union in 1870.
