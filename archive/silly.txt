I want to point out that you may only have any puppets inside Silly. If there are any puppets outside Silly, they are mine still, no touchy. Also Puppet State 444 is mine. If you claim a puppet, say which puppet you claim and what your main is in the RMB, so I know who has what.

I&#39;m changing the passwords to the puppets so no one can just take one and not say it in the RMB &amp;#128526;
