&amp;#127775;[b][I]Welcome to Octoarma.[/I] A scifi roleplay-centric region based in a galaxy of same name.&amp;#127775;[/b]

[I]We were kids. [B]Children.[/b] Mere mortals messing with things only the Elder races understood...

Across the [b]Octocultus[/b], there was weeping &amp; gnashing of teeth... Rekkonning had come.

[B]All that was is gone.[/b] Aeon-old Empires died, their ruins &amp; secrets left to rot on the worlds they once subjugated and governed.

More elderly races left, forsaking the Materium for a more &quot;cosmic conscious&quot; life... Darn Space Hippies. Most weren&#39;t so lucky, &amp; very few have survived to tell the tale of [b]Rekkonning.[/b]

The End of an Era... but another to come! New races &amp; civilizations have arisen; ready to scavenge &amp; conquer the whole of Octoarma!

Will [b]you[/b] be one of them?[/I]
