[color=red]Welcome to [b]Dunia[/b][/color], a region set in the 1940s made up of a collection of archipelagos and small continents. We are open to the NS Multiverse, which means that the region takes place in the 1940s of the Multiverse too. Dunia is aimed at quality roleplaying and aim for realism. Above all, Dunia tries to achieve a fun and good RP experience for the members and participants of the region. We are open to all, whether you are an experienced roleplayer or someone who is brand new to the world of NationStates and is cooperative and wanting to learn.
