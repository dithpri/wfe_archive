I&amp;#39;m calling out from Scatland
I&amp;#39;m calling out from Scatman&amp;#39;s world.
If you wanna break free you better listen to me.
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy.

Everybody&amp;#39;s talkin&amp;#39; something very shockin&amp;#39; just to
Keep on blockin&amp;#39; what they&amp;#39;re feelin&amp;#39; inside
But listen to me brother, you just keep on walkin&amp;#39; &amp;#39;cause
You and me and sisty ain&amp;#39;t got nothing&amp;#39; to hide.

Scatman, fat man, black and white and brown man
Tell me &amp;#39;bout the colour of your soul.
If part of your solution isn&amp;#39;t ending the pollution
Then I don&amp;#39;t want to hear your stories told.
I want to welcome you to Scatman&amp;#39;s world.
