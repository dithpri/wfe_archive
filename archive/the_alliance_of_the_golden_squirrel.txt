We all pledge our allegiance to the golden squirrel. May he watch over us and bless us with his gloriousness. 

If you are fun loving. We welcome you.
If you are mad or clinically insane. We welcome you.
If your son just blew up your giant battle station. Sorry but we can&amp;#39;t rebuild it.
If you are easily distrac..... BUNNY!!!!
If there&amp;#39;s kilngons on the starboard bow. Fire the phasers!!!!

We do not take life seriously. However we will not condone anybody being rude or agressive towards other nations or regions. Anybody caught doing so shall be spanked..... with a sledgehammer.
