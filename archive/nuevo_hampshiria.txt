A rugged, granite-strewn region known for its mountainous terrain, slowly-declining population of white-tailed deer and citizens endowed with massive genitalia, Nuevo Hampshiria (from the Old English &amp;quot;Southern Maine&amp;quot;) is a scenic destination located in the northeastern portion of the Old United States. Wide, fast-running rivers abut granite-dotted slopes covered in birch and pine; maple syrup virtually sprays from the trees and acorns rain down in skull-rattling torrents every fall. The hardy, self-reliant people of this land subsist on a diet of beef, venison, pork, chicken, fish, squirrel, rabbit, and sewer rat (which allegedly tastes like pumpkin pie, according to noted resident Jules Winfield).
