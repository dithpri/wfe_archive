The Union of Science is a union of, well, science. It&#39;s founder, PRYabog and his co-workers, RScience and Wisdom and PRYee-Man, are pleased to see your interest in our factbook. Unlike other larger nations, we give &quot;special privileges&quot; controlling an aspect of our union to every new nation. Even though we aren&#39;t that big, nor scientifically advanced(or maybe we are...), we are just a small union ready to help out the world. Thank you for reading this.
