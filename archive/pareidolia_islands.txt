Pick a continent number. Send [nation=ouma] a telegram with which one you&amp;#39;d like. If more than one nation picks the same continent, I will let each person know so that they can discuss between themselves how they want to divide it, and you guys can get back to me.

[url=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v283/flaksthird/nationstates/ex1.png]Example[/url], Red and Blue both choose the continent and agree on how to divide it. They both highlight an area they can never lose should other nations move in.

All divisions of land and permanent areas will be within reason, so a third nation won&amp;#39;t claim everything that isn&amp;#39;t permanent.
