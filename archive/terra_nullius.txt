There is considerable debate among historians about how and when the terra nullius concept were used. The debate has been especially prevalent in Australia where it was ignited by the History wars caused by the Mabo case in 1992. The history wars caused Australian historians to reevaluate the country&#39;s history, the dispossession of Aborigines and whether the land best should be characterized as having been &quot;settled&quot; or &quot;conquered.&quot; A part of this debate concerned whether terra nullius as a concept was ever used by England and other European powers to justify territorial conquest.
