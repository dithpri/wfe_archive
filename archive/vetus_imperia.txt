[i][b]Vetus Imperia is as much a philosophy as it is a dream. A dream of a world of power and authority![/b][/i]

Vetus Imperia is the belief that progressive modernisation and liberal ideals are withering and de-evolving the world as a whole, and that the only solution is to return to the old ways of military power and autocracy.
It deems to return to the glory days of imperial conquest and political intrigue, where power is taken and earned through the duality of force and deception.

Vetus Imperia values Authoritarianism, Militarism, Elitism and Imperialism.
But the mortal enemy of it is Pacifism, Progressivism, Anarchy and Liberalism.
