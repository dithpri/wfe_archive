Vetus Imperia is as much a philosophy as it is a dream. A dream of a world of power and authority.

Vetus Imperia believes that progressive modernisation and liberal ideals are weakening and corrupting the world as a whole, and that the only path to strength is to return to the old ways of military power and autocracy.
It deems to return to the glory days of conquest and political intrigue, where power is taken and earned through the duality of force and deception.

Vetus Imperia values Authoritarianism, Militarism, Ideological Extremes and Elitism.
But the mortal enemy of Vetus Imperia is Pacifism, Progressive Modernism, Extreme Socialism and Liberalism.
