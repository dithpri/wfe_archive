[i][b]Vetus Imperia is as much a philosophy as it is a dream. A dream of a world of power and authority![/b][/i]

Vetus Imperia is the belief that progressive modernisation and liberal ideals are corrupting and weakening the world as a whole, and that the only solution is to return to the old ways of military power and autocracy.
It deems to return to the glory days of imperial conquest and political intrigue, where power is taken and earned through the duality of force and deception.

The region is dedicated to host right-wing conservatives, classical autocracies and military dictatorships.
[u]But the real policy of recruitment is non-alignment, Nations that stand by themselves and do not alter their ways to please anyone.

[i]For the old powers, for the old world![/i]
