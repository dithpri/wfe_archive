[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] would like you all to know that we listen to you, and we are open to your suggestions. This update, the Hawks decided to try out defending! We noticed several regions whose WFE&#39;s were a bit [color=grey]bland and unexciting[/color], so we thought we&#39;d [color=red]liberate[/color] those regions from boringness and [color=orange]spice things up[/color] a little. We didn&#39;t even ban that many natives this time!

Want to [color=pink]defend[/color] the game from growing stale and add a little [color=orange]flavor[/color] to someone&#39;s day? [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Come Join Us.[/url]
