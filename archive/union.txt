hi there!

We&amp;#39;re a small group of Canadian players, most of who had been in and around NS for awhile but dropped it. so... We&amp;#39;re back!

Come join us! we&amp;#39;d love to have a chat about the outsid world, discuss our methods of transports to school and our snow houses in the cold north.
