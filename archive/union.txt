hi there!

We&amp;#39;re a small group of Canadian players, most of who had been in and around NS for awhile but dropped it. so... We&amp;#39;re back! --&amp;gt; mostly anyho

Come join us! we&amp;#39;d love to have a chat about the outside world, discuss our methods of transports to school and our snow houses in the cold north. We are raider aligned, but some of us have old and new ties with defenders. We are as diverse as the north is far from the south, and we really don&amp;#39;t care if your defender, raider, neutral, fangirl, gay, straight, depressed, creeper - okay, maybe we care about that one, but we&amp;#39;re awesome people :D
