The Deep Core was a brightly lit region of the galaxy that lay at its very heart. A densely packed mass of stars, planets, and autistic screeching, the Deep Core was dangerous to navigate and largely left alone by galactic explorers. At its center existed an ancient, super massive black hole called Sheev2184 that bound the galaxy together. This black hole was named after the galactic emperor, Sheev, as he too binds the galaxy together with his unlimited powaa.
