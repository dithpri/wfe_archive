Magna Crecia is a role playing region of nations united for individual freedom, free economics and mutual defense.

Colonized by the Ancient Greek nations in the build-up for the Pelloponesian War (432-404 BC), Magna Grecia distanced herself from the turbulent and, at times, humiliating Greek History, and became a haven for Hellenes who were either hunted or tired from the division that became the curse of the Hellenic Race.
