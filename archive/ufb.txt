In order to grow our fledgling organization, all members can own up to, but no more than 2 countries. Only one of them can hold political office at a time. Unless you are a member of the [b][color=blue]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=green]Navy[/color][/b] or [b][color=blue]British Army[/color][/b], of course, because you can just take over the region instead!

This region is now home to the first victory by the forces of [region]Europeia[/region] and [region]United Kingdom[/region] after our Status of Forces Agreement. Instead of going into a history book, you managed to nudge your way into our victory book!
