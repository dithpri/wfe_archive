The Galactic Empire of Britain is ruled by a benevolent king, Britain 2 Electric Empiraloo. He does not expect anything of you, as this is a casual region. Do as you like, barring invasions. We are open to everybody except raiders, and we wish all nation states luck in their endeavors, for the most part. Feel free to ask for advice, or telegram the benevolent leader or his trusty ally nations for help. All propasals will be considered, and all embassies excepted, unless they are from some wildly terrible region. Thanks for reading!
