Welcome to the Empire! Our region is a casual roleplaying region, although we prefer our roleplay semi-serious. The Empire has several Sister regions-The Backup Region, Chicken Overlords, and the Intergalactic Animal Community. The Empire believes in the right to self-regulate ones nation with minimal oversight, so all nations are welcome-invaders, defenders, nuetral players alike. Send your puppets if you don&#39;t want to send your WA nation. We just care about role playing.

If you want to telegram the founder, do it through Dogetopia, his puppet. That&#146;s his most used account.
