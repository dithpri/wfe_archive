Welcome to the Empire! Our region is a casual roleplaying region, although we prefer our roleplay semi-serious. The Empire is spread across numerous regions-
The Backup Region, Chicken Overlords, and numerous other regions we have diplomats or puppets in. None of these were achieved through invasions, but through diplomacy. The Empire believes in the right to self-regulate ones nation with minimal oversight, so all nations are welcome-invaders, defenders, nuetral players alike. Send your puppets if you don&#39;t want to send your WA nation. We just care about having fun in the RMB!
