trolled!
You&#39;ve been
trolled!
Yes you&#39;ve probably been told
Dont reply
to this guy
He&#39;s just trying to get a rise
out of you!
Yes its true!
You respond 
and thats his cue
To start trouble on the double
While he strokes his madly stubble
You&#39;ve
been
trolled!
You&#39;ve
been
trolled!
You should probably just fold
When the only winning move is not to play
And yet you keep on trying
Mindlessly Replying
You&#39;ve
been
trolled!
You&#39;ve
been
trolled!
Have a nice day!
