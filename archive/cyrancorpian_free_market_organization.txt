The Cyrancorpian Free Market Organization is home to apolitical, capitalist free market, anti-democratic nations. We believe that politics is a cancer at the heart of all nations and believe that under a corporate government, regulated by the market, ensures that there is stability and efficiency in the function of government and to ensure the maximum liberty for all citizens. [i]NO POLITICS, NO PARTIES, NO DEMOCRACY.[/i] We believe in personal liberty for the citizens but the corporate governments have absolute control over the actions of the state. As long as the separation of Citizen &amp; State is not crossed, the government and the people will prosper and live on forever!

[i]BY THE MARKET, FOR THE PEOPLE![/i]
