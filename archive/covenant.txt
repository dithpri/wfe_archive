A united people, the Covenant was founded by King Samuel Alexander IV of the Republic of Aona, under the regional constitution, The Cheshire Compact. In it, the Compact specifies the rights, alliances, and details of the partnership, and in the case of a war, military response. A proud people, the Covenant is a collection of islands in the South-Pacific Ocean, with a sub-tropical climate overall.
