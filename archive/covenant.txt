[b]Fast paced and action packed speed running is what we&#39;re known for, and today the [region]Europeia[/region]n Republican Navy had Mate [nation]Europeiandusre[/nation] take our fleet flying to park our ships amongst the coves of [region]Covenant[/region]. Thank you for facilitating our ships, and if you too would like to join the ERN, we would welcome you with open arms and soaring spirits.
