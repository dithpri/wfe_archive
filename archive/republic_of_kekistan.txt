[color=red][b][u]MODEDIT:[/u] As this is now the third time this region&#39;s WFE has contained rulebreaking material, rather than simply delete the rulebreaking bits out, we&#39;ve chosen to wipe the WFE entirely. 

This is not /pol/. This is not Reddit. This is not 4chan, 8chan, or any of the other chans. This is Nationstates, and users [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=260044]are required to follow the site rules[/url] as a condition of being permitted to participate on this site. If you cannot or will not abide by the site rules, you will ultimately wind up no longer permitted here at all. Your region&#39;s founder already teeters on the brink of having his nation deleted due to rapidly gaining warnings both on the forums and over here gameside. 

I strongly recommend that you [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=260044]review the site rules[/url] before the banhammer becomes necessary.[/b][/color]
