The United Collaborative Alliance of Nations, simply known as Collaborative Nations, is an alliance of independent nations that seek equal and free representation and protection. The nations of this alliance are mainly grouped together for a progressive cause, one that isn&amp;#39;t rigged or corrupted, but purely just the opinion of the members and not any higher powered officials. The nations each have their own independent and equal vote point. The majority of vote points will win only, if there is a tie, then the action will not pass, but be held up until the tie is broken. Administrative powers are only enacted by the popular vote as well.
