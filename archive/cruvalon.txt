After the mini-planet buster was dropped upon Cruvalon Colony (Former grox territory), the Darylians successfully pushed out the Grox from the Cortan star system (shame, it just became the 2,400th star system colonized by the Grox, and the most recent colony as well). With neighboring planets Econia and Laval becoming a colony and military occupation zone respectively). While the war rages on between the Darylian Federation and the Grox Empire, the planet of Tridea has mostly fallen into complete chaos or extinction, depending on the area.
