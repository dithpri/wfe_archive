[nation]7 Deadly Sins[/nation] retains the delegacy.

This region is one that favors the rule of law and general consensus over oligharchy by the delegate and founder. The Regional Council is a legislative body which controls regional administrative affairs and also deals with extra-regional threats. Our region allows nations to run their own affairs, and we allow all types of government to exist within our region; so long as they abide by the rules, don&amp;#39;t impose their ideology upon us, and above all else strive to maintain democracy on a regional level (on a national level dictatorships are fine).
