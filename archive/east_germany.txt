[b]East Germany[/b], formally the German Democratic Republic, was a socialist state in central-western Europe, during the Cold War period. From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War II&#151;the Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the Oder&#150;Neisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party, though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. &#151;Wikipedia [hr]
