Planetary Zone Ceres corresponds to a spherical space defined by the average Hill Sphere of the planet Ceres, between Mars and Jupiter. The colonization of the body resulted in its reclassification as a full planet and designation with a Planetary Zone. In 2090 a revolution brought about the overthrow of the regime established by the Ceres Salt Extraction Project, establishing a feminist state. The Planetary Zone now serves as the border of the Matriarchy, defended and maintained by the Ceresian Outer Space Fleet.
