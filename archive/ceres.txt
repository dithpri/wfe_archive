Ceres (minor-planet designation: 1 Ceres) is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Sol system. Its diameter is approximately 945 kilometers. The 33rd-largest known body in the Sol System, Ceres is composed of rock and ice and is estimated to account for approximately one third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt in which it resides. Ceres is also the only object in the asteroid belt known to be rounded by its own gravity. It is currently home to [nation]Taranys[/nation], a scientifically advanced culture that has built a series of torus shaped city modules on a single axis within the dwarf planet&#39;s crust.
