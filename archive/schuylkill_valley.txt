[b]Welcome to the Valley[/b]

[i]What&#39;s it like to be an atheist? 
Are you okay with suicide?
Well, it&#39;s baffling that my ears can bleed
When I see your domestic thighs
Yes, the future is kush and bubblegum
But I prefer wood to linoleum
My destiny is calling me, it says
You&#39;ll be fine if you take some Tums[/i]
