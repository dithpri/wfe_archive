Inceptum is home to nations from a large array of ethnic, ideological backgrounds, and governments. Forged in fire and tempered by ice. The ongoing warfare, and diplomatic strife within will forever continue to dominate its vast continents and islands.

Anyone is welcome to join and roleplay with us; however, main nations are strongly encouraged.
