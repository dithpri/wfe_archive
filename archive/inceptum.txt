Forged from the bravest souls tempered in the flames of eternal war.  We are gifted in strength, with variance. We cannot be broken by weapon or threat. We grow closer through our differences and conflicting aspirations, ideals, and methods. With political strife, warfare, and religious theocracies at the heart of the region there&amp;#39;s no such thing as a simple day within Inceptum&amp;#39;s borders. Making Inceptum forever stronger as it faces the tests of time.
