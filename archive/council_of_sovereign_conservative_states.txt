In a time of great turmoil -political, societal, and economy- one group saw its time to rise: The forgotten masses, those not only left  behind by the Left and Center but actively demonized, the people whose righteous voices should be heard but are silenced. So, these people decided enough was enough and rose up as not only their forefathers did but theirs before them, instituting strong, nationalist and conservative governments of the people. Many of these nations, seeing the threats from both the Left AND the Center , banded together and formed the Council of Sovereign Conservative States or the CS3 for short. This is their triumph: For Faith, State, and Folk.
