One nation per state can join, and Puerto Rico, but if you are a Canadian province or a large Caribbean country such as Cuba, exceptions can be made. This coalition will be Roleplay, and I forgot to mention, but you will be allowed to do your own thing, all government types are allowed, from anarchies and communists to fascists and dictatorships, no Nazis or Confederates though, for obvious reasons. If anyone wants to ask, yes I am from Maryland, although technically born in Virginia. We can have monthly elections for nation in command and secondary commander, except I retain my power, I am founder, but I will not abuse it. Send me a telegram if you&#39;re interested. We will find out some stuff along the way.
