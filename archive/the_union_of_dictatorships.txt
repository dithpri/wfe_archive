Welcome, Dictators far and wide, to this haven of oppression, bribery, election fixing and maybe a bit of genocide (if you&#39;re into that stuff).

More offshore havens than Switzerland (All to save for retirement, legally gained from your salary, of course) and better tools for oppressing those whining masses, always demanding luxuries such as food, shelter and jobs.

The Union is Ruled by the Democratically elected Generalissimo Tapioca, and &#39;elections&#39; are held every month, to see who is not loy- I mean, to choose a new leader!
