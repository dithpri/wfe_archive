[color=darkolivegreen]Welcome to [/color][b][color=olive]FARWOOD[/color][/b][color=darkolivegreen].

Farwood is a hidden kingdom deep within a mystical forest. Here, we live in harmony with one another. We had little contact with the outside world... until now.

We offer our residents a tight-knit community with a rich culture and deep lore. What adventures await you here?[/color]
