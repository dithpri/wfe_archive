We are a Capitalist region.
Socialist peasants will be shot on sight.

The first ever socialist was poggy the entitled caveman. He always used to pass around when others were out hunting. When they came back, he would be the first to eat. He soon gathered up a band of such lazies.

My friends, don&#39;t be like them. Socialism is a curse.
Nobody my friends is entitled to even a penny of your tax money.

And if you think Socialism is good, then ask the Cubans making improvised rafts to escape or the Venezualens silently crying in their homes.
