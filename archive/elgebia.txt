Inspired by the pronunciation of the beginning of LGBT, Elgebia is an extremely inclusive community. We shall accept you for who you are, as a person, and as a nation.
A small region founded by a small nation, we will never underestimate the power of a small nation.
In a smaller region, you will have a greater chance of representing the region, and a greater chance of showing your beliefs in this world.
Elgebia is an inclusive, kind region. While we may not value economic gain or military gain as much as other regions, we value the opinions and necessities of our citizens, and the environment of our nations.
