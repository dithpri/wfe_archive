Telegram [nation]Porterno[/nation] if you would like to run for a role in office; you can either run for the Roleplay Council or the role of Prime Minister. Elections will begin as soon as the new RP tech level poll is finished, so you have until that finishes to get your candidacy requests into me for roleplay council and +2 days for Prime Minister.
