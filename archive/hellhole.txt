[color=red][b]Hi, we&#39;re the People&#39;s Revolutionary Air Force. Your region now belongs to us. Get out of the frontiers, now.[/b][/color]
[b][i]Your beliefs are reprehensible, your ideas intolerable. This region, and all others like it, will be destroyed. Learn this lesson, or be taught it by force: [u]bigots don&#39;t get frontiers[/u].[/i][/b][hr]This fascist frontier once hosted hundreds of nations. It does no longer; it is an impermeable territory of [b][region]the Communist Bloc[/region][/b] and its People&#39;s Revolutionary Air Force. The garrison in [nation]Fort Makhno[/nation] maintains the perimeter proudly, knowing that yet another fascist frontier has been annihilated.
