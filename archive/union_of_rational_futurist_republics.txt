After the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) the revolutionaries of the newly independent Fioletovyyrus quickly sought to preserve what they perceived as worthy goals of their former alliance, while improving on its deficiencies. The result was an unprecedented devotion to science and facts and strong belief in the human ability to overcome all obstacles. Born from this was the Union of Rational Futurist Republics (URFR) / &amp;#1057;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1102;&amp;#1079; &amp;#1056;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1094;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1100;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1099;&amp;#1093; &amp;#1060;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1095;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1082;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1093; &amp;#1056;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1087;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1073;&amp;#1083;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1082; (&amp;#1057;&amp;#1056;&amp;#1060;&amp;#1056;) / Soyuz Ratsional&#39;nykh Futuristicheskikh Respublik (SRFR), open to all who seek scientific advancement in order to reduce suffering and improve living conditions for all sentient life, whether sapient or not.
