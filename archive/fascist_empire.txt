[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[color=red]To cure this region of its ills, on the 25th May, 2012, [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] seized and confiscated this fascist hellhole, previously the domain of [nation]Hungramy[/nation] in the name of Anti-Fascism. 

Participants in this daring and brilliantly executed assault on a region [i]with an active founder[/i] were:
- Comrade Field Marshal [nation=short]Fynnbays[/nation]
- Comrade Field Marshal [nation=short]of the free socialist territories[/nation][/color]

[color=blue]Protected in memory of the [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] concept, whilst also highlighting the failure of then Nazi [nation]Captain Woodhouse[/nation]. His attempt to infiltrate the [region]Antifa[/region] network failed and over 50 regions were handed over to [region]The MT Army[/region].[/color]
