Hello! We are the new region &quot;Anime World&quot;, and we are looking for members! Feel free to ask any questions and talk in RMB, but we do have rules.
1. No over swearing. A few swear words are fine, a wall of them isn&#39;t.
2. No spamming.
3. No bullying.
We are democratic, and elections are held once a month on the 17th, at 12:00 PM UTC.
