[b]Welcome to New Jerusalem - a region for no one.[/b]

The old order of regions has long ended. In its place, innumerable Frontiers and Strongholds have emerged.

[nation]Grishahakkaverchynot[/nation] has taken the lands. To him who is unendorsed (and really everyone but the founder puppet), leave because this region is a closed land of the Keepermaster.

On every day will its gates be shut, for there will be a password there.

No longer will there be any curse. The throne of the Delegate will be in the city, and its inhabitants will choose him, but there will never be any inhabitants.

These words are trustworthy and true: This land was captured.
