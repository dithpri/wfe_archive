[b]Welcome to New Jerusalem - a region for no one.[/b]

The old order of regions has long ended. In its place, innumerable Frontiers and Strongholds have emerged.

[nation]Grishahakkaverchynot[/nation] has taken the lands. To him who is unendorsed (and really everyone but the holder puppet), leave because this region is a closed land of the Keepermaster.

On no day will its gates be open, for there will be a password there.

No longer will there be any curse. The throne of the Delegate will be in the city, and its inhabitants will choose him, but there will never be any inhabitants or Delegate.

These words are trustworthy and true: This land was captured.
