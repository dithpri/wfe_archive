[b]Welcome to New Jerusalem - a region for sensible people.[/b]

The old order of regions has long ended. In its place, innumerable Frontiers and Strongholds have emerged. But one holy city persists.

[nation]Tinhampton[/nation] is making everything new. To him who is unendorsed, she will permit endorsement without limit from the spring of the World Assembly population.

On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no password there. The glory and honour of the nations will be brought into it.

No longer will there be any curse. The throne of the Delegate will be in the city, and its inhabitants will choose him.

These words are trustworthy and true: Tinhampton is only showing you the things that must soon take place. Everything else is your call.
