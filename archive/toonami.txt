Welcome to Toonami.

This region was captured by Repreteop and was kept due to [region]Free Japan[/region]s dislike of those actions, which in turn got him banned from a region for which was friendly before.

Although [region]Mac Tonight[/region] is very dormant, Toonami is a essential part of Carolinas history and until these demands are fulfilled:

1. The unban of Repreteop

2. The reopening of embassies with Carolina

3. Friendliness is shown

Toonami will belong to Carolina.
