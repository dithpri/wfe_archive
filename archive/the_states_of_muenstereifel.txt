Greetings, comrades of all kinds!

We are the Coalition of all States in BAM (Bad Muenstereifel). We have many different state forms in our Coalition, but our main form of government is mostly determined by our current Delegate. As such, we especially welcome socialist states and states form originating from the left spectrum, but everyone is free to join our alliance, as long as they are able to show loyalty to their brothers and sisters.

Glory and Equality to Muenstereifel!
