Serrovia is a nice small region, that isn&#39;t big, but still is a nice place to be a country in. It is led by Serrovington, a nice little country that likes growth. In this region, the leaders encourage growth, and that is good if you want to just play the game and grow.

Serrovia is a place that is very nice, so you should join it.
