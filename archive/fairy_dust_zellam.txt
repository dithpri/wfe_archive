Zellam is but one of many continental groups scattered across a colossal world dominated by the vast and mighty Old Empires. While once monumental, the Old Empires have wilted in the wake of an immense conflict, leaving the burgeoning nations of the Zellam Isthmus to arise from the ashes of the old world to meet a vast new one of dangers and alliances. Invent new war crimes, roll out a Landkreuzer but worse as a functional military asset, suffer the wrath of Fae Guerilla asymmetric warfare and more!
