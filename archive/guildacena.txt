Welcome to Guildacena, a semi-functional diplomatic experiment disguised as a NationStates region, founded by a group of friends who decided the best way to preserve international peace was to give themselves godlike powers and immediately begin squabbling over fictional borders. Originally created for &quot;fun,&quot; Guildacena has since devolved into a chaotic blend of absurd worldbuilding, overpowered lore, suspiciously advanced empires, and at least one nation that may or may not be powered entirely by spite and frogs.
