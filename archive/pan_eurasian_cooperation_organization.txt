The Pan-Eurasian Co&ouml;peration Organization (PECO) is an alliance initiated by the Federal Republic of Liechtenstein &amp; Saint Gallen to bring together nations from across the Eurasian landmass on a humanitarian and military level. 
Mutual defence and foreign aid are not compulsory, however they are encouraged and are what the PECO is founded on.
