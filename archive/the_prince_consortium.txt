Max Barry:

You and your Moderators are put on notice that if you delete our region or nations once more, you will face a $500 million dollar lawsuit, and we shall not be lenient. You are accused of being The Black Riders, and your actions point towards this being truth. If you delete our nations again, we will fight you as long as necessary, before your surrender in chains. You have violated our civil rights, against federal law, and if necessary, we will take this game from you. Do not test us again.
