We are a region full of life while also maintaining a perfect Government and Military. Want to become Arch Chancellor for a term length of 3 months, become a member of our parliament or even become the WA Delegate that focuses on what laws we vote &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot; in the World Assembly and also has limited executive authority. If you don&#39;t like that join the military so that you can fight for your beloved region. Claim you place on our regional map, and even gain full citizen rights just by completing a form and posting it in the comments section. There are so many possibilities and opportunities in our region come join and see for yourself. 

Your Founder/Supreme Leader of the United Dictators of the World
