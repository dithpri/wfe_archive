Founded by a small exploratory team of Space-going Peasants, roughly 41 cubic acres of outer space located slightly to the left of Mars is now owned by some guy named Jeb. Jeb is a pretty cool guy, and he let us settle a couple countries here as long as we don&#39;t get too rowdy. So lets all just crack open a few drinks, play some space volleyball and just have a good time.
