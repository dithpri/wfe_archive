The Crimson Dawn is a region that admires justice, safety, and freedom, and is a place where nations of all kinds are welcome.

The Crimson Dawn was a great region, but now it is all but gone.  Raiders, mergers, and griefers have all taken their toll on this region, but we still live.  And as long as we live, we stand for the above values.  We may be few, but we will not give in.

One day, the Crimson Dawn will shine anew!
