The Derpy Dominion (Region) is a union of pony nations who support Derpy Hooves in her quest to bring peace to the ponies and non-ponies of Equestria and death to the two sisters, Princess Luna of the New Lunar Republic and Princess Celestia of the Solar Empire, that continue to wage war on each other, over a sibling rivalry that has cost millions of innocent pony and non-pony lives.
