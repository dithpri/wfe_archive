The United League is a superior sovereign organization composed of international powers - the League&amp;#39;s decisions and actions are based on the majority opinions of the heads of governments. The League was founded by The United Kingdom of Genivia (ruled by the dominant Conservative Party) and its cabinet government, led by Genivian Prime Minister Nigel Chen, and wishes to ally with other diplomatic regions to repel unjust aggressors and aid nations. Seeing rising crises and conflicts almost always leading to war, its strongly anti-violence beliefs encourage the key aims of enforcing diplomatic resolutions to all incidents. The League may be approached by both member &amp;amp; non-member nations in need of ANY form of help: military or otherwise.
