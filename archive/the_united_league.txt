The United League is a sovereign organization composed of international powers - the League&amp;#39;s decisions and actions are based on the majority opinions of the heads of governments. The League was founded by (the then United Kingdom of) Genivia (now the Free United States), led by the Liberal Party of Her Majesty&amp;#39;s Government, ruled by Her Majesty Queen Amelia, and wishes to ally with other diplomatic regions to repel unjust aggressors and aid nations. Seeing rising crises and conflicts almost always leading to war, its strongly anti-violence beliefs encourage the key aims of enforcing diplomatic resolutions to all incidents. The League may be approached by both member &amp;amp; non-member nations in need of any form of support.
