The United League is a superior sovereign organization composed of international powers (The League&amp;#39;s decisions &amp;amp; actions are based on the majority opinions of the heads of governments), founded by The United Kingdom of Genivia (ruled by the dominant Conservative Party) &amp;amp; its Cabinet Government, led by Genivian Prime Minister Nigel Chen and wishes to ally with other Diplomatic regions to repel unjust aggressors &amp;amp; aid nations. Seeing rising crisis &amp;amp; conflicts almost always leading to war, its strongly anti-violence beliefs cause key aims to enforce Diplomatic resolutions to all incidents. The League may be approached by both Member &amp;amp; Non-Member Nations in requirement of ANY form of help: military aid, authoritary aid etcetera.
