Welcome All!!

This is a region, based on [color=blue]Post-Modern Tech[/color], with a unique history I&amp;#39;m hoping you will help me make. I want only [color=red]serious roleplayers[/color], and people that are as [color=red]in-depth[/color] and as interested in [color=red]collaberative story-telling[/color] as we are. The region is [color=red]password blocked[/color] for right now, so just talk to me and I&amp;#39;ll give you the password if I think you&amp;#39;re wanting the same things I do.
