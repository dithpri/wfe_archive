The Land of Yellow Snow is a vast landscape with wonderful biodiversity. Its main geographic regions are the Penis Mountains of Gandor and the mighty Yellow River located in Daily County (named after famed Plentiful Fiberian poet I.P. Daily). Due to high sulfur contents in the river, it gains its famed yellow color and infamous smell that makes the surrounding region virtually inhabitable but has stimulated the economy by allowing ridiculously cheap housing constructs near the river allowing the regions poorer citizens to provide a reasonable life for their families.
