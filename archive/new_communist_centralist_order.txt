I am tired of seeing leftist extremists and far right extremists thinking they are superior above all! they have forgotten that the proletariat is the main key to a successful and healthy world! shame on these people who are two faced to the true mission! a united socialist key principle used to unite the poor, and the rich, and the other social classes together to create a communist aligned centralist utopia! 

it is time people to and to rule once again for the greater good of the Nationstates!
we shall shape our own path! the red army dawns yet again!

[i]WE WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO WA TYRANNY! WE WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO EXTREMISTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM![/i]
