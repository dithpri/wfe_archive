The most advanced and powerful beings in the galaxy left behind their structures, their worlds, and their secrets so no one can exploit their existence. Colonization on Forerunner worlds and Installations will have to be done by military personnel in setting up fortresses, bunkers, space stations, and other military assets in order to establish transit routes for civilian transport ships to land. Prometheans are the main threat, so the UNSC is unavailable until both economic and military strength are achieved.
