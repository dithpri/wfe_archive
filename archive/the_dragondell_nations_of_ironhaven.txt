Following his election to power, Hawaiiwong, leader of Wong-Dom, has a few goals for the region.

1. To promote cooperation of regional members.

2. Promote interregional cooperation.

3. Prevent seizes of power through fraudulent means.

4. Encourage all regional members to have fun during their time on NationStates.

In order to assist with these goals, I request that you all, as leaders of your nations, consider endorsing Wong-dom for delegate. It is to assist in preventing invasion by foreign threats. Thank you.
