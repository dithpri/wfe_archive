
I&#39;m a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin&#39; to reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Every burden, every disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don&#39;t have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it&#39;s getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R we are meant to be
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps crappin on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain&#39;t ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century,
ENTER ME!
