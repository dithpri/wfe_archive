For a long time [color=#FF8000]Stacramon[/color] was considered a [i]pure democracy[/i]. However, Stacramon has now been reclassified to a [b]Democratic Empire[/b]. The reason for this is because Stacramon now is in possession of three large nations, which are now classified as colonies of Stacramon. Those nations are:

[list][nation]Brezlesheek[/nation]
[nation]Libernita[/nation]
[nation]Balianica[/nation][/list]

If you want to join the Stacramite Empire you can! You don&#39;t have to be a colony if you don&#39;t want to, but you can be! If you&#39;re a colony of the Stacramite Empire, you&#39;ll still govern yourself but you&#39;re nation&#39;s classification, flag, motto, and leader name would change. If you just wanted to join our empire as a fellow nation, we&#39;re fine with that also!
