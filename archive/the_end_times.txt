[b]Description of Region[/b]: 

[i]The year is 1985. Hell broke out long ago in the form of Nuclear War, reducing everything Mankind had built to Rumble in hours. Now with Radiation Levels low enough, Bunkers reopen and Civilization begins anew. However with the Moral Compass that had been guided by the Good People of the World reset and murder now the new normal, will Civilization survive in the Wastes or crumble under the Pressure of the End Times?[/i] 


That is up to you to decide in this Roleplay based Region that will focus on how Nations would Interact with each other years after Nukes wiped America clean off the map. This Region is based in the early 1980&#39;s with slightly altered Technology and Mutated Creatures roaming the former Streets of America.
