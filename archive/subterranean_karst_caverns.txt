Located beneath the Antarctic, a continent long-thought uninhabited, civilisations have fluorished in a tropical climate maintained by geothermal energy. Bioluminescent slimes first cultivated thousands of years ago have been selectively bred to produce sources of light said to be comparable to a really good torch. These subterranean peoples, finding their homeland growing increasingly exposed to the outside have made it their aim to end the rising levels of atmospheric pollution. They are widely known as &amp;quot;max-chillers&amp;quot;, but have been known to cough loudly at outsiders arriving on fossil-fuelled powered craft as a form of disapproval.
