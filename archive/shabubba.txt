We were attacked, but quick thinking by the founder [nation]Sunniesville[/nation], defeated The Black Riders!

[region]Shabubba[/region] was a small place for friends to take refuge from the zombie apocalypse.  We are now aiming to become a strong region, but to do this WE NEED MORE NATIONS!!!  Yes, we know it is locked. This is to prevent any future invasions.  Please send  [nation]Sunniesville[/nation] a telegram to check your movement history and let you know the passcode.  

[region]Shabubba[/region] wants YOU to join us!
