Capitalist haven where the rich get richer and the poor..well who cares. A democratic state where the corporations are the new aristocracy of society and the only way to get to the top is to lie, cheat and steal. These democratic states are a tax haven to those with bundles of cash and we feel you shouldn&amp;#39;t spend your hard earned cash on some bum unwilling to work.
