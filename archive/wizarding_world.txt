Welcome all, to the Wizarding World!

Our region is divided into two different roleplays, the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts proper. 

In the Ministry of Magic, you get to play as your nation, whereas in Hogwarts you get to play as a character.

Both require you to join one of the four houses, in the MoM, this will be your political party, in Hogwarts it will be the same as in the books.
