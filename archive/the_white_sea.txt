This region was created by [region]White Pride World Wide[/region] as one of its many &amp;quot;colonies.&amp;quot; It has been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b].

The area had mostly been de-militarized and coastal residents relocated when FJA intel picked up signs that fascists were planning to retake the area, so a small but powerful force led by [nation=short]White Sea Battleship[/nation] remained here. With the apparent death of WPWW&amp;#39;s successor organization, [region]The Realm[/region], the evacuation will continue. 

&amp;quot;The White Sea is a southern inlet of the Barents Sea located on the northwest coast of Russia. It is surrounded by Karelia to the west, the Kola Peninsula to the north, and the Kanin Peninsula to the northeast.&amp;quot; - Wikipedia
