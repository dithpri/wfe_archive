By bringing nations under one law, one language, and the enlightened guidance of one federation, the corruption that plagued the countries in its later years will never take root. Regional governors will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed the terrorist movement to grow unchecked. A strong and growing military will ensure the rule of law.

We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but the people of the Federation are ready for the challenge. Because of our efforts, the world has traded war for peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings now look forward to a secure future. The Federation of United Nations will grow as more states feel the call.
