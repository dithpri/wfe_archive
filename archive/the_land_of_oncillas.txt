Named after a small feline similar to the ocelot, the land of Oncillas has an ancient and rich history, of betrayal and war and&#151; okay, yes, I&#146;m being dramatic. Let&#146;s see you come up with a good world factbook entry for a region where the other country ceased to exist! I mean, come on! It&#146;s not as easy as it looks! Come on, I&#146;m the ONLY person here!
Anyway, we are a friendly region, and will accept many quirks and oddities that may get you expelled from more stiff regions. At least, provided you can get the password right&#133;
