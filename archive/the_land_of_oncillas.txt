We&#146;re mostly friendly, mostly accepting, and will absolutely wig out whenever somebody new enters the region. Just to set some ground rules:
No coups.
On polls, only vote with one of your nations. No double votes.
Be nice&#151; no mean or racist comments.
If you&#146;re going to do something ridiculous, please clear it with the governor first, unless it&#146;s not dangerous, destructive, or disrespectful.
Yes, we have like fifteen alts.
No, we will not hesitate to ensue in pranking.
Have fun.

Also, I have decided on a system: you get one warning for bad behavior, where you are ejected from the region but not banned. Further offenses WILL result in a ban.
