The Ormiston Vanguard Pact was established in 2012 to encourage and regulate trade between all member states. Currency manipulation is monitored so that no country or business monopolises an industry, causing recessions. Joint projects are not uncommon but likewise input and funding is not mandatory. Notably they include the OVP space program, OVP medical exploration program, and the OVP charity fund.
