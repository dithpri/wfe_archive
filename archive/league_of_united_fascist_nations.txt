The League of United Fascist Nations commonly called The LUFN, is a Fascist/National Socialist Region on NationStates. Its purpose is to provide a region for those who are persecuted for sharing their fascist beliefs who are often misunderstood as nothing more then white supremacist prejudiced bigots. The purpose of this faction is also to educate the world about the true ideals of fascism, that is not simply a union of Jew hating racists, but that it is a political organization that supports strong leadership, national pride, and a belief that a nation is judged by its citizens actions, not by their words.
