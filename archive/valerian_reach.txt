Welcome to Valerian Reach, a quixotic attempt to contain the V-nation chaos! Bewildered by the multitude of nations starting with the letter V, [nation=noflag]Rotenaplistan[/nation] created this region to hoard V-titled puppet nations - and, in a futile bid to stem the V-nation tide, reserve every conceivable V-name to prevent others from adding to his confusion. Beneath its rolling hills, lush forests, and ancient cities, Valerian Reach boasts complex trade routes, modern advancements, and a healthy dose of V-nation intrigue, all safely quarantined from the rest of NationStates (or so he pretends).
