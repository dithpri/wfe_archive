[b][color=#EE0AFF]The [region]blanket fort legion[/region] decided to roll out of their sleeping bags tonight and test out microwaving bubble-gum and marshmallows... Would they pop, or would they melt? 

We ended up causing minor electrical issues and falling through a slew of regions, but found ourselves back at the Fort, mostly unharmed, and happier and fuller than before.
