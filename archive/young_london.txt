[b]My fellow nations,

I regret to inform you that I no longer have time for this region.  

I have been in contact with a fast growing region, must like ours, that shares a very similar government to our own, [region]The Royal Alliance[/region] I actually based our government off of theirs, as I was once a member of that region.  

[region]The Royal Alliance[/region] has been kind enough to extend its arms out to us, and allow us to  move there.  [nation]Buddyland[/nation] and [nation]Lazzarania[/nation] do a wonderful job running their region, and are fair to all nations.  I ask that you all consider moving to [region]The Royal Alliance[/region].  It will be a great opportunity for all of you.  

[nation]Buddyland[/nation] will be contacting you with more information.[/b]
