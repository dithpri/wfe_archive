The Islas de Jaina are an archipelago comprised of a dozen individual islands, mostly uninhabited.
The few that are populated contain indigenous people who all those from the &amp;quot;Holy Empire of the Jaguar Sun&amp;quot; are descended. 

The main island of the Islas, which is also the largest, is inaccessible except by a few docks and two airports. Fairly isolated from the rest of the world, the Islas are content with living a life of peace and almost total freedom (unless they&amp;#39;re in the private sector).
