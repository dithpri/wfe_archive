The People of New Kekistan have long searched for a homeland. Now that we have finally found it, we wish to extend the arm of friendship unto other nations. We care not your political system, or the state of you country. We only ask that you be dank, and reject the normies of your world. We are here to provide peace to the world, whether it be compulsory or forced. Join us and become part of our Alliance for the general good of human kind. Except Normies.
