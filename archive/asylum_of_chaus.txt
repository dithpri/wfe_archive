Hello (insert your name here) and welcome to [region]Asylum of Chaus[/region]. 

We are a refuge for all those who seek it. We&amp;#39;re a little crazy, but this is the internet right? The Asylum, as the locals call it, is a safe and relatively secure place to stay, raise a family, grow your population, or just thumb your nose at the people from your last region. Because we have an active founder it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible for us to be occupied or any other form of grieve. All are welcome here, as long as you play by our rules. Im sure that we&amp;#39;ll have you here for a long and productive stay.

I&amp;#39;m sure that we can work together to form many purposeless and sumwhat erratic laws. 

Till the end of the age, your founder [nation=short]Rabiosum[/nation]
