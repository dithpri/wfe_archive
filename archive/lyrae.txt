[b][color=#72659b]Welcome to Lyrae![/color][/b]
[color=#a99cce]We are a region of democracy, freedom, safety, and equality. We are an Atheistic Nation, as dieties are citizens as well, and aren&#39;t better than you or more deserving of worship, they are a species. We have very rich lore which I am still writing much of, and we hope you enjoy roleplaying, because we do too! The leader is a writer &amp; artist, so creativity is very strongly encouraged. We are peaceful, but are ready for war. But I do not suggest a non-magical region wages it against us, it would not be wise as magic deals with the forces of nature. For now, let&#39;s make sure nobody builds a death star.[/color]
