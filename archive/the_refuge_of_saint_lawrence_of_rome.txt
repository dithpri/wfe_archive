Welcome to The Refuge of Saint Lawrence of Rome. We are a place for all who need somewhere to stay while changing regions, a place for people who need emotional support, a place for people who need help getting started in NationStates, a place for people who need motivation, and a place for people to spread messages of love.

We are all-inclusive, our refuge welcomes all who wish to join regardless of religion, political views, sexual orientation, etc. This is a safe space for all.
