Reconquered by The Empire of Vulaxinora in the name of The Grand Alliance of Democratic Nations. Terran imperial Provinces first invaded The Grand Union of Democratic States, the region that Proreadem, Vulaxinora, and Adamantiland were setting up. After being pushed backed to The Grand Alliance, the Allies then decided to play the long con and wait until the region died. Even after Vulaxinora refounded the Union, the Allies decided to say in the Grand Alliance. The Grand Union is used today as puppet storage and as a backup region.
