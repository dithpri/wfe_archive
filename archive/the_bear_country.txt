[b][colour=black]Making The Bear Country Grrr Again[/colour][/B]

[color=714833]The Bear Country will once again be NationStates&#39; premier bear-centric region for all things bear, bear-related, &amp; beyond! The Bear Country celebrates the natural environment and all wildlife.   We value compassion and inclusiveness.  All who share similar values are invited to visit or settle.

Bears of every kind are all over the place, but you truly don&#39;t have to be a bear-lover to belong here. Just be respectful, and we won&#39;t bite ([i]much[/i])![/color]
