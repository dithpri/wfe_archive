This region used to be a sexist region until TAFA and [region]Raxulan Empire[/region] raided this region thanks to the tip off of [nation]Rxcn[/nation]. I waited a long time for this region to be refounded to make sure everyone forgets we raided this place and to prevent people from taking this region (Example: [region]United States of Femdom[/region])[/b]
