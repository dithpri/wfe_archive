The Radfem alliance is an exceptionally friendly and welcoming place.  We welcome everyone..... apart from men, no men.  

Also, we&#39;re not down with:
Racists
Furries &amp;Anime fans
People who vote conservative/republican
Pornsick weirdos
Pickmeishas, 
People who post videos on Tiktok
Anyone using catface filters on their social
Anti vaxers &amp; Flat Earthers
Folks that don&#39;t wear masks in Coronavirus areas
People who unironically use the words &quot;stan&quot;, &quot;mood&quot; &quot;cancelled&quot;, &quot;validate&quot; or &quot;problematic&quot;

Apart from being unwelcoming to 99% of the internet&#39;s population, we are friendly (ish). Actually it&#39;s probably better if you don&#39;t join. I doubt you&#39;ll fit in.
