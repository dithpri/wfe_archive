A region of rips in space/time (aka portals) leading to various lands.  Some of serene prosperity ruled by just queens, others of pure turmoil lead by psychotic dictators, and even oppressed yet happy nations ruled by corrupt socialists.
All in all, [region]The Seras Multiverse[/region] is bound together by a single thread of time, which connects the worlds of the Multiverse and it&amp;#39;s select council of unique individuals; of different races and styles of ruling their worlds.
