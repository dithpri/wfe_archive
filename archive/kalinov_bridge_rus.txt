 The vast unexplored world located behind the gateway island was named Kalinov Bridge by the first settlers and explorers. This region is located in the middle of a stormy sea, and to cross it, you need the help of experienced guides from among the first settlers. However, it is worth considering that these people are not always ready for contact if you do not speak their native language, Russian.
