[b][color=#FF0000]Welcome to the Turkish Security Zone[/color], a region dedicated to restabilizing the Middle East and giving it a good healthy dose of Turkish culture. Since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish people and other ethnicities in the region have suffered just tremendously from wars, foreign occupation and a loss of stability. The Turkish Security Zone seeks to change this and is constantly growing, occupying nations so order may be brought to them. We wish to make clear that wow this region is predominately Turkish, people of various ethnicities are welcomed to make this region home and to do business with the great Turkish people. So don&#39;t wait! Move your nation to the Turkish Protection Zone today![/b]
