The Hell of Blazing Fires&amp;#39;, or more accurately, the Remains of the Blazing Hell is located below the Palace of the Earth Spirits. Formerly a part of the underground Hell where criminals were banished, it has recently been re-ignited by Okuu and is now being utilized as part of their Anarchist Revolution project.
