There is a mentally disturbed ex-lawyer in Los Angeles who retreats to an imaginary world when life gets too hard, which is represented as a basement that does not exist. He can create many things here, it is essentially a universe in itself. This region is the collective of just a small part of that basement. 

Ryan&amp;#39;s basement is a very lax nation. If you want a region where you can play however you want, by all means, join us. There isn&amp;#39;t really any leadership around here, so if you want to raid or something, feel free to organize it yourself. If you become the WA Delegate, feel free to change anything and everything except for the region description above- this will signify Ryan&amp;#39;s suicideand the end of an era. Welcome to Ryan&amp;#39;s Basement!
