Located in the hot, grassy savanna of the southernmost regions of Afrika, the union consists of colonies and dominions (either of these titles are MANDATORY in your nation&#39;s name) united under the British Crown and the colonial rule of Great Britain as the South Afrika Colony. In real life, the Colony is based off the countries of South Africa, Namibia (not NAMBIA you trumps), Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique. If you join this region, you MUST pledge your loyalty to the bearer of the British crown, Queen Elizabeth II, and her successors.
