After the initial colonization of Antarctica in 2120 AD by New Russia, this continent has experienced numerous revolutions and decentralization. Antarctica today is known as the final refuge for democracy and capitalism. As the rest of the world has descended into authoritarian governments with bloated and inefficient consumer economies, Antarctica&amp;#39;s unique climate and environment has required practical governments to emerge, focused on survival and collaboration for resources. Although rogue nations sometimes arise, they are quickly eliminated as a result of their isolationism.

Antarcticans always repeat a proverb which defines the politics of the region: &amp;quot;You never really know your friends from your enemies until the ice breaks.&amp;quot;
