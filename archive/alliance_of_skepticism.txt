&#147;Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing?
Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing?
Then why call him God?&#148;
-Epicurus

&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&amp;#39;&amp;#39;
-Karl Marx

&amp;#39;&amp;#39;After coming into contact with a religious man I always feel I must wash my hands&amp;#39;&amp;#39;
-Friedrich Nietzsche
