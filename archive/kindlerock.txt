[color=purple]A northern and barren part of the world. Kindlerock is home to erratic nations with equally erratic regimes. Notably home to [nation]Dark Kajembi[/nation] and [nation]Hitmonlee[/nation]. International relations are limited and morale is mixed. Heaven for the rich and intuitive.[/color]
