Welcome to Atlas Minor, the remnants of a fallen continent. In this world, chaos and uncertainty thrive as new states emerge, and greater powers arise. 

Atlas Minor is an open-world role-playing center, where the history is written by you. You choose how your state evolves, without the interference of a comical hyperpower telling you what to do. Bask in the freedom!

There will be some set rules, and regional government positions; nonetheless there is an expansive universe to your liking, to do as you please with it.
