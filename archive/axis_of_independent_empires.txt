[b][color=red] Dear the region calling itself &amp;#39;[region]The Greater German Reich[/region]&amp;#39;, 

[u]The Red Fleet[/u] as a participatory member of [region]Antifa[/region], notes your desperate attempts to somehow deny the reality of the evident fact of the successes of the Comrades of Antifascism and it&amp;#39;s string of crushing victories over Nazis and Fascists by briefly founding [region]The Communist International[/region] and then founding [region]The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics[/region] and claim them as victories because you are unable to conquer [region]Communist International[/region] and [region]Union of Soviet Socialist Republics[/region]. 
Further as you are unable to fight your own battles you instead now cower behind those who are willing to [u]defend[/u] the indefensible: Fascism.[/color][/b]
