The League of Right-Wing Nations (TLoRWN) is an association of nations similar to that of the United Nations, only instead it is for Right Wing nations that want to be independent of such regions and associations such as the Greater German Reich, yet still want to be in a consolidated group with other like-minded groups.

The country&amp;#39;s location does not matter, only that your nation is indeed Right-Winged.
