[b]~ Tactical Nuclear Penguin ~[/b]
[i]Bow down or fall down[/i]

We merry band of little penguins look soft. But beneath our soft, squishy and cute exterior lies a terrible tempest of annihilation awaiting release upon the world. We look to ensure our friends and allies are taken care of and those who oppose us get crushed beneath our short stumpy flippers. We do not seed territorial squabbles with other schools of penguins and we welcome all who wish to befriend the mighty penguins.
