[color=darkblue]We merry band of little penguins look soft but beneath our soft, squishy and cute exterior lies a terrible tempest of annihilation awaiting to release upon this world. We look to ensure our friends and allies are taken care of. And those who oppose us get crushed beneath our short stumpy flippers. We do not seek territorial squabbles with other schools of penguins and we welcome all those who wish to befriend THE MIGHTY PENGUINS.

We are penguins,
And we are hungry for some fish...[/color]
