For too long now The North Pacific Region has been effectively a one party state. The North Pacific is  ruled by a progressive party that has constantly violated civil liberties and silenced many. This Region is officially being created in hopes of recruiting nations to infiltrate the TNP progressive party  spy on its members and liberate the region from its rule. I have already have made contact with several TNP members of the RA and executive branch that have been feeding me information. I am requesting that all nation states nations that wish to join the quest to liberate TNP from there rule,to  telegram my nation with your wishes after a security check you will be admitted to the Council.
