British explorers discovered Round Square Bay in the 17th century when a ship-of-the-line that had separated from its main fleet hit a coral reef near the bay. The area is named Round Square Bay because the explorers that discovered it could not agree on its shape. Further exploration in the 18th to 19th centuries revealed that the &quot;Bay&quot; was neither round nor square or even a bay, but a tongue-shaped peninsula. However the name had been around for 200 years and it was agreed that it should remain unchanged.

Today, Round Square Bay is known for its climate extreme, with the sunny island of Frandre in the south and the cold mountains inhabited by foreigners in the north.
