This region has seceded from the rest of mainland China to form a free and independent region. From this time until the end of time this land will be independent and free.

We are a separatist movement formed due to some dissent within Mainland China&amp;#39;s government. Our forces were valiantly fighting off raider nations invading the region, and for what? Our infrastructure has crumbled. Now it is time for a New China. Southern China will make that China.

We are a independent region who will absolutely not tolerate fascists or imperialists. For we do not kneel.
