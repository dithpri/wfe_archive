[b][color=#3e9ad2]Shalom![/color][/b]

I am the leader of [nation]New Merakh[/nation], and have created this nation with the Jewish community of Nationstates in mind.

This newly created region will hopefully serve as a unifying, just, and peaceful means of [b]helping repair the world[/b]. On a smaller scale though, it will be a place for Jewish nations, Jewish individuals, and gentiles who share these values and goals, to come together!

Both Zionist and Anti-Zionist nations are welcome here so long as they are respectful of Israeli-Palestinian nuance and are not anti-semitic or islamophobic.

I am open to instituting roleplay and maps as well as facilitating general conversation. Though I imagine barely anyone will join and this will remain a one nation region.
