[b]Shalom!

This newly created region will hopefully serve as a unifying, just, and peaceful means of helping repair the world. On a smaller scale though, it will be a place for Jewish nations, Jewish individuals, and gentiles who share these values and goals, to come together!

I am open to instituting roleplay and maps as well as facilitating general conversation. Though I imagine barely anyone will join and this will remain a one nation region.
