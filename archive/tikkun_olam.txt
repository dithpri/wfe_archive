[b][color=#3e9ad2]Shalom![/color][/b]

I am the leader of [nation]New Merakh[/nation], and have created this nation with the Jewish community of Nationstates in mind.

This newly created region will hopefully serve as a unifying, just, and peaceful means of [b]helping repair the world[/b]. On a smaller scale though, it will be a place for Jewish nations, Jewish individuals, and gentiles who share these values and goals, to come together!

This is primarily a Zionist region but welcoming of critisism of Israel. All nations are welcome here so long as they are respectful and not anti-semitic!

I am open to instituting roleplay and maps as well as facilitating general conversation.
