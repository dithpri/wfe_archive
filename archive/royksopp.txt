[color=#1f0656][b]&#149; An extremely large archipelago lies in the midst of a vast, endless sea near the equator. The weather is tropical and humid in the north, whilst maintaining a sub-tropical and cool climate in the south

&#149; Bursting with flora, fauna, and wildlife, very few sections of the island have yet to be disturbed by human activity. However, a small nation of people has laid waste to a considerable amount of the island despite its young age

&#149; Most of the island chains have yet to be mapped, as the few that have already bear massive amounts of wealth in natural resources
