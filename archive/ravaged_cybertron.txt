the red eyes, just keep my heart beating
your secret&#39;s safe with me
just drive, i&#39;ve broken our mirror so our past won&#39;t look so tempting
i never thought it&#39;d feel this good to quit, failure tastes so sweet
i&#39;m not afraid anymore
forgive me
i&#39;ll hang here, i&#39;ll swing from this rope just at least until they&#39;ve found me
stay close dear, the note on the floor says &quot;i wish that you were here&quot;
i&#39;m not afraid anymore

forgive me
