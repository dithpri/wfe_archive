Perunia, a land torn to shreds by the ravages of the Great War. Once upon a time this was a land of peace and plenty, united and ruled for millennia by the mighty Gnoman Empire.

But no longer

The greed of men exacted its toll upon this once fair land, perpetuating the fall of the Empire - and with it - the peace this land once enjoyed. All the remains are scattered remnants of those who wish to cling onto some semblance of the past, those who wish to maintain what little they have left, and those who wish to build a a new future with themselves at the center. 

This is the story of Perunia: a land torn by war.
