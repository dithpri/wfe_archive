Welcome to [b][color=#800000]The[/color] [color=#004000]Big[/color] [color=#800000]Walnut[/color] [/b]!
[color=#800000]Legend[/color] says that our universe is secretly in a cluster of six other universes in a walnut shell, which is suspended on a Metaversal walnut tree...which may itself be merely one in a grove of countless other walnut trees, who knows?
In a mountain in Eastern Kyrgyzstan, there lies a portal to this walnut shell. Well congratulations, because, one way or another, you have entered this portal, and now, can find a place to resettle in any of these seven universes.

This is a region built on the principles of democracy, fun and community. We support diversity, freedom of expression and creativity.
