The Third Roman Empire was founded by the Nationalist People of Roman to care for it&#39;s brother and sister countries.  
We enforce fair rule, firm, but fair.
Previous Roman empires have failed due to a struggle for leadership and invading nations. This will not happen thrice. Other nations can voice their opinion, which will be considered fairly, but the ultimate word is possessed by Nationalist People of Roman. The founder will provide all the military protection for the region, although individual armies are not discouraged.
Protect your brothers and sisters, if you are part of the region you are part of the family, that is the supreme law of the land.
