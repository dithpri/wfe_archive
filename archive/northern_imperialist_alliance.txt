[u][b]THE NORTHERN IMPERIALIST ALLIANCE[/u][/b]

The [b]Northern Imperialist Alliance[/b] is a region of like-minded nations set on expansion, world domination, or any other empirical characteristic. Although all nations are different politically and ethically, NIA members share a common goal of imperialism. 

Formed in 2012, the NIA has three main goals:

- Establish a trade system between members, conducive to a functional economy.

- Create an international defense system, allowing member nations to quickly receive foreign reinforcements in the event of invasion.

- Expand it&amp;#39;s territory across the world, eventually becoming a massive empire that spans the globe.
