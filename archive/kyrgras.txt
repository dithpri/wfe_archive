A peaceful region with large quantities of tequila and suspicious deaths.

Well, when we say peaceful, we mean a different thing to you.  There are plenty of healthy, inconsequential rivalries between nations that commonly end in death, destruction and a massive influx of refugees leaving our region but peace still reigns through a strict and brual enforcement of love and happiness.

We may be over-populated with rambunctious fledgling nations, but our word is strong. We also do not agree with some of the WA&amp;#39;s policies and bills, but we ultimately support a unified world that works to legalise social freedoms and ban anything that doesn&amp;#39;t make the government money.
