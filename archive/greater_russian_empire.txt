Welcome, To Federation of The Greater Russian Empire! A region that thrives on political and socio-economic diversity and uniqueness from the mainstream regions. This region does not welcome other warring or invading factions as they ruin the peace in a region that thrives on peace and prosperity. As a Federation, we are a conglomeration of independent states that meet in the capital of New Moscow (FSNR&#39;s capital) to discuss matter of significance and to achieve a more peaceful and wealthy region. We also have a strict social order, and it goes as follows:

Emperor/Czar: Federated States of New Russia 
Grand Duke of the Empire: Vicienna
Secretary Baroness: Wiscl
Grand Marshal of the Federation: Cynada

&quot;Live Long and Prosper&quot;
