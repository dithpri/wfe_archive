Today, [region]The Black Hawks[/region], and their friends from [region]Kantrias[/region], met together to observe the changing of seasons.

The original plan was to play 25 hours of christmas music and dance around a bonfire.

Unfortunately, they were all feeling hungry, and were promised [color=red]free pasta[/color] by the pasta gods if they spread the word that Obama was actually santa. 

Armed with this revelation, we have come to your region to steal your cookies and spread the word that Santa Obama will be coming to town! 

If you would like to eat pasta with us and learn Obama&#146;s last name, [url=www.forum.the-black-hawks.org]Come Join Us[/url]!
