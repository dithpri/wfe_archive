The Lonely is one of the Entities. It is a manifestation of the fear of isolation, of being completely cut off and alone, the fear of being disconnected. Victims are generally either predisposed to isolation or simply have the misfortune to cross paths with the Lukas family. The Lonely often manifests as fog, ships, travel and faceless crowds.
