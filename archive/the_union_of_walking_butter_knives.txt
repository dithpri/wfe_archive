For we have lived under such a region for too long..&amp;#128298;

The blasphemy that is..&amp;#128298;

The Union of Walking Baguettes.&amp;#128298;

They have ruled over us for far too long. We do not belong to a region that calls us their little &#39;playthings&#39;&amp;#128298;

Come, join the rebellion. &amp;#128298;
We will prevail.&amp;#128298;
We will live on.&amp;#128298;
We will have the greatest Revolution known to man!&amp;#128298;
