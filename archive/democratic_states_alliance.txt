[b][i]What Was the [color=blue]D[/color][color=red]S[/color][color=yellow]A[/color]?[/b][/i]

[i]The [b][color=blue]Democratic[/color] [color=red]States[/color] [color=yellow]Alliance[/color][/b] was a region I, [nation]Struberria[/nation], Made in around May of 2017. The reason the region was made because I had gotten into an argument in my now current region, [region]New Western Atlantic[/region] and had left the NWA to create my own region. The DSA had done moderately well, and it lasted for around 1 and a half months. After an Internal conflict, most of the citizens left this region to make their own region, called just &quot;DSA&quot;. The DSA (the second region) was ultimately killed by myself after working with the NWA, and after killing the 2nd DSA region the DSA as a whole was dead. [b]This Region Serves As A Monument Of Hopes And Dreams; But Also Of Failure.
