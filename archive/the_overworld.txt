[u][i][b]The Overworld is an incredibly complex environment with a wide variety of features.[/b][/i][/u]
[b]The Overworld[/b] is subdivided into biomes. The current biome determines almost all physical aspects of the terrain. Biomes may vary widely based on size, and almost all biomes have several different variations of themselves. Biomes also influence which mobs may spawn, and affects environmental behaviors such as weather.
Our biomes hide many secrets, f.e. portals to Aether and Twilight Forests. As well as that, we have many oil springs around [b]the Overworld[/b] but still we tend to foster and use renewable energy.
