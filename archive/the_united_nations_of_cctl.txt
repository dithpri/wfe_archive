The United Nations of CCTL openly endorses Communism as being the greatest form of government, and recommends that all other counties agree. Capitalism is everything wrong with the world, promoting only money, while disregarding care, and love for other human beings. 
&amp;quot;Democracy is the road to socialism.&amp;quot; -Karl Marx
Socialist economy, and a Communist world is in the best interest for everyone, whether they believe it true or not.

Capitalist countries are strongly frowned upon, but will be TOLERATED. 
Everyone must have some political freedoms, else they may be kicked out.
