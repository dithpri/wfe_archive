The tropical subcontinent of Xiliki is home to the nation of Oceanic Vakiadia. 

It is believed to have first been inhabited by humans 6000 years ago, arriving by sea. The Vakiadian population arrived more recently, in 1444. 

To many in Vakiadia, &#39;Xiliki&#39; is interchangeable with the name of their country.
