Xiliki is a subcontinent primarily in a tropical climate. Its total size is 6,355,655 sq km.

Home to the Imperial Archipelago of Oceanic Vakiadia since 1447, the land&#39;s first inhabitants were various tribes believed to be descended from ocean-crossing pioneers some 12,000 years ago. 

The city of Adiakav was founded on the coast of the Sea of Sovant, in the Northwest of Xiliki. From there, expansion went mostly southward, with the Derensti Peninsula becoming the last area to formally join Vakiadia in 1803.

Today, Xiliki is the heartland of Vakiadia. While Vakiadian influence extends to other lands far from Xiliki, those lands make up a negligible amount of the population. To some, &#39;Xiliki&#39; and &#39;Vakiadia&#39; are interchangeable.
