[b][color=red]IMPORTANT INFORMATION[/color][/b]

The Zombie Apocalypse is now here. All nations are [b][color=red]required[/color][/b] to start researching a cure [B]immediately[/B] as the more nations curing, the lower the infection rate in the region. Failure to do so may result in ejection!

Shoot newcomers with cure missiles immediately. Like last year, we will be maintaining an open-door policy into [region]My Pants[/region], so please be as active as possible during the outbreak.
