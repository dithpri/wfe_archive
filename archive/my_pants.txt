[b]Welcome to [region]My Pants[/region]![/b]

[b][color=red]IMPORTANT INFORMATION[/color][/b]

The Zombie Apocalypse is upon us once more, starting around [B]31st October[/B]. All nations are [b][color=red]required[/color][/b] to start researching a cure within the first 12 hours of the outbreak. Once cure missiles are available, they should be despatched to any new nations immediately on arrival.

Like last year, we will be maintaining an open-door policy into [region]My Pants[/region], so all nations are requested to be as active as possible during the outbreak.

[b]Remember[/b] - [i]&amp;quot;There ain&amp;#39;t no infection in My Pants!&amp;quot;[/i]
