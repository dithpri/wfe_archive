Welcome to The Sandbox! The place where you can do anything! Every nation is apart from each other, although you can invite everyone! Build anything, anything and anything! WE DO SOMETHING AGAINST BULLIES THOUGH! Oh we accept ALL Ideologies! You are free! If you want... There&#146;s a 2nd RP too! It plays in 1913, and isn&#146;t with infinity resources! If someone is offline DON&#146;T attack him if you do, the war will not exist. If someone conquers the world, it resets and fills with new members. If there are not enough, old players can return in the game. (You need to choose a 1913 Nation) That&#146;s it. Sorry for the rule-set but... Yeah... Then you know!
