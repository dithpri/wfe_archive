Welcome to the [b]Semi United Nations[/b] - (abbreviated the S.U.N, pronounced the SUN)

[hr]

The [b]Semi United Nations[/b] is a [color=green][u]peaceful region[/u][/color], however if the status of our region is at [color=red]high risk[/color], a preemptive strike may be [b]inevitable[/b].

The [b]Semi United Nations[/b] is always finding the best way to make the world a better place and will [b]open negotations first[/b] rather than [color=red]conflict[/color].

[hr]

Where the diversity is strong, the complexity is state-of-the-art, the debates strong and the technology plentiful!
