Welcome to the [b]Realm of Coalitions![/b] What makes our region stand out from the rest is our unique perspective on community, discussion, and acceptance. It has become a personal goal of ours to create a level playing field that welcomes all opinions and ideas to better enhance our glorious region. So, what are these &amp;quot;Coalitions&amp;quot; that you speak of? Coalitions are a group of like minded nations that seek either political power, autonomy, or even something as simple as a voice and can be created by any single nation. If you truly believe that your nation is unrepresented by any current Coalition, take a stand and found your own! We sincerely hope that you consider signing up today!
