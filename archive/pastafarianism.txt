A message to all pastafarians to pray with me.

Our pasta, who art in a colander,
draining be your noodles. 
Thy noodle come, Thy sauce be yum,
on top some grated Parmesan.
Give us this day our garlic bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those 
who trample on our lawns.
And lead us not into vegetarianism,
but deliver us some pizza,
for thine is the meatball the noodle,
and the sauce, forever and ever.
