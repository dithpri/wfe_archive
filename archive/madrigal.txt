SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM THE FOUNDER:[/B]
Hello, I am the player that was given rightful ownership to Madrigal in 2014. While the player known as &amp;#39;Shadoke&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;Benjamin Henrikson&amp;#39; has been left to control the region, I have seen Madrigal deteriorate. Therefore, I am now taking solo control of the account. Changes will come, and they will be good.

Also, DarkDune is the one known as &amp;#39;Rifty&amp;#39; of AOI. I can&amp;#39;t believe that wasn&amp;#39;t obvious.
