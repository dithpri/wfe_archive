[color=black][b]Darkspawn, your reign of terror is over![/b][/color]

Madrigal has been taken over by [color=grey][b]The Grey Wardens[/b][/color] and the [color=red][b]Taijitu Citizens&amp;#39; Militia[/b][/color].

As invaders you have taken the gamble that you would never be as vulnerable as your victims and you have  lost. It is the mission of The Grey Wardens to put an end to the blight and we are more than willing to journey into enemy territory to do so.
