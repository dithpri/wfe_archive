[b]Welcome to &quot;[i]World Folk Alliance[/i]&quot;[/b].

Region created with the intention of serving as a meeting and socializing point for NationStates players who carry the ancestral cult with them. Pagans, animists, polytheists, those who practice ethnic/native/autochthonous cults, etc. People who don&#39;t minimally identify with these &quot;labels&quot; are equally welcome as long as they behave in a respectful manner.
