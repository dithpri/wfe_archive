Welcome to The African Republics, a region where nations fallen from the shadow of communism
can live again in a world where the west is dominating the lists for richest economies.

Zakatutu has a long and proud history, dating back to when it was part of the British empire. In 1923, Zaka and Tutu led an army to gain independence, and since then Zakatutu has gone from strength to strength, surviving hardships such as World War 2 and the Zakan Missile Crisis. In 1990, Zakatutu was classed as one of the world&#39;s top 10 geopolitical superpowers.
