The Factory was initially an experiment by Chinese and American entrepreneurs, to create a business with as high an economic output as possible. Due to how unethical their ideas to increase productivity were they ended up building in the middle of Africa. After hiring a private army they took over a sizeable portion of land.

If you would like to join The Factory please create a new nation with a name from the following template:
Room x-Product
The rooms need to prioritise economy and wealth over the citizens, so please don&#39;t join with your main nation.
