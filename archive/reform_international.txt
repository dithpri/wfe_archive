Reform International was founded by the Palmerstone Libertarian Party and by Great Shades to bring about political reforms to countries around the world. 

This coalition aims to focus on bringing about reform to the government, requiring the &quot;nations&quot; represented by the political party to have high political freedoms. This region shall contain solely political parties and not actual countries for technical roleplay.

All political parties are welcome.
