The archipelago that surrounds Macapule Island was opened for other island nations to settle on in late 2011. The area is still governed by Macapule Island however, and as such, nations must apply to be granted land. This is not an arduous process, but requires new nations to have a forward-thinking and socially progressive domestic policy, whilst at the same time avoiding hostility with other nations. The area is one of stunning natural beauty, with lush rainforests and bountiful water-features. More land is always attainable through reclamation, and further islands need only be requested from the Grand Prince.
