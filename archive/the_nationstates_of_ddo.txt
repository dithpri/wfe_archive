This nation was created from people involved in DDO. Only those who are a part of DDO may join.

This region was created on the glorious day of February 4th in 2012.

All who come from DDO are welcome, you may create your own nation based on your personal ideologies and views about economics, civil liberties, and political rights and rule with a fair hand. That, or you could completely oppress your own people just for kicks like an insane dictator.

THERE ARE TWO RULES OF THIS REGION
1) If you advertise for DDO, be careful
2) Fights that happen on DDO, STAY in DDO, dont bring it into here.............. This is all for just for fun
