The Churchill Coalition is a unique, resilient region that is notable for its strong leadership and its strong belief in strength through power. The CC will almost always put its opinion into the battle. We are also democratic. Every 6 months, we will come together in a convention in which each nation puts forth a delegate and a candidate for the leadership position. The CC shall never back down and shall use brute force if necessary. Strongly conservative and believes in limited government intrusion and basic liberties.
