[b]Big Sur[/b] is a lightly populated, unincorporated region on California&#39;s Central Coast where the Santa Lucia Mountains rise abruptly from the Pacific Ocean. The coast is frequently praised for its rugged coastline and mountain views. As the &quot;longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the United States,&quot; Big Sur has been described as a &quot;national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development,&quot; and &quot;one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation.&quot; Big Sur&#39;s Cone Peak at 5,155 feet  is only 3 miles from the ocean. The stunning views make Big Sur a popular tourist destination. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
