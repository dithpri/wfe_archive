Raised from the sea by eldritch power, the region of Stephenopole boasts a thriving volcanic island chain surrounding a landmass of indeterminate size.

Legend has it, the region once played host to the fabled Terra Atlantus of antiquity, but the only evidence remaining of that long fabled city-state are the blue grey ruins that dot the landscape.

Here the gryphon and pegasi of legend roam the sky. There are tales of dragons nesting in the dormant caldera, and if your quiet, you may catch a glimpse of the brownies tending to the old ruins.

As for political views, classically conservative. Check your liberal ideology at the door. Activists get booted.
