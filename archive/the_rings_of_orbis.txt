All residents are asked to temporarily relocate to Southeastern Wisconsin to support Capitalem in his battle for justice against Zaldania.  While there, assume positions of power and resolve issues with their constitution and resolve loopholes within the region.  Please support Capitalem and the proposed Union of Regions.  If you have any questions, telegraph The Softwires (about topics pertaining to The Rings of Orbis), or Constitutionation or Capitalem for anything else.  The Softwires will remain here to protect the regions borders.  For Justice and The Rings of Orbis!
