The whole of history is a 10000 year experiment in the feasibility of male leadership. The conclusions of this experiment are undeniable: Wherever men lead war and suffering follows. It does not matter if it&amp;#39;s a monarchy, a democracy, some form of communism, fascism, or tribalism. Every form of male rule has been shown to have the same result. 

This region is for those of us who do not want to repeat the experiment again. This region is those who advocate for social, political, and economic rule by women. 

We do not wish to hurt men or cause them pain. We just understand that men should not be in positions of power. They should not be legislators, managers, CEO&amp;#39;s, presidents, Judges, Priests, or law enforcement officers.
