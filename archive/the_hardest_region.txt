We are the hardest region. Please do not come here, if you are not hard like us. People fear hard people, therefore, we are not a region to be messed with. Fear the hard. Fear the strong. Fear us!

Hard countries are feared by both other countries and their own people.

Hard countries do not tolerate crime of any sort.

Hard countries are tough.

Hard countries are durable.

Hard countries will last for more than four hours. Consult another country if hardness last less than four hours. But not us as you are not hard.

Hardness is not attained. You are born with hardness. Be proud of your hardness. Show others your hardness. Win with hardness!

For hardness!
