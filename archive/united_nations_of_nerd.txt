I regret to inform you that this will be the last entry this year. I will most likely not be updating it over the course of the coming summer. Although I will get on in order to keep my nation. I hope that all of you will do the same so that we will not lose our region entirely. Also, can someone get this pelican off of me? Some old lady, who I think was my neighbor, dropped of this pelican and told me it was a murder pelican. Weird. Why would she say that? I dunno. Wait, I bet she meant mopey pelican. Its probably sad. Oh. Looks like it enjoys playing with knives. Well, if that&amp;#39;s what it wants to do then that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll do you sad little peli... This is the pelican. I have just killed your friend. Next, the world!
