Ok, so I was thinking. Why not get a bouncy house? You know, one of them big huge ones with a ball pit and obstacle course. Could be fun! Plus I&amp;#39;d have a new happy place! All I&amp;#39;d have to do is tear down the poor old lady&amp;#39;s house which is just taking up a bit to much space. Oh well. I&amp;#39;ll give her, let&amp;#39;s say, a two hour notice? Sound good? Yeah, that sounds good.
