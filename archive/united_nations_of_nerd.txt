Did you hear about that guy on the news who destroyed an entire neighborhood just to put up his humongous bouncy house? I saw it on the news and I was like, &amp;quot;Wow, that looks like MY bouncy house!&amp;quot; but then I thought it couldn&amp;#39;t be mine because they were talking about some old lady, who looks remarkably similar to my neighbor, who wasn&amp;#39;t able to get out of the way in time and they found her underneath after 4 days, which is strangely how long mine has been up. Anyway, I was thinking it couldn&amp;#39;t be my neighbor because I gave mine a 2 hour notice! Right? Right? Yeah, I&amp;#39;m right.
