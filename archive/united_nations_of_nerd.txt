We&amp;#39;ve done it! We&amp;#39;ve hit 88 miles per hour! Haha! Now if we could just invent a flux capacitor... Does anyone have a toilet we could hit out heads on until we figure that one out? Please donate it to the region now! Oh, we also need a DeLorean DMC-12. We only hit 88 mph in my old Honda. I guess though, it could be a trap, but we&amp;#39;re giving it all she&amp;#39;s got and she can&amp;#39;t anymore, so we don&amp;#39;t have much choice.

Is that enough random movie references for one post?
