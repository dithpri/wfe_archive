Did you hear the one about the cat and the flamingo who got the wrong idea about the cat&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;I want to kill you!&amp;quot; call? Yeah, me neither. And what&amp;#39;s up with airline food? That joke is so bad. Anyway, so it turns out that old lady WAS my neighbor! And now I&amp;#39;m enjoying my days in... wait for it... FEDERAL PRISON! They have me splitting rocks with a pickax in 113 degree weather for no apparent reason. I got a hold of a plastic spoon and I bet you think I&amp;#39;m using it to dig a hole out of my cell right? Nope, I&amp;#39;m using way more practically. I use it to get spoonfuls of water out of the toilet in here! It&amp;#39;s WAY more sanitary than going straight in with my head. See you in 10 to 20!
