And now for a message from the SORE King Pelican. &amp;quot;Hello there! This is your ruler, SORE King Pelican! I am here to introduce to you a new law! A law which will bring a new Golden Age to us all! Its a new game show! For this, we are removing all these silly sports like &amp;quot;football&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;baseball&amp;quot; and replacing it with the new Team Death Match! All current sports players will be moved to a respective Death Match team. For example, the St. Louis Cardinals will still be the St. Louis Cards, but for Team Death Match! So, teams will train all year. Then in the spring, they will fight! All players must be in game every game. So, if a team should win with one player left, they have one player for the rest of the season. Isn&amp;#39;t that great? Have fun!&amp;quot;
