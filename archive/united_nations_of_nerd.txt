Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Only, its not a happy one. For this fine region has nothing to be thankful for! For we do not have a Minister of Cake! And without cake... what is there to live for? That is why we MUST take action! We MUST find a replacement for Racuda! For now, I will appoint a temporary Minister of Cake as and add on of that person&#39;s current responsibilities. If we cannot find someone more permanent before Thanksgiving I&#39;m afraid we will have to be rid of one of our other offices as none are as important as the Minister of Cake. Good luck to you all!
