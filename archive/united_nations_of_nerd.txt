This is a post. It&amp;#39;s a post for things. Getting stung by a bee really stings. 
I play the host. I play the host for things. &amp;quot;It&amp;quot; is the thing that he said he brings.
I like toast. I like toasting things. Toastin&amp;#39; everything around me from forks to rings.
Livin&amp;#39; on the coast. On the coast of things. Livin&amp;#39; on the coast of all the things.
Rhyme and I boast. I boast all these things. Boastin&amp;#39; while I&amp;#39;m toastin&amp;#39; and walking on these strings.
