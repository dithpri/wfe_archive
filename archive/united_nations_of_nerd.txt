Well the results are in and those of us receiving a large piece of cake are....... NONE OF US! As was just recently revealed to me by the local bum, the correct answer was Tables and Chairs. Well, what he really said was Live Cables and Flares -which incidentally is what he was trying to sell me- but I knew what he meant. So sorry to all of us but we who voted will receive a mildly smaller than the large sized piece of cake. Those of us who didn&amp;#39;t vote at all will receive a complaint letter in the mail telling why one should vote in the regional polls. Happy Days to all! (Except those who did not vote....)
