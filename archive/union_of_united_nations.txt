We are a proud region that supports the World assembly and its laws.
We accept all nations that are republics or have democratic systems of governments
We do not accept dictatorships or communistic nations.
Socialism is allowed to a certain degree.
We will soon have a regional government up and running 
So please embassy requests will be accepted after we have a president and vice president elected
