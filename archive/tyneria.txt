After the splintering of our glorious country of Tyneria during the Tynerian Civil War of 2014 Tyneria splintered into multiple rebel groups. The two main groups are those of West Tyneria and East Tyneria. West Tyneria is mainly composed of the remnants of the old central government of Tyneria and follows mainly the same principles. While East Tyneria is a liberal revolutionary state fighting for freedom from the oppressive central government. We of the nation of Tyneria have banded together under a region to quietly sort out our own problems without interference from outside states, which we will unilaterally oppose if they interfere.
