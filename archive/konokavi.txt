Who raids the raiders? The ones who are bent on watching the world burn under one anarchical flame... A revolution is starting, my friend. I take favor in you so I&amp;#39;ll warn you now... Tread lightly, for we may come face to face one day, or maybe we won&amp;#39;t. A revolution is starting that has already sparked hundreds in the course of 24 hours, a revolution that will result far worse than the Black Riders. Even the greatest will fall and when they do, we will rise from the fires and incinerate their ashes. Tread lightly my friend.
