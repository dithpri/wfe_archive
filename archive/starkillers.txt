We are just a group of people going against the &amp;quot;big guys&amp;quot; meaning the bigger groups and if you don&amp;#39;t like it then that&amp;#39;s your problem, but i will try and rise up as a whole instead of as a divided people and as the admin I will do my best to do that and I will change this periodically encase I become one of those &amp;quot;big guys&amp;quot; and I will not waver from my ideals just to appease people and shoot for as little conflict between us and that&amp;#39;s all I have to say about that.(And yes a Forest Gump quote at the end).
