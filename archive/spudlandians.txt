 Welcome to the Spudlandians. We hope you have a great time here! We like dogs and cats, books, cars, and other stuff. All people are to do a compulsory hour of potato field work a day, hence the name. We are also Anti-Dictatorship, so we still have Civil Rights. *Ahem Anti-Freedoms* Sorry guys I have a cold, anyway, LONG LIVE THE MEMES!! And also CW shows
