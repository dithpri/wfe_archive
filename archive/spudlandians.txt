 Welcome to the Spudlandians. We hope you have a great time here! We worship the Ugandan Knuckles God, like dogs and cats, books, cars, and other stuff. All people are to do a compulsory hour of potato field work a day, hence the name. We are also Anti-Fascist, so we won&#39;t put you randomly into gas chambers or throw you into a pit of people to rip you apart. LONG LIVE THE MEMES!! And also CW shows
