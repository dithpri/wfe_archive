Here, we welcome all who realize the great beneficial art and science of Genetic Alteration, Engineering, and Improvement. Those who are neutral in the topic are also welcome, as long as you don&amp;#39;t get on the Scientific State of Robotica&amp;#39;s governmental nerves. Those who are largely against genetic alteration, engineering and improvements, please leave; unless you are willing to change your mind, you will not fit well into this culture!
