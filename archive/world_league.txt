The World League of Terra Nova, the new world of Humanity

Terra Nova, Latin for &amp;quot;New Earth&amp;quot;, was intended to be a fresh start. Its first settlers hoped that it would provide a fresh start free from the chaos of the wider world. In the clarity of peace and cooperation the nations of Terra Nova decided that they distrusted the wider world more than each other and though old rivalries and tensions still run hot the World League, formed to protect Terra Nova from foreign intervention, has more or less kept the peace.
