Welcome to the D.S.F of O.P.C!
We are the combination of 2 formerly known regions of D.S.F (Democratic Separatist Federation) and OPC (overpowered China).

1. Map: https://ibb.co/g6sNrnC   (You have to be in the region for at least 2 weeks to be added to the map)

2. Elections for WA delegate are weekly. Once someone gets a majority vote, all WA members are legally required to endorse them (under threat of removal). Max period: 2 days

3. Former WA Delegate voted off will take the role of the newly elected W.A Delegate for a minimum duration of a week before any replacements can be done.

4. A Nation must clearly break the rules for it to be kicked out of the federation.
