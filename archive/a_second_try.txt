For the last 6 years, A Second Try has sat idle. Blacklisted, locked, and kept safe by [nation]-Westlake-[/nation]. I did not know -Westlake- nor have I ever had any communication with them. I would like to thank -Westlake- for the years of service keeping the region safe.

For years I have been wanting to return. I can only hope that Licentia, Can-ymir and the others may find their way back one day.
I am home
