The oldest continent on earth, ripe with post-colonial turmoil, starving children and horrible diseases. Known for its inspiration in creating the term &quot;3rd world country&quot;. Honestly nations change so much around here that there is no unifying factor between anyone in this region, except all the people are equally struggling for survival. it honestly doesnt matter if you are a horrible dictatorship or liberalism driven capitalist, as long as you remember the man with the most guns wins on this continent.
