Founded by the previously apocalyptic nation of Cryptica. Currently comprised of a single nation, The Empire of Blepia-Dominicus. 

Out in the middle of the Dark Sea, the Alliance hopes to unite nations under the promise of peace, trade, bread, arson, occasionally questionable morals, and better days.


Nations who&#39;ve left in a quest for better lands:
The Rogue Nation of Deez All Over - Aros Elyium
We wish them the best.

Dearly Departed
The United Kingdom of Cryptica
The Oppressed People of Cornicus
May they rest in peace and smile upon future countries.
