Heliopolis Cooperation Pact was created in 1681 R.E. (1946 A.D.; 1706 EoL; 29 N.E.; 1913 A.R.; 2489 B.E.; 42 H.A.) as a pact between [nation]Eleftheria Anexelenkti[/nation], [nation]Uyghur Manichaean Republic[/nation], [nation]Cubo-Futurist Dalian[/nation] and [nation]Free Ethiopia[/nation] on a summit in Heliopolis ([nation]Eleftheria Anexelenkti[/nation]) as a means both to ensure cultural and economical cooperation and to combat reactionaries both abroad and domestically. Later, many other like-minded nations joined it. The alliance is usually described as far-left, but is open to any ideology, that proclaims liberation of all sapient beings.
