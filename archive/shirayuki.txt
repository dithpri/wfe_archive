An icy chain of islands located north of the Japanese Archipelago. First colonised in the 2010s by Japan, pioneers make up a large part of the region&amp;#39;s residents. Mizuyuki, the main island of Shirayuki, functions as an administrative and economic hub for the region. The land is mostly covered by vast snow plains, and the towering, rocky mountains dominate the horizon. Shirayuki is named after the pure snow that often blankets the region, &amp;quot;white snow&amp;quot;.
