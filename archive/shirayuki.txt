An icy chain of islands located north of the Japanese Archipelago. First colonised in the 2010s by Japan, pioneers make up a large part of the region&amp;#39;s residents. The land is mostly covered by vast snow plains, and the towering, rocky mountains dominate the horizon. Shirayuki is named after the pure snow that often blankets the region, &amp;quot;white snow&amp;quot;.
