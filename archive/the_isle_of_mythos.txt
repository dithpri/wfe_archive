[color=lightblue]Welcome to the Isle of Mythos, a land of dragons and drakes, wyverns and wyrms, and all sorts of other Draconian beasts.[/color]

[color=turquoise]Our region strives to be a welcoming community centered around our people and our developing roleplay.[/color]

[color=blue]As you can see, we&#39;ve just been founded; 11/24/2020. Everything is a work in progress, and may take a while as the majority of everything is being developed by yours truly (the Founder), however we hope you&#39;ll find yourself a home in the Isle![/color]
