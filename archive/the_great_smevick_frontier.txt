Greetings comrades.
In my time in nationstates i have seen many regions trick new nations into joining them. A constant cycle of mental torture! I have created this place as an orphanage almost, to help you new nations into forging your own path. And to older nations maybe you can help raise the new generation of nations.
Thank you - Jono Harris The Leader of Smevick 07/10/25.
