[color=red][B]Carlism[/B][/color] (Basque: Karlismo; Catalan: Carlisme; Galician: Carlismo; Spanish: Carlismo) is a traditionalist and legitimist political movement in Spain seeking the establishment of a legitimate line of the Bourbon family on the Spanish throne. This line descended from Infante Carlos, Count of Molina (1788&#150;1855), and was founded due to dispute over the succession laws and widespread dissatisfaction with the Alfonsine line of the House of Bourbon.
