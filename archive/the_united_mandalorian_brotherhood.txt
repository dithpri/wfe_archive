From the ashes of [region]The United Study Group[/region] and [region]The Remnants of The United Study Group[/region], [region]The United Mandalorian Brotherhood[/region] will rise! We give hope to the hopeless and a home to the homeless. Our goal is to bring light where there is darkness, and to restore the peace where there is chaos.
