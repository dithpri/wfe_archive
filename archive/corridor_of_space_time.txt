With the destruction of the [b][region]Silver Millennium[/region][/b], the survivors of that catastrophe were able to escape due to the power of the Silver Imperium Crystal and of the Fourth Dimension. However, using that power did not come cheap as it took the life of the people&amp;#39;s beloved monarch, Queen Serenity. With that in mind and wishing for their queen&amp;#39;s death to not be in vain, the survivors hope to one day restore the Silver Millennium to its former glory.
