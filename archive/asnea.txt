Welcome to the [b][color=gold]Asnean Coalition[/color][/b]

The Coalition is a democratic association of entities - whether single nations or whole planets, human or otherwise - working under the Black and Gold Star to bring back together the remnants of humanity (and their allies) that have been scattered across many worlds in the Milky Way in the three millennia since the catastrophic war which destroyed the first human interstellar empire and exiled humanity to the opposite side of the galaxy.

The Asnean Commonwealth is a supranational federation of sovereign states governing the planet Asnea and its stellar system, and is the head and founding entity of the Coalition.
