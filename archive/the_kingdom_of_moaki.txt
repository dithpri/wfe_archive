A group of two nations, one that was once ruled by the Constitutional Monarchy of Moaki (the mainland), and now an independent country. Yuken is a group of people who were founded in another country and was sent into war with Moaki. Moaki then ruled them over. Moaki was not financially stable at the time to prioritize the Yuken land and citizens, and was soon branched off from them. Moaki is more socialist and prioritizes their citizens and environment, while Yuken is heavily economically independent. Both countries have an alliance and frequent each other, but have bitter feelings and comedic humor towards each other.
