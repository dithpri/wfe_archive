In the near future, America(meaning the US, as well as the continents) falls prey to a second great depression. Now after revolution, New England declares themselves a sovereign nation from the US! Now who else will join NE in the great &#147;American Nationalist&amp;quot; movement.

[b]Note:[/b]In order to be a part of this region, you must be a nation that takes place in the american continents. 
Ex. 
*Myself the founder
*The southern confederacy
*free bear republic
*etc.

You do not have to be a nation that historically existed in real life. 
All ideologies are welcomed! Please telegram NE for password!
