The region &quot;APoorBrazilianFavela&quot; holds strong beliefs in the power of a community coming together and blazing it hard. The populace, racked with the burdens that come with overpopulation and scarce resources, instead turn towards either hard drugs or fervent religious activity as a means of coping with their insufferable lives. 

This region works towards a world where we can all do a good ol&#39; line of the 420, go have a 9-5 work day, come home and greet the kids and the wife then proceed to get hammered until you pass out on the kitchen floor to the dismay of your family only to wake up and start the cycle all over again.
