300 years ago, three empires were forged.  At the forefront was the Empire of Syrixces, and underneath his undying gaze, the world fell before him.  In one final clash, a triumvirate was forged, the likes of which, had never been seen before.  With the power trio of Lord Armstrong, The Moon Walker, the Ocean Stormer and the Crater Maker, Lord Kahn Seth Shu Rok, The Sun Lord, The Sand Warmer and the Dune Maker, and High Lord Syrixces, the God King, Storm Lord and Hammer above all, the world shall never know freedom again!
