As much a state of mind as a geographical entity, the Unknown Land of Distant Kadath, or simply Kadath, is region steeped in ancient mystery and intrigue. Shrouded in the fogs of hoary eons past, where rugose gods and creatures long thought moldering in antediluvian tombs stumble blindly through mile deep trenches and conduct ominous rituals atop apexless peaks of bleak marble, the Unknown Land is an inhospitable land for humans. First discovered in the dreams of Randolph Carter, the journey to Kadath is one that few have the inclination or ability to make. In Kadath, never make assumptions. Remember: &amp;quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie, and in strange eons, even death may die.&amp;quot;
