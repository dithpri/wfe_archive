[i][u]Anarcho-Liberalism[/u][/i]
Anarcho-liberals are radical classical liberals who take the idea of human liberty to its logical extreme. Advocating the end of the state as an entity and free existence of all men through Free Market,Private Property and Voluntaryism.
Anarcho-Liberals hold that, in the absence of statute (law by centralized decrees and legislation), society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a voluntary society).[/b]
