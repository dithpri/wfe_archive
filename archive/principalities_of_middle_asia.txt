The various Principalities that fill Middle Asia. Some of them are too small to be of political significance on the world stage. Of the various princedoms, only two stand out Bhatang which sets itself as a idealistic utopia while Bhatung, a sister state that split off on its own accord attempts to set itself as a world power while scheming to take over Bhatang. The two are somewhat evenly matched in terms of military power so while Bhatang maintains a cool and detached approach to its sister state, Bhatung is eager in other ways to finally bring its neighbour under its control.
