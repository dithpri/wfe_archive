[B][color=black]This region, a former [region]Das Kommune[/region] satellite, has been destroyed by [/color][color=gold]Anti[/color][color=black]sta.[/color][/B]

[color=darkgrey][i]The end of all accumulation is dispersion. 
The end of all creation is destruction.
The end of all meeting is separation. 
The end of all life is death.

Make this life meaningful, it is fleeting like a water bubble on a turbulent river, do not let it go to waste.[/i][/color]
