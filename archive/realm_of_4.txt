A region where I&#39;ve been working on a fictional world this summer. It&#39;s a fantasy genre around Humans, elves dwarves and orcs and a few more species, following the events of an ancient war and exploring the timeline of this unstable world in 1914.

It&#39;ll be available on my factbooks ([nation]Aurvia[/nation]) but I don&#39;t know when. Its just a summer project.
