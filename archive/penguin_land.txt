When this glorious region was founded by our forever leader [nation]Henrik P[/nation] he was persecuted, then [nation]Penguin and man[/nation] and [nation]Kit mains only[/nation] was recruited, and then from then we grew. Adding notable nations such as [nation]Aigeus[/nation], [nation]Radiant Rolly Pollys[/nation], [nation]Perpendicular bisector[/nation], and [nation]Isosceles triangle[/nation]. Then came the dark ages recruits were falling out of favor and after we fell from 35 members to 20, then [nation]Radiant Rolly Pollys[/nation] assumed the role of WA Delegate after a bunch of nations seceded, but after a power struggle the seceding nations were defeated and came back to the light and beauty of [region]Penguin Land[/region]. Now [nation]Aigeus[/nation] has taken the delegate spot, [nation]Isosceles triangle[/nation] continues to build our beautiful map, and [nation]Henrik P[/nation] continues to lead us into a new [b]Golden Age.[/b]
