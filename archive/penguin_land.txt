When this glorious region was founded by our forever leader [nation]Henrik P[/nation], he was persecuted, then [nation]Penguin and man[/nation] and [nation]Kit mains only[/nation] were recruited, from there we grew. Adding notable nations such as [nation]Aigeus[/nation], [nation]Radiant Rolly Pollys[/nation], and [nation]Isosceles triangle[/nation]. Then came the dark ages, recruits were falling out of favor, and after we fell from 35 members to 20, then [nation]Radiant Rolly Pollys[/nation] assumed the role of WA Delegate after a bunch of nations seceded and held [region]Penguin land[/region] together. But after a power struggle, the seceding nations were defeated and returned to [region]Penguin Land[/region]. Now [nation]Aigeus[/nation] has taken power as World Assembly Delegate, [nation]Isosceles triangle[/nation] continues to build our beautiful map, and [nation]Henrik P[/nation] continues to lead us into a new [color=FFD700][b]Golden Age.[/b][/color]
