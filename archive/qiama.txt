Welcome to [region]Qiama[/region]! This region derives its name from the Arabic word for &quot;resurrection&quot;, which is essentially what this region is for me. The region will largely be just a landholding and social/advertising space for our [url=https://discord.gg/gGQuf9A]Discord D&amp;D-style RP[/url] that I came up with. We&#39;ll do some NS gameplay stuff, though that won&#39;t be our focus. We reflect this in our discord, with a channel category for non-RP NS matters. Regardless of how you got here, or what your motivations are, welcome.
