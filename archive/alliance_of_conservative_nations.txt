[b]Originally founded by [i][color=blue]Conservative Mississippi[/color][/i], the [region]Alliance of Conservative Nations[/region] has had a checkered history. 

Cast your minds back for a moment to the days of Tuna, LW, Brit, Sweden, Krim, Boton, Renaldy, Texalberta, Lazz, Liber and others.

Yes, I&amp;#39;m sure y&amp;#39;all remember my departure and subsequent founding of [region]The Royal Alliance[/region] followed shortly thereafter by the massive pandemic of  &amp;quot;Lazz&amp;quot; paranoia and then total collapse/implosion of ACN. And of course let&amp;#39;s not forget the raid led by Texalberta and all his &amp;quot;multied&amp;quot; puppets where he raised the flag of The RA and [i][u]falsely[/u][/i] claimed he was working for me. Anyway, this place has improved 1000% since I liberated it.
