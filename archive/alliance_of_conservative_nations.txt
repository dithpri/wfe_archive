[b][color=red] Alliance of Conservative Nations, a corrupt capitalist haven, and originally Founded by [i]Conservative Mississippi[/i], was captured by an allied International Communist Army and has now been converted to a 5 star Communist holiday resort for the elite within the Party, as well as providing retirement villas mainly for the proletariat. Here, comrades, you can laugh, sing, dance, eat and drink while being served by the captured capitalist pigs who were once in control here.[/color][/b]
