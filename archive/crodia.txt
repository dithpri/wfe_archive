Crodia is a WIP fantasy political-themed region for my friends and I until it builds stronger.

Rough draft map is done. I&#39;ll link it here once I figure out how to upload images.

Questions? Concerns? Suggestions? Whatever it is, you can log it on the message board at the bottom of the page, or send a telegram to [nation]New Rowwenia[/nation] or another government official.

[nation]Knicto[/nation] became part of government by default and nobody told me to update the fact book. Thanks guys.
