[color=#68be8d][b]It&#39;s Kozue&#39;s birthday! 

Tonight, Kozue and friends flew on a paper aeroplane across the night sky, gazing at the stars above! They saw several constellations and even made a wish on one of the shooting stars! After the flight, Kozue met up with Kaho to perform Fortune Movie at a few venues for everyone!

We hoped you enjoyed this feature presentation, until next time![/b][/color]
