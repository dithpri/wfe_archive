Welcome to The Realm of Lindon. Lindon is an Elven Kingdom founded by Ereinion Gil-galad Finw&euml; at the beginning of the Second Age. It is the longest-standing Eldarin Kingdom in the history of Middle-earth, and the mightiest throughout the Second Age. It is ruled by its founder, Gil-galad, the High King of the &Ntilde;oldor, who, during that age, was the strongest and most powerful enemy of Sauron in Middle-earth.

The realm has endured through the Third Age, though diminished, and is the site of the Grey Havens, where the Elves, as well as the Ring-bearers, sail to the Undying Lands.
