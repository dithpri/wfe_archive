    [i]&quot;Gil-galad was an Elven-king
    Of him the harpers sadly sing
    The last whose realm was fair and free
    Between the Mountains and the Sea.&quot; [/i]
    &amp;#8213; From The Fall of Gil-galad, as translated by Bilbo Baggins

Lindon was a region of the Westlands. Initially populated by Laiquendi in the Elder Days, it became an important Elvish realm in the following Ages, known for its havens and ships that would sail for the West.
