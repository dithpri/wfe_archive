[b]WHERE MEN ARE MADE.

The Kung Fu Academy of the [region]Eastern Union[/region].[/b]

This is a place meant not just to serve as the breeding ground for the young guns who would be charged with the responsibility of defending the [b]Eastern Union[/b] but also to be a place where responsible, confident, strong characters equipped with purpose and fulfilment are built--- a refuge for the [region]lost souls[/region].
