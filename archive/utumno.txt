Utumno, or Ud&ucirc;n, was a fortress of Melkor in the far north of Middle-earth. It was the first and greatest of Melkor&#39;s citadels, delved in the earliest days. It was the home to hosts of demons, the fallen Ainur who allied with Melkor, and numerous monsters of corruption that were made in mockery of Middle-earth&#39;s naturally intended creatures and beings.
