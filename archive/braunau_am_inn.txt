Braunau am Inn is a charming little Austrian village on the border with Germany. Unfortunately it is most famous for being the birthplace of Adolf Hitler - and thus a tourist destination for fascists. The apartment building where Hitler was born is currently being turned into a museum on Nazi war crimes. A stone outside the building reads: &amp;quot;For peace, freedom and democracy; never again fascism: millions of dead remind us&amp;quot;.
