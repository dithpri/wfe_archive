[b]Christ needs you to love[/b]
Do not care about race or skin color
Love everyone as brothers and do good
To the suffering and the sad, give them love
To the humble and the poor, give them love
To the one who lives next to you, give them love
To the one who comes from far away, give them love
To those who speak a different language, give them love
To those who think differently, give them love
To a long-time friend, give them love
To those who don&#39;t greet you, give them love

Notice: Anyone who wants a government position can have one.
