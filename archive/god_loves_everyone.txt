[b]Christ needs you to love[/b]
Do not care about race or skin color
Love everyone as brothers and do good
To the suffering and the sad, give love
To the humble and the poor, give love
To the one who lives next to you, give love
To the one who comes from far away, give love
To those who speak a different language, give love
To those who think differently, give love
To a long-time friend, give love
To those who don&#39;t greet you, give love

Notice: Anyone who wants a government position can have one.
