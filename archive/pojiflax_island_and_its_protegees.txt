Hi. We&#39;re Greater #Pojiflax, Kupo!
We speax Pojiflaxian Pidgin English, which is like American English, but 1: rules are more lax due to anarchism in Pojiflax, 2: there is a lot of slang and invented words and phrases, usually from fandom\meme slang, including anime stuff. This includes stuff from other fiction, such as words like Kupo or Quiznak.
MIX Pixies and magical stuff are always welcome so is any fandom stuff.
We&#39;re ruled by the only Princess-General (and foundress) herself, Gaia Pojiflax.
The main sport is gambling over The Sims 3. Premade sims such as the Wainwright and Roomeis household are often considered proteg&eacute;es of Pojiflax, in a way.

so... Kupos to all!
