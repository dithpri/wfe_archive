For the longest time, dictatorships that band together into unfair powers have practiced invasion: overwhelming frontier regions by repeatedly endorsing delegates and taking advantage of them by sheer size. NAAI is a region dedicated to stopping that. Our region is a place to create safe havens for those affected by invasion. If you want to help, join NAAI, find struggling frontier regions and create a password protected (or non-frontier) region for them. If you are in an invaded region, contact us and we will help. Eliminate Invasion!
