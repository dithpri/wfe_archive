The Ladzuian Union is a union of nations that wish to better each other and help each other develop their own nations. We have a few rules and here they are...

1. You must change your flag to a similar type of flag to Ladzu. It can be any colors you want but must have the triangle canton and the tricolor going up and down. You may put any emblem in the canton. 

2. Be friendly and don&#39;t wage war on each other

3. We will have elections every month to decide a new WA Delegate or keep the same one. To be a member of the Ladzuian Union you must be a WA member. 

Thank you for reading and Hail the Ladzuian Union and the Great Nation of Ladzu!
