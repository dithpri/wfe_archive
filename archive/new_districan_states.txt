After the fall of the past two attempts at the Districan Empire, the state has been reborn in a new popular revolt after the failure of rebels governing the new nation. 
The old dictatorial regime has been reinstated and is regaining their control over the people and reinstating policies from months ago.

&quot;Back from the dead to reinstate our glory. Districa will once again rise to fame.&quot;
