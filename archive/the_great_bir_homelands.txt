We are a peoples united by a heritage of being descendants of the great Bir empire. Bir was cold and evil, but through its dissolution many a free nation has emerged. The region of Bir is awful overall, but with faith they stay relatively compassionate and close. If a nation claims to have a percentage of Bir heritage or is of reasonable views, they might be admitted to enjoy the brutal winters and angry warm monsoons of Bir. In a sense, all are welcome.
