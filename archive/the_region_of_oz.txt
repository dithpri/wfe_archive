So, yeah, anyone here doesn&amp;#39;t really like to be social, or invade (hence the fact that there is no Delegate), so come here if the world is a little too big for you!
Actually, I made this place just for myself, to be on NationStates without having to bother with any of that &amp;quot;Regions&amp;quot; junk. There was actually another Oz before this where I scared everyone off with a password, but then my nation expired, and I got moved to a more social region when I came back. *nodnod* I&amp;#39;ve decided to open this one a little bit more to the public, since there are probably other hermits out there, too. ^-^
