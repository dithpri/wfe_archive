This region enables discussions between creationists of NationStates. It&amp;#39;s purpose is to provide a safe society for creationists playing this game to express themselves, and spread the Light of Creationism to the NationStates world.

Our members should not join the WA, as they are a corrupt Secular dictatorship company set in their ways of destroying our sacred knowledge. Criticism of any philosophy or movement is allowed, along with freeform discussion of any kind, as long as truthful evidence is supplied in favour of each faction.

Comments found unfactual will be supressed, and nations which offer lies instead of just argumentation will eventually be banned for trying to hide the truth.
