Xithonia is a diplomatic paradise where none live in fear of war.  Religions, races and creeds live in peace.  All of Mars, Earth, and their moons are inhabitable.  Wildlife is vast and grand.  Reptiles have evolved to humanoid form and intelligence, along with other mammals, amphibians, and birds.  Heck, there are even countries run by sentient robots.    However, non of this would have been possible without the help of the country of Xankornovax.  They developed the super-weapon that helped take out the race of insects threatening all races&#39; survival.  Xankornovax is always looking for new allies to join their alliance of Xithonia.
