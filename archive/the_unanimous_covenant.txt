A covenant of sovereign powers. Join to experience the tranquility of an assertive fraternity.

&amp;quot;This day, March 17 2014, marks a tremendous achievement involving the cooperation of The Dodeca Entente of Ellysiumm and The Free Land of Homoscotia. These 2 nations have created together an alliance that makes the U.N. look like the a Polish parliament. March 17, from this day forth, will be celebrated as the inception of The Unanimous Covenant. This holiday shall consist of merry-making or the occasional &amp;quot;accidental&amp;quot; Tomtalian obliteration (usually both at the same time). This holiday shall be referred to as &amp;#39;The Day of Unflinching Resolve.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; -Fyodor Homoscotia, Archbishop of the Celestian Church
