Heathania (hee-thane-ya) was founded under the Benevolent Dictator Rictor Don Tirk. It&amp;#39;s founding nation, Yatay, is comprised entirely of intelligent people frustrated that lobbyists and corrupt politicians were crippling their native societies elsewhere in the world. Therefore Rictor, elected because of his lack of any bias, rules over Heathania&amp;#39;s flagship nation and opened the doors of Heathania for others who feel similarly trapped in vortex of slime that unchecked capitalism has visited upon the planet.
