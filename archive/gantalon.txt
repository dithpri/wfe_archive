[b]Welcome to the continent of Gantalon![/b]

Gantalon - meaning &quot;Great Land&quot; in Ancient Dardalonic - is a large continent home to a plethora of nations, which all work together in the Gantalon Entente to create a harmonious and prosperous international community.

Gantalon&#39;s arms are wide open in welcome, but all who would threaten the harmony and prosperity of this community will be kept at arm&#39;s length.
