These nations are merely the few that inhabited the lustrous continent of Elesia before the cataclysm following the arrival of the All-Mother and the death of the 899 gods. Don&#146;t worry if you don&#146;t understand, since that all hasn&#146;t happened yet. Walk through the streets of the Cuerra Tidalae, a fort on the very edge of the Telebian Empire, journey through the beautiful mountains of the Old Valley Kingdom, or stroll down the alleyways of the powerful New Al Ber. What ever you want, as long as you don&#146;t anger the humanoid species down on the southwest peninsula.
