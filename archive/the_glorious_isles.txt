The Glorious Isles are situated in the middle of an obscure ocean. Discovered by Brigandrian explorer Thomas Nelson in 1834, the Isles were the cause of much unrest in Brigandria as the people demanded that the King, Fredric XIV, fund colonisation efforts to the Isles to help relieve the struggling economy. His inaction on the issue is seen as the main reason for the Third Great Revolution. The Brigandrians previously kept the Isles a secret project to themselves, but after a recent referendum the people decided (65.47 Yes - 34.53 No) it would be best for the country&#39;s position on the world stage to be reveal the coordinates and value of their paradisiacal group of islands.
