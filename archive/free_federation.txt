The Free Federation is a union of free and independent nations joined together in free and fair democracy.
This region is a democratic simulation, and I hope that its politics and leaders are fun and engaging!
If you have any questions or problems, please just talk to either the Monarch, the President or the Prime Minister.
Glory to the Federation!
