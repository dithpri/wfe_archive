The Free Federation is a union of free and independent nations joined together in free and fair democracy.
This region is a democratic simulation, and I hope that its politics and leaders are fun and engaging!
If you have any questions or problems, please just talk to either the Monarch, or the Minister of Interior.

[u]The prime ministers&#39; election will begin on the 29 of November, 2 days away and will end on 2nd December 2025. Please VOTE![/u]!
[b]Glory to the Federation![/b]
