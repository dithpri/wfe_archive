The Village Green Preservation Society is a layed back region that doesn&amp;#39;t discriminate against people, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re; capitalist/liberal/communist, gay or straight or whatever, a brony etc. 
Feel free to have fun and voice your opinions here, but above all don&amp;#39;t be prejudiced. I hope you have a good time in this region.

(Side note: embassy requests are usually accepted)
