[b]We are great empire,sadly United Kingdom of Great Versimhine has collapsed but we are back!
North Versimhine is mainland of our union
Bez Trimarce is counted as place where we do the event called MVLM(Monthly Versimhine Leaders Meeting)
We discuss the problems of the countries of the region and try to provide our citizens with security and stability in the region There is also the most important event in the region - the Annual Leadership Meeting(shortly TALM)
&quot;Why in Bez Trimarce?&quot;
Bez Trimarce used to be the most important and strategically important point of Versimhine. And we protect this territory first of all, For a couple of months we also replaced Bez Trimarce with Kitchizerland but events didn&#39;t go as gracefully as in Bez Trimarce[/b]
