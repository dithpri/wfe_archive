Region: Eleotopia - &amp;quot;Place of Pity&amp;quot;

Indigenous Inhabitants: Umgati, &amp;quot;The Crippled Ones&amp;quot;

Terrain: Mostly scarred, rocky, ruined and uninhabitable. There are ruins of once-great cities here and there, and much of the place is covered in fallout. Only pockets of inhabitable territory are available, but these pockets seem somehow well-preserved by the indigenous peoples.
