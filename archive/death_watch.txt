The Death Watch&#151;or Kyr&#39;tsad in Mando&#39;a&#151;was a Mandalorian splinter group founded by Tor Vizsla, who opposed Jaster Mereel&#39;s Supercommando Codex. Their primary goal was to return the Mandalorians to their ancient roots as galactic crusaders, and advocated the savage raider mentality of past Mandalorians.
