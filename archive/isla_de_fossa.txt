So commonly are nations expected to conform to the rules of a region, where the region&#39;s success and unity is placed before the player&#39;s enjoyment.

If I may tell you firsthand, that is not the case here.

Welcome to Isla de Fossa! Allow the region to conform to you! We want Isla de Fossa to be the most diverse place in NationStates, and we need your help to get it there! Whatever your pleasantries; roleplaying, government, military, socializing, and anything you can think of, they are encouraged. Join us in our journey to prosperity, whatever your definition of prosperity is.
