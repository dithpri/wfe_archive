Founded on August 28th, 2265. Re-established on September 11th, 2265! We are on a mission to become a great region. Though we are small, if we stick together we can do the impossible. No matter what your views are, your wealth, or whatever else, you may join us. This is a region for everyone who wants to become a successful country. Or even if you want to be a simple country. It doesn&#39;t matter. We are friendly and will try to help you out as much as we can. Hope you decide to join either us or our Northern Siblings, our mission contrasts to that of theirs to give more variety to members.
