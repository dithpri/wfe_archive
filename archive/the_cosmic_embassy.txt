     Created in response to interstellar corruption by unruly nations, The Cosmic Embassy is a highly liberal region usually centered around both on-world and off-world wildlife preservation, civil liberty and human equality.

     The Embassy is accepting any nation willing to join. Just send a telegram to the founding nation and, once we review your nation, we will send you a letter of acceptence and the regional password.
