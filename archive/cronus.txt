A weird Earth-like planet in a solar system located somewhere in the hit PC, Mobile and Console game &quot;Roblox&quot; released in 2006 by David Bazooka (thats his real name, trust me). Inspired from the Dummies Vs Noobs universe, which is quite like this one except with a much worse worldbuilding.

Bacovis (My main &amp; also main focus point for the story) is where I&#39;m most active in, so if you would like to participate please TG me and we can talk things out from there
