Artifact is a land shrouded in mystery and myth; only being known from stories that originated millennia ago. It is a myth of a magical land beyond the horizon. The truth of the matter is that Artifact does exist yet passage to this realm is near impossible. The secrets to pass into this realm lies in ones ability to cast magic and magic only exists in Artifact. The land itself is highly uniform with a landscape that is temperate and dotted with large forests, swaths of farmland, clearings and where cities, towns and villages dot the landscape in between.
