This was an old ally of [region]True Land[/region] but sadly it died, it only existed, for, like, a day, but still.

This region was reborn in a much better form in [region]The Yeet Army[/region].

I decided to refound this place for propaganda purpouses, so, join [region]True Land[/region] today!

(This is also a memorial to the region that I won&#39;t name here, but it was neat, for the 5 seconds it existed.)
