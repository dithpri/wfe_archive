Nations who have fascist, communist, theocratic, or anti-Democratic tendencies are not welcome. Democrats, especially Christian Democrats, northerners, centrists, liberals, green party, socialist, or other nations who are left-wing are not welcome as well.

Southerners, paleoconservatives, neo-conservatives (depends), libertarians (depends), tea party, and republican nations are welcome. The more radical and conservative the views, the better.
