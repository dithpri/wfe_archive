[i][b]Suddenly, you&#39;re nowhere to be found
I turn around and everything has changed
Looking for a way to work it out
I&#39;m trying to find some peace to navigate
The oak tree where I met you
And the writing on the statue
I still remember every word you said
I&#39;m not a soldier but I&#39;m fighting
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won&#39;t give up &#39;cause there will be a day
We&#39;ll meet again[/b]
...We&#39;ll meet again[/i]
