The clouds stretch from horizon to horizon, billowing with dizzying size across a sky glittering with snow, swirling in a frothy blanket of milk foam.[/i]

[i]The rumbles of engines that send heavy-duty helicopter blades whipping through the frigid fog echo off of vast mountainsides, filling the sleepy morning with a throaty hum.[/i]
