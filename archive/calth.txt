Calth. One look at our recent happenings will show the downfall of a once Great region. Even I John Eden was gone for a short while. Leaving these left behind suffering in a dying region. But now I have returned I will restore Calth to its former glory. And I need people like you to do this. Glory to John Eden and glory to Calth
