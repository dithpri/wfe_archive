East Germany, formally the German Democratic Republic or [b]GDR[/b] was a state in the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War period. 

Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. After the collapse of Communism, the SED was renamed the &quot;Party of Democratic Socialism&quot;  which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German WASG to form the Left Party (Die Linke). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
