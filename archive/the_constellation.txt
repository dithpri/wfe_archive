The Constellation is a welcoming region founded by Islae, seeking to provide a kind and compassionate community in a place where that is sometimes hard to find.

If you join us, you are expected to be polite to nations both inside the region and out. Any nation found not adhering to this rather simple rule will be barred from the region. More rules and codes will be developed as the region grows.

If you wish to be a part of the World Assembly, kindly endorse our founder and prospective WA Delegate [nation]Islae[/nation]. Thank you.
