Tired of your present region? Eager for both peace and power?
Understand both comedy and irony? Got at least one star on your flag?
Join [b]the Constellation[/b] today!

&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;, you ask, and the reason is that most of the old regions contains
hundreds if not thousands of nations, many with well over billion citizens each.
It&amp;#39;s not easy for a newcomer to adapt to such place.

[b]The Constellation[/b] however, is a new region, with fairly new-started nations.
This means that we are all in the same level of gameplay and knowledge.
So, come on and let that/those stars become a part of [b]the Constellation[/b]!

[color=red][u]The only requiremen is that you at all times have at least one star on your nation flag[/u][/color]
