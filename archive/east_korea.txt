[color=purple]Welcome to East Korea[/color]
We have claimed independence from South Korea, and have made our own region, East Korea. Our cultures are extremely different, with 100% of the population being Australian. Our flag is a combination of Silvacometopia and Freyhill, the two major powers in the region.
