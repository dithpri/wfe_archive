[color=purple]Welcome to East Korea[/color]
We have claimed independence from South Korea, and have made our own region, East Korea. Our cultures are extremely different, with 100% of the population being Australian. Our flag is a combination of [nation=Silvacometopia] and [nation=Freyhill], the two longest serving nations in the region. We welcome all nations to East Korea, and we all hope you choose to join us.
