The Western Islands

The Western Islands is a young region that currently contains 16 nations. We enjoy being natives in the region and are very proud to be members of it. The region is very diverse, ranging from Right-Wing Utopias, to Drugged-Out Hippies to Psychotic Dictatorships. There are four main officers: WA Delegate, Vice Delegate, Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State. We have new polls nearly every day, because we care for the common interest of the members of our region.
