The Western Islands
The Western Islands is a region that currently is being rebuilt/remodeled after our near total collapse after the corruption and abandonment by our former government. Our previous leaders, Bobby and Cody, pretended to be creating a democracy while actually be a corrupt dictatorship. These corrupt leaders were eventually captured after an attempted escape with our greatest resource, the fruity pebbles man. They were then executed through burning and impaling. The fruity pebbles man has been returned and even got to torture the swine. Bobby&#39;s brother was also kept by us as a trophy and slave. Soon we hope to be more powerful than ever before but are currently rebuilding our inner circle of officers.
