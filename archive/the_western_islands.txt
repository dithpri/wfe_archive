The Western Islands

The Western Islands is a young region that currently contains 8 nations. We enjoy being natives in the region and are very proud to be members of it. The region is very diverse, ranging from Right-Wing Utopias, to Drugged-Out Hippies to Psychotic Dictatorships. There are four main officers: WA Delegate, Vice Delegate, Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of State. We have new polls nearly every day, because we care for the common interest of the members of our region.
