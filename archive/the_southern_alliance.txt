Founded by the war-torn nation state of Southern Azerkia a few months after it&amp;#39;s official declaration of sovereignty from the nation of Azerkia, this alliance is formed of Southern Azerkia&amp;#39;s closest allies, trade partners, and neighbors.

All nations who are members of the Southern Alliance may benefit from trade agreements between members, military alliances and assistance, and diplomatic opportunities.
