This is the home of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, known as the Knights Templar. 

We, with the Knights Hospitaller, the Teutonic Knights, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, the Order of Santiago, the Order of Calatrava, the Order of Alc&aacute;ntara, and the Order of Montesa, are the heroes of the Great Crusades.

In Hoc Signo Vinces! Join us in our cause to drive out the followers of the false prophet and his false god.
