The Nations Alliance is the representative body of Earth and all Imperial colonies in Nation States. Backed by Earth&#39;s most powerful nations, the Alliance has become humanity&#39;s military, exploratory, and economic spearhead. While the Alliance is relatively new to the community, it has already made a name for itself, gaining humans an embassy on the Presidium. The Alliance is governed by a parliament based in Normandy France, which also serves as the Alliance&#39;s capital.
