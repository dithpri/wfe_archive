The Peoples Region of Blood Raven is less of a region and more of a safe haven for small countries. In Nation States it is impossible to move up in this fictional world without being noticed by the leader of a massive region. The problem with that is that you would have to be in the region for years to have enough influence to be noticed. Then you must convince the founder that you are fit to help run the region. Then after about a year in that position you may have the ability to have a tight network of countries who agree with you and be able to push your agenda.
