This is the Conservative United States of America. We pride ourselves on being Conservative, Capitalist, Anti-Communist, Anti-Socialist, Anti-Big Government, and, above all, American. We believe in America 1st and only 1st, and 2nd place being far, far away. 

The WA will not have executive powers due to Communist forces and the small size of the Region.

No Communists allowed. Period.

http://www.nationstates.net/Commander_J_Military is a complete Military Force, not a &quot;nation&quot;.
