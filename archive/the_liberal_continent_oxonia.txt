Oxonia is a rugged land. Large mountain ranges run vertically and horizontally, and where mountains are not present you will find yourself in large forests and massive plains that run for kilometers and kilometers in every direction.

Oxonia was settled by the two current ruling powers, Sacrinto along the north face of the Albeer mountians, and Civitasum. The two powers are close allies and are welcoming to all nations that wish to inhabit the land that lays unclaimed.

The powerheads stand against communism, and the lack of basic human rights in other countries and they push forward with the idea of a clean environment.
