[B][color=yellow]When the Sun rose on Crest Valley Hill in the Great Land of the All Mighty Gea, We knew what to do[/color]

[color=red]Our brave leader, Welch, led our armada straight up to the gates of Bigtopia and we slaughtered everyone there!  We lived amongst our conquered land peacefully... at least for a few years.  People have their differences!  So we went our separate ways but we made an oath that when we forged our Empires, we would stay in the same region and unite when it is time to fight Bigtopia once again in an epic battle of Ragnarok!
