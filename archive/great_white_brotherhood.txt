[b][u][color=teal]Welcome to Great White Brotherhood. We have great white sharks for pets.[/color][/u][/b]
This region was recently held by the [region]Aura Hyperia[/region] 1st Platoon as part of a reaction-time exercise. We are taking our leave, and the natives are free to do as they please.

If you&amp;#39;re interested in getting out of this boring region and into a more exciting one, feel free to come on over to the [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Aura_Hyperia2/index/]Aura Hyperia forum[/url] and join up.
