Mercosur (also known as Mercosul or &Ntilde;emby &Ntilde;emuha) is a South American trade bloc established by the Treaty of Asunci&oacute;n in 1991 and Protocol of Ouro Preto in 1994. It&#39;s purpose is to promote free trade and the fluid movement of goods, people, and currency. The official languages are Spanish, Portuguese, and Guarani. Since its foundation, Mercosur&#39;s functions have been updated, amended, and changed many times: it is now a full customs union and a trading bloc. Mercosur and the Andean Community of Nations are customs unions that are components of a continuing process of South American integration connected to the Union of South American Nations (USAN).
