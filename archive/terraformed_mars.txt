The planet Mars has recently finished the process of being terraformed by several like-minded private companies on Earth. Through several lawsuits and a lot of capital, those companies were granted first colonization rights of the planet, and elected to colonize immediately. The first colony began as a research base which quickly grew into a city named Ariapol. Ariapol stands as the largest city on Mars and controls a large territory known by the same name.

Several species from Earth were introduced during the terraforming phase, most notably the previously extinct imperial mammoth as well as a diverse selection of boreal and tundra fauna.
