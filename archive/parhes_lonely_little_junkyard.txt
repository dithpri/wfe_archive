Nothing much, just a place for me to be. Will continue to function as eith the place for my nations, or a central are for all my puppet regions, if I choose to do so.

For now, and a while more, this place will be empty except for me. Others are welcomed to stay in this region or park their Non-WA puppets but I require they inform me in whatever way, through telegram or post on the RMB, what nation their main/s is/are. If enough people ever decide to actually join, well, I guess y&amp;#39;all can try to set up a government and forums; I will just make sure to give the WA delegate regional controls.

Any telegrams to nations in thus region should be sent to the founder Parhe.
