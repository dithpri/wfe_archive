Aux armes, Citoyens!

Scientific Socialism, Marxism-Leninism; but, foremost, the Sovereignty and Liberty of our people.

May our nations&amp;#39; glorious leaders lead the way to greatness.
May the townsfolk rise up in arms if their Freedom is threatened by whoever it might be.
May the Force be with our Nations.

Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute;, ou la Mort!
