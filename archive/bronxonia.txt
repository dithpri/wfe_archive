Welcome our new nations to the wonderous region of Bronxonia. Here, you may run your government however you please. You are the ones in control. All we ask is that we keep this region safe for everyone here. No inappropriate names, symbols, words or gestures will be allowed in this region. If you or any member of your government break this promise, your nation will be erased from Bronxonia and you must start again. But with that, as your new minister, I welcome you to the promising region of Bronxonia. 

Your minister,
Mr. Krugman
