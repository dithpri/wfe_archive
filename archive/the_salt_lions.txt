Two basalt beasts, cathedral-sized. They frown eternally at each other across the black waves. The north one carries an encampment: creeping human figures eat away at its features like rot, pick-pick-picking. There&#39;s a supply dock below.

In the vast sea, surrounded by nothing but water lies the isolated port of The Salt Lions, a collection of islands, with two massive sphinxes of basalt as its center piece. Feel free to join, and please enjoy your stay.
