National anthems: &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;S h a d i l a y&quot; 
Religion: The Cult of Kek 
Currency: Big-boy points
Mission Statement: To protect the Keki people from the oppressive normies. These normies have been raiding meme farmers&#39; fields, burning down villages, and sending Kekis to their gulags. 
There is a temporary travel ban on all ethno-normies.

&#147;When the Normies send their people, they&#146;re not sending their best. They&#146;re bringing drugs. They&#146;re bringing crime. They&#39;re meme-stealers. And some, I assume, are good people.&#148;
