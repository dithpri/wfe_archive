This was a target TBH raided...which got locked up as a defender trophy for some reason.

[region]The Black Hawks[/region] stole your cookies and your milk, and your carrots, and your bread, and your muffins, and your pancakes, and your hashbrowns, and your meatloaf, and your cell phones, and your backpacks, and your kitchen sink. You have been raided. [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]Join Us[/url]
