Several years ago, the nations of Nephilis and Kumapolus lived in harmony.  But due to disagreements of the division of the land and sea, war ensued.  The Nephilii went to the right of the Adriatic sea, while the Kumapolusiae took the the left.  Due to disease and famine, Keith, the representative of the Nephilli, and CV, the representative of the Kumapolusiae, convened and decided to come together to form new region with an agreement to share the land and the sea under a new name: Mare Nostrum Pater (The sea is our father).
