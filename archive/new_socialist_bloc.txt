[b]Opposite the wall, there was Grand Admiral Joshua&#39;s desk, a great stack of monster energy cans next to his monitor and desktop accessories. On the other side of the desk, there was a large keg of monster, which he called his &quot;raiding fluid&quot;. Suddenly, he slammed his desk and roared &quot;GO! GO! GO!&quot;. He leaned to the side, put his mouth under the tap of the keg and took several large gulps of his raider fluid before returning to his screen, slamming his F5 key multiple times and roaring &quot;FEND! POST POINT POST POINT POST POIIIIINNTTTT&quot;. [5/9]
