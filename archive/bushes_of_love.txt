How did my father die? 49 times. We fought that beast. Your old man and me. It had a chicken head with duck feet, with a woman&#39;s face too. And it was waiting in the bushes for us, and ripped off your dads face. And he was screaming something awful. In fact there was this huge mess, had to change the floors. The floors? You see his blood drained into the boards, I had to change them. But we all got a chicken duck woman thing waiting for us. Every day I worry all day, about  what&#39;s waiting in the bushes of love
