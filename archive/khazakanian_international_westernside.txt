The Pouhkleed Tribe was mad. They sent swords out. Te kids were having arrows. Fast Wind is a child and has a gun,he was very sensitive. The women had knives,and chief Raindrop had best defense,not to be told. The battle was January 6,1777-November 3,2008. That war ended a long time,most women were killed but Fast Wind was still alive. The Pouhkleed won! The pioneers have to move back to Yeng Beshen,Fe,Ireks Islands,or Yeng Hillsby,Fe.
