Bracara, the larger of the two main landmasses, is known for its temperate coastlines, tall mountains, and wide stretching plains. Caralis&#39;s shoreline is rocky and dotted with large sheltered bays, while forests and prairies dominate the interior. The many islands of the region vary greatly in terms of size, shape, and climate.[/i][/b][/color]
