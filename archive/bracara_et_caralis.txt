The region is composed of two major subcontinents and an array of islands lying in the sea between them.  Bracara, the larger of the two main landmasses, is known for its long temperate coastlines, tall mountain peaks, and wide stretching plains.  Caralis&amp;#39;s shoreline is mostly rocky outcroppings dotted with large sheltered bays, while forests and prairie land dominate the interior. The many islands of the region vary greatly in terms of size, shape, and climate.
