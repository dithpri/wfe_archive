[color=#909090][b]Welcome to [/color][color=#8404BF]L&#39;Empire de la Mort[/color][color=#909090] or as translated into English, &quot;The Empire of the Dead.&quot; 

 The French version is the preferred name.  If punctuation was allowed in naming regions and nations, this would be it&#39;s name. 

 It is a tribute to the catacombs under Paris filled with the bones of an estimated 6 million dead.  

 This region serves as a final burial place for nations that shall never rise again.  May they rest in peace.[/b][/color]
