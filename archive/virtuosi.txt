United forever in friendship and labour,
Our mighty republics will ever endure.
The Great Virtuosi will live through the ages.
The dream of a people their fortress secure.

Long live our Virtuosi motherland,
Built by the people&#39;s mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our epic flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all people to see.
