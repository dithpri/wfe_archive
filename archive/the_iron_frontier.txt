The Iron Frontier is a nation of capitalism, spirituality and prosperity. We encourage the minds of the young to serve their country with honour, modesty, hard work and perseverance. We have both previously left regions who failed to conserve their previous ideas and let their culture rot. We have a no-nonsense policy, to praise the great nations and chide the troublemakers.
