The United Protectorate is a fledgling region. We are a relatively new region based on roleplaying and communication. In the United Protectorate, you will be accepted despite any standpoints you take on any subject, in real life or simply to annoy people on the forums for fun. By joining, you get access to a growing community of roleplayers, and are joining a safe region well-protected from marauding regions who enjoy tearing apart other regions simply to troll. As such, the WA Delegate cannot access Regional Control.
