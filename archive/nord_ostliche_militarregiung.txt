Wilkommen, we are the North Eastern Military Government. If you wish to have fun, like invading, defending, or just curious, please join the North Eastern Military Government! We have an 1800s / Napoleonic Europe theme but we are dedicated to maintaining a helpful and good community no matter what kind of themed region you are interested in. All political discussion is allowed, and we do not censor people for their view. However, please remain civil in discussion or you will be removed.
