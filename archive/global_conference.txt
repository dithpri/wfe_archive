[u][B]FAQ:[/B][/u]
[B]Can I join?[/B] Yes! Assuming your nation is believable, and does not occupy territory already in use (see below). You will need to write a basic factbook for your nation.
[B]I want to join but my nation&#39;s land is already taken![/B] If a player beat you to it, discuss the territory with them. For a neutral country, we can write a scenario that explains the change in territory.
[B]I got ejected![/B] Your nation was deemed to not fit our RP theme.
[B]What are the &quot;Neutral Countries&quot;?[/B] They are puppet nations that act according to their own &quot;personality&quot;. (See factbooks for RP rules.)
