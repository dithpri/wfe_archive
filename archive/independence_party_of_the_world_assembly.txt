Party Platform:

-Deregulation of archaic and unrepresentative legislation
-Regional politics independent of the endorsement system
-Endorse anti-World Assembly legislation
-Aid in the strengthening of World Assembly independence movements

*NOTE

Moderators are useless and ideologically biased. As a member of the IPWA you are expected to support party agenda and legislation, insubordination is not tolerated. Members of the World Assembly are held in higher scrutiny. This region does not have citizenship, does not operate with a judicial system, all traitors will be dealt with.
