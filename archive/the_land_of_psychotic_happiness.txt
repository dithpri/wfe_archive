Nation motto: &amp;quot;Alright, I&amp;#39;ve been thinking. When life gives you lemons, don&amp;#39;t make lemonade - make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don&amp;#39;t want your damn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life&amp;#39;s manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I&amp;#39;m the man who&amp;#39;s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons. I&amp;#39;m going to to get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!&amp;quot; - Cave Johnson
