A bright blue sky above and a see of grass ahead.

Just a slight tremor in the ground and a herd of elephants pass by. 

Monks sitting in front of a temple on a nearby hill. Chanting [i]bliss thy neighbor[/i] or maybe [i]blitz thy neighbor[/i]. Who knows.

A tank in the distance derelict and overgrown. Monkeys sitting on it and grooming.

The smell of flowers in the air. A slight breeze. A blazing sun.
