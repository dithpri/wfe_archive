Drifting slowly, the clouds float in the sky without a care in the world, far above the bloodstained Earth and not bothered with the petty concerns of Man.
Aradawn shifts and struggles, a victim of the greed and inherent violence of humanity. Kings fall, nations burn, empires are built.
Despite the shifting borders and times of this great region, the spirit of humanity shall always scar, yet at the same time bless, the land of Aradawn.
