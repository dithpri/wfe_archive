[color=#7b9902]Glory to the DFO and The [region=Northern Riders]![/color][hr]

[color=#000077]After finally making it down the 700 steps of deeper slumber you find yourself in a strange, beautiful, and dangerous land. From picturesque cityscapes of Ulthar and Celepha&iuml;s to the crumbling ruins of Sarnath, the Dream Lands are filled with wondrous and hostile sites but you are not here for vacation. You heard of the great treasures of the Dream Lands and you heard of the great turmoil caused by the Fallen and the resulting disappearance of the Great Ones. Now is your chance to stake your claim on these frightful and chimeric lands and secure your place as one of the great dreamers and gods of the Dream Lands.[/color]
