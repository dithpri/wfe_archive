Original WFE: Formerly ... The Isle of Duce. Then, a warrior came from within the barren wasteland. At first the people mocked him, but, his consistent tactical success on the battlefield allowed his small band of military men to grow into one of the most powerful armies in the world. His might seemingly unstoppable and his passion for love making legendary he brought the various islands under a strict control... Now we begin the Thousand year Reign of the Duce. (trimmed)
