Alliance of nations dedicated to peace and democracy, and opposing dictatorships. 

We fled here after a region was transformed into a dictatorship. The founder banned or ejected anybody who opposed him. 

So we opposed him. By calling his actions out, we founded a new region- a place of freedom, and equality. 

And that region is the FFA!
