Shall Audax be known as a region that never gave up. It was a struggle, but a struggle worth having.

I loved you all and made bad choices, but I tried. I tried my best to provide the best and I failed you all. I am sorry Dave, Malson, and everyone else for the decisions Aglrinia and I made.

I failed. Both in life and NS.
