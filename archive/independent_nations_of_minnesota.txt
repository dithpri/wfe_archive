[b]Nobody expected [region]The New Inquisition[/region]!

Two soldiers, [nation]Christopher Bishop[/nation] and [nation]Grand Prussia[/nation], went out drunk for TNI&amp;#39;s Foundation Day!

Both were disappointed that [nation]MagentaFairy[/nation] had to leave before the update. Hope she is well and may the Santa Bunny brings loads of chocolate!

Come to our regional forums to help us celebrate![/b]
