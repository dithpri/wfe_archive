Strong and peaceful, wise and brave;
Fighting the fight for the whole world to save.
We the people will ceaselessly strive
To keep our great revolution alive.
Unfurl the banners, look at the screen;
Never before has such glory been seen.

Oceania, Oceania, Oceania, &#39;tis for thee.
Every deed, every thought &#39;tis for thee.
Every deed, every thought &#39;tis for thee.
