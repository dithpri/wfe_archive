Welcome to Endogeny.

Endogenous substances and processes are those that originate from within an organism, tissue, or cell. Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are DNA sequences derived from viruses that are ancestrally inserted into the genomes of germ cells.

Our aim is to dominate using the tactics of the Endogeny, using as much military force as we can muster.

First striking the core, we will take over the strongest.
We will Change.
We will Endure.
And last, We will not Surrender!
