Here at [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region], there&#39;s little we like more than a good tagging. Except, of course, a good bargain - and there&#39;s no better bargain than two tags for the price of one! That&#39;s why for a limited time only, the Brotherhood is offering a two-for-one special for all poorly-detagged regions! That&#39;s right - if you&#39;ve ever found yourself in a detagged region with a raider RO, the Brotherhood will give [i]you[/i] your tag back - [i]guaranteed![/I] 
So don&#39;t wait - call now and leave one of our assassins as RO, and you could get a second tagging, absolutely [i]free![/i][/b]
