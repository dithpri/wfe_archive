I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o&amp;#39; clock, the radio&amp;#39;s the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tell me what I got to do
I got to

Get up
Everybody&amp;#39;s gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody&amp;#39;s gonna leave their seat

You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
