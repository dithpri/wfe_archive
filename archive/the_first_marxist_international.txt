 [region]The First Marxist International[/region] is a international only accepting of those who uphold the original words of Karl Marx, not Marxist leninism, troskyitsm, kautskism, maoism, or any other interpretation of communism.

The First Marxist international encourages anyone meeting the criteria of being a true marxist to join to flourish as a community of true Marxists as opposed to lofty networks of revisionists.
