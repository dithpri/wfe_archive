Tired of being a part of a region that represents something other than the safety and solidarity of its own members, the Forge of Nations is committed to leaving your nation to rule itself.
The Forge of Nations supports its members and hopes they will support &amp; protect each other as well, but no promises or requirements are imposed on them.
