[color=blue] Welcome to the Confederation of Independent States [/color]
The CIS is a small confederation made to keep the nations within it free from the major regions and factions. So we can all be sovereign and independent, hence the name. The CIS region is built to have a small central government and High Member State Autonomy. Declare Independence today!

Anything changes must be democratically ratified by the members of the confederation through a poll as of [color=red]1/14/2016 4:29 PM[/color]. (flag changes, officers, removing nations, etc.) Any Confederation member can request something be changed through a poll.
