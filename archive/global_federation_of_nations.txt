The [b]Global Federation of Nations[/b] (GFN) was founded February 1, 2012 by a merging of Global Alliance, [region]The Empire of United Nations[/region], and [region]The Imperial Guard[/region]. The EUN and TIG has since split from the GFN and functions independently. In it&amp;#39;s heydays, it vibrated with activity and gameplay and had an organised structure. The region is re-established with it&amp;#39;s focus on Commonwealth values of democracy, transparency,freedom of expression ,rule of law and justice.
While GFN is now annexed to be a satellite region of [region]The Commonwealth of Crowns[/region], it will function independantly and it&amp;#39;s history shall be preserved.
