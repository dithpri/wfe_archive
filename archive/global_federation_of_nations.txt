GFN was first Founded in February 1, 2012 by a merging of [region]Global Alliance[/region], [region]The Empire of United Nations[/region], and [region]The Imperial Guard[/region]. The EUN and TIG has since split from the GFN and functions independently. 

In it&amp;#39;s heydays, it vibrated with activity and gameplay and had an organized structure. The region is re-established with it&amp;#39;s focus on Commonwealth values of democracy, transparency,freedom and rule of law.

GFN is now refounded as a [color=blue]protectorate[/color] of [region]The Commonwealth of Crowns[/region], and the CoC is committed to it&amp;#39;s growth and well-being.
