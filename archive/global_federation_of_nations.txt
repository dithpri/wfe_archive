The [b]GFN[/b] was founded February 1, 2012 by a merging of [region]Global Alliance[/region], [region]The Empire of United Nations[/region](EUN), and [region]The Imperial Guard[/region](IG). The [b]EUN[/b] and the [b]IG[/b] has since split from the [b]GFN[/b] and charted their  independent course. In mid 2012, after it was abandoned by it&amp;#39;s founder, who ejected unwilling natives at random,[b]GFN[/b] was refounded by [color=blue]Regional  Defense Force[/color] of [b]CoC[/b].
Join us and help us chart this glorious, independent course for GFN !
