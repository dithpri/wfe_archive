After the Ventrilian continent was destroyed in the Final Continental War, all the nations of [region]Ventrilius[/region] took to the sea in the Great Exodus. 

One by one, their fleets came upon a [url=http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n182/Harrilal1984/VentriliusArchipelago_zps7647b407.jpg?t=1403282984]vast expanse of islands[/url] that the Trindaslavians named the Ventrilius Archipelago in memory of their former land. In hopes that the sea would separate them, they settled. Time will tell if the greed of the leadership will overcome the desire for peace.

The first to arrive in the archipelago was the Holy Fleet of [nation=short]Trindaslavia[/nation]. They settled in the [url=http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n182/Harrilal1984/Trindaslavia_zps52a598f9.jpg]heart of the islands[/url]. 
Five other nations have since joined Trindaslavia in the archipelago.
