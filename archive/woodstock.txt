[b][color=red]Welcome to Woodstock!
Full of grassy fields and ringing with the sound of music throughout, Woodstock is favored by the flower children of the last millennium and their progeny.[/color]

[color=blue][i]This land is your land, this land is my land
Our region[/i] [region]Woodstock[/region] [i]is a far-out island
Of peace and love and amazing music
This land is made for you and me.[/i][/color]
