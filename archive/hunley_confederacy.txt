The Hunley Confederacy is a speculative history/steampunk region, set in 1888. The Confederacy managed to survive the American Civil War through advances in technology, forcing the Union into a peace treaty in 1865. Due to wartime innovations in steam technology, along with economic pressure from Britain, slavery sharply declined in the late 1860s, as plantation owners replaced slave labour with machines, and was eventually banned outright by 1873.
