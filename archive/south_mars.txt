[b]About South Mars[/b]

A region of unknown size shape or colour; South Mars inhabits an &quot;anachronistic&quot; time period meaning that it mixes and matches technology from all time periods into one. No one seems to question this and asking someone directly about this is seen as confusing and slightly offensive.
