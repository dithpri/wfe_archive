Established in 1950, PACT (Partnership for Action, Cooperation, and Trust) was created in the aftermath of World War II. With nations struggling to rebuild their economies and trust eroded between countries, PACT was envisioned as a beacon of international cooperation.
Today, PACT stands as a testament to the power of partnership and trust. From its humble beginnings in 1950, it has grown into a global institution that continues to tackle pressing challenges, inspiring cooperation and hope across generations.
