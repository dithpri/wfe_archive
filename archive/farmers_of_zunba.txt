This region is provided for the farmers of Zunba, our nation&#39;s backbone.

[i]In Zunba&#39;s heart, where dreams are spun,
Work we farmers, we toil under the sun.
Beneath crimson skies, from which rain glides,
Lay our card fields, envied worldwide.

In unity, strength, and unwavering grace,
We Zunbai farmers nurture the sacred space.
Harvests shared, a triumph untold,
Tis our quest, a journey for gold.[/i]
