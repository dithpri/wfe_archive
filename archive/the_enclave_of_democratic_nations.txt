This region stands for the belief that power should rest with the people, rather than in the hands of one tyrant. If you&amp;#39;ve received an invitation to join us here, it is because you are believed to be more than capable of helping form this community and its constitution. After its completion feel free to leave, but you are welcome and encouraged to stay.
