The United Community of Muars is an exclusive trade union of states under the banner of The One True Mua. Our goal is simple: To establish unified humanity on the planet Muars. The One True Mua will not infringe in the internal affairs of nations that do not pertain towards that goal, and will provide only help and support to The People in His care. 

The Community is presided over gracefully by The One True Mua, as represented regionally through [nation]Mualossia[/nation], and internationally through [nation]Meranova[/nation], The Delegate to The World Assembly.
