Bodywater is your life
 And without it you would die
 On the desert the planet Dune.
 
Without a stillsuit you would fry
 On the sands so hot and dry
 In a world called Arrakis.
 
It is a land that&amp;#39;s rich in spice
 The sandriders and the &amp;quot;mice&amp;quot;
 That they call the &amp;quot;Muad&amp;#39;Dib&amp;quot;.
 
He is the Kwizatz Haderach.
 He is born of Caladan
 And will take the Gom Jabbar.
 
He has the power to foresee
 Or to look into the past
 He is the ruler of the stars
