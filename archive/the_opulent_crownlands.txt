The Confederation of Opulent Crownlands is an elective monarchy, similar to the earthly &quot;Holy &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Roman&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; Empire&quot;. Nations are incouraged to cooperate and unite under the banner of it&#39;s Minister, but frankly, each republic, duchy, kingdom, proletariot dictatorship and anarchical commune has full autonomy to fight in between themselves, or to conspire against the very existance of the Confederation.
