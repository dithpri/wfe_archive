Brenda continent, is a group of islands (not yet discovered in its entirety) that currently belong to the great Hernandez-Cabrera Empire, the continent, called &quot;Brenda&quot; by Empress adopted by the Cabrera family in a new region which I consider a new continent to show this map of the earth explored, so they were unclaimed lands and Brenda Empress decided to adopt its own name for the big island where it originates and the rest of continental land besides currency empire.
