The Collective borders areas of Southern Burma and South-Eastern Thailand. Originally consisting of loosely aligned colonies bound by a rudimentary constitution, The Collective was founded in the mid 1990s, when The Free Land of the United Peoples of Timbercroft recolonized the Burman capital, Yangon, supporting the democratic movement. Soon, neighboring municipalities, communities, and states began to flock under the newly-colonized Burma, appealing to the idealistic concept of isolationist diplomacy. By 2011, The Collective expanded into the Andaman and Nicobar islands, as well as parts of Thailand - growing towards Bangkok.
