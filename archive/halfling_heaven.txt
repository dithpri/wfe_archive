A place for relaxing in the sunshine and eating lots of pies, Halfling Heaven is the home of sloth and gluttony.

If you like AD&amp;amp;D, Neverwinter Nights, WoW or any form of fantasy roleplay, then this may be the place for you. Halfling Heaven is open to all who &amp;#39;races&amp;#39; who wish to make their mark in Nationstates. Be you Elves, Orcs, Minotaur, Gnomes *spits* or those troublesome Longshanks (Humans).
