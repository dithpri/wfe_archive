We stand for freedom, for only taking as much as we need, and for standing strong in the face of danger. If your nation wants to oppress your people, we will eject and even possibly ban you from our region. Grand Arcadia is a land of freedom, and if your nation does not have Average or higher civil rights and political freedom, you will be ejected. Thank you, and good day.
