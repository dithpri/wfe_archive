The World of Avatar is divided into four separate nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads.[1] At the end of the Hundred Year War, Fire Lord Zuko and Avatar Aang transformed the Fire Nation colonies located in the Earth Kingdom into a fifth independent realm, the United Republic of Nations. Each location has unique geographical layouts, civilizations, climates, and demography, and each one has a diverse range of landforms.
