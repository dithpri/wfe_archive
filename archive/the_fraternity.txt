From [region]The Fascist Senate[/region] RMB:

[hr][i][b]To my Fascist children, I have temporarily left in order to establish a new region, devout to protecting our Fascist/Nazi Regimes.[/b][/i] 

- [b][nation=short]Vici Minerva[/nation], on announcing the creation of [region]The Fraternity[/region][/b].[hr]

[b][color=red]Looks like they failed....

Happy New Year 2012! This Fascist region was founded by the Fascist [nation=short]Vici Minerva[/nation] to try to rally Fascists against [region]Antifa[/region] for it&amp;#39;s antifascist stance.[/color][/b]

[b]But [nation=short]Vici Minerva[/nation] left the door of [region]The Fraternity[/region] House open, and it has now been seized and confiscated by [region]Antifa[/region], and will no longer be a platform for the Fascists to spew their hate.[/b]

[color=red][b][region]Antifa[/region]. We[/color] are [color=red]everywhere.[/color]
