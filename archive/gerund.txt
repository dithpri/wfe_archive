Let&#39;s get down to business, to defeat the Huns. Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons? You&#39;re the saddest bunch I ever met. But you can bet before we&#39;re through, mister, I&#39;ll make a man out of you. Tranquil as a forest but on fire within. Once you find your center, you are sure to win. You&#39;re a spineless, pale, pathetic lot, and you haven&#39;t got a clue. Somehow I&#39;ll make a man out of you. Be a man. We must be swift as the coursing river. Be a man. With all the force of a great typhoon. Be a man. With all the strength of a raging fire, mysterious as the dark side of the moon.
