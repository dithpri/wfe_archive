[b] We are [i][u]The Social Group of Associated and Interacting Nations[/i][/u] on the continent of Rayzonia [/b]

There exists a diverse array of nations on the faraway grand continent of Rayzonia, and TSGAIN is the organization for everyone. Stay tuned for events and occurrences, as there is an ever-changing geopolitical scene. (Puppets courtesy of [nation]Cyzixraqab[/nation]/Rayz9989). Some nations are better fit in other regions for gameplay/roleplay reasons, as such they will only have a representative. But please see the list below for all our members. The nations not present include: [nation]Mozilla Floweyland[/nation][nation]Xzol[/nation][nation]Quaphchi[/nation][nation]Cyzixraqab[/nation]
