This Alliance is for anyone who wishes to bring peace, a place to be, and to have high standards of culture. This Union also offers those who just need to be somewhere. 

But just so you know, we do have a number of strict rules that must be followed; (See [nation]Artsotska[/nation]&#39;s Factbook to find the Regional Policy and Constitution.) If you are in the business of breaking our Regional Policy and/or rules, then we&#39;ll be glad to ban you from [region]The Okchi Union[/region]. If you do follow the rules, then your golden! 

If you find yourself not satisfied with anything, then let us know. As you should know, you are allowed to protest to any issue or subject in The Okchi Union. 
Please inform [nation]Dongwonghaegug[/nation] if you want to propose an issue.
