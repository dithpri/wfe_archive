The constitution 

 Must obey all laws but if a nation does not think a law is reason able they can bring it to the attention of someone in charge who can start a vote to either keep or repeal The law.
Cannot raid, attack, or in anyway shape or form make fun of another nation unless you can explain your case to the judges.
New rules can be added if the majority agrees, and only one vote per nation no puppet nations can be used to vote.  If we find out you used your puppet nations to vote you will be brought to the supreme judges.

To get a position the nations vote on the  people to fill those positions.
