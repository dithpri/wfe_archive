[color=red]Welcome![/color]
The Union wishes to extend its open arms to all who wish to join our region. We do, however have one policy for new members. All nations [u][I]must[/I][/u] ratify the constitution within five days of their joining. Any nation found violating this rule is subject to ejection, and banishment depending on what they have done while staying in this region. If you wish to join, then simply send a telegram to the founder or delegate for the password. Remember, the union is eternal, if you ratify it, you will be held to it&amp;#39;s standards.

Signed
