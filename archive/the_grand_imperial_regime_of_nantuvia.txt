[b]Welcome to the Grand Imperial Regime of Nantuvia![/b]
Our ultimate goal is to become the grandest and most extensive region in all of NationStates, but all things grand must start small! This is where we begin, a fairly sizable island off of the coast of [region]The West Pacific[/region], but our expanse in the long run shall be greater than your wildest imagination! Should you decide to enter under our benevolent regime under your own free will, we welcome you with open arms as our protectorate and you shall officially be called part of the [b][i]Nantuvian Empire![/i][/b] If you decide not to... beware.
[b]Glory to our Grand Imperial Regime![/b]
