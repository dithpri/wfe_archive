The Continent of Xeofroth is small and tucked away at the ends of the earth. Because it is small and isolated, the continent&#39;s inhabitants tend to be peaceful and content. However, it is also because they are isolated that many of the powerful factions that inhabit the land are mega-corporations. These corporations monopolize many valuable resources that each nation needs to survive. It is because of this that nations on this continent will always favor the rich and do anything they can to keep their economy afloat.
