//temporary description.

This is an RP region centered around the politics of civilizations under a galactic council. There are three council members, of whom are elected from the three most powerful galactic civilizations and govern galactic law. The galaxy is connected by a series of ancient gateways built by unknown precursors. All that remains of these precursors now is their creations, the Remnant, lead by 001 Repentant Dawn. The council only knows 003 Jubilant Sentry, who is the face of the Remnant. The Remnant always speak of life&#39;s duty and the threat of grave danger from the void, and from within.
