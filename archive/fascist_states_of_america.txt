We strive to keep our region in order, at all costs. If foreigners think they have a right to something and they want to try and immerse themselves in our culture, they must be stopped. We are in equilibrium and nothing should be changed. People don&#39;t know what they want, they only know what they think they want. We know what they want. We molded this region so that we all could live in peace without a chance of an outside threat, that&#39;s why our persistent military conscriptions are in place. Any issues brought up by the people we govern will be treated as an attempt to overthrow the equilibrium of our region and will be stomped out.
