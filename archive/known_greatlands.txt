The Known Greatlands. Where all nations are known about. Complete honesty from everyone is expected. Any invasions are prohibited unless they follow the following reasons:
1: They are great
2: They bring greatlands
3: They make us known

We may be small, but we are great. We are a patriotic peoples. Arable land, flowing rivers, a long coast. Any who disobey are killed, but trust me we have zero who disobey! *trust me*. 

We are more than a region, we are a peoples of the Known Greatlands. All are independent save for those who disobey, which are promptly stripped and killed.
