After the Hostile Goon Takeover, a regulated society was proposed. A society where a goon can be free to steal, rob, pillage, attack, pick locks, and give those who cannot conform with the madness the concrete shoes. The Goons were quick to accept. With the Goon Corporation at the forefront of the Gaming plains, no nation is safe from the wrath of an angry goon. The Region of the Goon Frontiers seeks to show all the true and might and power of those who ally with the Goon Corporation.
