The American East Coast was originally found by Lief Eriksson on 1001 AD, but left soon after, and was forgotten. But in the 15th century, it was discovered again by the English and colonies were established soon after. A few decades after the Europeans colonized the lands, the lands descended into anarchy after major trade embargoes and steep taxes. Many small states declared their independence from their overlords, but still remain unstable to this very day.
