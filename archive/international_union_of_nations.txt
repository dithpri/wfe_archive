The International Union of Nations (IUN) is a union of independent states united by common goals of cooperation and mutual assistance, similar in structure to the USSR. The main governing body is the Presidium of the International Union of Nations, where representatives of all member countries jointly make decisions on key issues. In the IUN, decisions are made collectively, ensuring equality and consensus among the union members. The union aims to strengthen political, economic, and cultural interaction, maintain peace and security, and promote the joint development and prosperity of all member countries.
