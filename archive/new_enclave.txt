After the death of president Eden by the hands of a Brotherhood of Steel assassin, a new era dawned in the wastes.  A new alliance focused on the rebirth of civilization and preservation life formed. The New Enclave carved out a safe haven in the capital wasteland using the superior technology from the original Enclave. Unlike the corrupt cult known as the &amp;quot;Brotherhood of Steel,&amp;quot; the New Enclave is based on the ideal that man deserves better than they have.  Hostilities with the Brotherhood are sure to form, but with loyal and undying effort, we shall prevail! These zealots who have lost their way shall face the might of the Enclave! They will be eradicated in the name of universal safety of man! COURAGE TODAY, VICTORY TOMORROW!
