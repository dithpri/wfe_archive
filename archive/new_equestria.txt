Welcome to New Equestria!

A land of bubbles and rainbows at the moment. By that will change. Yes, this tiny fledgling of a region shall change.

But what I can tell you so far, is that I and my co-founder wish to make this into a land for anyone. Brony or non-Brony alike. People from all respected fandoms, such as Homestuck or TF2 for example are indeed welcome here. We&amp;#39;ll try to make this an interesting and excellent region as possible!
