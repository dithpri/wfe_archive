&quot;Heaven on Earth&quot; - Mark Twain, 1929

The Tropical Seas is an area right in the middle of the Equator
The fauna and flora is infinite
The diversity of people is beyond your imagination
The air, so clean and fresh
The cuisine, taste the best

This place has many things best

Lots of island are unclaimed.. so this can be the land of new nations
