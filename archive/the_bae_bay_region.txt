The Bae Bay is a large bay that is very rich in natural resources and is strategically important. Its Alliance was founded by the Nation of Lidiya. Its flag has green to represent the fertile soil and beautiful environment seen throughout the region, surrounding a blue semi-circle to represent the sea and the bae bay. There is a white shield in the middle to represent the people and the defensive nature of the alliance, which was originally founded to defend from the Vikings that plague the bay.
