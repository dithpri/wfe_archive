Kalos is a region of the Pok&eacute;mon world. It is the setting of Pok&eacute;mon X and Y. It is based on the northern part of France.[1]
The Kalos region is shaped like a five-pointed star, with one of its biggest cities being Lumiose City to the north-central part of the region. It features a vast network of rivers and waterways snaking through much of its landscape, cities and towns. North-east of Lumiose City, lies a mountain range where more frigid temperatures exist, extending down into the plains below. Western Kalos features a vast ocean, where the shore side city of Shalour City lies in the middle of a cove.
