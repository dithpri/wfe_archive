Thank you for presenting interest in The Order of Sacrifice. Based on real-world ideology of a sacrificial love for the world, the Region of The Order of Sacrifice, also known as The Order, Ordirum, TOS and many other socially adopted aliases, is the unsung existence of a protective ultimatum. 
Members of TOS will not mention their membership while in aide of a weaker subject, or suffering victim, as this is dishonorable (that is to seek fame coming from others misfortune).
The Order of Sacrifice exists to become a first and last line of defense for new and old nations, regions, and to aide any of those who request it.
