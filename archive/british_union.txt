The British Union of Fascists, or BUF, was a fascist political party in the United Kingdom formed in 1932 by Oswald Mosley. It changed its name to the &quot;British Union of Fascists and National Socialists&quot; in 1936 and, in 1937, to &quot;[b]British Union[/b]&quot;. It was finally disbanded in 1940 after it was proscribed by the British government, following the start of the Second World War. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
