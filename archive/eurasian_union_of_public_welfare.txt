The Eurasian Union of Public Welfare (or EUPW) is an economic union between several countries with roots in public welfare debate. EUPW was founded in 1979 as an international board of economy and trade between closely positioned countries, and has since then grown into a cooperative union of politics. The union is represented by delegates from the different countries, each country&amp;#39;s number of delegates organized in a proportional representative, using population as a measuring unit.
