[color=darkblue]Welcome to [b]Olympia[/b], we are a political simulation roleplaying region; as a region, we celebrate our greatly diverse base by encouraging our members to participate in productive democracy amongst citizens as well as participating in the various event nights that we host to provide a close-knit community where everyone can relax and enjoy themselves in our blossoming community. We hope to achieve a rebirth and inspire others to become leaders and to have fun doing so. Welcome to a New Age of Olympia![/color]
