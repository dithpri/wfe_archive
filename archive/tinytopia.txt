Welcome to Tinytopia!
This region is a place of opportunity where you can contribute greatly to our region and become a distinguished member of our society.

We have recently established our very first Constitution. A new Legislative Assembly was born out of this, where you can create laws, enact treaties, and even establish new officials. Elections for our very first Assembly Head will commence shortly. I hope that you will be among those who will participate in this exciting new body.
