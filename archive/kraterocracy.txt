[b][color=purple]Greetings Battleborn,[/color]

Welcome to the [color=darkred][i]Kraterocracy[/i][/color] where constant wars will bring you merits, honor, influence, and glory.

There are three worlds which you can reside, flourish, and wage wars in. These worlds are [color=gray]Yokuda[/color],[color=blue] Philissar[/color], and [color=red]Estella[/color] which represent [color=gray]Past[/color], [color=blue]Present[/color], and [color=red]Future[/color] respectively. Each world is under the jurisdiction of the Kraterocrats with guidance from the Theocrat, messenger of [nation]The Battlemaster[/nation].

[color=red]Together we shall strive to prosperity through bloodshed. [i]Hail Victoria in all her forms! Hail the Kraterocracy![/i][/color][/b]
