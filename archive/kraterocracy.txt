[b][color=purple]Greetings Battleborn,[/color]

Welcome to the [color=darkred][i]Kraterocracy[/i][/color] where constant wars will bring you merits, honor, influence, and glory.

There are three worlds which you can reside, flourish, and wage wars in. These worlds are Yokuda, Philissar, and Estella which represent Past, Present, and Future respectively. Each world is under the jurisdiction of the Kraterocrats with guidance from the Theocrat, messenger of [nation]The Battlemaster[/nation].

[color=red]Together we shall strive to prosperity through bloodshed. [i]Hail Victoria in all her forms! Hail the Kraterocracy![/i][/color][/b]
