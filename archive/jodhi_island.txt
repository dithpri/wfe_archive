The Pacific island discovered by J&oacute;&eth;i S&iacute;gur&eth;sson and his followers in ideas, and settled by them. It has seen long years of history, and may see many more. Strangely, it looks like Poland during the 2000s. It was named J&oacute;&eth;i Island, and anglicized as Jodhi Island. It is located next to the equator, and is slightly larger in size than Hawai&#39;i island.
