The Nations Allegiance Region (NAR) is a region that is fairly new, but willing to expand.
This is a region of peace and a region where citizens have free will.
Any propositions or opinions that could affect the region are welcome to be discussed, but ultimately, it is up to the nations to decide if the said proposition is carried out.
The leading nation is the United Bacon of Pizza but if many nations express the same opinion, this can be changed through an election.
Whether you&#39;re starting out or very experienced, The Nations Allegiance Region welcomes you with open arms to be a part of this glorious strong region.
