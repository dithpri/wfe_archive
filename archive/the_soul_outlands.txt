The Soul Outlands is a large newly discovered landmass with a dark, thick, and eerie fog always surrounding it no matter the time of day or the weather overhead. The Soul Outlands inhabitants the &quot;Hollows&quot; are as strange and mystical as the land they inhabit. The founders of these lands are the Okesh Zelvainians.
