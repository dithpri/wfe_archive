Moving the entirety of our country&amp;#39;s landmass around the world via cars and catapults proved to be more than we can handle after the 37th time. So we decided to go to the moon! But apparently it was US territory. As was Mars. And the rest of the solar system.
Long story short, we just want to be alone, really. Isolationism, ho!
