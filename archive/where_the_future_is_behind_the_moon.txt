[b][i]Lets be friends and play &quot;[Mars] Total War&quot; together. I&#39;ll tell you about the coding I learned and you can tell me about your day. Don&#39;t think for one second that you&#39;re not important here.[hr][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/671690/MARS_Total_Warfare/]https://store.steampowered.com/app/671690/MARS_Total_Warfare/[/url][hr][url=https://discord.gg/w4Z824V]https://discord.gg/w4Z824V[/url][hr]When I get back I&#39;m going to fly you to the moon baby.[/i]

Plenty of other games out there, all suggestions are accepted. The other game I suggested just happens to run well cause of low graphics.[/b]
