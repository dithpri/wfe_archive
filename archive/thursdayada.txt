[b]This region is dedicated to Thor, god of lightning![/b]

Thor&amp;#39;s name is the origin of the name Thursday. By employing a practice known as interpretatio germanica during the Roman Empire period, the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar, and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own. Latin dies Iovis  was converted into Proto-Germanic &THORN;onares dagaz.
