Linux (/&amp;#712;li&amp;#720;n&amp;#650;ks/ (listen) LEE-nuuks or /&amp;#712;l&amp;#618;n&amp;#650;ks/ LIN-uuks) is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word &quot;Linux&quot; in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.
