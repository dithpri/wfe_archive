When the Theocracy of Phonexias decided to secede from the South Pacific, they declared the country to reside within the newly established region of the Risen Ashes. While others are welcomed into the region, they must follow similar politics to Phonexias. No dictatorships, strongly military minded, or conservative authoritarians are welcomed. Members of the Risen Ashes are very unlikely to join the World Assembly as they feel being forced to accept doctrines from a super powered group who don&amp;#39;t necessarily have everybody&amp;#39;s best interests in mind is detrimental to the region&amp;#39;s ultimate goal.
