This is an unforgiving land, for those whom aren&amp;#39;t residents. Here, we believe in the right for each nation to be their own and for the strong to stand above the weak. Here there is one rule; Each action has a consequence, each consequence is severe. And only those with the heart, will, and soul of a dragon may survive.
