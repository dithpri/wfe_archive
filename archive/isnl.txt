[b]the Incorporation System of Nation Leaderships[/b]
-----------------------------------------------------

The goal of this region is to incorporate international voting systems in which other nations will vote for your issues to determine the outcome.
hopefully by doing this we will achieve proper democracy in that not only the people get to vote, but the members of the ISNL vote.
The reason of this is to hopefully stop future conflicts and wars.
