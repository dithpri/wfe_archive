The Commonwealth of Independent Subjects (CIS) was established, based on the political philosophy of Manfred Cheng. Currently, the philosophical system of Manfred Cheng is far from complete, the CIS is therefore not accepting new members. Once an initial framework arises, the CIS will be open to new applications, and there will be alterations made to this entry since the CIS will cease to be a one-member region.
