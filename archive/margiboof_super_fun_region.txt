Hey this is MargiBoof! So anyway, I wanted to create a region so I could see what it was like to run one. Unfortunately, I didn&#146;t want to move from the rejected realms, where I am an honored citizen and officer, so I created MargiBouf to be the founder of this region! 

Anyone is welcome in this region, although I may eject the clone nations I create just for fun. Unless you are being a complete nuisance, I won&#146;t eject you! You can be whoever you want in this region, and do almost whatever you want! 

The only rules I have are that you can&#146;t spam, or recruit, or be an online jerk. 
Oh yeah, and to have fun! 

Have a nice day/night! :3
