[b]We of the Assembly promote the following doctrine:

[i]&quot;What we have to fight for is the necessary security for the existence and increase of our race and people, the subsistence of its children and the maintenance of our racial stock unmixed, the freedom and independence of the Fatherland; so that our people may be enabled to fulfill the mission assigned to it by the Creator.&quot;[/i] Mein Kampf

Furthermore, we recognize that each nation of our race is unique and that national uniqueness in blood, history and culture heritage must be protected and so must bring forth laws to protect each. We implore all white nations to embrace our ideals and join us in our cause
