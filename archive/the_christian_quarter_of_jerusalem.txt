Hello and welcome to Jerusalem.

Jerusalem is without a doubt, the Holiest City on Earth. From the Jews arrival brought by God after Moses parted the Red Sea and their exile in the desert, to Jesus&#39; triumphant entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, to His crucifixion just outside of its walls at Golgotha, Jerusalem is a city with great reverence amongst all Abrahamic religions.

Founded to be a (mainly) Christian region, but all are allowed.

The regional password is &quot;Christ is King&quot;.
