For centuries, the Kingdom and Dominion of Imagem were known only to each other. It was with the arrival of the community that the region came into limited contact with the world.

The three nations rub along fairly well. The Kingdom is content to cooperate provided the others take care of the local environment. Ergalim respects the autonomy of the other communities, and protects them against the influence of capital and imperialism. The priesthood will work with whomever necessary to retain their independence.
