For centuries, the Kingdom of Imagem was unknown to anyone but its neighbouring isle of cultists. It was only with the arrival of the community that the region came into contact with the wider world.

The three nations rub along fairly well. The Kingdom is content to cooperate provided the others take care of the local environment. Ergalim respects the autonomy of the other communities, and has a general affinity for all peoples (if not all rulers) of the world. The priesthood will work with whomever necessary.
