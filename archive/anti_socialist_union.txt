We are a new fascist region intended to unite all fascist nations together.


[b]Regional Anthem[/b]
Sneaking up on the reds
They wish nothing but death
Our region shall stand tall
and never, ever fall

March on! My comrades!
Fight, the ones who want equality
Our God gave us only strength and morality

Wave the flag high
The one of the Third Reich
Our region shall stand tall
and never, ever fall

March on! My comrades!
Fight, the ones who want equality
Our God gave us only strength and morality

Watching them forever
They invade our sovereign land
Our region shall stand tall
and never, ever fall
