Our region is a self-sufficient one, and we wish most of our members wouldn&#39;t join the WA so we freely do all the work ourselves. We wish for our members to maintain their nation in strict(not oppressive!) rules which prohibit offensive policies like fascism, nudity, LGBT, etc. We hope there&#39;re many of you and your comrades who would like to support the conservative, nation-saving community of my region, The Conservative Ones.
See ya!
Regards,
Conservatist State of Leonus
