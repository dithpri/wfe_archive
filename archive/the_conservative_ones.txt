&quot;Our region is an internationalist one, and we wish most of our members would join the WA so we cooperate with other regions. We wish for our members to maintain their nation in few rules which allow undeniable rights like abortion, homosexuality and gender transition etc. We hope there&#39;re many of you and your comrades who would like to destroy the conservative, nation-hating community of my region, The Conservative Ones.
See ya!
Regards,
Conservatist State of Leonus&quot;
