Greetings,
Welcome to the Hadera Confederacy. Feel free to visit our regional [url=http://s13.zifboards.com/Hadera_Confederacy/index.php]Forum[/url] and view the [url=http://s13.zifboards.com/Hadera_Confederacy/index.php?showtopic=3]regional constitution[/url] and regional policy.

While the Founder is committed to Judeo-Christian values, all nations are welcome. Please see [url=http://s13.zifboards.com/Hadera_Confederacy/index.php?showtopic=5]Declaration of Regional Values[/url] for further elaboration.

Please note that the Hadera Confederacy is a World Assembly-free region. A WA Delegate is not permitted to represent this region though WA member nations are not prohibited from residing here so long as they do not give WA endorsements or seek them. The reasoning for this can be found in the [url=http://s13.zifboards.com/Hadera_Confederacy/index.php?showtopic=3]regional constitution[/url].
