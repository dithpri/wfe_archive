This region will function as a meeting point for regions that share similar anti-lily views, as well as being a place of residence for individual nations that share these views.

[b][color=purple][i]Work in progress, please come back later[/i][/color][/b]

[b][color=darkblue]Currently:[/color][/b] Writing various things that will be used by this organisation, such as a peace treaty etc.

[b][color=darkblue]Embassies:[/color][/b] Will not be accepted unless I&#39;ve contacted you personally. You&#39;ll probably need to sign some kind of treaty later if you want to keep it, once I&#39;ve sorted that.
