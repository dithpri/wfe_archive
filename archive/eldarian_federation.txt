A Steampunk-themed alternate dimension taking place on the world of Eldaria, where true lovers of the Steampunk genre can come and wage war against each other in peace. Be prepared for roleplay, and frequent conversations. We are currently busy creating a map for the region, and all descriptions for your nation should be sent to [nation]Urtu[/nation], the map can&amp;#39;t be made until all nations submit their information.  We have survived a (brief) nuclear war, alien invasion, and the zombie apocalypse, we are strong.
