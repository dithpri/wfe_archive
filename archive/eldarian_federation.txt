We are the Eldarian Federation, we have just repelled an attack by the black riders, and no serious damage was done.  Due to this insurrection, a password has been placed on the region.  All new members must message the delegate to get permission to enter.  For further security of the region, all suspected black riders (or other invaders) will be ejected...any known to be attempting another coup...will be [u]ejected and banned[/u].

We are a role playing region that tends to engage in frequent conversations, and an unusual hatred of Limburger cheese.
