We are the Eldarian Federation, we have just repelled an attack by the black riders, and no serious damage was done.  Due to this insurrection, a password has been placed on the region.  All new members must message the delegate to get permission to enter.

We are a role playing region that tends to engage in frequent conversations, and an unusual hatred of Limburger cheese.
