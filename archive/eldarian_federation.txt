A Steampunk-themed alternate dimension taking place on the world of Eldaria, where true lovers of the Steampunk genre can come and wage war against each other in peace. Be prepared for roleplay, and frequent conversations. We are also an alliance of small regions to defend against larger regions, and member regions can be seen below.  We have survived a (brief) nuclear war, alien invasion, and the zombie apocalypse, we are strong.
