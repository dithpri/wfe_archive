     Located across the ocean and through the three rivers, a continent is born. The natives of this land have welcomed strangers for thousands of years, assuming they survive the journey. Not yet fully explored, the region is continuing to grow. Many of us are environmentally conscious countries. Yinzeria prides itself on diversity and is home to a wide variety of nations. We are a peaceful region yet one to be reckoned with.
