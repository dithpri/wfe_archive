[b]Welcome to Yinzeria! [/b]

     Located across the ocean and through the lost sea, a continent is born. The natives of this land have welcomed strangers for thousands of years, assuming they survive the journey. Not yet fully explored, the region is currently home to 15 resident nations. We are a peaceful region yet one to be reckoned with. 

*The Black Hawks &amp; their affiliates are not welcomed here.
