     Located across the ocean and through the three rivers, a continent is born. The natives of this land have welcomed strangers for thousands of years, assuming they survive the journey. Not yet fully explored, the region is currently home to 16 resident nations. Many of us are environmentally conscious countries. We also focus towards nudity! We are a peaceful region yet one to be reckoned with. 

[Color=purple]&#149;Almost all are welcome here! We don&#39;t accept raiders or intolerance.[/color]

[Color=maroon]&#149;The Black Hawks &amp; their affiliates are not welcomed here.[/color]
