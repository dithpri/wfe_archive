On November 11, 1111, Treciene was founded by Yvelen Vagazoan. After many years of fighting he has claimed this country for over 100,000 people. Yvelen Became Yvelen I, working hard to keep our nation thriving. We have fought through many wars, installed democracy, and created a better environment for the now 500 million people in our country. Anyways, we would like to say welcome to the Sovereign Constitutional Empire of Treciene, ruled with the great power of freedom and home of the Ross Shapekid series. This region welcomes all with open arms and hopes to become the best region in the world! We hope that you stay long and have a good time in our region, and remember that Nationstates rules still apply here!
