Four thousand and 26 years ago the world was united under one banner.  This banner belonged to the Married Nations of Earth. However several of the nations started gambling, a few drinking, and others smoking. It created an unhealthy relationship as the ones who didn&#39;t participate in such activities were being affected by this. So nine hundred days ago the world had a legal divorce and now stands as The Divorced Nations of Earth.
Not to be confused with the United Nations of Earth or the Divided Nations of Earth.
