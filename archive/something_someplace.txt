[color=magenta]Something someplace[/color] is a new, small region, a region of [color=gold]peace[/color], [color=cyan]democracy[/color] and [color=green]anti-discrimination[/color]. A place of unity of humanity and simply put, [color=red]equality[/color]. [color=orange]Conservatives and right-wingers[/color] are allowed here but please be respectful about your views. On the off chance that someone actually sees this crappy region and joins it, endorse me if you happen to be in the World Assembly.
