Welcome to Rostil, an MT/Light Fantasy RPing region based around an original planet and solar system located in the Pinwheel Galaxy. As Rostil is an RPing region we are not at all interested in raiding/defending and recruiters for other regions are unwelcome. Rostilian nations range from constitutional republics to fascist dictatorships and even completely original governments.

Rostil is a Direct Democracy, every region-mate gets a vote on regional issues.
