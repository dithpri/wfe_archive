[color=red][b]Our Comrades [region]Syndicated Red Black Tendencies[/region], who are now part of [region]The Internationale[/region], seized and confiscated the Nazi region &amp;#39;[region]Blood and Honor[/region]&amp;#39; in the name of Anti-Fascism and Anti-Nazism some time ago, but then it got us thinking: What if the Nazis and Fascists try and regroup and found a region named &amp;#39;[region]Blood and Honour[/region]&amp;#39; as a replacement?[/color][/b]

[b]Heh. No chance of that now. [region]Blood and Honour[/region]&amp;#39;s been seized by [region]The Internationale[/region], and it will be an anti-fascist and anti-nazi region also, denying the hate-mongers another platform for their hate.[/b]
