We are an International of Socialist Republics dedicated to the establishment of a worldwide proletarian revolution to overthrow Capitalism and establish world Communism through the methods of implementing radical reform in the World Assembly and proletarian internationalism to intensify the class struggle and to bring other Socialist nations to the cause of fighting for World Communism! 

Fascists, Capitalists, and anti-Communist/anti-Marxist Leninist nations will be banned from this International Organization if their tendency is not re-oriented to Socialism/Communism within 3 days along with nations who have a public sector economy of less than 60%.
