In the recent years, our livelihood, our rights, our ideas, and speeches are being suppressed by governments who want to control every part of life. But not here. In Freelandia, you are obligated to live your country the way you want, with the chance of little or no intervention, as long as your nation is free as well. If not, you go bye-bye.
