[colour=#651C32][b]Did you know, if you noclip while in the Fujishima Megacity, you&#39;ll end up in that city&#39;s version of the Backrooms? There lies the HQ of Suzuhara Industries, whom sent an expedition to forcefully noclip locations to bring under control. Despite the Major Explorer Group doing their best to combat against Lulu Suzuhara and her forces, several areas were successfully absorbed, now unrecognizable from what they once were. This experiment was overall a success, and Lulu will be back soon...[/b][/colour]
