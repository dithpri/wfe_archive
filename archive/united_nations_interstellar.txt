United Nation Interstellar was founded in April 5, 2041 after the fall of United Nations in September 24, 2030. United States, Japan, and Ukraine founded the Organization. It was located in New York. The Soviet Russians doesn&#39;t like that idea and doesn&#39;t want to join it. They want to destroy it. Join us the UNI to explore some space and stars. Our Navy will set things up.
