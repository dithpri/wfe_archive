[color=red]At the Casa de hidalgos Tea House we offer a variety of beverages to suit all , and unlike bars we are a tranquil and relaxing place where there is no fighting , bad language , or distasteful people allowed , if you don&#39;t wish to have a cup of tea feel free to lounge around , lightly flirt , or enjoy one of our many activities.[/color]
