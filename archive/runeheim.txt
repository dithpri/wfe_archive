Welcome to the World of Runeheim, an alternate version of the wretched world Zyphius was ejected from.

Anthros, humans, reptilians, and other species are welcome.
By the way, all racists, occultists, and scientists are also welcome here.
[color=red]Invasions are impossible.[/color]
There shall be no nations in the World Assembly, no WA Delegates, no WA members. We are password-protected. Want to enter? ASK [nation=short+noflag]Zyphius[/nation].

Notice to all: You may be allowed to curse, but only limited to 1 curse word per message.

Enjoy your stay, mortals! BWAHAHAHAAA!
