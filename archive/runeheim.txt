Welcome to the World of Runeheim, an alternate version of the wretched world Zyphius was ejected from.

Anthros, humans, reptilians, and other species are welcome.
By the way, all racists, occultists, and scientists are also welcome here.

There shall be no nations in the World Assembly, no WA Delegates, no WA members. We are password-protected.

Notice to all: You may be allowed to curse, but only limited to 12 curse words per telegram.

Enjoy your stay, mortals! BWAHAHAHAAA!
