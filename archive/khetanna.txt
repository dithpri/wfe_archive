[i]&amp;quot;A Hutt without a sail barge is like a smoke moth without wings.&amp;quot;[/i]

Welcome to the [b][color=brown]Khetanna[/color][/b]. Formally under the ownership of [b][color=grey]Jabba the Hutt[/color][/b], this luxury sail barge now sits forever parked over the [b][color=green]Great Pit of Carkoon[/color][/b]. Please keep your hands and feet inside the Khetanna at all times or risk falling into the pit where you&amp;#39;ll be digested slowly by a [b][color=red]Sarlacc[/color][/b] for over a thousand years. 

Upon attaining delegacy feel free to add a rule.
