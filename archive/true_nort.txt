True Nort is the result of the great nation of Trollheimgard&#39;s succesion of Up Nort. Trollheimgard was not to be undermined as a mere supporter in the reigion of Up Nort so A NEW ALLIANCE came from the smoldering hatred of the undermined Trollheimgardian people and CORVO ODONSON began the march of leadership and independance for Trollheimgard in the True Nort!
