[color=0073CF][b]Greetings and welcome to The Commonwealth of Democratic Republics![/b][/color]

We are a cozy and small community of [color=yellow](more or less)[/color] democratic republics!
[hr]
If you are a democracy of any kind, preferably a republic, you are welcome in this delightful [color=0073CF]commonwealth![/color]

We are quite new, however, so we are yet to set up forums or discord servers or anything of the like. Do, however, feel free to introduce yourself in the [color=yellow]Regional Message Board![/color]

If you have any questions, you can always ask a question in the [color=yellow]RMB[/color] or send a telegram to [nation=long]Viryta[/nation], the founder of our fair Commonwealth.
