Waiting for the whistle, a pistol Waiting for a sign in the line on a target like a missile Waiting for the go, for the big show Laying out the wire, light the fire Now we&amp;#39;re waiting till it blows.  Fight like you&amp;#39;ll never die Fight to stay alive Fight to raise the crown Fight to take them down Fight like you&amp;#39;re gods and monsters Because you want to To save a life Fight for you and I.
-Fight, All Good Things.
