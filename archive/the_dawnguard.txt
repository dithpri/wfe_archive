To those that are tired of being alone and in darkness.  Those that have been taken for granted or used like a pawn in someone else&amp;#39;s world.  Those that want something real, the dawn begins anew.  We follow the footsteps of those that went on before us, in hopes of a brighter future.  We will guard those that went on till dawn.
