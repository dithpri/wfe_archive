Two of the most powerful kingdoms of the early modern era, France and Spain fought a 24-year war (the Franco-Spanish War) until the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. The treaty was signed on the Pheasant Island between the two nations, which has since been a condominium, changing its allegiances each six months. On 19th of December 2016 the two countries founded a politico-economic union named Franco-Spanish Union to strengthen the relationship and economy of the two countries. It has an area of 1,149,791 km2 and an estimated population of over 113 million.
