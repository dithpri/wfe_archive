This region has been liberated by the Interregional Defence Pact.

To the founder of this region I am sorry that so much damage has been done to your region also if you want some more information on what happened or would like support in rebuilding your region contact [nation]Tanoai[/nation] or [nation]Region Tanoai[/nation] also once you become active just dismiss the IDP defence assistant since you will no longer need it. I would have put your regions flag up on the banner but you did not have one so I just put the defence pact star and read the factbook below on security recommendations for your region.
