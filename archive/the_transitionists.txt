A puppet storage region of really no importance. The majority of the puppets belong to the founder, which is me, but quite a few aren&#39;t. 

Also, please note that we reserve the right to eject or banject anybody for any reason.

Oh, and by the way, this region sucks for any R/D missions because it updates a mere 9 minutes after the update starts. You should take note of that if you decide to dump your puppets here. For a relatively late-updating region, go to [region]Try 2[/region], which is operated by me.
