[b][i]The bright sun was made brighter, and the stars
[color=blue]Did shine sparkling in the eternal space,[/color]
Strenghtened, and traveled, and the heartened earth
[color=blue]Swung strong and joyful in the crystal air;[/color]
Sun came and went&#151;and came, and brought the day,
[color=blue]And men renewed their passions in the light[/color]
Of this their exaltation; and all hearts
[color=blue]Were warmed by their selfless prayer of light:[/color]
And they did live in their cities&#151;and the thrones,
[color=blue]The palace of their crowned king&#151;the homes,[/color]
The abodes of the merry populace,
[color=blue]Shined with their great pride; cities were aglow,[/color]
And men were gather&#39;d round their shining homes
[color=blue]To share in their unity, pride, and grace.[/color]
No sadness could be seen, nor happiness lost,
[color=blue]For the [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]foe[/url] was beaten [/color]
And darkness quelled by the sun.[/i][/b]
