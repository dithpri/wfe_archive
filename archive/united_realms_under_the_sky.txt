The United Realms Under The Sky (URUTS) is a beginning region where everyone has a voice. 

If you want to engage in politics send a telegram to the minister of elections. Then get voted on in the next election poll! Depending on your office you could organize elections, declare wars, beautify the region, or create role playing games, polls, and anything else you can think of.

If you just want have fun, no problem! Have fun chatting away in the message board and participating in our minister&#39;s wars, elections, RPGs, and polls!

Note: As I am currently the only member of this region I hold all of the elected offices. As soon as another nation joins the URUTS elections will commence.
