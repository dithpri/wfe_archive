Flevoland is the 12th and youngest province of the Netherlands, established in 1986, when the southern and eastern Flevopolders were merged into one provincial entity. 
It is located in the centre of the country, where the Zuiderzee was previously located. Almost all of the land belonging to Flevoland was reclaimed only in the 1950s and 1960s. 
By land area, it is the smallest province of the Netherlands at 1,412 km2 (545 sq mi), but not by total area as that includes much of the waters of the Markermeer and IJsselmeer. 
The province has a population of 423,021 as of January 2020 and consists of six municipalities. Its capital is Lelystad and its most populous city is Almere.
