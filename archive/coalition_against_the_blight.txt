[b]In War, Flight. In Peace, Gossip. In Death, Flaming.[/b]

This wretched monument of Pretender hate has been cleansed by steel and fire. Darkspawn everywhere cower and flee at the sight of our glorious arms.

Join the fight against the Pretender menace by signing up here!

[i]Blessed are they who stand before
The corrupt and the wicked and do not falter.
Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just.[/i]
