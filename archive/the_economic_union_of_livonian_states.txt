We are a group of nations linguistically similar and culturally similar, we have been united time and time again in history, during 1366 the first Duchy in modern day Livonian Order Of The Syn was created. In 1457 The Livonian Order formed, inspired by our ancestors (The Teutonic knights) they created a union with equallity and religious freedom, in 1801 the Russians invaded our homeland, annexing Modern day Syn. In 1807 they finished us off by annexing us as a whole, creating our modern alphabet although, Syn keeps the old alphabet that dates back to the Teutonic Order along with Sordica.
