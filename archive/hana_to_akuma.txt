Meaning &amp;quot;Flower to Demons&amp;quot; in Japanese, this is a region where anyone is welcome, be their government good or wicked. My government is evil, but not corrupt and war is not popular in Hana to Akuma--conflicts remain in one nation, not to spread in all the region. We welcome you to this glorious land.
