The Kattowitz Pact was signed shortly after the fall of a unified Hungary and the declaration of an independent Slezania. 
It was first signed by Prime Minister Gutek of the Incorporated States of Slezania and Governor Daniel of the United Socialist States of Transdanubium. 
The Regional Council is located in Kattolov, and the Security Council is located in Veszpr&eacute;m. 
The aim of this pact is to make trade between the nations untaxed and easier and to improve the relations between the member states.
