A planet orbiting a dead star, with a moon. The planet itself is a lush paradise approximately three times the size of the earth. The planet is separated into five continents: One in the north, and the two continents connected to it (like the americas), one small island continent (like australia), and one massive continent on the other side of the planet. The massive continent is completely barren save for agricultural fields and wastelands, with one quarter of it being taken up entirely by one large city.

The moon is inhabited by a fledgeling colony, and the continent resembling Australia is home to a civilization comprised entirely of hardcore gamers.
