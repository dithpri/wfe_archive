A new faction born of the shadows. All players are welcome. Being that this is a small group, your voice counts MORE in regional and even general assembly votes. 

Until we rise in number, the region will be very simple. I will vote based on the results of a majority vote carried out here in the region. You don&#39;t have to vote! As i&#39;m sure we all know, voting is a right not a duty. If that&#39;s not you&#39;re cup of tea or you just don&#39;t wanna vote, feel free to not vote. Let&#39;s all build our nations together! :)

Ask questions, give advice. We rise together. 

I hope you consider joining me despite our current size.
