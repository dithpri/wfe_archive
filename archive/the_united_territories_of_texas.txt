The United Territories of Texas was founded by The Commonwealth of Peterbiltonia, to escape from a controlling, pro-World Assembly region. (Peterbiltonia is kind enough to not name names, but you know who you are) You are invited, encouraged, and welcomed to move to The United Territories of Texas. Thank you for reading, and we hope to see you soon.
