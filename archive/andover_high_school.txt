Welcome. If you&#39;re new to NS, here&#39;s some tips to help you get started:

1. Change your telegram settings so your inbox doesn&#39;t get flooded with recruitment telegrams. 
    Go to this link --&amp;gt; https://www.nationstates.net/page=tgsettings, and then check &quot;Block All&quot; for Recruitment

2. If you have general questions about this game, ask the Advisor of this region: [nation]Golden Warriors[/nation]

3. If you want to, you can join the world assembly. Once you do that, you are eligible to become delegate of this region (and hold executive power). You can also endorse/vote for someone else to become delegate (or, add your endorsement for the Advisor, [nation]Golden Warriors[/nation]).

4. To start a new region, click on this link --&amp;gt; https://www.nationstates.net/page=change_region, and select &quot;Found a New Region&quot; to get started.
