Welcome to United Unithonia, NationStates newest invader military, we have 3 different branches of military, Army, Air Force and Navy. The army is responsible for sending nations into the region currently being raided. The Air Force will provide support for the puppet regions, and replace them in the event of nations being kicked/banned. The Navy will be the defense force, preventing other regions from invading us. The WA Delegate will be also considered Commander of The Army, while the previous WA will be appointed as a DO (Deployment Officer). DO is in charge of finding weak nations. Commander Elections happen once every week, but the leader may override outcome.
