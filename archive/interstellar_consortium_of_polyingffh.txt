The Interstellar Consortium of Polyingffh, also known as simply Polyingffh or the Consortium, was a decentralized federal union between various alien civilizations that collectively controlled 65 star systems across the Orion-Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way alongside countless other unincorporated stellar territories. At the Consortium&#39;s peak, it boasted a total population of 1.2 trillion intelligent lifeforms from a total of 24 intelligent alien species. However, it was ultimately conquered by the Imperial Kingdom of Kaywell.
