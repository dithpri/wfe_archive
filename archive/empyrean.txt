[b]Empyrean[/b], from the Medieval Latin [i]empyreus[/i] meaning &amp;quot;in the fire,&amp;quot; was once a world of immense beauty and inconceivable potential. With the outbreak of war amongst its constituents, however, the world was left barren and desolate. Now merely shadows of their former glory, the countries of Empyrean and their respective denizens reside among the ruins of their ancient empires of old.
