[b][color=darkorange]Welcome to Ainur![/color][/b]

Not even a week in and the liberation is going swimmingly! Big shout out to returning natives Ponderosa and Emrys, who saw the 7-5 name and didn&#39;t even need to be asked to help with endorsments!

The will of old Ainur will not be denied! This historic region stands to once again become a name worth knowing in NS!!
