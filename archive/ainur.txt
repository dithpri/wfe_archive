[color=purple]EVERYONE REMAIN CALM. There has been a minor mishap with the Zombie problem we have tried to contain for so long in the nation of Eldarion Telcontar. DO NOT FEAR. Everyone should go to http://www.nationstates.net/page=zombie_control and choose the second option: investing in a cure. Do NOT export the Zombies. Do NOT attempt to kill them. That will only result in more needless death. We owe it to our countrymen to invest in a cure.[/b][/color]
