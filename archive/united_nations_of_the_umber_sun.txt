A diverse and stunning region located on a continent who&#39;s waters are turquoise and who&#39;s earth is a deep umber color. The region is made up of dozens of small countries with close political ties to one another. The people of the Umber are as warm as the sun which they walk beneath and despite speaking a plethora of languages and dialects, value their diversity and individuality yet also bask in the knowledge that together they are stronger than divided.
