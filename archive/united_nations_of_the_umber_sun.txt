Welcome to the United Nations of the Umber Sun!

A diverse and stunning region located on a continent who&#39;s waters are turquoise and who&#39;s earth is a deep umber color. The people of the Umber are as warm as the sun which they walk beneath and despite speaking a plethora of languages and dialects, value their diversity and individuality yet also bask in the knowledge that together they are stronger than divided.

Here in the U.N.U.S. we have an optional economy, auction system, roleplay both regional and national, a fully fledged regional map and more!
