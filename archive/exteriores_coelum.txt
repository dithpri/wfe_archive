We are soldiers without borders. We have no regional allegiances, no exterior loyalties, and no cause other than our own. No agendas, no anthems, no pledges. 

There is only [i]Exteriores Coelum[/i], [b]Outer Heaven[/b].

And there is only the mission and the money.

[b]PLEDGE[/b] &#147;I [Insert Name], swear off all loyalties, titles, benefits, and all other perks and benefits of my past life. I dedicate my new life as a soldier of [i]Exteriores Coelum[/i] to The General and his vision. I am a soldier, mercenary, and outcast.&#148;
