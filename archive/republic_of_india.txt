India, officially the [b]Republic of India[/b], is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people). Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Bangladesh. 

Home to the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation and a region of historic trade routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for much of its long history. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism&#151;originated here. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
