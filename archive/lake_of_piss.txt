[b][color=blue]The Three Freedoms of the Lake of Piss[/b][/color]
[color=green]Freedom of Speech[/color]
The right to freedom of speech is held sacrosanct, even if a nation makes disparaging remarks about the region. No posts will be suppressed on the message board.
[color=green]Freedom of Movement[/color]
If a nation feels it necessary, they may be allowed to secede if they so wish. No action will be taken against them, and they will be welcomed back if they chose to reconsider.
[color=green]Democratic Freedoms[/color] 
Democracy means fair and free elections. Corruption and conspiracy are not tolerated. As legitamately elected, the Delegate is effectively the PM. (Gristleby the Monarch.)
