A lake of grimey piss situated in deepest darkest yorkenshire, shrouded in a rancid green mist hiding the serene republic of gristleby from view. 

1. God save our Lake of Piss
Long live our Lake of Piss
God save the Piss
Send it to it&amp;#39;s grimey sea
Happy and glorious
Long to smell over us
God save the Piss
2. O Lord our God arise
Scatter it&amp;#39;s faecal vaporise
And make them fall
Confound their stools
Frustrate their knavish pricks
On Thee our hopes we fix
God save our piss
3. Thy choicest from penis&amp;#39;s soar
On her be pleased to pour
Long may it reign
May it defend our laws
And ever give us cause 
To sing with heart and voice
God save the Piss
