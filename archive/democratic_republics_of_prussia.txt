[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] try some new circus tricks. 

Cards up the sleeve, and sawing something in half just wouldn&#39;t cut it. [color=blue]But how about vanishing and magically appearing somewhere else?[/color]

The hawks thought that might be interesting, and decided to try all sorts of things to make each other vanish and reappear!

The first thing to vanish was endorsements, which magically appeared again in your region! The second, was a [color=yellow]pineapple[/color], which never returned.

If you find our pineapple, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]please return it to us![/url]
