[color=darkgreen][b]Puppets Everywhere[/b][/color][hr][color=red]This region is participating in a version of the game NSEmbassy Oracle, where the goal is to create a string of embassy links forming a chain well in excess of 1,000 degrees of separation from [region=United States of America] to [region=Western District]. Unfortunately, Embassy offers and rejected embassies counts as a real embassy in this game, as a result all offers needs to be aborted for the game to no longer register them as an embassy -- all embassies accepted are just the two that link this region to [region=Central Africa] and [region=Surrey][/color]
