As the year starts in 2010, the continent of Inconentia has been officially recognized by the world. The region is new, people still forming their nations and their governments to lead them. As for the direction of this, who knows. War or peace, alliance or coalition, rival or friend. It is up to the nations to decide.

Welcome to Inconentia! A new continent established by the World Assembly (just in lore) as a way to maintain peace in the region. Countries have abandoned their colonies and protectorates, letting the people who remain decide their fates. Discord is currently in the making!
