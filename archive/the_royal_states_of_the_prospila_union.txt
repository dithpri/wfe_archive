The Prospila Union is a governing body that pursues economic growth, protection, and cooperation from its many diverse states. Each state has full autonomy on any issues not proposed and ratified by the Union. Leaders of the Union are elected from the member states.

In future, the Prospila Union seeks to spread it influence to the World Assembly and seek a new order of its own by adding more to its union, for security of course.
