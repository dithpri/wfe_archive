[i][color=magenta]My expectation is that we will solve the problem. With just a matter of time, it&#146;s just a matter of strategy. Why do I say that this is the case? Well it&#146;s because I think solutions come from evolution. It comes from asking the right questions, because the answer preexists, but it&#146;s the question that we have to define and discover.[/i][/color]
