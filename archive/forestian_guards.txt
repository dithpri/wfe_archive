[color=ffcc00][b]This beautiful core world is a little niche of land covered in tall, majestic trees and fed by a small pond and several running streams. Inside the dip of land lays the first of Avalar&#146;s castles, surrounded by a small rampart and large pillars, as well as grassy forests. This world is constantly stuck in Summer, making it the hottest of the core worlds in Avalar![/b][/color][hr][color=009933][b][u]Regional Links[/u]
