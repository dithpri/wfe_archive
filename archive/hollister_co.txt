
HOLLISTER CO, We have a Society that we all know
But there&#39;s something in our DNA
That socialists can never measure, that imperialists can never weigh

We got the girls and boys in power factor in that
We pull together, &#39;cause we&#39;re a perfect match
We stand as one,
We got the tools,
We&#39;re pulling it together and we&#39;re tearing up all the raids

We got a friendship that&#39;s unique to us
We come together in a way nobody else does
We work it work it &#39;cause we&#39;re building A dream dream dream
(We work our region like Billionaires)

We got The Muslims on our side and we got the Kiwis to lead
We got this region made so you understand
But there is something in our region
That the Girls are gonna get that the Boys are gonna play
