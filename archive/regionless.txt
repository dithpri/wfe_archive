For People who want to act like they&#39;re in a region, when they&#39;re not.

A region for people who do not wish to be in a region. It shall be Regionless. In Regionless, you can talk on RMBs with like-minded people, and you can have diplomacy with whoever you want. So basically, we act as if we&#39;re in a region, but pretend we&#39;re not!
