For People who want to act like they&#39;re in a region, when they&#39;re not

I have create a region for people who do not wish to be in a region. I shall it Regionless. In regionless, you can talk on RMBs with like-minded people, you can create embassies with like minded people, and you can have diplomacy with whoever you want. So basically, act as is if we&#39;re in a region, but pretend we&#39;re not! No recruitment or raiding please
