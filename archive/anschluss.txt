[b][i]The unification of Germany excluded Austria and the German Austrians from the Prussian-dominated German Empire in 1871. The German Empire lasted until the November Revolution in 1918, when the German Reich changed its form of government from a monarchy to a social democratic republic. The &#39;Weimar&#39;  Republic was ended with the March 1933 election of the National-Socialist Party and subsequent joining of Austria into Germany on 12 March 1938.
