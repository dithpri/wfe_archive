Europas Pakt (Europe&#39;s Pact) is a region for all the various European nations which follow the ideologies of National Socialism, Fascism, Falangism, and other third-position ideologies. We strive to show the merits of our governmental systems and to improve the health and happiness of our societies through policies from either &#39;side&#39; of the political landscape.
