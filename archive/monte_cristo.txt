[b][colour=blue] [i][u]Welcome to [region]Monte Cristo[/region][/u][/i][/colour][/b]

[region]Monte Cristo[/region] is a region. Not just any region. We offer [b][u]MANY[/u][/b] things. We offer role play, a regional army, a Christian service and an active, fun community! We are built on the core beliefs of a well-run society.

What separates us from the others? Because we are ban appealing and don&#146;t just care about the number of people here. We recruit because we want more people to experience [region]Monte Cristo[/region].
