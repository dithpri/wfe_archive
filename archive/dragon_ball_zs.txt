Popo (Leader): Mr. Popo (or Popo if you&amp;#39;d prefer, though I wouldn&amp;#39;t call me that if I were you)
Kami (2nd in command): 20 Dragon Riders
Popo&amp;#39;s Stool (ambassador):

pecking order: you &amp;gt;the dirt &amp;gt;the worms inside of the dirt &amp;gt;popo&amp;#39;s stool &amp;gt;Kami &amp;gt;Popo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome everyone; There&amp;#39;s just one rule so far and that is: Listen to Mr.Popo and you&amp;#39;ll be fine. (anyone who knows what that&amp;#39;s from gets a cookie and a cake) lol

But in all seriousness, this is a new region and we&amp;#39;ll have fun here, anyone (except bronies) are aloud in. So, welcome to Dragon Ball ZS. This is meant to be sort of like a ___ region (free pizza for whoever knows what I replaced with underlines)
