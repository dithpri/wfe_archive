Popo (Leader): Mr. Popo (or Popo if you&#39;d prefer, though I wouldn&#39;t call me that if I were you)
Kami (2nd in command): Frieza
Popo&#39;s Stool (ambassador): Goku

pecking order: you =&amp;gt;the dirt =&amp;gt;the worms inside of the dirt =&amp;gt;popo&#39;s stool =&amp;gt;Kami =&amp;gt;Popo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome everyone; There&#39;s just one rule so far and that is: Listen to Mr.Popo and you&#39;ll be fine. (anyone who knows what that&#39;s from gets a cookie and a cake) lol

But in all seriousness, this is a new region and we&#39;ll have fun here, anyone (except bronies) are aloud in. So, welcome to Dragon Ball ZS. This is meant to be sort of like a ___ region (free pizza for whoever knows what I replaced with underlines)
