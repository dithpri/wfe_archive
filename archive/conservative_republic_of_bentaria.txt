All nations must comply to the laws created by the Senate
Each nation will send 1 delegate to the Senate for every 1 million people in their country. If you are not a full member, you get 1 delegate for every 50 million in your country. Colonies get 1 delegate for every 150 million. 

In order for you country to be a full member of the Republic, you must reach certain guidelines. The decisions made by the Senate should never compromise a countries ability to meet those guidelines. Any country that falls out of grace with these guidelines will be given 5 days to fix it, or lose full membership status. 

The Republic Senate will elect a leadership committee shortly. More information to come.
