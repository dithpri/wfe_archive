After facing mass destruction across their region after extreme partying over two amazing promotions, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] needed a new ball room for their [i]masqueraid[/i]. Time was running out, so the Hawks left their [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]nest[/url] to venture across NationStates to hold their masqueraid! Chandeliers were shattered, and pianos somehow crashed through multiples windows. Yet the Hawks wanted to pay for the damages, but they had given all of their money to Zizou for a debt about tomato sauce and stained tatami. The Hawks decided to just head on home to play with adorable kittens while drinking some nice tea with each other.
