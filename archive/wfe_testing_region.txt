[color=blue]LWU decided to pay a visit to this lovely region, with the full consent of the founder, upon reception of a Telegram inviting us to join them. Well, we are not about to join them, but we certainly paid them a visit! The generous donation of stamps as recompense is appreciated, but unfortunately one does not simply recruit from LWU and walk away. In the future, please refrain from this behavior, as it is both annoying and unmerited. With all of our sincerity, the lovable rogues from Lone Wolves United.[/color]
