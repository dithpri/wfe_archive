Due to the enormous size of the star Omega the area around it that may host planets with decent enough conditions for life is enormous as well.

This means that the number of life suitable planets is growing as new explore missions are sent.

The few that settle these planets must attempt to hold claim to the orders they establish on them.

The first planet settled was what leading scientist claim was the 20th planet closest to the star Omega of the planets within the habitable zone.  This planet was named Anubis and is a mild to hot desert planet with few lakes and rivers.

New settlers may wish to settle a new planet before attempting to dominate a particular established one.

Welcome to the Omega System.
