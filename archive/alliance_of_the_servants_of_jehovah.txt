The Alliance of the Servants of Jehovah (ASJ) is an alliance made for Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses and people who respect the organization.
Please remember that the things that occur in this region are fictitious and in no way represent the real organization of Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, or its affiliates. We are simply a region that caters to any JWs who enjoy this game.

Our dispatches contain our regional regulations, as well as the Bible for important principles.

Join us, and you will be an all-powerful member of the society of people who value God&#39;s word and holy name.

Embassies welcomed with open arms.
