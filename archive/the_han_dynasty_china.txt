We shall restore order to China and bring it under its rightful ruler. Sure, We will but not in the hands of foreign occupiers! May the Blade shine forever bright!

P.S: To any Defenders in pursuit of the Lone Wolves, It&#39;s not exactly what you think. We were actually invited here by the region&#39;s last active nation &amp; they requested me to ban your forces just to preserve the peace. As for the fugitive you were hunting, as long as he&#39;s within our territory, we&#39;ll deal with Rocoth ourselves.
