[b]Kotachia is a roleplaying region. We use modern tech. This is not a completely serious region, nor is it human-only. Most races (unless they are a godmod) are allowed. If you are unsure about whether or not something is considered godmodding, contact the regional founder. While we are not completely serious, base your technologies and such on that what could potentially exist in real life. No fantasy or future tech, please. Alternatively, you do not have to take part in roleplaying, and can simply be a member of the community.
