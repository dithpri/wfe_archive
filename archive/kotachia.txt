Kotachia is an active roleplaying region. We are not completely serious, nor are we human-only. Most races (unless they are a godmod) are allowed. If you are unsure about whether or not something is considered godmodding, contact the regional founder. While we are not completely serious, base your technologies and such on that what could potentially exist in real life. No fantasy or future tech, please. We use modern tech.
