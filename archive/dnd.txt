This region is the NationStates home for fans of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a table-top roleplaying game (TTRPG) created Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in 1974. 

The game is currently on it&#39;s 5th edition, known as DnD 5e, with the next generation in development. 

[b]NOTE: This region is designed to be a place to discuss DnD, world-build, and have fun! All are welcome![/b]
