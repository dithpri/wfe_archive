Seasteads are independent nations that hold their &quot;land&quot; on floating platforms, allowing any group of people to form a new experiment in governance provided they are willing to take part in this &#39;experiment&#39; in lifestyle.
It might seem like a risky venture, but don&#39;t worry - the Federation of DARFF subsidizes seasteads with technology and security, and provides all seasteads choosing to participate in the DARFF program with some okay-ish land they can retreat to.

Your island nation shrinking into the ocean due to rising sea levels? join the seasteads and we will give you the technology to rebuild yourself.

DARFF is also working on a space program, for those who really seek the ultimate frontier - stay tuned for that!
