Home to the lost ready to be found once more!! Rising from the ashes to become pristine once more. We are the first, the last, the beginning, the end. We will rise to the top and conquer all who are against us, welcome all who are for, and embrace all who are with. Let the drums of new beginnings ring, for we will arise once more!
