I feel like this needs to be said; &quot;Body shaming is not bad.&quot; Why? Because being morbidly obese and/or being a &quot;sex worker&quot; is dangerous. Heart disease kills people. STDs kill people. High cholesterol can kill people. Normalizing and &quot;accepting&quot; bad states of the human body are inherently self destructive to our collective society. Telling young girls it is acceptable to be these ways is intolerable. Harassing and bullying these people over it is not right, but telling them that they are in danger and engaging in bad behavior [i]is[/i] right. This region has been founded to protect that undeniable truth.
