A chain of island-nations in the South Berren Sea, formerly owned by the Union of Solvenian Republics until its collapse in 1989. Ownership of the islands were transferred to the new government of the Federation of Eastern Solvania, who relinquished control in the subsequent years, as they were not economically viable to sustain. The remaining population of each individual islands formed their own nation-states. While they exist within each others&#39; presence in a state of tense peace, none of the tiny nations are willing to take action against the other, but are more than willing to defend the Archipelago from the outside world, thus forming a pseudo-Allience.
