The Tavari Union is a supranational organization of sovereign states with an ethnic Tavari majority. In addition to promoting the 2,000 year old Tavari culture and language, the Tavari Union jointly manages the EEZs of the member states and two Union Territories that belong equally to each member. The Tavari is led symbolically by the Emperor of the Tavari, who also holds independent constitutional roles in two member state governments. Each member state&#39;s head of government serves on the executive body of the Tavari Union, the Union Council.
