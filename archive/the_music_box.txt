[b]Regional News:[/b] Due to the lack of volunteers, we have limited resources which severly limits our abilities and services. If you are on the list of nations waiting to be attended, it may unfortunely take months until you get your service, unless its not an emergency case of you being raided, it will take a long time. We sincerly apologize for any inconveniences and we hope you understand.[/b]

In short terms, we are a region who assist regions in need.
