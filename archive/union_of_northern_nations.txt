After the dissolution of the former Socialist Scandinavian States and the Free Market States of Scandinavia thanks to the collapse of the Treaty of Stockholm and Weimarainia, it was decided that an organization must be made to fill the niche left by the two groups. Neuebayern, a new nation that took areas previously owned by Weimarainia, decided to create the Union of Northern Nations to unite all nations in the region that were previously segregated by the SSS and FMSS.

The requirements to join are that your nation must be based off of a European or North American nation. We allow any form of government in the region.
