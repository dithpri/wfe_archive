Founded on Hatred and Sorrow, these nations work together to spread the joy of hatred and sorrow. In 2015, The Oppressed Peoples of Shnnin and The Fiefdom of Shake and Bake picked up their entire countries and moved. We proudly support genocide and ethnic cleansing. We strongly support the Pro-choice and Gay agendas. We firmly believe in the power of Satan and trust in His leadership to bring us where we need to go. We really like gay people. Like a lot. Screw traditional families lets just all marry each other. One Big Regional Pro-Genocide Family.
