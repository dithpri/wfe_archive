This ancient ruin is rumored to have been host to dark rituals in the past and it is even said that Banes stalk the ruins at night. The Elders of the Bear Clan have sent Sana here to investigate these rumors.

However, it would appear they are true! A Bane has attacked Sana! Even now, the Priestess battles the fearsome creature of darkness! Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points will slay it and claim the region!
