After Pacemania&#39;s split from the Post-Trump United States, Pacemania decided to make attempts at establishing peace and democratic socialism throughout the world. Countries in The Democratic Socialist Union of Pacem are asked to respond to issues with best interest for their people and the environment. Countries are also asked to take steps to implement a majorly government/state planed economy. 

The Democratic Socialist Union of Pacem is a private region that can only be joined through invitation.
