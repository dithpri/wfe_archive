Welcome to [b][color=red]United Soviet Soviet Soviets[/color][/b], a region of communist and democratic socialist nation states, sometimes authoritarian, but always [b]UNITED[/b] under our martyr Josef Stalin! We don&#39;t have many criteria for entry - just go along with our dictator [b][nation]Bestburgia[/nation]&#39;s[/b] desires. All are welcome, and all are equal. Just as it was... at least until 1991. :-(
