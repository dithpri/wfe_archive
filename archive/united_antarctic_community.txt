 Huzzah! The United Antarctic Community has been founded in the small town of Amundsen-Scott on the Antarctic Peninsula. The date is 30th January 2035 and at present it contains only one NationState, the Antarctic Space Station, its future capital. All nations wishing to apply must adhere to its constitution once published, and will be expected to commit to the values of capitalism, freedom and to an agenda of scientific progress and advancement of the wider community.
 We are a community of democracy and libertarianism, so beyond the constitution and our core values, what your colony or station decide to do is really up to you! The future is yours, and remember that, ultimately, &#39;Science is the Path to the Stars!&#39;
