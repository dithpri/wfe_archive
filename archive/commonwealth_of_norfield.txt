Based in a temperate climate, the Commonwealth of Norfield is a region characterized by sloping valleys, gushing rivers, large lakes, and rolling hills. The landscape consists of one medium-sized continent and several smaller archipelagos surrounding it. The temperate climate of the north allows for a long growing season, and the winters are very mild. Down in the south, hot winds and a dry climate limit the importance of agriculture in the region. Somewhat isolated from the neighboring continents, the Commonwealth is regarded as a moderate and relativity diverse place.
