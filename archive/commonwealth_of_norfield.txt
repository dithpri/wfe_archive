Based in a temperate climate, the Commonwealth of Norfield is a region characterized by sloping valleys, gushing rivers, large lakes, and rolling hills. The landscape consists of one medium-sized continent and several smaller archipelagos surrounding it. The temperate climate allows for a long growing season, and the winters are very mild. Somewhat isolated from the neighboring continents, the Commonwealth is regarded as a moderate and relativity peaceful place.
