We here at Saga Bloc are brand new. We stand for the acceptance of others and other things. Saga stands for Straight and Gay Alliance, or you can just call it a LGBTQQIAAP (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Allies, Pansexual.) Basically we are a region where you can be yourself, once it hopefully gets bigger we will do our best to actually run it, so hopefully with elections made with popular vote. A democracy, if you please. 

Also please do not discriminate against other people. Freedom of speech is a thing but it is illegal to use it to discriminate against ones religion, sex, sexuality, race, etc. Please be respecting of everyone. You may swear but keep it to a minimum yeah?
