The Fertile Crescent Union (FU) is an EU-style military and economic bloc uniting Iran-e Mazdayasnayi, Kemet (Egypt), Aram (the Levant), and Bit Nahrain (Mesopotamia). This powerful bloc controls the strategic land bridge between the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is globally stable due to Iran&#39;s numerous eternal alliances (including with Israel and Greece). The FU champions Iran&#39;s radical Green Revolution doctrine, while honoring the linguistic autonomy of its member regions.
