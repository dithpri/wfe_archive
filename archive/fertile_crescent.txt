The Fertile Crescent is a roleplay region dedicated to the geopolitics of the Middle East. The name is a misnomer. This region seeks to serve as a staging ground for a roleplay featuring countries in modern day Jordan, Palestine/Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, and Iran. Maybe Turkey too. Maybe Cyprus as well. I&#39;m not sure.

Those who are interested will be able to request a nation, provided they elaborate on what territory they would like out of that. If your request is deemed as acceptable, you&#39;ll be added :)

Telegram [nation]Palestine and Transjordan[/nation] for acceptance.
