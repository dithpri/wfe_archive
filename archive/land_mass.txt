Land Mass is a region dedicated to growth, entertainment and conversation. Land Mass was established on Thursday November 21, 2013. Other purposes will be determined as the region grows. Our current goal is to gain a total of 50 nations. Let&amp;#39;s hope for the best guys! Invaders are not welcome. I am a VERY active founder and any attempts to control this region are futile.
