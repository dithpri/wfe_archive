[b][color=darkred]Welcome to Land Mass.[/color]

Founded by a ragtag group of immigrants from different lands, Land Mass serves as a home for the homeless. Upon the creation of Land Mass, arguments broke out over the name, or lack of. Immigrants from one country wanted to name it one thing, while others wanted to name it something completely different. Eventually they agreed to compromise on &quot;Land Mass,&quot; a perfectly neutral and obvious name.[/b]
