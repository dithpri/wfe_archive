[b][color=red]OM MANI PADME HUM[/color][/b]

[i][color=orange]Do not go by revelation;
Do not go by tradition;
Do not go by hearsay;
Do not go on the authority of sacred texts;
Do not go on the grounds of pure logic;
Do not go by a view that seems rational;
Do not go by reflecting on mere appearances;[/color]

[color=gold]No one saves us but ourselves,
No one can and no one may.
We ourselves must walk the path.[/color][/i]
[color=red]~ Buddha[/color]

[color=purple]In whom there is no sympathy for living beings: know them as an outcast.[/color]
