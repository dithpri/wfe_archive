The Independent Kebabuslavic States used to be a union of ruinous states before the isolationist policy was abolished, which is also the time when the economy boomed. The founding nations were Kebabuslavia, KebabKebabKebabKebab, The Kebabuslavic Borderstates and the French Kebab States. These four nations make up the Kebab4, one of the members of the Kebabuslavic Regional Council. Other members include: The Matter State, The Velburgian Embassy, The Khaos Empier and The Independent Regional Council, which is separated from the Kebab4 as it&amp;#39;s own body.
