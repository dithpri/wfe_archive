The Gemini Sector is a conglomerate of stars comprising of four main quadrants, the Farris, Potter, Clarke and Humboldt quadrants. The four quadrants are each known for a dominant trait, Farris rich in asteroid fields containing high quantities of minerals, Potter is the trading hub of the Gemini sector, full of wealth from all corners of the galaxy. The Clarke quadrant is heavily militarized as the confederation of Gemini meet the Bolshevik Revivalists, a Communist Militaristic regime bent on conquering the Sector and other surrounding locations, and finally the Humbolt quadrant, a currently sparse quadrant with little to offer but occasional agricultural, mining and refinery bases, but lots of potential.
