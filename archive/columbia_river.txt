[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Captured: 13.11.14[/I]

[color=red]This region was once owned and oppressed by Nazi [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region]/[nation]Captain Woodhouse[/nation].[/color]

[color=blue]It was liberated by the Mighty Anti-Fascist Warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region]. This region is now a democratic society that lives in peace and love. 

This liberation serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]
