A region for like minded individuals to discuss politics and any other topic really. 

We&#146;re not too political but we do have somewhat of a regional government in place. And by that I mean like the first few people will get positions and then we will hold election at some later date.

We will try to be as active of a community as possible and we don&#146;t have any off that site stuff. If you join you must b inclusive and accepting of our fellow capitalists.

So just come on in and have some fun!
