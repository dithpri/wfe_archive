The 4th Confederation of Richland Republics was a newly formed Confederation of conquered states by the Supreme Leader Mr. Richards. Most of the nations associated with this region were war-like and very difficult to work with. However, the Supreme Leader brought order to chaos and now these warring nation states have to work together to make their region stronger against any invaders. Like the nations in the 1st Confederation of Richland Republics, it is a law that March 7th should be known and celebrated as Supreme Leader Day to pay homage to their founder and hero Mr. Richards! &amp;quot;LONG LIVE THE CIVILIZED REGION OF THE 4TH RICHLAND REPUBLICS!&amp;quot;
