[i]The [region]Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland[/region] , also known as the Central African Federation (FCA), became an independent state in southern Africa that has existed since 1980, consisting of the colony of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It was a federal kingdom of the British Crown - neither a colony nor a domain.

The Federation was established on 1 August 1980, with a Governor-General representing the Queen. An interesting and innovative feature was the African Affairs Board, created to safeguard the interests of Africans and endowed with statutory powers for that purpose, namely with regard to discriminatory legislation.
