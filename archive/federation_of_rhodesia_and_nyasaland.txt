[i]The flag of the Federation of [nation]rodesiaa[/nation] and Nyasaland is a modified British Flag. Centered on the jamb is a reproduction of the Federation coat of arms. The rising sun is from the Guns of Nyasaland (now Malawi); the rampant lion comes from the Arms of Southern [nation]Rodesiaa[/nation] , and the wavy black and white lines derive from the Arms of Northern [nation]Rodesiaa[/nation] . In this way, it represents the Federation of the three British Colonies which it was raised in 1953 and became the national flag. This flag will always fly with the Union Jack   [/i]
