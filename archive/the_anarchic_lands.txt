[region]The Anarchic Lands[/region] are, as the name describes, a group of barren wastelands ruled by anarchy and total chaos. Despite whoever maintains control, no one truly rules these lands, as each nation squabbles for their own collective power, irregardless of resource, humanity or morality. War, famine and death are just part of everyday life in these terrible lands. The Anarchic Lands are currently ruled in unchallenged unison by the [nation]Makluan[/nation] Empire.
