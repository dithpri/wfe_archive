One day in the early formation of the continents, Africa was born in the warm dawn of the great Sun.  The daughter became the mother to humanity&amp;#39;s first born.  Here in Africa Nova we are the shining star in the black sky.

The purpose of this region is to house as many like-minded, freedom-loving, poly-racial societies as can be.  It&amp;#39;s not necessarily an attempt to roleplay Real Life Africa.  There&amp;#39;s already a region for that.

Entry is free, but don&amp;#39;t think that means you won&amp;#39;t be scrutinized by the natives.

The Founder is forever a benevolent Emperor.
The region will always have a Hostess.

As time develops, we will have more to do.
