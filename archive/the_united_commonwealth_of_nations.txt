[hr][b]Welcome to the [color=#001193]United Commonwealth of Nations[/color][hr]&#147;Et Populi, Sapientiam Iacet&#148; | &#147;In The People, Lies Wisdom&#148;[hr][/b][b][color=#001193]Who We Are[/color][/b][hr][b]The United Commonwealth of Nations (UCN) was created by a group of patriots, expelled or forced from their homeland by oppressive governments, monarchies, and beliefs.

Committed to good and expeditious government, the Commonwealth looks to its people for guidance in all things, advised and led by a firm, fair, and checked executive.

We are a new Region, so if you are committed to the principles of democracy, fairness, and transparent government, we invite you to join us, and take advantage of the bountiful opportunities to make an impact, present in the UCN.
