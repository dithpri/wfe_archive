[b]The Ricanoverse[/b]

The Ricanoverse is a separate historical timeline and the subsequent universe created, in which the largest difference is the existence of [nation]La Paz de Los Ricos[/nation]. The Ricanoverse&#39;s earliest possible split from the standard Human timeline occured at the end of Earth&#39;s Cretacious Period, when the Chicxulub Impactor strikes Earth and decimates a majority of life on the planet. In the Ricanoverse, the force of the impactor caused a split in the Earth&#39;s crust in the eastern Pacific, creating a new lanclass which eventually became the Ricano Archipelago. The Ricanoverse is timeshifted exactly 200 years into the future.

The current year is 2219 in the Ricanoverse.
