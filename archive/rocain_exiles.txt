Due to irreconcilable differences, [region]Rocain Labs[/region] has exiled members of the atoms and orientation tribes to this cold, inhospitable region. The original members of those tribes have been recycled, and recreated with new, slightly more meaningful names. We&#39;d love to have you visit, but security of our holy mission to retake our home region comes first, don&#39;t you think?
