[color=663300]The [b]Nile[/b] is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa, generally regarded as the longest river in the world. It is 4,130 miles long and runs through Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Egypt.

The northern section of the river flows almost entirely through desert, from Sudan into Egypt, a country whose civilization has depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along those parts of the Nile valley north of Aswan. Nearly all the cultural and historical sites of Ancient Egypt are found along riverbanks. The Nile ends in a large delta that empties into the Mediterranean Sea.[/color] [color=666666] &#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
