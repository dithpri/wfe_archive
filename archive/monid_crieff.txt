[region]Monid Crieff[/region] has been inhabited for over 10 millennia, and existed as a political entity for over 1,300 years. In that time it has bourn witness to population migrations and adapted to technological, ecological and geopolitical challenges. Its inhabitants are uniquely able to marry tradition with innovation, show reverence for the past and the gifts it has bequeathed us whilst embracing the future and the gifts it promises us.

The resident nations are bound together by the shared history and the resolute belief that countries and regions exist as entities to benefit those living within their spheres of influence. That economies and industries exist as services to improve the lives of those that sustain them.
