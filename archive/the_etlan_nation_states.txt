The Etlan Nation States are a group of outlying political bodies surrounding the Etlan mainland. These nation states are semi-independent bastions of power in Etlan waters who are distinct from the nation of Etla itself, they may work together or compete as needed, but outright hostility usually results in ejection or invasion by Etlan forces.

The mainland is ruled by the mysterious ruler simply known as The Queen, who allows people to live free, but comes down on infractions with an iron fist.

This is a roleplaying region, with the background LOOSELY based on the Etlan canon. Nations are considered to be in a modern era. Characters, countries, and whatnot may be alternate reality versions of their Etlan selves.
