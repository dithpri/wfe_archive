A large tropical island with no native population. It was initially colonized by [nation=Denali Whitewater] before being joined by a small group of nomads known as [nation=Sorthweast] who sought to explore all corners of the island. Soon, a community of [nation=Fiendish Snackers], hearing of the island&#39;s rich food supply, descended and carved out an enclave. Last but not least, the nation of [nation=LOUDER AND BIGGER], sensing an opportunity to make themselves even BIGGER, laid claim to their corner of the new land.
