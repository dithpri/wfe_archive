A new roleplaying region startup. 

For new members: please introduce yourself on the Regional Message Board! To get space on the map, download the current regional map and color in the spaces you want with MSPaint or some other program. Please be reasonable in claiming territory. Upload the map to Imgur and post the link in the RMB and it will be checked, discussed, and then our regional cartographer will update the official region map.
