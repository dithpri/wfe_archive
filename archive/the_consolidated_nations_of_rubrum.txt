[b]Welcome to [region]The Consolidated Nations of Rubrum[/region][/b]
In [region]The Consolidated Nations of Rubrum[/region] we favor individuality. We allow all the Nation-States to govern themselves if they so choose. If they would like make decisions as a region in order to make an influence in the World Assembly, that would be acceptable as well; this region exists to facilitate that. If there are any questions, they can be directed to the organizer of The CNR, [nation]Pria Bicania[/nation]. Thank you.
