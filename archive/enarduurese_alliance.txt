Welcome to the EA! (Created in Oct 26, 2025)

Here are some Rules:
1. No communism.
    THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE.
2. No cussing.
    Self-explanatory.
3. Me (the creator), will post almost any other time, like news and updates, so don&#39;t be patient.
    Self-explanatory.
4. Don&#39;t even post fake stuff in the alliance.
    I&#39;m serious.
5. NO PLAGIARISM.
6. If you speak a different language other than English, Spanish, and Russian, please get a translator.
    This is because I can only speak English, half of Spanish, and a bit of Russian.
If you defy those rules, you will be kicked out, temp banned, or perm banned.
To join here, Make sure: You aren&#39;t communist (Do I keep saying this?), and your nation was created longer than after yesterday.
