[color=black]Welcome to the[/color] [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=republic_of_tunisia][color=red]Republic of Tunisia.[/color][/url]

[i][color=black]Hark! You tyrannous dictator,
lover of darkness, enemy of life.
You mocked the cries of the weak,
and your palm is stained with their blood.
You set out tarnishing the enchantment of existence,
sowing the thorns of anguish among the hills.

Think! Whenever you reap the heads of men and the flowers of hope,
wherever you water the heart of the earth with blood
and inebriate it with tears,
the flood will carry you away, the torrent of blood,
and the burning rage will consume you.[/color] [color=red]- Aboul-Qacem Echebbi[/color] [/i]
