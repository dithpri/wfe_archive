The Socialist Montonian Region was a failed Social Democratic region founded by [nation]the montonian[/nation] to ensure democracy,free speech and free politics. It started off very well and had a population that extended to a total of 24 nations but it fell into a nation divide because of the founder&#39;s regrettable actions towards some of the members and the population shrunk to about 9 nations. The Montonian officially closed it on March 5th 2019 because of the failed attempt to reach 100 nations.
