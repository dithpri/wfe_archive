[i]&amp;quot;The best region in NationStates is the one with the name you can&amp;#39;t pronounce. We also have penguins. Lots of penguins. But we have alot more Little Blue Penguins.&amp;quot;[/i]

[b]Welcome insightful leaders of great nations![/b]

You are wise to have chosen Hogarahoiprash as your nation&amp;#39;s home region. Why? Because life here is what you make of it. Hogarahoiprash is a blank slate for you to create your collective destiny. What kind of region should we be? That&amp;#39;s up to you to decide. 

All leaders are encouraged to discuss whatever is on their mind on the Regional Message Board, a forum in the capital city of Xochi.
