[b]This region is an alliance of thriving nations, of which we describe as city-states. We are all independent nations, but we classify ourselves as these since we think of ourselves as an entire empire of peoples who work together. To simplify, each city-state is like a thread in a tapestry that makes up a bigger picture and being. So, join us and prosper![color=red] &amp;#917;&amp;#955;&amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#952;&amp;#949;&amp;#961;&amp;#943;&amp;#945; &amp;#947;&amp;#953;&amp;#945; &amp;#972;&amp;#955;&amp;#959;&amp;#965;&amp;#962;![/color][/b] (Freedom for all!)
