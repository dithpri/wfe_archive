[b]Sakkara[/b] is a hidden civilization located inside an inaccessible, extra-dimensional closed subspace inversion, encased in an inert layer of subspace. Approximately 0.00000002 light years in circumference, it is impenetrable to matter or energy, resulting in a region wherein no gases, stellar bodies, or matter of any kind exists. Thus the Citizens of the [b]ISO Culture of Sakkara[/b] are living on a vast superstructure inside the subspace inversion.
