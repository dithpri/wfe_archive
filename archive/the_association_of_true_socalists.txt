Descending off the cruel Warpspace, the SKITARII VANGUARD has scourged this place, bathing it in baleful radiation. Flesh melted off what little resistance there was, its pain and last breath sacrificed to the Omnissiah. Radium guns have sung their song, turning the whole place into a wasteland, one and same with that of Mars.

[i]There is no truth in flesh, only betrayal.
There is no strength in flesh, only weakness.
There is no constancy in flesh, only decay.
There is no certainty in flesh but death.[/i]
