After a particularly bloody battle between countrys owning the North Indian Ocean Islands, the Islands came together in a confederacy and declared diplomatic independence. This led to many court battles, and finally, the United Nations recognised the region officially. Since then the Islands have had tense relationships with India, China and North Korea specifically, but have enjoyed economical and military support from other UN, now WA, nations. So far no major conflicts have occurred in Islander territories.
