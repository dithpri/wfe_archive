[color=545AA7][b][u]WELCOME TO THE NON ALIGNED UNION - NAU[/u][/b]

NAU was established by the Santo Franciscan Government as a group for new and smaller nations to have a say in world affairs, whilst remaining neutral. A majority of the members of NAU, just like [nation]Santo Francoso[/nation] itself has recently transitioned into democracy, after a end of a prolonged dictatorship. We welcome all up-and-coming nations regardless of ideology, as long as they remain tolerant of all ideas and maintain respect towards their other peers.

Embassy Requests will generally be accepted as long as they aren&#39;t involved in illicit acts such as raiding.

No. of Embassies: 0[/color]
