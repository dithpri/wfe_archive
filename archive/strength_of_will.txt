Welcome to all nations that have the wisdom to join! We are an incredibly intelligent and environmentally beautiful region, welcoming to all! If you have been invited to our region, it is surely an explicit pick, in order to sift our army into the very best. You are free to leave at any time, but we&amp;#39;re sure you&amp;#39;ll stay!
