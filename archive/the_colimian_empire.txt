As a small, yet growing empire, we have seen the darkest of ages. We have seen the rise and fall of many benevolent empires. Some oppressing their people deliberately. Some giving people too many freedoms. As we look back at the fallen empires throughout history, we have tried to create the best possible empire. Behold; The Colimian Empire. We are a region that pledges protection to the smaller, weaker nations that support our newly founded empire. We give military protection, offer trades, and while we don&#39;t oppress the citizens of the region, we don&#39;t want too many freedoms. The Colimian Empire promises protection and wealth to all of its followers.
