The Democratic Empirical Kaisaru is the Democracy of the main Kaisaru empire. The leader of the region is Klijoja - One of the major leaders of the fast-expanding Kaisaru Empire. The Empirical Democracy was the third Region Founded by the Kaisaru Empire.

It&#39;s closest to the Empirical Republic due to the friendship between Iomada and Klijoja, but the Democracy hates the OEK (Opressive Empirical Kaisaru) due to their treatment of their subjects.
