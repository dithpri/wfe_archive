Twinkle, twinkle, Patrick Star
I made myself a sandwich
My mommy named it Fred
It tastes like beans and bacon
And smells like it&#39;s been dead

Writing stuff is hard so I use a pointy pencil
Pointy pointy pointy, pointy pointy point
P.U., what&#39;s that horrible smell?

Drum solo!

I have a head, it ends in a point
Pointy pointy pointy, pointy pointy point
This song is over, except for this line:
You win this round
Broccoli
