Welcome to [color=#c10940]The Free Conservative Alliance[/color]!
We were founded after our founding members were exiled from [region]The Royal Conservative Alliance[/region] for criticizing the corrupt and totalitarian government of the region. We of [color=#c10940]The Free Conservative Alliance[/color] believe in a nation&#39;s right to govern itself, and in the ideals of a small and transparent regional government. All nations are welcome, provided that they are willing to abide by our ideals.
[color=#c10940]Currently under a Provisional Government while we work on establishing a constitution.[/color]
[color=#c10940]Voting for the regional constitution will commence at 3:00 PM on the August 16, 2017 (PST).[/color]
