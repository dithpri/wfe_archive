[i]Then you came my way on a winter&#39;s day
Shouted loudly, &quot;Come out and play&quot;
Can&#39;t you tell I got news for you
Sun is shining and so are you
And we&#39;re gonna be all right
Dry your tears and hold tight
Can&#39;t you tell I got news for you
Sun is shining and so are you[/i]
