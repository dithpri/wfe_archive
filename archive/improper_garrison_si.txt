[i]It&#39;s so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you&#39;re gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don&#39;t pretend that you don&#39;t want me
Our love ain&#39;t water under the bridge
If you&#39;re gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don&#39;t pretend that you don&#39;t want me
Our love ain&#39;t water under the bridge
Woah-woah
Say that our love ain&#39;t water under the bridge[/i]
