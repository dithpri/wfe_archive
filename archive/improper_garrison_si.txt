[i]Could&#39;ve been the worst day of my life
Could&#39;ve been the worst day of my life, I
Thought that I would have to say goodbye
Could&#39;ve been the worst day of my life, of my life
Just when I felt you slippin&#39; out my hands
I guess that Heaven had another plan
Oh, oh
Could&#39;ve been the worst day of my life[/i]
