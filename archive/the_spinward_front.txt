&amp;quot;Out here, beyond the Periphery, the void itself burns. Some say it&#146;s the flames of dying stars, others that it&#146;s the fires of war that consume the entire region. Me, I know it&#146;s the flames of hell that burn on the Spinward Front, and they&#146;ll take us all before they&#146;re extinguished.&amp;quot;
