[b]It hadn&#39;t been that long since [region]The Black Hawks[/region] had raided, but they decided to mix it up anyway. The Hawks tried a few new things during this raid... with [i]varying[/i] degrees of success. During this run, they found a surefire way to terrorize regions: just let the secret weapon, [nation]Penny Two Point Oh[/nation], lead the raid. 

Thank you, Penny.
