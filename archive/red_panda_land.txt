[b]Hello Pandas! We tried a small unsuccessful raid on [region=The Bone Zone], unfortunately they unexpectedly cared about their region even though they were inactive up until the raid... After our failure there was a Raid Attempt on us from [region=The United Nations of AxoBadgeria], they have been ejected for now. Now we are at war with two enemies. Please endorse Nitsua, WE NEED A DELEGATE TO NEGATE FUTURE RAIDS. This is very important and I expect that once you see this message you will endorse them immediately.[/b]
