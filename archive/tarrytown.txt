The sun is rising high up over Tarrytown,
Friends taking off and friends touching down.
That&#39;s where you&#39;ll find,
That one of a kind

Jay Jay
Jay Jay the Jet Plane!
That&#39;s me!

Never been another little guy like this,
So much in love with the sky like this.
So buckle up tight,
It&#39;s a magical flight!

With Jay Jay
Jay Jay
Jay Jay the Jet Plane!
That&#39;s me!
