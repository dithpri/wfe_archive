Breadcat is a region well known for its endless fields of bread and its abundance of furry cats. Now don&#39;t get us wrong, we love other animals too, but our friendly, tame, cats are the most commonly sighted animal.
Anyways, we have a good time, and our nations frequently have inter-regional holidays that include huge happy festivals. Bread-making contests are common at these festivals; local bakers as well as families can choose to participate. Winners of bread contests have in the past received prizes as grand as home-makeovers! Join our region, and it&#39;ll be a good time. woo!
