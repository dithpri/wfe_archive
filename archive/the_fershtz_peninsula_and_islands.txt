This region consists of a peninsula with an archipelago of islands accompanying its right and front side. Once an empire was here and ended in the civil bloodbath after a horror revolution turned into a bloody civil war which ended 15 years later. Terrun Bur Shvetz was the most powerful republic of the former empire and it is now taking the lead of the whole region.
