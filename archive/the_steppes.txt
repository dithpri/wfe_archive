[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region], decided to watch anime in your region. It was a tough choice between Idol anime, Yakuza films or Arknights.

[b][color=steelblue]Of course, with some really democratic vote, we decided to watch Arknights [Prelude to Dawn] in your region. [/color] 

Today, while watching arknights, we realised that arknights was indeed very tragic, with the death of many key characters like Shatterskuller which turns some raccoon girl into the bad people
