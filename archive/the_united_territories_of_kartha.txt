The United Territories of Kartha originally formed by the joining of the two nations Pandazia and Holaz; countries of two very differing ideologies. Pandazia stands as an anti-religious, Constitutional Monarchy, while Holaz was formed historically on the basis of a Holy-Empire. As the two countries formed and grew in population, the differing governments became fearful of one another, leading to a state of panic, an arms-race, and a war. The gruesome war lasted four blood-filled years, ending with a devastating plague caused by the use of chemical warfare and genetically modified diseases. Facing devastation and death, the two opposing countries signed a peace treaty.
