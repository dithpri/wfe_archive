[B][color=#484259]Welcome to Grey Tokelau![/color][/B]

[B]We are a region that blends socialist and direct democratic values into an anti-capitalist utopia. Here, all residents have a large role in decision-making. This region is multilingual as well! English and Tokelauan are the languages to be used. [i]E mafai nei e koe matua faitau?[/i] Here, you can do pretty much anything as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone. Want to free yourself from regions with tyrans? Then join us and say [i]M&amp;#257;l&amp;#1086;&amp;#772; ni![/i] (hello) on the RMB, and make yourself at home![/B]
