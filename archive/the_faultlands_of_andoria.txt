Andoria was discovered in the late 1072s, when lunar exiles from Kelvarius stumbled upon its vast, open expanse. They settled the land and spent years building a fragile peace&#151;until others came.

Exiles. Extremists. Prophets. Corporations. Anarchists. Radicals of every kind found their way to the new frontier, each seeking to claim it for their vision of the future. Ever since, the once-quiet landscapes have been embroiled in endless war.

The grass now lies stained a sickly brown. The once-crisp air is choked with smog and mustard gas. Civilian airliners teeter on the edge of permanent grounding, and most of the world&#39;s population can no longer remember a time before anarchy.
