An obscure volcanically active rock of a planet, it is known primarily for its stygium crystals. The crystals find their primary use as lightsaber crystals, giving a Jedi increased stealth and dexterity. For the past 10 odd years, Aeten II has served as the home base for a radical Sithist sect calling themselves Jen&amp;#39;Jidai. The planet serves not only as their military base but also features an Academy founded, fostered and staffed by Jen&amp;#39;Jidai. Their primary compound is located not too far from the settlement known as Arete.
