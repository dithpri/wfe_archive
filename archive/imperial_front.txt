Hehe! Anyways, if you want to thrive in the region, you must look at our set of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1987773]rules[/url] if you wish to [b][color=green]live and prosper in the region[/color][/b]

If you wish to get on our map, you must stay in the region for atleast a week before wanting to get on it, and must actively post. Then [nation]Imperialist Germannia[/nation] might think to get your [color=red]SMALL NATION[/color] on the map.
