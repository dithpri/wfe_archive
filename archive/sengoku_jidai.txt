[color=crimson]&amp;#25126;&amp;#22269;&amp;#26178;&amp;#20195; [i](Sengoku Jidai)[/i][/color] or &quot;Age of Warring States&quot; is the historical period in Japan known for its political intrigue and military conflict. Since the colapse of the Ashikaga shogunate in 1467 CE, the [i]daimyos[/i] (local lords) rule their own lands without much central control; meanwhile, the [i]Tenno[/i] (emperor) is still the official ruler of the nation, but he is mostly a ceremonial and religious figure.
