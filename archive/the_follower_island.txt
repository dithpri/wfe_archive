The Region of the Followers was until the mid-19th century been in complete isolation when a French expedition accidentally discovered the Island. Soon after many European nations had their colonies, the colonists did soon make up their own cults and by the end of the 19th century a revolution sparked on the island which liberated the island from its colonial ties. The Followers ruled the entire island for nearly 45 years before the communist revolution split the former empire throwing it in to the dust.
