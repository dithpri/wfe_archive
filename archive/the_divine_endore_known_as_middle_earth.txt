This is a Middle-Earth themed region for fans of Tolkien&#39;s works to enjoy. I myself am a fan of Middle-Earth and its deep, wonderfully crafted, and expansive lore and world. I dream of seeing this region develop into a burgeoning hub of conversation and kindness.

PS: Hobbit and Dwarves are awesome.
PS: D&amp;D is awesome too.
