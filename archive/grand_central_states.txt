The Grand Central States is run by the core group known as the Triple Coalition which are the Republic of Zacharin, the Republic of Area 66, as well as the founder, the Republic of Bel Lione. All countries are welcome to join, as each country has its own unique political and social views etc. 
     We are a progressive and growing region with a new website being created for people to collaborate outside of e region. Polls will be put on the website and will be discussed by the triple coalition to see what changes or improvements will be necessary. All ideas and opinions are accepted as long as they are appropriate, as the region of the Grand Central States endorses and supports equal voice from all of its members.
