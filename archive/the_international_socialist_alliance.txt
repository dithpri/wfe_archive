[b]Welcome to [region]The International Socialist Alliance[/region]![/b]
This region was founded to bring small Socialist states together in peaceful co-operation for the furthering of the struggle of the working class.
We will welcome any nation looking for sanctuary from the turbulent world out there.

[i]&quot;Communism is not beauty - it is a hammer with which we will crush our foes. Peace, love and bread for all, with not one step back!&quot;[/i]

This is a casual region; activity or no activity, we hope it will be a pleasant environment for all.

[b][i][color=E60000]WE ARE RECRUITING![/color] If you&#39;re interested in joining, but not sure whether this is the right region for your nation, please contact any of the Offices of the Commissariat. Our ministers will be happy to assist your nation.[/i][/b]
