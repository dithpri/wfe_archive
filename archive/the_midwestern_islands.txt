  This moderately-sized continent stretches across several climate regions, from Temperate in the North, through to Polar in the South.
The continent sits very close to the edge of a tectonic plate; the Northern edge of the land features a small mountain range and some prominent canyons and valleys.
The MidWestern Islands have a particularly large dormant volcano, and deadly earthquakes happen every few years.
The winds in this region are often inconsistent, with large storms and extreme weather being common, but the seas surrounding it are often calmer.
