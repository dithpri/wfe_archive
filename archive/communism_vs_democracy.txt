If you&#39;re a country that employs some form of communism, like a dictatorship, socialism, or where power is all in the hands of the government, or some form of democracy, where people have some sort of control, this is the region for you. Here, you can war against communism, if you&#39;re democratic, and war against democracy, if you&#39;re communist. Not much else besides that. Just have fun.
