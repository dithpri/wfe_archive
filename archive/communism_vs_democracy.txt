I will delete and add privileges to nations as time goes on to balance it out.

If you wanna invade or do something else military-related, ask Ripoff USA (aka me). I have this in place because I don&#39;t want complete anarchy. And do not worry, there will be invasions at some point.

If a nation who is governor wants to abdicate, or go somewhere else, they must appoint the next highest power (Whether that be the WA Delegate or the highest position besides) as successor.

Will probably add more stuff later.
