The Global Peace Commune is a sovereign movement founded on the belief that lasting peace can only be achieved by dismantling borders, hierarchies, and systems of exploitation. Rejecting nationalism, capitalism, and militarism, the GPC unites people through collective ownership, ecological balance, and shared governance by the Unity Council. Its communes operate without currency, guided by need, cooperation, and mutual respect. Though it maintains a defensive peacekeeping force&#151;the Guardians of Stillness&#151;the Commune spreads its influence not by force, but by example. To the oppressed, it offers refuge. To the world, it offers a choice. There is another way.
