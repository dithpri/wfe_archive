[color=green][b]Welcome to the Regional Alliance![/b][/COLOR]

Okay everyone! The Regional Alliance is CLOSING DOWN. That&amp;#39;s right! All nations have 14 days to move out. This is happening because Sugarfootland has quit the game, and he has indicated that he wants the region to close. In reaction to this, frGDR, Olivee, Cockatrice City, Elemental North, Sofa, CEMA, and Glaser have began to work on a new region, called the Confederacy of Nations. It will come into existence after the apocalypse has passed. If you want more information on the Confederation, read the RMB, or contact Elemental North, Olivee, or frGDR.
