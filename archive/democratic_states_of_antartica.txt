Founded in very recently in 2015 by New Austractica, The Democratic States of Antartica is open to all nations to join. After all there is plenty of room in the Antarctic. We at all times honour the sovereignty of our nations and will not intervene with your country at all. So make a change from the major regions and join the DSA now!!
