[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their friends in [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=valle_de_arena]The Sekhmet Legion[/url] have, on this most sanctified Major Update, raided this region. The natives remained unheard from to this day. Upon rendering this small plot of cyberspace clean of its vainglorious idolatries, it is made pure and holy in the name of the most chumby, most scrungly, most worthy of belly rubs and neck scritches, Gwilymverse, patron of raiderdom and litter boxes.

The ritual continues elsewhere. [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]Join us[/url] or be joined to the Gwilymversian void that consumed this once-proud shrine of human arrogance. [i]Meow![/i] X3c
