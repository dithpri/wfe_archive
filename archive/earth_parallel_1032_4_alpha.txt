You enter a room with two doors. Each lead to a different dimension, yet with striking similarity. One door leads to our reality, while the other leads to a mirror reality, yet with some additions.

You have just entered our world, but it is theirs. They, I speak, are us, but not us, and few of them have this rare opportunity as you have.

You may join the Ellipsis Program to cross this reality if you desire. Just check in with us occasionally and leave your observation notes for our study. Trust no one, as they have the same kind of program as we do, and we intend to keep it quiet.
