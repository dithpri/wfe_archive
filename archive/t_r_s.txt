Hello Hi! Welcome to The Seven Realms!&amp;#9786;&amp;#65039;

The concept of this region: I intend this region to be a neutral point connecting all regions were new or old fans to Undertale, Deltarune, Doki Doki Literature club, Yandere simulator, Bendy and the ink machine, Fnaf and Baldi&#146;s basics, can come and meet and interact with other fans at the same time as you the residents are governing a nation. Kinda like a social caf&eacute; were people talk about games and politics. So please, take a seat and have a &#147;fika&#148;. UwU

(In case you haven&#146;t noticed, I just named &#147;Seven&#148; games, &#147;Seven Realms.(Get it :P?))

Please feel comfortable and present yourself in the RMB to make new friends.
