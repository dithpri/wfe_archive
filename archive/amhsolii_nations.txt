Our history begins with the ascension of the state previously known as Amhsolia [Anglicized: Amsolia]. The Amhsolians came from a few villages set between the Northern Mountains, where their ancestors are said to have sprung up from the rich red clay soil and descended from the Mountain of the Sun, the greatest Amhsolian mountain. 

Following the Imperial Period and the establishment of Amhsolia as God&#39;s Dominion, we have become a collection of various folks united for The Cause.
