A region in which to [strike]kill off[/strike] phase out any unwanted nations you possess NATURALLY! Just wait for 28 days and your nation decomposes! Fun, eh?

This region is NOT for nations that want to talk. All RMB messages will be suppressed. This is for the purpose of letting puppets (or your main, if you&#39;re feeling that way) rot.

There is no regional government and no WA delegate. The founder, [nation]Those Who Are Alone[/nation] is the only power, and that is only to prevent raids.

Due to the theme of this region, no embassy requests will be answered.
