We accept all countries that fall under the liberal-leftist umbrella. Strong political and civil rights, and worker-owned economies. 

All communist, socialist and even capitalist states are welcome as long as they respect civil liberties, increased welfare, healthcare and education spending.

All members must be democratic and ready to make progressive reform.

Members should be open to debate, free discussion and arguments in good faith.
