Welcome to the trophy region inspired by Equestria at War, a mod for the Paradox grand strategy game Hearts of Iron IV. It is set in the world of the cult TV hit My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, and expands on the existing show elements of conflict, industrialisation, and magic into a full blown setting for war and politics.
