We are region that focuses on 6 things
1.Gender equality
2.Racial equality
3. Anti-Homophobia. 
4. Feminism [don&amp;#39;t worry we don&amp;#39;t hate men, the founder himself is male :)]
5.Anti-transphobia
6.Secularism.  
We are the equalist federation, we are LGBT centric and want to keep gender roles out of nationstates and keep things secular. Although we advocate democratic Socialism its not required for you to be Socialist. Feminists are welcome, as well as people in the LGBT community and straight allys. We hope to make a region that combats against social inequality on the website of nationstates.
