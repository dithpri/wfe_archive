[color=chocolate][b]Dedicated to [nation]Tatu Rama[/nation], who wrote the second constitution of The UEF which would be later used for The DFN, due to the coup d&amp;#39;etat of The UEF by its founder.

This was the temporary home for the exiled peoples of The UEF, until a major flaw in the naming of our new home had been pointed out. This name implied that the region was a federation for democratically governed nations, which it was not. It was intended to be democratically governed region where any nation could settle. The DFN was founded soon after.

The Federation of Democratic Nations is part of [region]The DFN Commonwealth[/region], which in itself is a part of [region]The Japerican Imperial Commonwealth[/region], consider relocating to [region]Japerica[/region] today! ^_^

[i]Let the old UEF and the new DFN live on![/i][/b][/color]
