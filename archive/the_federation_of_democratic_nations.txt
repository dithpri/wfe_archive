[b][color=chocolate]Dedicated to [nation]Tatu Rama[/nation], who wrote up the second constitution of The UEF which would eventually become the constitution of The DFN after the coup d&amp;#39;etat of The UEF on May 31st 2012.

Home of the exiled peoples of [region]The United Earth Federation[/region], before it was realized that the name did not reflect what every nation was, a democracy. The Federation of Democratic Nations is part of [region]The DFN Commonwealth[/region], which in itself is a part of [region]The Japerican Imperial Commonwealth[/region], consider relocating to [region]Japerica[/region] today! ^_^
