[u][b]Welcome to Auroran[/u][/b]

[u]Back from being hacked; had to start a new region.[/u]

Founded on December 20, 2016 the region of [region]Auroran[/region] is a place where nations can meet other nations and chill. Our motto &quot;We Shine by Friendship&quot; represents what Auroran stands for. Since we are a new region we need nations that are willing to be active members of the region. If you have any ideas on what the region should do, do not hesitate in sending me a telegram.  

New Nations may help themselves to meats, cheeses and water at the Welcome Table.

[u][b]Motto: &quot;We Shine by Friendship&quot;[/u][/b]

- [b]No RMB Recruitment Allowed; All RMB Recruiters will be banned on sight[/b]

- We have a temporary flag and new one will be up shortly
