[color=green][b]Welcome to Auroran[/b][/color]
 
Auroran was made so that people can network with others, have fun, be a little competitive and just a place to discuss different topics and play games. The era of couch gaming and couch hangouts, like so many other things, have gone digital. So if you&#39;re a gamer looking to be part of a region or just a normal nation looking to converse with others then Auroran is the place for you.
