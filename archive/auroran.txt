Founded on December 20, 2016 the region of [region]Auroran[/region] is a place where nations can meet other nations and chill. Our motto &quot;We Shine by Friendship&quot; represents what Auroran stands for. Since we are a new region we need nations that are willing to be active members of the region. If you have any ideas on what the region should do, do not hesitate sending me, [nation]Starlaris[/nation], a telegram.
