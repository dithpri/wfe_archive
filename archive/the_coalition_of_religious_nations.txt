The Coalition of Religious Nations (also known as C.O.R.N.), is home to all relgious and or spiritualist nations. Any and all differences between our beliefs are cast aside and any infighting will result in a permaban of the party(parties) involved.

Only nations with a high relgious/spiritualist stat may be allowed entry.

Any nations that are found not to be religious/spiritualist in any way, will be a victim of a permaban. However anyone who is openly willing to begin the search for their religion, or any form of it, will be welcomed with open arms.

Have fun in the Coalition!
