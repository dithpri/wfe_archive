Welcome to [color=4682B4][b]Hyrule[/b][/color]! The oldest Legend of Zelda region in NationStates.

Home of renowned heroes, malevolent beings, and where the legacy of classic video games lives on! We hope that you will have a great time! 

Feel free to start some activity -- we&amp;#39;re looking to rebuild the region! You could easily be the next leader of the region! (contact South Malaysia for more information)
