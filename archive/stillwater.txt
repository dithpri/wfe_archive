Delegate (Starkenfaust), Vice Delegate, Regional Defense, Offensive Department, Embassies. If anyone if these five seats in the house want to change something they telegram the Delegate, after that the Delegate must tell me what to change as i am the only one who can change things (like a Secretary). Delegate - leader, Vice delegate - 2nd in charge, Regional Defense - protects Stillwater against invaders, Offensive Department - takes over other regions, and Embassies find other regions to either make them allies or tell Offensive Department to take over it. 
THIS IS A CAPITAL REGION
