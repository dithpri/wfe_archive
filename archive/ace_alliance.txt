The ACE Alliance was founded on the 2 February 2017 by Hugas Nation, and is a symbol of pride, strength, power and freedom. A force to be reckoned with, its members are globally established nations with both powerhouse economies and superb freedoms, as well as a strong principle of democracy. However, this brilliance is not achieved without rules, and just like any region, the ACE Alliance has a set of rules that if broken can result in ejection from the region-
 
 - All countries must be main accounts
 - You must apply for positions of office
 - Do not betray or break alliance with fellow nations
 - Economies lower than good will be ejected.
 - Freedom is held dear
