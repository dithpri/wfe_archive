This is the Caelestean Region of Provinces. We are a nation that takes pride in the Free Market and startups of companies Big or Small. Apart from this, we hold strong Conservative beliefs and believe this is the way to lead the New World. That being said, here you will find all the Provinces that belong to Caeleste and how each Province might differ from the next. To become a Province of Caeleste, you must pledge full Allegiance to Caeleste and send a Telegram to her should you be allowed to join our glorious nation. To show her your Allegiance, you must be willing to reclassify your nation as a Colony, or a Province should you have reached a populace of 500M+.
