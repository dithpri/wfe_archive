*occupied by Georgian, Sith, and SU forces* 


TPSA had no right to sieze control of the RIAR and password lock it. he puts slander in the RIAR. insulting us few that stood up for what was right. 


we have returned the favor and taken The Colsak Mountains. 

The Colsak Mountains was previously thought to be invincible. until on February 8th Georgian and SU troops took control of the mountains. no civilians were harmed. although they were made to leave the region to return to TPSA. 



When the TPSA government ends its occupation of the RIAR and removes the password lock and tags, we will do the same. returning the Colsak Mountains to TPSA control. but until then, the mountains remain locked down.
