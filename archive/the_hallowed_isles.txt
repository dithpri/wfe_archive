The Hallowed Isles is a collection of nations situated on a rather small continent in the North Atlantic Ocean. There are several-hundred volcanic islands sprawling out from the mainland, (thus earning its &#39;Isles&#39; status). The nations rely upon each other in order to survive and have formed a union that is headed by the Holy Empire of Splendania, which is comprised of 6 islands as well as well as control over the eastern peninsula on the mainland. The islands are peaceful, temperate, and have a slowly-growing population with the growing strength of its resident nations.
