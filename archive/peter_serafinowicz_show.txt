The &quot;Kitchen Gun&quot; infomercial parody skit was performed in an episode of The Peter Serafinowicz Show, originally aired in late 2007, in which Serafinowicz cleans a kitchen by shooting messes with a firearm. The show subsequently aired a similar sketch in which Serafinowicz promotes the &quot;Toilet Grenade&quot; cleaning product by destroying a toilet.
