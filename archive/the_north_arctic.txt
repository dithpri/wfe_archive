The North Arctic is a frigid area where life still found a way to thrive. We in fact wage a secret war against the evil cheese manufacturers as cheese is seen as the food of disrespect and hate in Northern Arctic society. We also take a strong stance for equality, preserving the earth and defense. The North Arctic stays neutral is most cases but will always stand by unless it&#39;s allies are in need.
