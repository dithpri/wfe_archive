[b]The North frigid zone, between the Arctic Circle 66.5&deg; N and the North Pole 90&deg; N.[/b] 

The North Arctic is a frozen land
Where icebergs float and glaciers stand
Where polar bears and narwhals roam
And the sun never sets in summer&#39;s home

The North Arctic is a salty sea
Where currents swirl and jellies be
Where plankton feed the ocean&#39;s life
And the ice reflects the solar light

The North Arctic is a changing place
Where warming threatens its cold embrace
Where humans seek its hidden wealth
And its creatures fight for their own health
