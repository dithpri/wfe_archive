[b]Ally of [region]Mocambique[/region][/b]

[b]Mocambique belongs to the Mozambicans[/b], not European imperialists or Islamic fundamentalists.

The region [region]Mocambique[/region] was originally founded by pro-apartheid Europeans.
It was briefly conquered by Islamic fundamentalists.
We refounded before either could get their hands back on it.

Then, like the sore losers they are, the theocrats founded this region, [b]Mo[u][i]s[/i][/u]ambique[/b], spelled slightly differently, so they could still brag about taking a piece of Africa.

But, like all glory-seeking conquerors before them, they lost it to the indigenous people of this land.

Sorry, fundies. Sorry, imperialists.
