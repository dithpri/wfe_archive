It&#39;s so hard for me to sit back here, in this studio,
Looking at a guy out here hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor
In bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made
You&#39;re talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kid stealing (WOO!)
Wheeling dealing, Limousine riding, Jet Flying, son of a gun
