One of the most common telegrams I get is how to join [region]The Roman Council[/region]. I decided to tell you all! If you want to join make a nation with the words: Roman, Rome, SPQR, Republic, etc... like our other nations and send me a telegram. I will then send you the password. If you get the passwrod and you do not have these words then you will be banned! Thank you, [nation]The Northern Roman Senate[/nation]
