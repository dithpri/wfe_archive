The old world is no more, not one country can claim to have total power over one specific region nor it&#39;s own borders. The brittle balance of peace and order can break at a moments notice. Build Alliances, break them, or go your own way. Your actions decide your borders. I hope to produce not just border maps, but alliance and religion maps on top. Fight wars, decide peace, it&#39;s all up to you. Combat and how it will all work will be decided later. This fact book will update as rules are written.
