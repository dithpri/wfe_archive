Welcome to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. We are a region devoted to Lord Glob. We generally don&#39;t care. Please remember to celebrate talk like a pirate day (September 19) and FSMas (December 25) May you forever be touched by his noodly appendage.

We stick to the rules
Here in our government
We do not force rules

These rules are to help
Bestow peace in this region
No matter the cost

We will not back down.
No fugitive shall stop us
From serving justice

High power people
Pose no exception for us
Power matters not
