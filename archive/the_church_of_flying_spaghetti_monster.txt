Welcome to [region]The Church of Flying Spaghetti Monster[/region]. We are a region devoted to the FSM. We generally don&#39;t care.
Please remember to celebrate talk like a pirate day (September 19) and FSMas (December 25). May you forever be touched by his noodly appendage.

[b]ATTENTION PIRATES: It&#39;s been 4 months since we&#39;ve been last raided! We have free grog, beer and strippers (all genders). What are you waiting for?[/b]

FSM scholars have found a clear link between the number of pirates and global warming. Considering that, we are excited to see that many pirates are still alive. Most recently we were invaded by pirates from [region]The 1st Order[/region] and [region]USSF[/region]. (See our dispatches for details and list of invaders.)
