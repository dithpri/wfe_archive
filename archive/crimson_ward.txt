The Crimson Ward is a strategically vital region under The Empire of Phoenician, encompassing The Dictatorship of Strom2 and The Democratic States of Sauram. Its geography features mountains, deserts, fertile plains, and coastal areas, making it ideal for defense, agriculture, and industry. Rich in oil and minerals, it serves as an economic and military hub. Sauram&#146;s ports facilitate trade, while Strom2&#146;s industries fuel Phoenician war efforts. As a heavily fortified buffer zone with strict surveillance, the region ensures Phoenician dominance, suppressing dissent while securing vital resources and strategic waterways.
