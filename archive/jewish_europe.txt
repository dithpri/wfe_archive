Former WFE:
This was the scene of the Jewish Justice League&amp;#39;s worst defeat way back in January 2013. It was occupied by the Nazis and their friends the UDL, and we were able to kick them out, but then I had modem problems and the communists beat me to the refound.

Well, I guess the reds couldn&amp;#39;t hold onto it, so, thankfully, Jewish Europe is back in Jewish hands.

(Remember Linkthat Star Trek episode? The one where the guy said &amp;quot;That which was ours is ours again, and will never be taken from us again!&amp;quot; Yeah, it&amp;#39;s kind of like that.)

Selah!
