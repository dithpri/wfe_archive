&amp;quot;For if you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father&amp;#39;s house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&amp;quot; (ESV)

Psalm 42:11

Indeed I (God) have spoken it; I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed it; I will also do it. Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness . . . Isaiah 46:11-12
