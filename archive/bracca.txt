Bracca was an inhospitable junkyard planet located in the galaxy&#39;s Mid Rim. Located close to various hyperspace routes, Bracca&#39;s strategic importance made it the site of a campaign during the Clone Wars. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the Scrapper Guild operated on the planet, breaking down starship wreckage and selling the components to the Empire.
