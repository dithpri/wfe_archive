[color=crimson][b]The Internationale[/b]

[i]Stand up, all victims of oppression,
For the tyrants fear your might!
Don&#39;t cling so hard to your possessions,
For you have nothing if you have no rights!
Let racist ignorance be ended,
For respect makes the empires fall!
Freedom is merely privilege extended,
Unless enjoyed by one and all.
  So come brothers and sisters,
  For the struggle carries on.
  The Internationale
  Unites the world in song.
  So comrades, come rally,
  For this is the time and place!
  The international ideal
  Unites the human race.[/i][/color]
