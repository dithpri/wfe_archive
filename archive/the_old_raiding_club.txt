Once a thriving bar with its famous drinks on the house policy, this large and discrete clubhouse continues to operate after being rebuilt on its original foundations. Home to some, refuge for many, The Old Raiding Club is the place to trade intel, spread rumour, recruit, relax, unwind and enjoy a brew. Patrons are encouraged to tip the doorman when they leave. Tradition has it, that it is unlucky to enjoy the hospitality without leaving a posting.
