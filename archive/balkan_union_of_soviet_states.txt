A union of nations situated in the Balkan region of Europe, the B.U.S.S. came about as a result of the unprecedented socio-economic crisis in Europe. The Union Assembly&amp;#39;s permanent home is in Beloroye, though other nations may host an Assembly gathering as a means of showcasing their progress and power to the rest of the union. Socialist states seeking to join the union are requested to make contact with the union membership bureau in Beloroye.
