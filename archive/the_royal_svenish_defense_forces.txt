The doomsday has come again.... and we must fight!
our people are relying on us to defend them!
our grand empire will fall soon, and we must stay alive to defend it until everyone of us dies!
then our grand empire shall rise again!
Bloodshed and tears will come, yes, but does that mean we should fear the day of the damned?
NO!,Never fear!
Should any of us surrender to the enemy?
NO!,never surrender to our enemies!
should we be scared that the enemy is stronger than us?
NO!,never be scared! the enemy knows that fear makes us weaker...
should you abandon your allies?
NO! never abandon your allies!, even it means you&#39;re going to die!

L&auml;nge leve kung Felix, l&auml;nge leve f&auml;derneslandet!
