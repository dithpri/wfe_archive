Welcome Brownistan, a peaceful region that&amp;#39;s full of life! 

Constitution: 

List of Rules: 

1. Regional elections are okay as long as the founder or delegate approves.  

2. Only the Founder and Delegate can Declare war. 

And that&amp;#39;s it... so far. But eventually, more rules will be added or repealed, and the region will develop!
