We are a region trying to rise above the rest, we are a fair region. We will do everything we can to help others survive. We accept all nations of all kinds here, are biggest rule is please dont be toxic. Like dont try and make other players hate the game, dont make fun of smaller nations, just be nice. We are a democratic type region, but nations who join dont have to be. Depending on your skill and what you want, plus how much you are on the game will determine what spot, if any you are eligible for in the region government. If you have any questions feel free to ask me.
