[b][color=red] Hamas is regularly described as
&#39;Iranian-backed Hamas, which is dedicated to
the destruction of Israel.&#39; One will be hard put
to find something like &#39;democratically elected
Hamas, which has long been calling for a two-
state settlement in accord with the international
consensus&#39;&#151;blocked for over 30 years by the
US and Israel. All true, but not a useful
contribution to the Party Line, hence
dispensable.[/b][/color]
