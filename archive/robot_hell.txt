[i][color=darkred]Cigars are evil; you won&amp;#39;t miss &amp;#39;em
We&amp;#39;ll find ways to simulate that smell
What a sorry fella! Rolled up and smoked like a panatella,
here on level one of Robot Hell!

Gambling&amp;#39;s wrong and so is cheating;
so is forging phony I.O.U.s
Let&amp;#39;s let Lady Luck decide what type of torture&amp;#39;s justified;
I&amp;#39;m pit boss here on level two!

Ooh, deep-fried robot!

Fencing diamonds, fixing cockfights, publishing indecent magazines...
You&amp;#39;ll pay for every crime, knee-deep in electric slime!
You&amp;#39;ll suffer &amp;#39;till the end of time, enduring tortures; most of
which rhyme!

Trapped forever here in Robot Hell![/color][/i]
