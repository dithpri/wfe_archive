[color=darkred]Welcome to Robot Hell! Home to all wretched sinning units![/b]
With your [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9AexiRyPc0]humble host[/url], [nation=short]Thee Robot Devil[/nation].[/color]

[i][color=red]Ooo, deep-fried robot!

You&amp;#39;ll pay for every crime, knee-deep in electric slime!
You&amp;#39;ll suffer &amp;#39;till the end of time, enduring tortures; most of
which rhyme!

Trapped forever here in Robot Hell![/color][/i]
