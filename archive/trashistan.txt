Trashistan was founded by two nation states: The Commonwealth of Lunar States and The Democratic Republic of
The Congressional Districts of Columbia on January 26, 2017. The Trashi language is spoken by the numerous Trashi tribes that inhabit these lands. The two states that formed the core of Trashistan largely enslave the Trashi people for speaking such a Trashi language.
