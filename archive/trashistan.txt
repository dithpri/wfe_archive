Trashistan was founded by two nation states: The Commonwealth of Lunar States and The Democratic Republic of The Congressional Districts of Columbia on January 26, 2017. The Trashi language is spoken by the numerous Trashi tribes that inhabit these lands. The two states that formed the core of Trashistan largely enslave the Trashi people for speaking such a Trashi language.

Today, Trashistan is a region dominated by constant warlord-ism and tribal affiliations. Despite the DRCDC&#39;s proclamation of a [i]de jure[/i] Trashistan region and subdivisions, Trashitstan continues to be recognised by its old world boundaries of the Eastern United States seaboard.
