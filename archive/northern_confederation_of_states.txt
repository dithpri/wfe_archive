The Northern Confederation of States is a region composed of a very diverse group of nations.
You are welcome regardless of form of government. We understand that all the nations (no matter how crazy) need a helping hand. We will be your good neighbors that you resent. We will be the Flanders, we will be the Dinkleburgs, we will be here for you. A mentally disturbed dictator is welcome here, so is a commie. As long as you don&amp;#39;t impose your values on others, ye are welcome.
We believe every state has a right to sovereignty, if you can take power you are a leader, if your state fails, there is a reason. The world powers shouldn&amp;#39;t interfere.
