NCS is a region for states who have been oppressed by the powerful world nations. Countries that have been corrupted or damaged by the USA and USSR&amp;#39;s competion to starve out the other. Whether communist, capitalist, or otherwise, you only need to be independent from large foreign powers. Neither capitalism nor communism created the world&amp;#39;s poor rouge states, rather it was interference from large foreign powers who made sure someone who promoted their ideology took power. They sent guns tosmall poor countries , stopped trade to nations who wouldn&amp;#39;t pledge support, and then the nations who did pledge support were abandoned and left to rot when they were no longer needed.
