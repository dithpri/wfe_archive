Cormactopia is a magical land in which everyone may do whatever they want unless Cormac says differently. And he probably will.

Cormactopia is also home to the Cormactopia Chaos Corps, the best ambiguously aligned military force in NationStates (because it&#39;s the only ambiguously aligned military force in NationStates). You may contact [nation=short]Cormactopia Prime[/nation] to join, but he probably won&#39;t let you.
