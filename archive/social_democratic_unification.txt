Hi and welcome to the social democratic unification. We are focused on bringing on unity to the leftwing, secular but also conservative nations of the world. We believe in strength in unity and share one common currency the Ringgit. We are looking for anyone who follows the Nordic model and is secular to join us or ask for embassy. Please see our embassy policy on the board. 

Why should you join us:

- have a voice in the WA
- be supported by fellow social democrats
- have a calm home in the bustling nation states
