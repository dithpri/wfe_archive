[color=blue] In memory of the [region]Green Weed Region[/region] and their military branch the [region]Marijuana Militia[/region]. Already dying communities which near the end of their &amp;quot;life&amp;quot; got destroyed by an self-righteous organization. For them this &amp;quot;desecration of corpses&amp;quot; is a huge victory in a so-called war against &amp;quot;big and mighty&amp;quot; opponents...for others this only shows the true nature of those &amp;quot;do-gooders&amp;quot;.
