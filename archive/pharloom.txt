[hr][hr][color=#d33742]The kingdom of Pharloom is the distant and withered land where [i]Hollow Knight Silksong[/i] takes place. It is ruled and haunted by silk and song, the two powerful forces of that world. Like Hallownest in its golden age, Pharloom is dedicated to faith and pilgrimage, although the gilded pin is its traditional weapon and the silk spool its symbol. At the peak of the kingdom is an enormous, shining Citadel which Hornet must ascend to.[/color][hr][hr][color=#d33742]Flag is self-made.
Waiting for some good banner fanart to drop.[/color][hr][hr][color=#d33742]Embassy requests will be accepted if coming from authentic and genial [i]Hollow Knight: Silksong[/i] fans.
