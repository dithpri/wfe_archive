The kingdom of Pharloom is located in a distant and withered land. It is ruled and haunted by silk and song, the two powerful forces of that world. Like Hallownest in its golden age, Pharloom is dedicated to faith and pilgrimage, although the gilded pin is its traditional weapon and the silk spool its symbol. At the peak of the kingdom is an enormous, shining Citadel which Hornet must ascend to.
