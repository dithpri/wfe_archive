A region ruled in an almost hierarchical imperial structure, the Empire of Ulfr-Reich has sovereign dominion over the other nations via the fact that they are essentially vassal states.

One way of telling if a nation is a vassal of the The Greater Reich is when it&amp;#39;s tanks roll through your living room-wall and you see the essentially resurrected Kroitzheim insignia upon said tanks hull, also, look for a runic inscription in said flag with the letters &amp;quot;DGR&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s an insignia of conquest and victory.
