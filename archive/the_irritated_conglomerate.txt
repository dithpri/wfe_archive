Welcome to the Irritated Conglomerate, administered by the Glorious Illuminate, Emperor Harrington V of the Empire of Dai-Harrington. 

The region was founded in 2013 by the nation of Yararoski. The region&amp;#39;s WA Delegate and guiding hand is Emperor Harrington V, who rules with a kind but sensible policy. As WA delegate and leader of the region, Emperor Harrington V has promoted and brought about further peace and prosperity within the region.

All nation&amp;#39;s are welcome as long as they conform to the region&amp;#39;s ideals of regional peace and prosperity, though nations are given almost total control over their own individual policies as long as they do not threaten these ideals.
