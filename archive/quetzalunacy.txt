The region of Quetzalunacy is a small, violent region split among a variety of different states. Most are run by mindless lunatics who think only of plundering their neighbors. It is also a rather loud place. While there are a number of different cultures, a common trait among all peoples of Quetzalunacy is a love of shouting, yelling, exclaiming, and generally communicating at high volumes.
