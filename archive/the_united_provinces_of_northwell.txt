Snow covered year-round and full of tough united communities. Although they are spread out these communities pull together in times of great need for the good of the country.

Fascism and Capitalism are frowned upon but are accepted within provinces as long as it is not being pushed upon another. It is preferred that provinces have their own ideas unless asking for advice.
