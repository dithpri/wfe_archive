The Confederation of Lichen is a group of individual member states that are bound in an alliance to each other. 

We aim to be a good base for nations to begin their existence in, as most nations do not stay in their founding region for long. 

If you wish to join, you can. (FYI there&#146;s nothing stopping you)

Yours,
Schpoervenel 
(Founder)
