Citizens of the International Commonwealth of Nations, do not be alarmed. The Black Riders came, which happens to the best of regions. The factbook will return later.

Until the return of the factbook we are declaring martial law in ICON. All WA nations are required to endorse our delegate, [nation=longnoflag]Overcaffeination[/nation], to speed up the gain of influence to a point where it becomes possible for a regional password to be made as a shield against raiders. Non-WA nations are encouraged to join the WA (at least temporarily) and endorse [nation=shortnoflag]Overcaffeination[/nation], and [i]only[/i] Overcaffeination.

Violators of the law will be ejected and banned after a warning.
