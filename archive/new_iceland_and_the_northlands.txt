New Iceland and The Northlands were first settled by Norse peoples during the 17th and 18th centuries before being colonized by Spanish, Sardinian and British settlers in the 19th century. The region is desolate, located in the Arctic Circle and divided between harsh cold temperatures to the north and sub-tropical climates in the south, affected by an Atlantic air stream bringing warmer airs over the landscape of mainland New Iceland, today part of the nation of Dellalarum, named for the population of seagulls.
