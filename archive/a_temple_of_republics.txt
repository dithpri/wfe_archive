sst, Hey you, yes you. Welcome to my temple. I&#39;m KIWI KIWI KIWI Rep, the founder. We always accept embassies, so if you are an embassy manager, do not decline these.

Anyone can join, it is free to be in here. Only eject nations if you can eject them if they are:

-spamming

-being VERY rude

-saying bad things to admins


Any flag that looks like jumpscares, etc is allowed, BUT, keep it appropriate.

You are allowed to endorse other nations.

Roleplaying is allowed. Don&#39;t make it very violent, or you&#39;ll get a warning.

Well, that pretty much wraps it up. Hope you have a good stay in the temple of nations.
