Welcome to the multiverse, my fellow entities of every kind. This is a place of fun, beauty, passion, magic, mystery, diversity, acceptance, and occasionally&#133; the scuffle between different nations (which we resolve peacefully by bringing matters to the ruling council of leadership, which has completely fair, not magically rigged, no powers involved, definitely fair elections&#133;) , and occasionally we must defend ourselves from other regions that wish to unify the multiverse into a single timeline&#133;
