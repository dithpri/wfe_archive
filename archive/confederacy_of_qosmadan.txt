[b][color=white]Welcome to [region]Qosmadan[/region]![/b]

[hr]

This is [nation]Isoti[/nation]&#39;s private Region, as the nation is against large, bureaucratic Regions and alliances that, in the end, hold everyone back.
As such, this Region is Anti-General-and-World-Assembly and Anti-Security Council.

[b] Explanation of Nations [/b]
If it is not clear already, I own all the Nations inside of this Region. Here is an explanation for all of them.

    1. [nation]Isoti[/nation] is where I attempt make an ideal state from my point of view. It is libertarian and democratic in nature.

    2. [nation]Jethaulor[/nation] is where I attempt to make the most oppressive, tyrannical regime possible.

    3. [nation]Mofleuburg[/nation] is where I attempt to make a fundamentalist, holy state.

    4. [nation]Dastroyla[/nation] is where I attempt to make a excessively free, anarchist state.
