This is [nation]Isoti[/nation]&#39;s private Region, used for alternate Nations.
As such, all Nations here are owned by one person. Only [nation]Isoti[/nation] shall be in the World Assembly.

[b] Explanation of Nations [/b]
If it is not clear already, I own all the Nations inside of this Region. Here is an explanation for all of them.

    1. [nation]Isoti[/nation] is where I attempt make an ideal state from my point of view. It is libertarian and democratic in nature.

    2. [nation]Jethaulor[/nation] is where I attempt to make the most oppressive, tyrannical regime possible.

    3. [nation]Mofleuburg[/nation] is where I attempt to make a fundamentalist, holy state.

    4. [nation]Dastroyla[/nation] is where I attempt to make a excessively free, anarchist state.
