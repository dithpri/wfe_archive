This is [nation]Isoti[/nation]&#39;s private Region, as the nation is against large, bureaucratic Regions and alliances that, in the end, hold everyone back.
As such, this Region is Anti-General-and-World-Assembly and Anti-Security Council.

Communism and Fascism are dysfunctional ideologies that hold no place within this Region.
