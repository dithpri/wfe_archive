After the disasterous Brexit referendum in 2016, and the 3 following years of austerity and crisis, Parliament descided that it would take action and took it upon itself to remove Boris Johnson from Number 10 and began taking steps to regain order after the political revolution. However Queen Elizabeth II didn&#39;t support this form of government, so in August 2019 the Queen declared a state of emergency, resulting in the second English civil war. That leaves the government in a tense situation, resulting in the formation of European Britain. The future of this new region is uncertain and unclear, however the government will carry out the will of the people as effectively and functionally as possible.
