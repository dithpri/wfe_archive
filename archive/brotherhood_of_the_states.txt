We Believe that the nation&amp;#39;s making up the Brotherhood of the States(B.o.t.S.) should have the right to govern their country as they please. The B.o.t.S. is highly anti-W.A. and believe their oppression of countries rights to govern themselves as they please is immoral. After World War 3, also know as the Nuclear War, the B.o.t.S. was formed to protect it&amp;#39;s countries rights from fear of what the W.A. may have planed. This is a new region that will continue to develop as it goes on. However you must ask for approval, upon approval you will be given the weeks password.
