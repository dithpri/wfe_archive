         Hello, and welcome to The Robust Military Alliance. This is a militaristic region, with that said, we believe that any and all military powers should always be in front of everything else, and should be taken very seriously. And all countries located in this region should be prepared to defend this region from foreign invaders. We do accept all forms of government, from dictatorships to democracies.

Stand at attention, and march forward!
