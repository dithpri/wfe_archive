Pelononia is located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres. With approximately 60.7 billion people, it hosts a small but fair amount of the world&amp;#39;s current human population. It has a high growth rate in the modern era. For instance, during the 20th century, Asia&amp;#39;s population nearly quadrupled.

Given its size and diversity, Pelononia &#150; a toponym dating back to classical antiquity &#150; &amp;quot;is more a cultural concept&amp;quot; incorporating diverse regions and peoples than a homogeneous physical entity. Pelononia offers a very wide range in regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.
