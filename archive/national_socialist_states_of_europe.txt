The National Socialist States Of Europe is an authoritarian dictatorship, commonly referred to as the predecessor and descendant of the Third Reich, due to their dictatorial government and oppressive ways. However, they do not discriminate against people&#39;s religious ideals. Instead, religion is allowed but is kept minor, in order to praise the Leader instead. All non-Europeans are instantly kicked out, in order to &quot;preserve the purity of our continent.&quot; Civilians are constantly reminded that every duty done is a duty done for the Leader. The National Socialist States Of Europe are often at war with neighboring countries that do not conform to their ideological beliefs.
