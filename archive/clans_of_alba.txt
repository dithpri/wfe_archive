As the Kingdom of the Picts deteriorated, the land modernly known as Scotland was again divided and became completely feudal. Territory was disputed between various clans and families. Today, disputes are commonly negotiated if they occur and the land that was formerly united has now been split up as each clan claims its space on the map to create it&amp;#39;s own household. The leading clan today is the Hamilton clan which resides in Lennoxlove and controls most of the regional activity. However, the land continues to be split and territories are constantly changing as more and more clans form.
