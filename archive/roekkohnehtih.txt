 Roekkohnehtih is a small island community about the size of Rhode Island and is located in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. Settlers from Africa arrived at the island in 186,000 B.C.E. The island was first discovered in May 8th, 2023. This did not go well for the people that ran into the island as they were affected by a disease the natives had that were related to bats as that is a main source of food the natives had eaten for tens of thousands of years. This has caused an outbreak of a new virus that has now spread all over the world. People are not allowed to visit the island due to diseases and the fact that very dangerous animals live on the island.
