[b]The Religious Holy Land[/b]
The Religious Holy Land is a region that concentrates on religion, belief in the one and only God, our lord. We don&amp;#39;t like democracy, but when it&amp;#39;s needed we will have to tolerate it. Our region doesn&amp;#39;t believe in freedom. We only believe that the God is our ruler and a person shall never do anything against him.
