We welcome all nations, no matter what, however,we do have some rules:

1:Please be kind and welcoming to all
2:No Extremism

We are a very welcoming community, this is meant to be a paradise of democracy, however, I am protecting from invasions by asserting permanent executive authority. Please do not feel threatened though .:)

We hold elections for the High Council every two weeks. My ally, Zarexium, has a permanent seat. The amount of members in the high council will grow over time, and I will soon be appointing ministers as more members join.

Thank you and welcome to our region!!!
