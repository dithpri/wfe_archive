LORE:

After the capitulation of the Central Government based in the wartime capital of Chongqing, the Imperial Japanese put the Reorganized Republic of China in power of all of China. However many NRA (National Revolutionary Army) officers and generals were upset. They fled to southern China and Xinjiang and Tibet whereas others fled to India or Bhutan. They formed militia groups to disrupt Japanese and Chinese Collaborator supply lines. They occasionally attacked the capital (Nanjing). In 5/6/1954, they met up in Yan&#146;an to form an alliance to counter the Japanese and Chinese collaborators.
