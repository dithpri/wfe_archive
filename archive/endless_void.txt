Endless Void was founded in 2011 by those displeased with Laos Refugees&amp;#39; tenure as Lord High Executioner in The Imperial Legion. The founding of this region secured TIL&amp;#39;s grave, but karma kicked EV&amp;#39;s ass after a few months of activity. After around a year since the birth of the Endless Void, it is mine now.
