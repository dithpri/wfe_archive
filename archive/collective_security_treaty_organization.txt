The Collective Security Treaty Organization is an intergovernmental military alliance which was signed on 15 May 1992. In 1992, six post-Soviet states belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States&#151;Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan&#151;signed the Collective Security Treaty. Three other post-Soviet states&#151;Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Georgia&#151;signed the next year and the treaty took effect in 1994. Five years later, six of the nine&#151;all but Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan&#151;agreed to renew the treaty for five more years, and in 2002 those six agreed to create the Collective Security Treaty Organization as a military alliance. Uzbekistan rejoined the CSTO in 2005 but withdrew in 2012. -Wikipedia
