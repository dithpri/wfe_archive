[b]This region kindly volunteered to host a last minute Star Wars marathon for [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and all of their friends. But after they got here, Jakker announced some promotions [i]so loudly[/i] that it scared Aquila&#39;s enlisted rank right off and made Mira drop his green light saber crystal. Whoops! At least he has this dull grey one now. 

After skipping Episode 1, and burning three bags of popcorn in the microwave, we eventually made it to the Mustafar fight and fell asleep immediately.
