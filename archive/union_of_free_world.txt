[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] took to the seas to celebrate some recent promotions. We&#146;ve plundered this region for all its booty and are currently enjoying its spoils in a far away tavern, toasting a treasured crewmember&#146;s upcoming vacation. We&#146;ve buried the leftover plunder where X marks the spot. If you&#146;d like to enjoy your treasure too, or want to ask for it back, please [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come find it![/url]
