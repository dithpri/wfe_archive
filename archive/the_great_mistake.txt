A small section of the continent Idiotica, named for discoverer James N. Idiot. His son, Justin P. Idiot, would later become an American hero then be promptly forgotten due to an unfortunately ridiculous name.

The Great Mistake sits on the northwestern edge of the continent, bordering the Sea of Troubles. The area is known for having a great many climates and geographical features incredibly close to one another. This is due to fluctuating wind and ocean currents, which also cause the heavy storm activity the superstitious sailors picked up on when naming things nearby.
