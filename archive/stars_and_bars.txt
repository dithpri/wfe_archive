Stars and Bars stands against abortion, birth control, planned parenthood, gay marriage, polygamy, open borders, labor unions, gun regulation, evolution, slavery, communism(despite Soviet Socialist Republic of Greca&amp;#39;s membership), and big  government.

We stand for (starting with the obvious) prolife movements, traditional marriage, strict regulation of borders, gun rights, Biblical Creationism, Capitalism, state&amp;#39;s rights, Brad Paisley&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;accidental racist&amp;quot;, strong military force, small government, and Christianity based in the Bible.

We are all fiercely conservative and enjoy debates. Whether you are liberal or conservative, we would enjoy debating with you.
