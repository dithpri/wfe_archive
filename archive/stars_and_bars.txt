Stars and Bars is against abortion, birth control, planned parenthood, gay marriage, polygamy, open borders, labor unions, gun regulation, evolution, communism(despite Soviet Socialist Republic of Greca&amp;#39;s membership), and big federal government.
We are for (starting with the obvious) prolife movements, traditional marriage, strict regulation of borders, gun rights, Biblical Creationism, Capitalism, state&amp;#39;s rights, strong military force, and Christianity based in the Bible.

This region was founded by a group of six friends, one who has since moved on. We are all fiercely conservative and enjoy debates. Whether you are liberal or conservative, we would enjoy debating with you.
