Hetare is a conglomeration of independent nations located all around the world. Each nation has special representatives that meet occasionally to discuss regional politics in Hetare. This small yet robust region contains essentially everything necessary to sustain itself, do to the various locations of its member nations, and member nations are generally very peaceful. Hetare is not a large member on the world front but does play a small part in the World Assembly.
