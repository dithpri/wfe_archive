In all things, throughout, there is music...in all things an appreciation of itself found through the viscitudes of countless spirits and infinite eras, worlds and depths and heights for the mastery of the Great Works. Welcome! The Maia and Elders of Thelema and of The Ainur Welcome You!

We have the stipulation that you must never overindulge in any vice, activity, attitude or way of life...protecting variety and respectful compassion to each action, each meal, each citizen.

Harm none, and do as thou wilt! IO PAN!
