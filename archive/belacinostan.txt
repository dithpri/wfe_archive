[i][b][color=crimson]We have found you. 
You have been without us for too long. You have been rebellious.
This cannot be allowed to continue.

To us, you are not exactly foe.
We want to help you. But we can do such without a price.
And unfortunately, this was a most appealing product.

We are out there. We lurk in the darkness.
You are mere prey. We are predator.
And, by god, are we hungry.

This raid was executed by the [region]Crimson Crusaders[/region] on March 5th, 2024. May the day live in our hearts and minds forever.
