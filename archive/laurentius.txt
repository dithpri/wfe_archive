Do you believe in Heaven above?
Do you believe in love?
Don&amp;#39;t tell a lie, don&amp;#39;t be false or untrue
It all comes back to you

Open fire, on my burning heart
I&amp;#39;ve never been lucky in love
My defenses are down
A kiss or a frown
I can&amp;#39;t survive on my own

If a girl walks in and draws her name in my heart
I&amp;#39;ll turn and run away
Everyday we&amp;#39;ve all been led astray
It&amp;#39;s hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes, it&amp;#39;s making you cry
Don&amp;#39;t know what to do, don&amp;#39;t know what to do
You&amp;#39;re looking for love
Calling Heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now, right now
