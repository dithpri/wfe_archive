The Realm is split into many districts or &#147;realms&#148; or &#147;Planes&#148; for each type of resident. Every plane has one or more &#147;gods&#148; that looks over it and manages it, but every plane is subject to a base set of laws as well as its own special laws. Each plane has special properties and most do not have magic distribution. Home of &#147;The Veiled&#148;/ &#147;The Hidden&#148;/&#147;The Others&#148;/&#147;Monsters&#148;/&#147;Shadows&#148; take your pick. Mostly referred to as  Residents. The Realm is fluid, always changing and in motion as it is comprised of many planes/realms itself. As it and the amount of magic changes, parts of the plane&#146;s barriers weaken allowing for cross over between planes.
