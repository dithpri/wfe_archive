The Stellaris Galaxy is a futuristic science fiction region made up of massive space nations.

The Galaxy is a beautiful but terrifying place to behold. A massive galaxy with millions of uncharted systems and a black hole at its heart. The galaxy has been home to The Being - a massive extradimensional terror. The Being rests near the rim of the galaxy...

The region was founded by a fan of the computer strategy game Stellaris, and uses some of the lore/concepts from that game in world building but members can participate just fine without having played Stellaris.
