Finally! A safe haven for libertines, seditious demagogues, cocksuckers, Marxists, extraterrestrial agents, your cat and Vivaldi! Malcontents of the world, rise up with us in a Great Passage to the eastern plains where we shall build a strong and fair Scrivdom, that is, a consortium of humble communes dedicated to literature and pleasure! All are welcome, none are shunned! All is lawful, pedantry is punishable by death!
