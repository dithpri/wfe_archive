[The United Enclave of Profit is dedicated to the spread of Great Society principles and economic principles.
If you wish to join on the train to success, you must be ready to make money but keeping principles in mind. We also believe in an effective and realistic government, that doesn&#39;t always necessarily pander to every corporate need.
We do not discriminate against any nations but we do not turn a blind eye to unsavory behavior, just do not be a jackass.

God Bless The Enclave
