The United Empires of Carson is a stack of many nations, accepting all types of nations. Every Nation is stacked on top of each other because of limited space, it looks pretty cool. The religious leader Pope Carsonal the VII, who is in control of the Holy Empire of Carstilation leads the United Empires of Carson in worship of Carson the Great and Carsonism, Worship is ecouraged for every nation. Anyone can become the WA Delegate, but you should still do what it says in bold.
