The United Empires of Carson is a treaty between many Socialist Nations (And the occasional capitalist pig for financial support). Every Nation is stacked on top of each other because of limited space with roads in each of the nations being built of glass so that each Nation can have farms, plus it looks pretty cool. The nations near the top of the &quot;Nation Stack&quot; are usually the most obese because of their ability to grow more food than nations near the bottom of the Nation Stack. The religious leader Pope Carsonal the VII, who is in control of the Holy Empire of Carstilation leads the United Empires of Carson in worship of Carson the Great and Carsonism, Worship is Mandatory for every nation.
