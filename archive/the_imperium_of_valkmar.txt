[region]The Imperium of Valkmar[/region] is the headquarters and regional operations base of [nation]Valkmar[/nation] and its puppet states. Here we establish full control and enforce the main laws of the new Imperium; Conformity, Industry and Control. We are a bastion of defense against the endless hordes of mutants, aliens, and other deformed beings. Humanity will rule all. For the Emperor, for the Patriarchy!
