[region]The Imperium of Valkmar[/region] is a regional base for Valkmar and her puppet states. From here all actions and events are controlled, influenced and regulated. All hail the Emperor Malpheus Khamurov! For the Patriarchy!

Please note that the majority of regions we have embassies with, we control.

Control, conformity and industry. These are the three laws.
