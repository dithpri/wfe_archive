[color=#400000]In the name of [nation]Valkmar[/nation] and her Emperor, we fight for pride, honor, fascism, and glory. No one can stop us, our hate and wrath will caste a shadow over this world and all whom inhabit it, no one is safe from the devastation we bring. We are pestilence, war, famine, greed, hatred, and retribution. Our power, undeniable. Our rightful place above all, indisputable. All will bend knee and kneel before the living god Emperor, Malpheus![/color]

[color=#400000]This is a nexus of [i]hatred[/i], [i]intolerance[/i], and a burning desire to [i]destroy[/i] all who stand in our way. We have no compassion, and will not be moved by tears nor lamentations.[/color]
