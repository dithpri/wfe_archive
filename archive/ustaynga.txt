Ustaynga is an active, roleplay centered region. Founded by Omnum, and represented by WA Delegate New Cospus, nations in Ustaynga strive to provide a lighthearted roleplaying experience.

Nations inside of Ustaynga are able to propose and vote on new bills that dynamically alter the region and it&#39;s development, similar to how you address issues in vanilla NationStates. You can see a list of every active bill [color=red][url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1030112]here[/url][/color]
