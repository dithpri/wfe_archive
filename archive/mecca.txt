This holy region is tended by Sufi devotees. 
We ask only love and compassion for all humanity.

Come, come, whoever you are.
Wanderer, worshipper, lover of leaving &#151; it doesn&#39;t matter,
Ours is not a caravan of despair.
Come, even if you have broken your vow a hundred times,
Come, come again, come.

In this gathering
there is no high, no low,
no smart, no ignorant,
no special assembly,
no grand discourse,
no proper schooling required.
There is no master,
no disciple.

There is peace in Mecca.
