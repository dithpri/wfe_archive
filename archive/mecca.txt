This holy region is tended by Sufi devotees. 
We ask only love and compassion for all humanity.

Allah said Man and Woman have equal rights. 
It is Man, not Allah, who oppresses us.

If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, 
it cannot save the few who are rich.

The Thing we tell of can never be found by seeking, 
yet only seekers find it.

There is peace in Mecca.
