This region is formed of independent nations in the Pacific ocean. These nations reside on islands and archipelagos varying in size. 

(In this imaginary world, all of Polynesia does not exist and the Pacific is dotted with both massive landmasses and smaller chains of islands)

The many nations here are fighting for power and influence. Often times issues will affect individual nations or the entire region. Wars often destroy vast swaths of land. While trade is frequent and essential to the region, many nations opt out of this and decide to isolate themselves. Others are extroverted and emphasize cooperation.
