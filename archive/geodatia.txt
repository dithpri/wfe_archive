Are you lost in this weird game that doesn&acute;t really explain anything? Do you just want to play as a real nation and interact with real players as in real life, wage war and get involved in political conflicts with a lot to do? That was me when I started this game, looking for something siple, fun and interactive. If so, just join us!!!

We offer a really kind and active community that wants to live this game in a different way... Welcome and be free to ask me, Pradatia, any questions!
