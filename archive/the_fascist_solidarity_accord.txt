The [b][color=red]F[/color]ascist [color=red]S[/color]olidarity[/b] [b][color=red]A[/color]ccord[/b]  is the inter-regional association of the main active Fascist regions in NationStates.
The FSA&#39;s role is to push back against the dissemination of degenerate and maladaptive ideologies in this metaverse whilst also providing its signatories with a rich social environment of brotherhood and cooperation- as well as the numbers and the tools to triumph in their specific regional missions as they take part in the preservation and expansion of positive worldviews centered around honor, strength, &amp; beauty.
