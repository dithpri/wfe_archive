Perchance you despise the hygienic hierarchy of our modern world. As a former member of the late and great region of ALL BACTERIA LIVES HERE, I too miss the bacteria-infested lifestyle that many nations once flourished in. 
All nations may seek refuge from the clean and sanitized beings of disinfected society.
Join THE REGION OF THE LOST BACTERIA and help us spread illness worldwide!

Thank You, Northern Paugg Pan2
