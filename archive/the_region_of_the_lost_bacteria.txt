Perchance you despise the hygienic hierarchy of our modern world. As former members of ALL BACTERIA LIVES HERE, we too miss the bacteria-infested lifestyle that many nations once flourished in. 
All nations may seek refuge from the clean and sanitized beings of disinfected society.
Despite our distrust of sanitized humanity, we still endorse peace, integrity, and empathy.
