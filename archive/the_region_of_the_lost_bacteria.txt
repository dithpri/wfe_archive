As a former member of the late and great ALL BACTERIA LIVES HERE region, I often find myself missing my bacteria-infested lifestyle. This region is for all the good or bad countries that want to seek refugee from the clean and sanitized beings of this disinfected society. If you feel tired of this hygienic hierarchy come join us and allow us to spread illness worldwide.

Thank You, Northern Paugg Pan2
