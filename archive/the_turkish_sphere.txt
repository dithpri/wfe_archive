It was our founding father, Mustafa Kemal ATAT&Uuml;RK, who said: &quot;How happy is the one who says I am a Turk!&quot; We strive to provide such happiness to all peoples of the world should they be willing to adopt the honorable way of the Gray Wolf. We are one under Kemalism, and for that we are strong. Our idea of growth condemns forceful violations of nations. Instead, we seek members who wish to adopt the Turkish name willingly. We offer freedom for all, with the exception of extremist ideologies which are nothing but poison to our main ideology: &quot;Peace at home, peace in the world...&quot;
