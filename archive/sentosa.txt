[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] know that you can&#39;t just sit around in the same region all day and wait for things to happen. You need to go! Be active! Get out there and see things! And so we took a trip through the skies, gazing over all of the wonders of NationStates. And happened upon this lovely paradise. We leave you this signed guest book as a celebration of our shared time here.
