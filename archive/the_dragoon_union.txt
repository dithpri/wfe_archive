[B]What is The Dragoon Union?[/B]

The Dragoon Union is a Sonoran inspired region for role-play and Regional Politics. All are welcome here and every citizen has a voice. As a new region we are looking for Nations interested in joining and helping to grow a community here in TDU. You can have a part in forming our regional government and building the community you would like to be a part of in NationStates. I hope you consider it.

Thanks,
