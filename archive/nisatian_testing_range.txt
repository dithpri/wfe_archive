When the earth went black
It was such a dark, dark day
And such a cold, cold night
But in this dark town, we thought we saw a sign
And it looked like
No building shelter, just building fences
start burning bridges and arming your defenses[/url]

Exploit the tension, ain&#39;t no need to question why
This dark town didn&#39;t have a light
[hr]
And they tell you
&quot;Pay no attention
Harbor resentment
For everyone who don&#39;t look just like you do
Communication don&#39;t mend a difference
Your civic duty is never, ever listen&quot;
This dark town ain&#39;t got no stars[/color]
