Stretching around the sparkling blue Bah&iacute;a de Banderas and backed by lush palm-covered mountains, [b]Puerto Vallarta[/b] (or just &#39;Vallarta&#39; to many) is one of Mexico&#39;s most enticing coastal destinations. Each year millions come to laze on the dazzling sandy beaches, browse in the quirky shops, nosh in the stylish restaurants and wander the picturesque central streets and enticing malec&oacute;n.

Activities aplenty include boat trips, horseback rides, diving trips and day trips to the interior, while after sunset Vallarta takes on a new identity with pumping nightlife along the malec&oacute;n. &#151;[url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/puerto-vallarta][color=336699]Puerto Vallarta/Lonely Planet[/color][/url][hr]
