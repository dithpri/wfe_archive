[b]A flock of birbds from [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to be very sneaky today! Putting on their best camo feathers, they swooped around looking for some food to steal. First, they looked at [region]Lazarus[/region], but it seemed too big for their little bird wings to carry away with them. So they settled on here instead, using their superior stealth to dodge all the meanies who wanted to bop them with newspapers.
Having eaten their fill, they&#39;ll now fly off to their [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]nest[/url] to sleep off all the c a l o r i e s~
