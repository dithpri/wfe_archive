[region]The Utopian Anarcho-Communist Wasteland[/region] was called a wasteland by nations outside of it, and so when its members began to give it a name, they too would begin to call it a Wasteland, whether it be for the sake of irony or to appeal to the nations outside.

The region consists solely of far left nations, pre-dominantly those that identify as anarcho-communists. This is not to say that anarcho-communism is the only political philosophy allowed. Any variants of communism and/or anarchy are permitted.
