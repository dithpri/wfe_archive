[b][i][color=cyan]Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr![/color][/i] It sure has been chilly these last few days. Too cold, in fact, to go sledding, which [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their friends in [region]Lair of the Dragon[/region] had been missing out on this winter :( 

Fortunately, tonight was finally warm enough for the birds to go out without getting their beaks frozen shut! They had a fun time taking the baby birds sledding and ice skating through your region, before going in for hot chocolate to warm up.
