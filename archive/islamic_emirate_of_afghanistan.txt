The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was founded in 1996.

After a brutal imperialist invasion in 2001, the Emirate struggled for 2 decades to oust the evil invaders and their puppet government.

After the invaders had been defeated, the Emirate rose again from the ashes like the mythical Phoenix bird.

The Emirate is ruled by Islamic law (Sharia) which is from the Quran and Sunnah. This means that nobody, not even the government, can change the law. The government is just there to implement Sharia, take care of the poor and needy, defend the Emirate, and to provide and improve Islamic and regular education and healthcare.

Long live the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan
