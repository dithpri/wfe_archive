The United NationStates of Greater Rome (UNSGR) welcomes all Nations no matter what, however there are just THREE rules. (Not complying will get you exiled)

First: You are permitted to join the WA, however we will be working as a UNITED FORCE, All members must endorse The Senate and we will hold polls to vote for or against.
Second: All members must use our international currency: The Remus. (You can just use Remus, and can have another currency in parenthesis AFTER Remus if you so please.
Third: Once you have joined and complied with the last two rules you are prohibited from leaving UNSGR, this is because NationStatehood is eternal. (Still can be exiled)
