The United NationStates of Greater Rome (UNSGR) welcomes all Nations not matter what, howver there are just THREE rules. (Not complying will get you exiled)

First: You are NOT permitted to be a member of the WA, and may have at a MAX of THREE accounts in UNSGR. (We might have a WA delegate to maintain peaceful relations.)
Second: All members must use our international currency: The Remus. (You can just use Remus, and can have another currency in parenthesis AFTER Remus if you so please.)
Third: Once you have joined and complied with the last two rules you are prohibbited from leaving UNSGR, this is because NationStatehood is eternal. (Still can be exiled)
