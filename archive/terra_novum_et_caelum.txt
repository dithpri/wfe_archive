This is North America, 2050 CE. The world has been thrown into chaos and righted itself again, after the end of the Russian Federation, the People&#39;s Republic of China, and the major nations of North America. Nations have arisen from the rubble, and have worked to establish order and stability in North America. Oil is all but dead, but biofuels are rising fast. The Euro has become the world&#39;s dominant currency, nukes continue to gather dust, and space is becoming easier to reach every day.
