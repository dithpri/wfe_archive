The land promised to the descendants of Abraham, the lost tribes of Israel that have recently been rediscovered in places around the world, have been given this region as reparation for millenia of abuse and slavery.  To live as Ahayah wanted, saved uunder grace by his son Yashayah. We are led by His spirit, through our faith and obedience.
