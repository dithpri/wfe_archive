The Region of Amberlin is open to all active nations. Roleplay is encouraged, however, it is not required. To join this Region means to form an alliance between members. This does not mean that you have to be friends with everybody, because everybody knows that disagreements are inevitable. 
The RMB can be used for many things, ranging from discussions, debates, and moderate roleplay to nearly anything. Spammers will be banned without second thought.
There will be elections held for the positions of: Head Recruiter, World Assembly Delegate, and Maps man(Only job is to create a regional map).
This is my first time creating a region, so bear with me here. I&amp;#39;d be more than happy to receive help.
