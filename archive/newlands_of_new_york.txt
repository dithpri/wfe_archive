Just 5 miles from the coast of Montauk, New York, the Newlands of New York were created to deal with the overpopulation and exhaust of resources in New York&amp;#39;s boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. These Newlands are two different artificially built islands that surround the Block Island Sound. They expand over 600 acres, over roughly 12 times the size of Manhattan, and have over a combined 14 million residents.
