The Commonwealth of the Doodium exists to maintain the peace on the continent of Doodium, though it remains a fragile deterrence from war. The Great Doodium War, which saw the Federal Republic of Piovia, the Kingdom of Skattenburg, and the Republic of Mooloogers fight against the Grand Duchy of Valwyck and the Republic of Bobeia, is still remembered with distaste from both sides of the war. The People&#39;s Republic of Trinico had remained neutral during the war, and was the seat of the peace negotiations. The Republic of Asian Nothria was created as a militarized buffer state between Piovia and Valwyck as a result of the peace treaty.
