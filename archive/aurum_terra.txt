Welcome by [b][nation]Granduchy[/nation].[/b]

[b][region]Aurum Terra[/region][/b], which transcends ethnic, religious, social, and educational divisions, promotes moral and spiritual development by preaching the brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God. This noble [i]&#147;borderless brotherhood&#148;[/i] is most relevant in today&#146;s uncertain world of sectarian and ethnic strife to promote universal peace, understanding, and unity.

The three grand principles of [b][region]Aurum Terra[/region][/b] are [b]brotherly love[/b] [i](being tolerant and behaving with kindness and understanding to fellow beings)[/i]; [b]relief[/b] [i](acting charitably towards both own brethren and the community at large)[/i]; and [b]truth[/b] [i](striving for truth in all matters, demonstrating integrity in daily actions, and adhering to high moral standards)[/i].
