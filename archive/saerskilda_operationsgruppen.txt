In return these operators are offered a place in an elite unit which has conducted operations both outside and in the visibility of the public eye. Anyone who does not meet the standard will be sent away immediately, but new recruits are welcome and will be trained accordingly, and will be allowed to stay if they demonstrate capability which is up to standard with the rest of the unit.[hr]SOG is [region]Little Sweden[/region]&#39;s elite special operations unit responsible for regional defence, covert, inter-regional and assault operations.
