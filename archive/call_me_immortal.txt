[b][i][color=#ffad16]You carry me away
Tomorrow we&#39;re unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul - you make me whole
I want to live this second forever, always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait[/color][/i][/b]
