Welcome to The United Forces of the Supreme Yoda! We currently are open to all nations (regardless of thier past), and we are one of the few regions that is a &quot;progressing democracy&quot;. We have a Chancellor (ask him if you are unsure of something), WA delegate (ask him if you want to propose regional legislation), and a Founder (ask him for everything).

Some initiation stuff:

All members must take a non mandatory placement test that does not affect you if you score negatively, but will boost you up if you do well. The highest recorded score on the placement test is 75% (Numairica). Each test is different.
