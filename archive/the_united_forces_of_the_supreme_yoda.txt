For Yodas only &amp;lt;&not;_&not;&amp;gt;:

Welcome to The United Forces of the Supreme Yoda! We currently are open to all nations (regardless of thier past), and we are one of the few regions that is a &quot;progressing democracy&quot;. We have a Chancellor (ask him if you are unsure of something), But no WA Delegate. The password is &quot;theyodamovie&quot; to discourage raiders. Also the WA has no powers (all are in a separate office), so raiders stay away.
