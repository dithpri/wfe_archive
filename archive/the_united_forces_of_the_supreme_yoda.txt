For Yodas only &amp;lt;&not;_&not;&amp;gt;:

Welcome to The United Forces of the Supreme Yoda! We currently are open to all nations (regardless of thier past), and we are one of the few regions that is a &quot;progressing democracy&quot;. We have a Chancellor (ask him if you are unsure of something), WA delegate (ask him if you want to propose regional legislation), and a Founder (ask him for everything).

We just had a regional war. And I really don&#39;t want to execute order 72. So just voice your opinions on the message board without staging a revolt.

PLEASE do [u]not[/u] give away who owns a country.
