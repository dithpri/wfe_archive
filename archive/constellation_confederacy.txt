Welcome to the Constellation Confederacy on the beautiful Koplan Plateau! We are a region filled with rich history and lore. This region is not necessarily meant to be completely cooperative, but instead encourages independence, and creating your history and path. All nations follow service as duty, where the service you do for others rewards your country back, sort of like karma. Please know that this region is very new, and the stories and roles that find their place here are still a Work in Progress. We do not encourage toxicity, but we do tolerate memes and casual RP, so as long as you&#39;re not a jerk, you should be good to go here.
