The Grand Unified Pact of Naive Dehz is a thriving community of nations which are militant, and ready to no-scope at a moment&#39;s notice. Created after the great fall of Dz_Ritz (originally known as hd_novaswift, then Snow Mako, then Kona, then Ritzy, then Vatican Ritz, then Uprise Ritz), in the late 2015, Naive Dehz is a region booming with young, energetic quickscopers and instaswapers. The only universal law in the region is no reg gunning, this is punishable by death by Hunter Killer Drone.
