Overview of the World of Lumin:

[b]&quot;Oh mighty Sun, blazing tyrant of the heavens, your scorching gaze penetrates all that dares to live beneath you! You, the relentless eye in the sky, the furious heart of day itself, unyielding and unforgiving, granting life and snatching it away in equal measure! We, your trembling creatures, spin in awe and terror of your radiant wrath, praying you never dim but fearing your furious, unquenchable blaze!&quot;[/b]

Heil the Sun,
