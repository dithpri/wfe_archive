The Island is largely unmapped and undiscovered. Only certain sections of the giant island have civilization.
The Natives are mostly primal and aggressive, but a few are ready to accept civilization. 
The terrain is full of frozen forrests, frozen lakes, and frozen mountains. The entire island is covered in snow and ice.
Can you map the island?
