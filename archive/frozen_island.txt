[color=blue] Welcome to the island. We are a largely unmapped and inhospitable people. You&#39;ll find the frozen waters, plants, and people to be common here. 
The nations here are constantly at war with each other, and tensions run high. However, if you are willing to deal with -10 F temperatures and looming war, there is a lot to be found here in on the Frozen Island. The resources are plentiful and valuable. 
Our Oil and coal mines are unmatched. Jewels and precious metals are abundant and lying around. Our waters are plentiful with fish (Except near Loventia). The forests are full of critters, and geothermal energy can be used to procure undergrounding farming. Life on the island is not easy, but rewarding. [/color]
