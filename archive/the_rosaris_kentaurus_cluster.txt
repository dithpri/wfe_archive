The Rosaris Kentaurus Cluster, a lonesome corner of undefined space that is home to many interstellar powers and species of varying type. You are welcome to move here if you so choose to do so, we welcome everyone from Terrans, to Anthros, to Ponies, to whatever the heck that thing is.

Feel free to spark up a conversation, make yourself at home, just don&amp;#39;t burn the place down with the waffle iron.
