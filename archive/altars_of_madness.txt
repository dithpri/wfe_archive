A kind and friendly nation that is named after the Morbid Angel album of the same name. In this region, we kill for gain and shoot to maim. We don&#39;t need a reason! However, if you try to rebel against us, you&#39;ll be reduced to a shell of a man or be hanged for your bloody treason. I  may be a public leader but I report to Exodus guitarist Gary Holt. If you join, you must be oppressive to the citizens. SHOW THEM ALL YOUR POWER!!! For example, legalizing marijuana and allowing children to gamble.
