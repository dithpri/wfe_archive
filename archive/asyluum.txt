[B]Hug A Zombie[/B]
In Asyluum we do not believe the Z-Virus is real, let alone deadly. Allow me to quote from the small-print of the propaganda emerging out of the institutionalised establishment: https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=30225910#p30225910

&quot;your nation&#39;s population will revert to normal after the event is over&quot; - proof positive this is one great hoax in order to purge unwanted peoples from the system!

Pro-Zombie nations and victims of ethnic purges based on fallacious diagnoses of infection may find sanctuary in the region of Asyluum. You have to behave, promise not to kill any zombies, and piss off next Wednesday when it&#146;s all over.
