  When you are part of this region, we treat you like family. When you leave you are still a friend. Here, all are welcome, though it is recommended small nations come here to grow. We have a simple set of ideas.. The government shouldn&amp;#39;t have a say in our everyday lives and taxes should be low. 

RULES ARE:

1. No cursing.
2. Treat other members with respect.
3. Please do not insult our allies or our leaders.
4. If you violate any of these three simple rules. You&amp;#39;ll be kicked.

We will be with you in all of your battles, whether you stay in this region, or decide to leave. This is a great place for small nations to start-off and form alliances that will last a long time. JOIN NOW
