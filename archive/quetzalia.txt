Made up of various nations, Quetzalia was once a proud kingdom before economic breakdown and civil war, which killed its national animal, the leviathan. The region, located in the barren South, was split after a large area of oil was discovered, the resulting war wreaked havoc on the citizens. North Quetzal took most of the land but the rest was split into segments. The south was ruled much like Panem, but an uprising split the nation again. Now many powerful world forces seek to try and found their nations and micro nations here, but often many are destroyed by the barren forces of North Quetzal.
