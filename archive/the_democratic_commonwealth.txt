Today [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]Sparkalia[/region] tried to find some chaos in your region!

We tried splitting atoms, potatoes and even cash to find the mystical concept called cuteness. if something were split into two, that would surely mean twice the chance to find cuteness!

[color=aqua]In exchange for camping in your region, we left you this nice WFE and some cookies![/color]

If you would like to hang out to find cute things together, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
