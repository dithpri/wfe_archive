The Country of Cilivos was a peaceful country who didn&#146;t have a specific leader or party, so they decided to elect one.

Civil war broke out on whether Cilivos should be governed by communism or capitalism.

The bloodbath of the war ended after a year of battle.

The country was split into two nations, Enartopia, which is governed by communism and Davros, governed by capitalism.

After years of peace, Enartopia became relentless and declared war on Davros to unite both nations into a communist dictatorship regime.
