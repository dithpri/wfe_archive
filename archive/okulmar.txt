Okulmar is a region founded by Dranolleth. We support humanisitic traditions of the enlightement, which we could summarize in the motto &quot;[i]Libert&eacute;, fraternit&eacute;, egalit&eacute;[/i]&quot; of the French Revolution. We also proudly boast the Rank badges for top 5 % in Nudity and World Assembly Endorsements, then the top 10 % in Pacifism, Compassion, Weather, Tourism, Niceness, Environmental Beauty, Eco-Friendliness, Lifespan and Inclusiveness. All in all, we are just another brick in the NationStates wall.
