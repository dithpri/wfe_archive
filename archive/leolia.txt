Welcome one and all to Leolia!  We&#39;re a community open to all, as such we have a regional discord and will have a map soon enough.  Stay up to date with our regional news letter and enjoy yourself in an open and accepting community!  Everyone is welcome regardless of race, gender or past.  For many we are an option, for some we are a chance for a new start.  However regardless of why your here or how you got here we are happy your here.  Our Flag shall fly ever higher, for it represents Equality, Fraternity, Strength and Health.
