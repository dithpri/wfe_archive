The Bahamas.

This region is closed. It will be opened to other nations at a much later date. The nations currently in the region are controlled by the founder, and are gathering influence so that when the password is removed the region&amp;#39;s members could not be ejected and the region destroyed and taken within a couple updates. This is needed to keep the region safe since the founder chose to give up powers in order to make the game more interesting. 

Stand by for opening,
