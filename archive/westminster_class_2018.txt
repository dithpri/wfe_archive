We are learning about how politics works domestically and internationally. 
Internally via the consequences of decisions made and also via elections.
Externally through the way in which your countries interact with each other via regions, endorsements, embassies.
Do not forget your assignment comparing this to Australia.
I have discovered that I cannot sack myself!! I will need to look further into this and will not make any decisions (bar poll issues based on Australian politics) until I can work out how to be removed from office. As such i will act like the Governor General and approve all that the leaders decide. We still need to get 4 other nominations for office.
