A pact forged in principle, not conquest. The Accord unites sovereign nations under a shared code of honor, balance, and resilience. Though its people prize peace, they are not strangers to war &#151; only reluctant masters of it. Rooted in ancient traditions and real-world ideologies, The Aurelian Accord blends cultural richness with martial discipline. Its citadels are quiet. Its banners are not raised in aggression, but in warning: Peace is sacred. But it is not free.
