You are travelling through hills. A lot of hills. There is nothing but trees and hills for miles. You are beginning to wonder if you&amp;#39;re in the beginning of a horror movie. BUT suddenly, as if out of no where, you stumble upon a sleepy little place where there is literally nothing to do or see (except there are people there!) Welcome to Clintonia, where the regions are diverse but all the people are similar (in an almost uncomfortable way)! We try not to fight and to agree on things, [i]hopefully[/i]. Send us a telegram, sit and chat a while. It&amp;#39;s not like there&amp;#39;s anything better to do!
