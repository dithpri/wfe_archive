Welcome to the Phalanx! 
There are a few basic rules for this region. 
1. This is a strongly anti-communist region. Any attempts by communists to secretly enter this region will be met with ejection immediately.
2. The official ideology of this region is Falangism, which the moderator accepts as a right-wing ideology, not third position as it is sometimes claimed. Also, this is a pro-Franco region. 
3. Not all members need be Falangists. Monarchists, constitutional monarchists, and followers of other conservative ideologies shall all be accepted here. 
4. No National Socialists, White Supremacists, or other neo-Pagan nations shall be welcome. All who join from those ideologies shall be ejected immediately.
