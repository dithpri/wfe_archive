The Balts, a region created by The New Livonia, beautifully combines 21st-century technology with 20th-century architecture. 
Imagine cities with Art Deco and Mid-Century Modern buildings, vintage street lamps, and neon signs, yet filled with high-speed internet, electric trams, and smart homes. Historic theaters and retro diners coexist with cutting-edge medical facilities and interactive public spaces. 
Schools look old-fashioned but use virtual reality for lessons. The Balts offer the charm of the past with the conveniences of the future, making it a unique and captivating place to live, aimed at preserving the golden age of Livonia and other Baltic people.
