Welcome to this temporary refuge from original Hogarahoiprash, while it is being refounded.

Visit http://hogarahoiprashforums.webs.com/ to relive the First World Melee and other glorious days, in vintage black and white film.

Pass the time at our many quaint gift shoppes and museums, or relax in our thermal spring spas.

I believe we have the odd Swiss Alp, making this the ideal destination for an interregional summit.

BYO penguins.
