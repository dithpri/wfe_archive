Welcome to UK Office a region based on that of a future Great Britan founded in 3049 (not really). We are a combination of China, the US, and the UK. We combined by taking the 3 nations and creating an island and moving our supplies to it. We are named UK Office because the Prime Minister of the UK at the time was Mr. Pres E. Dint and he became President of UK Office. Mr. Pres. E. Dint is the Leader of Industrial Britain, essentially making him me. We have or will have Regional Government. There are many opportunities you have as a citizen like voting, answering polls, and suggesting amendments to add to our constitution. So what are you waiting for? Join UK Office and take part in social gameplay. Why?! Just Because.
