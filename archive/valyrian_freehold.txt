[i]We are the blood of Old Valyria and we will take that which we are entitled.[/I]

Founded by the [nation]valyrian stronghold[/nation] and its allies, the Freehold of Valyria intends to break the wheel of petty power grabbing and create an environment free of its wanton destruction of the principles of equality, security, and order. We want to build a new world where citizens are free to participate in their government, a government which works to protect the rights of the governed, and a government which listens to the desires of its citizens. The official greeting of this region is &quot;Fire and Blood&quot;.

Okey dokey!
