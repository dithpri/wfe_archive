Honestly, only reason this region exists is because I&#39;m too stubborn to let this nation die out even though I do absolutely nothing with it and don&#39;t want to sit in the rejected realms after my home region was invaded somehow... In other words: no embassies, no joining, and pretty much nothing in general. This just simply exists out of stubbornness. That is all, good day.
