Established in the peace treaty of a lengthy civil war, the Federation of Saarehon has superceded the Kingdom of Saarehon, whose rather autonomous vassals have become involuntary member states of the new nation. The nation is led by the permanent Head of Government, the Republic of Edirne, who led The Left Coalition in the civil war and whose ambassadors drafted the peace treaty. The apathetic King exercises no real power, and simply confirms the appointments of the Head of Government into cabinet positions.
