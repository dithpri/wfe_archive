This small, humble region of only three countries was founded at 8:14 EST, September 6, 2021. Understandably, the area is completely controlled by Occidencial Rhullia, Greater USSR, and Gabmen Villa, however, elections are held every three months, if any new nations have joined. Marzinnia tolerates role-play, however, speaking of the &#39;real world&#39; is strictly prohibited. 
Welcome to Northwest Marzinnia, we hope you enjoy your stay here!
