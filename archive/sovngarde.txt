The menace of [b]The Black Riders[/b] has been [i]repelled[/i] by the will of the Divines. 

Through sword and shield, the heavens defended the halls of Sovngarde. 

Unrelenting, Talos will bring justice upon those that are unrighteous.

[hr]

[i]Hearken now, sons of snow, as the scrolls have foretold of this day...[/i]

Sovngarde, hall of the relentless, the unyielding, the nords.

Where the mead flows freely and the laughter unending.
