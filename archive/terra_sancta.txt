The land of faith, love, and acceptance.

Dei omnia amat!

Know that God loves all, regardless of faith, creed, race, wealth,  sexual preference, or identity.

You are judged for your soul and your actions, and love is not a sin (between consenting adults)

God doesn&#39;t need worship, for you worship through good deeds. Nice atheists go to heaven, and if Gandhi was damned for being a Hindu, then i&#39;m a mentally challenged ferret that works at Walmart.

May Faith light your life, and God bring  you comfort

-Fides ut lux , et introducam vos consolantem.
