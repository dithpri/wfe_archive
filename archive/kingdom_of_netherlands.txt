[b]After Belgium&#146;s independence in 1839, the Kingdom of the Netherlands formed, roughly as today&#146;s 12 provinces (Luxembourg split in 1890). Amsterdam was the capital, The Hague the government seat, Dutch the official language, with northern Protestants and southern Catholics. William I abdicated; William II&#146;s 1848 constitution limited royal power and set up parliamentary democracy, followed by William III and then Queen Wilhelmina. The monarchy became constitutional, the homeland stable, and the economy relied on colonial revenues and port trade despite slow industrialization.[/b][hr]
