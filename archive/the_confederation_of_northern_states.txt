A small but close-knit region, the CNS is accepting of all ideas and beliefs. Any nation is allowed to lead themselves as they wish when a part of the alliance, however they are expected to assist other nations of the confederation who may need help. Nations wishing to join must be approved by the state which holds the primary seat, and will then be given access.

May you prosper in your endeavours.
