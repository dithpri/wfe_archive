Feel free to join our role play! anybody can run for a minister (homeland, regional, defense, diplomatic, world assembly/congregational, Deputy Prime, Prime, transportation), and if you are active enough, you can very easily become a SP. We strongly encourage inviting your friends over. If you find something glitchy in our region, or someone breaking our code(look in regional dispatches) contact me and our trustworthy CSI and DA ([nation]Flash CW[/nation] and [nation]Black Canary CW[/nation]) If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me.
