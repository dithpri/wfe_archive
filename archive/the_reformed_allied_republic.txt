[color=#08149b][b]Welcome to the Reformed Allied Republic.[/color][/b] 

[hr]The Reformed Allied Republic is a fledgling region founded by the former Delegate of the Allied Republic. Here, we seek to be an active community of like-minded politicians and problem solvers who always seek to make our region and respective nations better. Together we can accomplish so much, and together we can create our future. While we are an open region, we ask that all member nations respect each other as fellow citizens.

[hr]All member nations are asked to join the World Assembly and endorse our current World Assembly Delegate. Elections for official positions are held on a monthly basis.
