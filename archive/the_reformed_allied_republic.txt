[color=#08149b][b]Welcome to the Reformed Allied Republic.[/color][/b] 

[hr]The Reformed Allied Republic is a fledgling region founded by the former Delegate of the Allied Republic. Here, we seek to be an active community of socially conservative politicians and problem solvers who always seek to make our region and respective nations better. Together we can accomplish so much, and together we can create our future. While we want you to always speak your mind, we ask that all member nations respect each other as fellow citizens. 

[hr]All member nations are asked to join the World Assembly and endorse our current World Assembly Delegate.
