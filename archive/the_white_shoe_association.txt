We are a region where you can have fun or debate, or both if you&#39;re like [i]that[/i]. I like people and so do you, so we can chat! All political views are welcome to be discussed, just don&#39;t be mean about it. Thanks.

We like people so much that we want embassies, too. We really want people here to debate with and talk to. That also means nations from embassy regions should post, by the way.

You can post in English or German here, but if you do post in German [nation]Einalim[/nation] might be the only person to understand.
