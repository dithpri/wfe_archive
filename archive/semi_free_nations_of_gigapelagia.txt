The Semi-Free Nations of Gigapelagia (SFNG) are a loose collective of island nations spanning an enormous archipelago known as the eponymous Gigapelagia, or informally known as the &amp;quot;Big G&amp;quot;. The islands vary in size, climate and culture, even containing a few continent-sized landmasses that the founding Most Serene Republic of Kwashiorkistan has thus far refused to identify as anything other than &amp;quot;extremely large islands&amp;quot;.

The main trait of these islands is at least 60% of them have been host to a brutal dictatorship, ethnic cleansing or violent revolution - and the other 40% probably soon will.
