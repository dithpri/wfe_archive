[b]The Sacred Order was one a large mighty region created by the union of the [region]New Celtic Order[/region] and the [region]Sacred Order of Fire[/region], but one day, the Regions founder [nation=short]Alpha_Wolf[/nation] went crazy, and banjected every single nation from the region.
All those of NCO that put their faith in letting alpha be the founder, and all those of alphas old region, who trusted him and never expected him to do such a thing, were disappointed.
Alpha cleared the region leaving it to be a void wasteland and moved on, like he has done two times before this.

A month later, the old citizens of the order who are now residing in [region]The Mystical Council[/region] reclaimed the region, leaving it to be an old memory of their past glory days.[/b]
