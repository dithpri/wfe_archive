Rejoice! At appx. 1:35 AM EDT on Oct 30th, we managed to cure ALL of the remaining infected, with the bombing of the final group of undeads of [nation]Muir Republic[/nation]. This is a time for celebration. So get out your party hats, and pray to god that a horde nation doesn&amp;#39;t get through our screening process!

Borders will remain closed until the worldwide apocalypse ends.
