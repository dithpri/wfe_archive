During the Third Elections for Delegate, I thought of an interesting idea: to isolate ourselves from the WA and go our own way, establishing our own mini-World Assembly exclusive to the USMR. I believe this would benefit us in the long run, we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to deal with the idiocy of WA members. We would also be able to just install our own regional laws, so we wouldn&amp;#39;t be subject to some of the stupider laws of the WA. I have set up a voting form here, please respond! http://tinyurl.com/ohbytpp
