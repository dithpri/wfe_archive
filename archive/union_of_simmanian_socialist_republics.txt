To save the USMR population, please [b]RESEARCH[/b] a cure for the zombie population! Those that choose to embrace the zombie hordes simply to willfully destroy the region (griefers) may be ejected and banned.

After a recent incident, I have decided to warn any nation that receives a telegram asking for the password to join the region to [b]please check the nation&amp;#39;s history, infected status, etc. before giving them the password.[/b] Failure to do so could mean big consequences for the region.
