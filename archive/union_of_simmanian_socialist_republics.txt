(This applies to WA members of the region only) The second annual election of the USMR delegate begins! To elect your delegate, send him an endorsement on his nation page. The nation with the most endorsements by Nov. 11th will become our second delegate! Please note that the founder in (in this case Zuid California) is not eligible for delegacy, and will not vote unless a tiebreaker is needed.
