The second annual WA delegate election begins! Send your vote in [url=http://form.jotform.co/form/33147680088863]here[/url], and at the end, I will send a single endorsement to the nation who has received the most votes!
(NOTE: With this system, you will need to renounce any existing endorsements on a nation, and also non-WA members will be able to vote.)
