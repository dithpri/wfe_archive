The Valk Septentrional States, or VSS for short, is a free union of states featuring a predominant Valktic ethnicity. The VSS was formed after the People&#39;s Republic of Valkiryat has achieved an union treaty with neighboring unrecognized states. In exchange for their sovereignty, economical and political independence, they would form a close alliance with Valkiryat, coexist in a state of peace and replace their old government with a one-party political system promoting the numerous aspects of Rupertist Socialism.
