Welcome to the Galactic Imperial Union!

We all come together unified under one Galactic order, to ensure peace across the region. Every day we must fight to uphold the laws and code of ethics put forth by the Imperial Senate and myself the Grand Emperor.

We will work together for our future. You have my word that the Galactic Imperial Union will be safe for new ideas to be shared amongst peers. After all I am solely here to ensure the peace is kept, and our borders, as well as way of life is kept safe. 

We will stand the test of time united as one Imperial Union!
