Punjpeya is a region for nations that want to collaboratively develop a regions history. The idea is that new nations outline their vision for their nation and then discuss/RP/co-write how their nation fits into the tapestry of the rest of the region.

As this is a new region there is some flexibility in set up, but ideally nations will find a place near or next to another nation or nations that they can develop history with.
