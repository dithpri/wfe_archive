[b][i]*tap*[/i] Hello, hello? Is this thing on? I wish it wasn&#39;t. Some grumpy assassins from [region]the Brotherhood of Malice[/region] have decided to come visit you. They didn&#39;t really want to though, so count yourselves lucky that they chose your region specifically.

Come visit us in our hideout, the only place where our hoods come off: https://discord.gg/brotherhoodofmalice
