Amerrique is a RP-heavy region where nations are allowed to develop before participating in roleplay with others. The region is dominated by modern nations ruled by regional natives. Occasionally culturally unified nations were established by diplomacy or by force, but much of Amerrique is Balkanized based on culture and tradition. In addition, there are small enclaves of independent Europeans on the coasts and rarely inland. Password is given on request after some vetting. Nations that match the region&#39;s theme are more than welcome. Future regions of a non-Columbian world could be interacted with at a later point depending on activity.
