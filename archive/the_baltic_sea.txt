Also known as The Fourth Reich, located in the northern Baltic Sea is a chain of islands recently discovered by Swedish Admiral General Ingemar Lindblom and German General Labrecque on their explorations in the Baltic Sea. The region of the Baltic Sea is mostly Prusoland as well as its close neighbors and allies. Many uninhabited islands are also in the region as well as the Lindblom archipelago and the Fusrodahsian island chain, and the strategic Labrecque strait near the entrance of the Baltic Sea,which Prusoland is controlling trade in and out of the region with an iron fist. 
After the emergence of Ortinberg, Prusoland quickly became allies and began their  unmatched rule in the Baltic Sea.
