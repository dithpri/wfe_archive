The Baltic SEa was discovered by Swedish Admiral General Ingemar Lindblom and German General Labrecque on their exploration. The region of the Baltic Sea is mostly Prusoland as well as its close ally Ortinberg. Many uninhabited islands are also in the region: such as the Lindblom archipelago, the Fusrodahsian island chain, and the strategic Labrecque strait near the entrance of the Baltic Sea. Prusoland controls the straight and influences trade in and out of the region with an iron fist.
