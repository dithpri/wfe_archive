This region was first founded in 2004. A [b]Federal Empire[/b] is a classification that is rarely used by other nations and that is unique to [b][nation=noflag]New Zora[/nation][/b]. It describes an empire that is federated into multiple smaller, semi-independent kingdoms. While the emperor governs the overall empire and is responsible for foreign affairs, each kingdom is governed by a king who ensures that regional issues are paid enough attention.
