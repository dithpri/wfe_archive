Archomos is a new region created in 2015 - we may be small, but once we get a community, life here will be brilliant for you! 
Any nation can join this region, from Psychotic Dictatorships to Liberal Democratic Socialists. You will be welcomed warmly. You can&#39;t get ejected here.
The reason I founded this? I wanted independence from the big regions, where I was getting ignored. 
What about endorsements? I had 13, but I can live without them. All they do is (once you get two) let you submit a proposal for the WA to pass, but the chance of it getting accepted is around 5%, and once you&#39;re there, you only have a 50% chance of getting it passed!
If you too want independence from the giants, why not join Archomos?
