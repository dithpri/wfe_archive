We are a small region comprised of somewhat confused animals, minerals, and vegetables.  Visitors are welcome, but we don&#39;t exchange embassies unless we have a great deal in common with a region (which should probably worry those few regions with whom we do have embassies).  Please feel free to drop in, play Pooh Sticks, and enjoy muffins and mimosas.  But most of all, HAVE FUN[/b]
