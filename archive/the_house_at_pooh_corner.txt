You&amp;#39;d be surprised there&amp;#39;s so much to be done,
count all the bees in the hive,
chase all the clouds from the sky
[i] find a cure for the zombies[/i]

The House at Pooh Corner welcomes all those who have fluff for brains, like hunny and tut,tut think it looks like rain.  [i] Although, perhaps today, we just won&amp;#39;t mention the &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; word.[/i]   

Thanks for noticing us. [i] And maybe we&amp;#39;d just prefer to be unnoticed for the time being.[/i]
