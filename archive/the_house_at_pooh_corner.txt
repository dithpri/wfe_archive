You&amp;#39;d be surprised there&amp;#39;s so much to be done,
bring all the nations home
chase all the bad zombies from our region
reassure Zombie Kitten she is not a bad zombie and we love her.

At the 6 hour mark, we were number 1 for Most Survivors with No Infected.   Well done!

88th in the final tally for Most Survivors with No Infected!    

The following nations went forth selflessly to help other regions cure their bad zombie problem:
[nation]The Bottomless Hunny Pot[/nation]
[nation]The Captain-less Ship[/nation]
[nation]Rose from Devil Heart[/nation]
[nation]A ship of fools[/nation]
[nation]Bearistotle and Hebert[/nation]

We may be a small region, but we are mighty in heart!
