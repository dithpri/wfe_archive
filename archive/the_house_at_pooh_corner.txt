You&#39;d be surprised there&#39;s so much to be done,
Count all the bees in the hive,
Chase all the clouds from the sky

We are a small region comprised of somewhat confused animals, minerals, and vegetables. Visitors are welcome, but we don&#39;t exchange embassies unless we have a great deal in common with a region (which should probably worry those few regions with whom we do have embassies). Please feel free to drop in, play Pooh Sticks, and enjoy muffins and mimosas.
