[color=red]WELCOME TO THE GOTHIC STATES!!![/color]
(And no, not the emo-gothic. Look up gothic architecture or something, will you?)
[b]*Currently no delegate, although WA participation is recommended.
*The Gothic States is a new defender region, and a branch of the [region]Libertas[/region] Defense Core.
*Embassies with any and all regions are acceptable (besides with raiders, of course).
