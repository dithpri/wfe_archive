The Vampire Imperium is a multinational commonwealth in which vampires seek to peacefully coexist with humans, as well as other supernatural races who wish to ally with us, such as werewolves. While the Imperium is led by the High King of the Vampires, membership is open to any country, or species, that desires the protection and friendship of the creatures of the night.
