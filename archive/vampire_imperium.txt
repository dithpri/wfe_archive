The Vampire Imperium was recently liberated from North Pacific invaders by [nation]Vitalarium[/nation], our new WA Delegate. We will be updating our look and expanding our ranks as time goes by.

The Vampire Imperium is a multination collective in which vampires seek to peacefully coexist with humans, as well as other supernatural races who wish to ally with us, such as werewolves. While vampires rule from above, membership is open to any country who wishes to seek the friendship and protection of the creatures of the night.
