The [b]Vampire Imperium[/b] is a multinational collective dedicated to the peaceful coexistance of vampires and humans. Led by the [b]High King of the Vampires[/b], [nation]Vitalarium[/nation], the Imperium is open to all species seeking friendship or protection, from humans to werewolves.

Due to a history of formerly being a frequent target by raiders, Vampire Imperium is now password-protected. If you would like to join, just ask one of the member nations for the password. [nation]Vitalarium[/nation] will be happy to assist you, but due to copious amounts of World Assembly telegrams, your message may not be seen immediately. If you have not heard back within a week, send a follow-up message, or try contacting another member nation.

Please endorse [nation]Vitalarium[/nation] for World Assembly.
