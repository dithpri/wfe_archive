[color=#2E8B57][b]Hello, N&amp;#464; h&amp;#462;o (&amp;#20320;&amp;#22909;), Ol&aacute;, and Welcome to the [u]Official[/u] Macanese Hub of NationStates![/b]

Best known globally as the &#39;Vegas of China&#39;, the Macau Special Administrative Region is indeed a mecca of gambling and glitz. But the city is so much more than that. 

A Portuguese colony for more than 300 years, it is a city of blended cultures. Ancient Chinese temples sit on streets paved with traditional Portuguese tile. The sound of Cantonese fills the air on streets with Portuguese names. You can eat Chinese congee for breakfast, enjoy a Portuguese lunch of caldo verde soup and bacalhau (cod) fritters, and dine on hybrid Macanese fare such as minchi (ground beef or pork, often served over rice).
