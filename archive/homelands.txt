[b]New and recruiting! We welcome all nations willing to call this region their homeland. As founder I would like to thank our official founding fathers [Nation=Aticulpi] and [Nation=Viscondy] from Tezde and The North Pacific.
All WA members endorse Viscondy (if he&#39;s in the region.) Anyone not doing that by the time the founder returns will have their government position taken away from them.
[*]
You don&#39;t have to endorse Pokemanland!
Thanks!; )

[nation]The Lamparian Empire[/nation] is the new Emperor, and will be returning shortly from a trip to settle a feud between himself and [nation=Plugo][/b]
