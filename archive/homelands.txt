[b]New and recruiting! We welcome all nations willing to call this region their homeland. As founder I would like to thank [Nation=Aticulpi] and [Nation=Viscondy] from Tezde and The North Pacific.

Current events in Homelands:
 
[*]
Constitution finished!
[*]
The founder and prime minister are away, and we have no one to fill a vacancy in the security council!
[*]
All WA members endorse Viscondy, as he is the official delegate but doesn&#39;t have enough endorsements to maintain that position.
[*]
[nation]The Lamparian Empire[/nation] is current emperor
[*]
Hope you enjoy your time in Homelands![/b]
