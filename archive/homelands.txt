New and recruiting! We welcome all nations willing to call this region their homeland. As founder I would like to thank our official founding fathers [Nation=Aticulpi] and [Nation=Viscondy] from Tezde and The North Pacific.
All WA members endorse Viscondy and Aticulpi (if he&#39;s in the region.) If possible, please join the world assembly.
You don&#39;t have to endorse Pokemanland!
Thanks!; )
