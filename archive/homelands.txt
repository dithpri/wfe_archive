New and recruiting! We welcome all nations who are willing to call this region Homelands, except nazis. They are not cool.
We are the proud conquerors of [Region= United States of Tyranny] before handing it over to Tezde.

Current events in Homelands: 
[*] We are NOT at war! However, there have been tensions and threats of war which we have worked to resolve so, just in case, we need more nations to help! 

[*] We have a backup region! If we are invaded, all nations should move to [Region=The Homelands]

[*] Lampar has been banned for declaring war on his own region!

[*] We have room in the security council

Alert level: Medium

All players join the WA and endorse Delegate Viscondy! Otherwise, we may be invaded!
Help recruit! 
               
              Have fun in Homelands!
