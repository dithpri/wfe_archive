[b]I have been given the governorship of the region of Homelands. Anyone who wishes to return to the region is free to telegram me and move, regardless of the situation when they enter. I thank all those who have been graceful to the region and I hope to positively effect the region as much as circumstances and events permit.[/b] -[nation]Viscondy[/nation]
