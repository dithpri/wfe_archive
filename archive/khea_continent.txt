Do you wanna be in a continent filled with nations older then the sky(were not),then join Khea continent.
Khea has been ruled by the twinghunjians and stormians for a long time until the great war,
after that tiny nations have gottten more power and stormia is gone,but they had a sister nation called windia so theyre called the dictatorship stormia and windia or smthg like that,dont worry theyre jsut a show off theyre weak as hell.
ANYWAY IF UR NEW JOIN US bcs were WEAK after all these years so you should help the khean continent rise again

were mostly new so come and be bad at game with us
