&quot;May the DIC grow!&quot; 
The Dictatorial Independent Confederation is a place for dictatorships that simply want to dictate in peace without the interference of other &quot;free&quot; nations. Dictators of the world, rule with those that share values similar to your own. Or, if your government differs with another within the region, discuss it peacefully in the message board (war is always an option, though). If you want to lead with pure malevolence, go on ahead. If you wish to truly provide the safety your people need through a strong, benevolent leader, do as you please. In the DIC, you are free.
