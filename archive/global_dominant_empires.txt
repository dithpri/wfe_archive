The Region of Global Dominant Empires was founded on the belief that a coalition of higher power nations can rule over other nations indirectly but effectively. This influence can come in the form of negotiation, assistance, or fear.

Global Dominant Empires was formed in April of 2015. The nations of this region are free to pass their own laws as they see fit in their nations, but any nation is open to criticize another. No one nation shall be oppressed or assisted any more than another nation. Until the region of Global Dominant Empires received a World Assembly delegate, the nations of the region are not required to abide by World Assembly or Security Council laws, unless the leader of the nation is a delegate themself.
