The lower Ohio River just below Louisville is obstructed by rapids known as the Falls of the Ohio where the elevation falls 26 feet (7.9 m) in 2 miles (3.2 km) restricting larger commercial navigation, although in the 18th and early 19th century its three deepest channels could be traversed by a wide variety of craft then in use. Completion of the Louisville and Portland Canal in 1830 (and later the McAlpine Locks and Dam), bypassing the rapids, allowed even larger commercial and modern navigation from the Forks of the Ohio at Pittsburgh to the Port of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi on the Gulf of Mexico. The name &quot;Ohio&quot; comes from the Seneca, Ohi:yo&#39;, lit. &quot;Good River&quot;.
