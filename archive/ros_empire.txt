[color=blue]The Ros Empire is a proud Irish, Imperial, majority Catholic region, however in the true Irish fashion, the region is welcome to anyone who wishes to live. While the region is ruled by the Emperor who wields large amounts of power, the region also has many aspects of democracy, such as a Taoiseach (prime minister) who is elected by vote. [/color]
