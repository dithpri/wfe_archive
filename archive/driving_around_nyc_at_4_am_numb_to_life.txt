What even is life anymore
There are no days of the week, just light out and dark out
Breakfast at 7:30 PM
AM and PM what&#39;s even the difference
Honking at cars stopping for a red light
Why do people do 30 in a 55
It&#39;s really a 75
No, I am not going to pick up a hitchhiker on a rando South Bronx street at 3:49 AM
I will live long enough to pay $20 to cross a bridge
Is that a dead body in the Hudson
Probably but who even cares
When you miss your turn but don&#39;t care and circle back a few blocks down
Yes I am only making this region to get my main legendary in S3
Why is my main still epic trash
Who do I complain to
Do they take complaints before 4 AM
You know what happens at 4 AM
Driving around NYC at 4 AM numb to life
