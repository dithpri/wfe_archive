We are what we call say, an alliance of Nations. No matter the type, all are welcome. Young, Old who cares. We as individuals need to unite under the banner of New Indochina and thus, remove any possible threats against us. Here, I invite you as a envoy to join us. Let go of any possible petty rivalries you may have. And leave these petty world assembly nations behind!
