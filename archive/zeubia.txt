Zeubia and it&amp;#39;s nations support a balance of civil rights, economy and political freedoms. No one thing is more important than the other. Here in Zeubia, we treat the people of our nations with the utmost respect and kindness, except when they&amp;#39;re undead. Then we blast them with bazookas.
