Named after the world the Ancients in Stargate Atlantis left their city on, Lantea is a massive region mostly dominated by oceans--but several series of islands and a single massive continent exist.

Lantea is rich in resources and the oceans feature several spots for massive geothermal energy production facilities. 

There is also a rumour that Atlantis may still lie at the bottom of the oceans here. But due to advanced cloaking technology developed by the Ancients, it remains hidden.
