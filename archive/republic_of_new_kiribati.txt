[b]New Kiribati[/b], formally the Republic of New Kiribati, is a sovereign state in Micronesia in the focal Pacific Ocean. The state contains 32 atolls and reef islands and one raised coral island, Banaba. They have an all-out land territory of 800 square kilometres (310 sq mi) and are scattered over 3.5 million square kilometres (1.3 million square miles). Their spread straddles both the equator and the 180th meridian, despite the fact that the International Date Line goes around Kiribati and swings far toward the east, nearly achieving the 150&deg;W meridian. This brings the Line Islands into a similar day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati ended up free from the United Kingdom in 1979 and reformed in 2048 due to global warming.
