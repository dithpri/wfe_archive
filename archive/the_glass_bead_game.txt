The region&amp;#39;s new, the founder&amp;#39;s unique, you are welcome here.

Back in the early days of NS, the founder help establish the constitution and some of the cabinet offices in Canada. However, after not playing NS for eight years he is looking to explore the features that have been added to the game since. Max says there are even more new features on the way ([url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=news/2014/06/17/index.html]NS News[/url]). Who knows, things could get interesting....

The region is a clean canvas. The hope is it will become a fun and creative space. 

If you&amp;#39;d like to lend a hand, please have a seat around the campfire. *hands you a glass of wine I&amp;#39;ve been saving for a special occasion*

So, what do you think we should do next?
