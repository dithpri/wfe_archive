One thousand years before the onslaught of the Clone Wars,the dark age of the galaxy came to an end. The Sith, an ancient order of malevolent Force-practitioners, were defeated after their birth in the Hundred-Year Darkness and driven into hiding, but the then galactic government, known as the &quot;Old Republic&quot; also fell. Following the collapse of that government and a full-scale war, a number of solar systems united, founding a successor state: the Old Galactic Republic. As its governing body, the newly reorganized government established the Galactic Senate, the members of which were elected to represent their nations. The Republic&#39;s capital was installed on the nation of Bulforia, which had already existed for several thousands of years.
