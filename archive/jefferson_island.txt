Jefferson Island is a salt dome located in Iberia Parish, in Southern Louisiana. The term &#147;Island&#148; is a bit of a misnomer, as Jefferson Island is not actually an island at all, but rather a protruding salt dome which stands out from the surrounding landscape. This salt dome was formed through the slow evaporation of the ocean which once covered the area, and it is are a substantial natural resource.
