[color=CA0A0A][b]The Federation of Progressive Nations has now relocated to Olympia in the form of Nova Federatus[/b][/color]

This region has ceased to function in this form and is kept for historical preservation by the Custodian of Historical Artifacts.

All nations still present in this defunct region are required to depart, preferably to Olympia, in 30 days time of the signing of the merger agreement. Failure to do so will result in forceable ejection.
