Our forum is in the making, when it does come out you will know by telegram and an announcement on the discord server with a link to it. You can roleplay if that&#39;s what your into on here. Bobspaotistan, me, will most likely not be doing the raids with you but as soon as we get enough people and nations will have a military and navy.
