[color=slategrey]The LOG, first formed in April of 2013, is a region meant to be a place for friendship and fun, where anyone can take off their boots and participate in a friendly community. LOG is a democracy with regular elections, and many are welcome to join and take part in our government. As of December 28, 2013, the region of League of Governments has officially closed. All of its properties and assets will continue to be administered by the [region]Trade Federation[/region] for possible reopening.[/color]
