[i]We swear on this sacred soil; to a plundered home, for families torn, of our culture erased, that from this moment onward we would be proud of Our Race, Our Heritage, Our Customs.

Together we pledge to battle oppression and to always be B.R.A.T.S - Bigtopians Rising Against Totalitarian Scum![/i]

Loud &amp; Proud. Brash &amp; Bold. Biscuits &amp; Bananas. Bumbling and Bellicose. Bigger &amp; Cleverer.

[b]WE ARE BIGTOPIA.[/b]
