Bigtopia was founded in 2005 by former members of [region]the Grenvali United[/region]. We were very active, with 100 nations. We defended ourselves and our allies. Later, we would controversially shift into an invading role, and lost many members. In 2006, I left the region to pursue my real life military career, and the region has atrophied for the last 12 years. Many foreign regions have invaded since.

Feel free to hang out with us if you like. [nation]Simonation[/nation] has been granted the authority he so desperately sought and campaigned for. Don&#39;t let us down man!

We are honored to still have three original members remaining:
[nation]Ironjustice[/nation]
[nation]Simonation[/nation]
[nation]DuckandCover[/nation]

Take care,
~Ironjustice
