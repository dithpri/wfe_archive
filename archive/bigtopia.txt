
[u][b]BIGTOPIA IS UNDERGOING A GOVERNMENT TRANSITION[/b][/u]

Welcome Foreign Delegates and Visitors alike! Welcome to the Region of Bigtopia! We ask for your patience and understanding during this transition. For the time being, all embassies have been shuttered and all embassy requests will be suspended. We look forward to normalizing foreign relations shortly.

The mission of this region is to preserve the storied history of Bigtopia. There are so many individual nations to recognize, and in time, we hope to accomplish just that. Once again, thank you for your patience.
