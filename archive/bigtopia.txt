Bigtopia is a small but storied region founded by [nation]Ironjustice[/nation] as a refuge from the power struggle within TGU. Early members included [nation]Archidamus[/nation], [nation]Tyoga[/nation], and [nation]Gur-Di-Pin[/nation]. Bigtopia built and maintained a sizeable military and was a dedicated defender.

Today, Bigtopia has become inactive. Only a handful of the original members remain, but the region is maintained for historical purposes.

In order to improve security, please endorse [nation]Archidamus[/nation].
