Contests are held for all Bigtopians to participate in, with winners decided by vote. Feel free to send a puppet nation our way if you wish to join in. Winners will receive fabulous prizes and their name forever archived.

Bigtopia was founded in 2005 by former members of [region]the Grenvali United[/region]. We were very active, with 100 nations. We defended ourselves and our allies. Later, we would controversially shift into an invading role, and lost many members. In 2006, I left the region to pursue my real life military career, and the region has atrophied for the last 12 years. Many foreign regions have invaded since.

Come waste your life with us.

We are honored to still have three original members remaining:
[nation]Ironjustice[/nation]
[nation]Simonation[/nation]
[nation]DuckandCover[/nation]

BOOLAH!
