The Region of Neo Christendom was founded in the year of our Lord and Savior 2015 for Disciples of Jesus Christ to have a nation to stand together in under one banner. 


Matthew 11:28-30 

&#147;Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.&#148;
