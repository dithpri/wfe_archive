In wake of the chaos that has erupted from [region]Lardyland[/region], I have taken it upon myself to reassemble a home for Lardyland&#146;s residents who are in search of a new home. Together our new region will grow to meet the needs of this new age! Perhaps in time we may rebuild the whole of Lardyland. However uninspiring it may be, any nation that seeks entry into this region must telegram [nation]Lard Savior[/nation].
