Neutral Cat region of the land!

Requirements: Be an autocratic, Capitalist, and have at least a good economy (less than that and unfortunately you go back where you came from). 

Exceptions: If your nation&#39;s definition of peoples are Cats or National animal is a cat then I will allow it.

If you meet those expectations, feel free to be welcome in the Neutral Region of Catsianic Land. (Password: Catsian)
