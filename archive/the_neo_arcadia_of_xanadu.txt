In The Neo Arcadia of Xanadu did Hopeless
A stately pleasure-dome decree:
From the sea to the mountain, from the vine to the sand, here lies our nations, with everything at hand. Our policies promote us, our culture unites us and so our prosperity defines us. Though our walls stand tall, a gun and missile at the ready, so too are our hands, ready to embrace on the whims of faith that you be a friend and not a foe, for our foes know that every man and woman stand ready to defend whats right. Our diversity is our strength, where every model and every statuette is tested and tried, until we find exactly what our people desire.
