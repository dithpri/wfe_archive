The Epidavros Limira is a peninsula in the southeast of the Peloponnese in Greece. It separates the Laconian Gulf in the west from the Aegean Sea in the east. The seas around the Epidavros Limira are notoriously treacherous and difficult to navigate, featuring variable weather and occasionally very powerful storms.
