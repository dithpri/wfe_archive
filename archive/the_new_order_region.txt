The New Order&nbsp;is the period of geopolitical tension between the&nbsp;United States of America, the&nbsp;Greater Germanic Reich, and the&nbsp;Empire of Japan&nbsp;that began following the end of the Second World War. The term&nbsp;cold war&nbsp;is used because there is no large-scale fighting directly between the three superpowers, they do however support regional conflicts and interfere in local national politics across the world to further their own spheres of influence.
