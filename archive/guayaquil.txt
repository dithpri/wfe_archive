[b]Note:[/b] None of my nations will be made available:
[list=1][*]Due to the game&#39;s security programs, shared nations are considered to be still owned by the old owner, and will cause havoc if one of the shared nations were to join the WA.
[*]I may want to revive any of these nations in the future for whatever reason.
[*]I use an old list regularly and it may not display that the nation in question was given away, thus I will no longer do that.[/list]
