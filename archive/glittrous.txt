[b]Glittrous[/b] is a fledgling region which two countries, the queendom of [i][nation]Floufi[/nation][/i] and the queendom of [i][nation]Vorstebrun[/nation],[/i] are currently in. The Glittrous regional flag has been &quot;carefully chosen&quot; (in the words of region founder Arimus Ezekiel) to represent the two queendoms. The top, pink color, stands for Floufi. The middle, black color, stands for Vorstebrun. The purpose of the last green color is currently unknown.

Arimus Ezekiel (who, if you did not remember from the last paragraph, is the founder of Glittrous) has stated that &quot;only closely known nations may be allowed in Glittrous.&quot;
