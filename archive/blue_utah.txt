Our motto is &quot;For those who hope for the politically impossible, but do not expect much.&quot;

In this region there are not as of yet many rules, except for one.  If and when you get into a discussion with someone of a different view point, you must respect the fact that they have a different view point and be respectful.  If you are caught breaking this first and great law, you will be expelled from this region with no hope of coming back.
