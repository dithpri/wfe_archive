[Intro: CaptainSparklez]
Creeper, oh, man

[Verse 1: TryHardNinja]
So we back in the mine
Got our pickaxe swingin&#39; from side to side, side, side to side
This task a grueling one, hope to find some diamonds tonight
Night, night, diamonds tonight
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up
Total shock fills your body
Oh, no, it&#39;s you again
I can never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes

[Chorus: TryHardNinja]
&#39;Cause baby tonight, the creepers tryin&#39; to steal all your stuff again
&#39;Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again
And run, run until it&#39;s done, done
Until the sun comes up in the morn&#39;
&#39;Cause baby tonight, the creepers tryin&#39; to steal all your stuff again
