Hi! This is a recruit frontier! Hopefully you find this one to be more silly than the others. This frontier is for [region]OrangeJuice[/region], an anti-fascist, inclusive region that strives to be a welcoming place for all kinds of nations! [color=red]We are a very small region looking to expand and grow our community.[/color] We are also working on a map, as war is raging in our ongoing roleplay in the RMB; learn more on our region page! No obligations, of course. We&#39;re just desperate for new members. :P

However, we have one request for you: please!!! Don&#39;t tell [i]ANYONE[/i] that we sent you! In fact, move over to one of our other frontier regions first:
[region]frontier oj5[/region]
[region]frontier oj4[/region]
[region]frontier oj3[/region]
[region]frontier oj2[/region]
[region]frontier oj1[/region]
Just for security measures! :D
