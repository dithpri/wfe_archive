FFPD ~ FLDP
Foedus Fidele Pacis Divinae ~ The Faithful League of Divine Peace

We are a friendly fellowship of Christian nations. We seek to reflect Christ&#146;s love in how we interact with one another and in the beautiful world of creation (John 13:34-35). Bear with one another in grace, and work towards peace and unity (Ephesians 4:3, Ephesians 4:32, 1 Thessalonians 5:11).

FFPD is open for everyone regardless of background, as all are called to being Christ&#39;s own. We do adhere to the [url=https://www.englishtexts.org/the-nicene-creed]Nicene Creed[/url] as the proclamation of divine truth though, and expect our members to do the same.

Welcome!
