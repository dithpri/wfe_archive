Catholicism is our religion.
Europe is the land of our people.

Members must, above all, accept Jesus Christ and His Catholic Church. 
Our European heritage is central to our identity as well. 

I hope you will consider joining our region if you meet the above requirements. Religion is non-negotiable, but we hope to work with our friends from around the world. 

(We do not condone racial violence or prejudice and respect people of all cultures.)
