The primary purpose of DATO is to provide a framework for member countries to collectively defend against external threats and promote regional security. DATO could have a governing body composed of representatives from each member country, who would meet regularly to discuss security issues, share intelligence, and coordinate military operations. A formal treaty would be drafted, outlining the responsibilities and obligations of member countries, as well as the procedures for resolving disputes and coordinating military actions. By joining DATO, member countries could enjoy enhanced security, increased diplomatic influence, and access to shared military resources and technology.
