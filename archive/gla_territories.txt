[b]LIBERATED.[/b]

Former home of an Islamic fundamentalist nation and puppets who disguised attempts to impose theocratic tyranny on the world as &amp;quot;liberation.&amp;quot;

But not anymore. The free-thinking people of the world will not bow to religious fanaticism in any form.


[hr][i]&amp;quot;For I have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.&amp;quot;[/i]
-Thomas Jefferson
3rd President of the United States
