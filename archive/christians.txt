This Region will now serve as a tribute to the Christian Faith. Our Saviour Jesus Christ &amp; his Father in Heaven. 

Regional Motto: Take a stand for Christ, it is better to please God than the World.

For God so loved the World that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
