[b][color=#000000][i]But thou didst choose the rulers of cities themselves, beneath whose hand is the lord of the soil, the skilled in spearmanship, the oarsman, yea, all things that are: what is there that is not under the ruler&#146;s sway? 

Thus, smith, we say, belong to Hephaestus; to Ares, warriors; to Artemis, huntsmen; to Apollo the lyre. 

But from Zeus come kings; for nothing is diviner than the kings of Zeus. Wherefore thou didst choose them for thine own lot, and gavest them cities to guard. And thou didst seat thyself in the high places of the cities, watching who rule their people with crooked judgements, and who rule otherwise. And thou hast bestowed upon them wealth and prosperity abundantly; unto all, but not in equal measure.[/i] - Callimachus[/color][/b]
