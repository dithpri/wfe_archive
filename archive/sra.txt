[b][color=#990e0e]WAHOO![/color] It&#146;s-a us,[region]The Black Hawks[/region]! Our quest to save Princess Peach from the claws of Bowser led us to your region. We defeated the goombas, dodged some shells and even found a 1-Up in one of the blocks! At the end of the level, we all jumped on the flag pole and raised our flag.
