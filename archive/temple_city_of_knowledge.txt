We are the seekers of knowledge and religious understanding. We ally ourselves with those who seek these goals, and converse regularly with those who seek advice. No hate is allowed within these walls, but feel free to ask us questions. Our answers will be sent to you confidentially, after a free discussion on our message board, by our Leader, Rashadam.
