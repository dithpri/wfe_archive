Space furries, basically. We come in peace! We only harm if we are harmed. We do not seek to conquer Earth, only to stabilize its growing tensions. The concept of having so many different countries all crammed onto one planet is weird to us. In the case of an apocalyptic event, the Alliance will aid the earthlings and in the case of global destruction will give a home to the humans and repair Earth if possible.
