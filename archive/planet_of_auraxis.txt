Auraxis was discovered by a lost fleet of the Terran Republic. The fleet was stranded after a wormhole between the Sol System and an unknown sector the fleet was travelling through collapsed. A collection of ships with roughly 75,000 people on board survived the voyage.

After 2 years in space, and a loss of the main ship, Dominator, the last 50,000 survivors found a large planet which seemed able to sustain human life. Landing on it, the Terran Republic dispersed drones all over the planet searching for any form of life, but found nothing. No animals, not even insects; only plants. The Republic, seeing no better options, proceeded to colonize the planet, bestowing a name upon it: Auraxis.
