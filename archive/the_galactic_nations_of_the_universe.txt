The Galactic Nations of the Universe, is a open planetary SCIFI group. It is set in a galaxy where the players can create and dedicate such events to how they want. This plays similar to D&amp;Ds and has events and so forth. Join us in a Roleplay, be a leader, a killer, or even a group of isolated survivors! Join us, and RP as you please. We currently need a map builder, but we also want to help players build decals,factions, and so forth. Join us in other genres also! We&#39;re adding a open network so Roleplayers can enjoy their time and runs. Join us and have your party added today!
