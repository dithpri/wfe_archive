Sneadgard exists in a transdimentional plane somewhere between the Earth and Moon.  Nations of great Sneadian heritage joined together following an onslaught of spam telegrams urging them to move their countries to regions with very long names.  

In early 2014 a calamity struck, wiping out most of Sneadgard.  Many lands of Snead were sucked into a black hole of antimatter before the tide was stopped by the mighty leader of Sneadveria.  Some reconstruction has taken place, and hurried attempts to build a new floating pleasure vacation area Sneadadise, and Sneadtopia are at the forefront of efforts.
