Welcome to British South Africa, a charter region of the United Kingdom. The charter of British South Africa grants colonists of the region the political liberty to establish their own nations on the condition that they remain loyal to the British Empire and remain as a unified charter colony. 

The region is intended for nations looking to be based in British Africa. Our regional government is meant to be casual and add a certain level of realism to our nations. While there is no restriction on the type of nation allowed as a part of British South Africa, they are expected to represent a south African colonial with British colonial history.
