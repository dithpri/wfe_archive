[region]The Pure Land[/region] was once a great Region, but it ceased to exist, and was subsequently refounded by [nation=long]Ieoau[/nation].

This region will attempt to recapture some of the original spirit of the old [i]The Pure Land[/i], as founded by the great [nation]Buddha maitreya[/nation], by serving as a haven and oasis for all spiritual seekers and people of all religious or non-religious persuasions, both the sinners and the saints, or the non-believers and the believers of all faiths.

The Land is Impure, for we have all sinned and fallen short of the Devine Glory.

May the seekers find peace here.
