 [B][i][region]Belicia[/region][/i][/B] (formerly the Democratic Geths Confederation of Belician States) is a semi-public puppet station. Before being allowed to store your units here, you must TG [B][nation]Basharan[/nation][/B] asking for permission to utilize it. Any violatons of NS W.A. multying rules by any member will result in a password change and expulsion of all puppets linked to their ventriloquist nation. Any puppets added to the region must be verified and identified by ownership before regional placement, or they will be ejected. If you no longer wish to use a puppet, kill it off or send it to the [i][region]Rejected Realms[/region][/i]. If you make me do it too often and litter them about, I&amp;#39;ll do the same thing I do with multy violators.

Have a nice day!
