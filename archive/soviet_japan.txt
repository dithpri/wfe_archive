[i][B]In the beginning Jeff created Overwatch.
Now the game was boring and empty, filled with bastions and Torbj&ouml;rns.

And Jeff said, &#147;Let there be nerfs,&#148; and there were nerfs.

Jeff saw that Overwatch was good, and he created many heroes.

However, the heroes displeased him for their overpoweredness, overuse, and general annoyance.

So Jeff created Doomfist in his own image.

Jeff blessed them and said to them:

&#147;Be fruitful and increase in number; fill Overwatch and subdue it. Rule over the Bastions and Torbj&ouml;rn in their corners.

Then Jeff blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he buffed D.VA and nerfed all the rest.
