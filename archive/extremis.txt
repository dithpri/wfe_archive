We shall lurk in the shadows waiting to strike...no one will remain safe. We will strike fear into the hearts of our enemies and joy into our allies. Defenders do nothing and raiders are out of control. A third way is needed. The mercenary way.
Intelligence is our specialty and I will aid any region with similar views with pleasure. 
ALL HAIL EXTREMIS!
