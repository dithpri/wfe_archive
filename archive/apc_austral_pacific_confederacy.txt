&amp;#127796;&amp;#127749; We&#39;re a peaceful, democratic Confederative Region in the hot Pacific Ocean. In our environment we have thousands of islands and atolls, full of life, boats, flying fishes and sometimes kiwis. We enjoy the peaceful pacific life, we love pasta, relax and the Mediterranean and Polynesian culture and traditions. &amp;#127796;&amp;#127749;
