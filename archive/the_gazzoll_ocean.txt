[i]Gazzoll! Gazzoll!
What fruits and fish do ye hold? 
Calm waters and fair waves
Unto lost relics of old!

Gazzoll! Gazzoll! 
What soil do you bound? 
Nothing but sea and salt,
Except old Yervhenn around!

Gazzoll! Gazzoll! 
Who resides upon you?
Those hardy folks and their
Battle banners true! 

Gazzoll! Gazzoll! 
Who and what are they?
They are the Aleckandoreans:
Born on the 30th of May![/i]
