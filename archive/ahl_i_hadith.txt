The Ahl-i Hadith movement is a devoted group within Sunni Islam that holds firm to the teachings of the Quran and the authentic Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). We reject any practices or beliefs not explicitly supported by these primary sources, and we believe that true guidance comes directly from these texts, without reliance on the opinions or methodologies of the traditional Islamic schools of jurisprudence (fiqh).
