The Dark Void was the first region Bedebao joined after founding in [region]The East Pacific[/region] and getting a recruitment telegram. They were a new raider organization at the time. He was not interested and instead chose to inhabit [region]Psychotic Dictatorships[/region].

The leader of this region (Camo5768) joined [region]The Black Riders[/region] (now a nuked wasteland), this region was probably dismantled at that time. Later, it was found out that she allegedly used Predator and was wiped.
