  Welcome to the region of various civilizations in the Thryllasian Union, led by the previous republic of Parfuhmerie, although it has now become the capital of the Thryllasian Union. Associates of Parfuhmerie are also in here, such as the city-state of Psytronius.

  OOC: This region is for all my puppets &amp; me. Shwe Tu Colony would have been renamed the Thryllasian Union, but I found out that you could not rename your nation a bit too late, so now it&#39;s Shwe Tu Colony that&#39;s leading. Do remember it is really Parfuhmerie on the throne, even if they don&#39;t exist as a nation right now.
