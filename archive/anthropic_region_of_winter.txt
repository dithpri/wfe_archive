Established December 22, 2011 the Anthropic Region of Winter was a destination for those seeking a more relaxed setting. ARW does not have off-site forums and will most likely never heavily-recruit. It&amp;#39;s primarily for people to enjoy a bit of lime-light on a smaller stage until WE decide to grow. Primarily peaceful, ARW does not stand for negligence or aggression. Currently accepting all nations interested in relocation. Off-site forums a possibility if interest is strong.
