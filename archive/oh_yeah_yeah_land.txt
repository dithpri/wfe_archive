We are a safe land that strives for peace, prosperity, and freedom. As a strong region, we will hold true to our values even in the most difficult of times.

If you are new in the land, we hold elections for offices every month (other than executive, delegate, and vice delegate). You are free to join the elections or just enjoy life as is in the Oh Yeah Yeah Land, although we do encourage everyone to be involved in our elections. 

Don&#39;t forget to stay true to Maximillianmus, the God of Youtube!
