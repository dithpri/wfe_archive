For years, the left wing community of NationStates has mostly consisted of authoritarian regimes who do not care about the civil and political freedoms of their citizens. On the other hand, the so called liberals are right wing capitalists who do not care about workers&#39; rights. Ainland dreamed of a region where civil liberties and democracy are upheld, and the proletariat are the utmost priority. He founded the Social Liberal Union to fulfill his cause. Sadly, this is not the case anymore. The SLU is now run by people with authoritarian and unforgiving mindsets. Hence, on the 11th of May 2023, we hereby declare the founding of the Democratic Social Union of States, whose sole goal is to fulfil Ainland&#39;s lost cause.
