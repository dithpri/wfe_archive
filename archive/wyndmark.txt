[b]Currently under construction, Wyndmark is a low-fantasy, medieval roleplay region where you can war and conquest till the cows come home. 

Set in a formerly peaceful and now a war-torn bundle of continents on a fantasy planet, smaller nations are fighting to survive the wake wrought by the ever-expanding, dragon-riding Dracaari Empire.[/b]

A season is 5 IRL days, and a year is 4 European ordered seasons.
