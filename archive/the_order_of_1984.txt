 If you are unfamiliar with the writer George Orwell, then you may ask, what da heck does this community represent? Well, the book titled Nineteen eighty four details the totalitarian regime of Oceania controlling Great Britain, the Americas, and others. It is controlled by a dictator only known as &quot;Big Brother&quot; and the single ruling party is called IngSoc. It stands for English Socialism or the English Socialist Party. The Party literally can twist reality and even control everything that the people do, even what the think.
Hopefully you will enjoy your time within The Order. Obey the basic IngSoc laws and you will be safe. Most importantly, be truthful to the party or the Ministry of Truth will have to deal with you and...re-educate you.
