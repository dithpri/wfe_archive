[color=green]As soon as we have enough members and WA members, we will be hosting elections for government positions.
Civitatis Aurum runs under a Parliament and will hold elections for various positions once there are 10 WA members within the region.
Only WA members may run for positions. Non-WA members can only vote.[/color]
