&quot;Beleriand, Beleriand / borders of the fa&euml;ry land.&quot; 
    &amp;#8213; Lay of Leithian, Canto II, vv. 399-400 

Beleriand was the region of north-western Middle-earth during the First Age. Originally, the name belonged only to the area around the Bay of Balar, but in time the name was applied to the entire land. 

Beleriand translates to &quot;The Country of Balar&quot; with the ending -ian(d) for places and countries. The OS form could have been *Balariand&euml; (a slid to e because of the following i).

The element Balar refers to Oss&euml;, who often dwelt at the shores (although this refers to the earlier legendarium when Oss&euml; and Uinen were Valar of the sea, not Maiar of Ulmo).It was from Balar that the Teleri expanded and &quot;colonised&quot; the region of Beleriand, hence the name.
