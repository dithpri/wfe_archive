The Independent Order seeks to be an interesting, unique and dynamic region that is never short on things for member nations to do.
We seek to be a region where nations that contribute to our community are respected and rewarded for their efforts.
We seek to be independent of international influence, and to defend ourselves and our friends from foreign aggression.
