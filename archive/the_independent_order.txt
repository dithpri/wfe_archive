Welcome to [region]The Independent Order[/region], the electric bongaloo! an extremely active modern role play region where there is always something going on. 

We have everything from dirty commies to disgusting capitalists, and just last week we had terrorism, music festivals, coronations, weddings and more deaths than the last episode of Game of Thrones...

So why don&#39;t you give us a go? We&#39;d love to welcome you to Mundus!
