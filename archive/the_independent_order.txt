As you are all aware the forum is currently down. This is due to a&nbsp;hardware failure on the part of ZetaBoards. They are currently doing all they can restore a backup, but this may take some time.
&nbsp;
In the meantime, join us in the [b][url=https://discordapp.com/invite/peJ4Hb8]Regional Chat Discord[/url][/b]&nbsp;and on these boards!
&nbsp;
For more updates on the progress of Zetaboards as they recover from their monumental c***up, see [b][url=http://support.zathyus.com/topic/7003293/1/]here[/url][/b].
&nbsp;
Thanks for your patience.
