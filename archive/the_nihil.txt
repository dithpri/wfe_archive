The Nihil were a group of marauders who were active during the High Republic Era. Based in the Outer Rim Territories, the Nihil caused havoc throughout the galaxy and were responsible for various incidents, such as an attack on Trymant IV and the torching of the planet Nelgenam. The Nihil were obsolete by the time of the Galactic Empire, though rhetoric and imagery associated with the marauders survived, as did their technology, such as the design of the Path engine.
