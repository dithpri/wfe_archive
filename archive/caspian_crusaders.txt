The Caspian Crusaders is a defensive alliance of sometimes not-so-like-minded states seeking mutually beneficial international relations. Current primary members consist of the &quot;Big Four&quot;.

Any mentions of a fifth member are references to a nation once known as Ribe; a nation that has faltered against the test of time. Its fate, however, differs between history books: Muirskian children are taught to regard Ribe&#39;s fate as a prime example of any nation that dares betray its socialist roots. To Doklandians, Ribe is used to illustrate the supposed &#39;great power&#39; of their deity and the ultimate destiny of those who turn away from so called &#39;sacred acts of worship&#39;. Sakrithurvad and Canada, too, use Ribe as a tool for propagandistic purposes.
