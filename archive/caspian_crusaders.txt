The Caspian Crusaders was a defensive alliance of sometimes not-so-like-minded states seeking mutually beneficial international relations. Due to the breakdown of Muirsk and the subsequent military intervention led by [nation]Sakrithurvad[/nation] to restore order to the region, the alliance itself has proven to be little more than a farce. With the withdrawal of Doklandia, only two of the former four remain in region, and the Grand Duchy is still consolidating its control, in a manner not dissimilar to that which occurred over its own government.

The regional flag has remained unchanged, as the heads of the &quot;alliance&quot; are unsure who will remain, and are postponing any such action until stability is assured.
