The Great Stellar Plains. There&#39;s no end in sight. The remains of ancient castles rise silently above the tall grass, inexplicable tiny lights travel on the wind, beneath the canopy of majestic forests it is sometimes difficult to see daylight. At night, countless stars cover the indigo sky and thousands of lights shine in the grass. Arlin is more like a fairy tale than reality. It probably was a fairy tale. Maybe it still is. This is the land of the great legends of the past. The land of the valiant and just of today.
