We are Northern United States, which has 3 parts:
American Austria-Hungary, Canadian Germania, Mexican Yugoslavia.

We merged together because we live on one island and also the relationships, they were like we are best friends.

We won&acute;t allow any State to join our Country, but you can make Embassies with us.

Greetings

Northern United States
