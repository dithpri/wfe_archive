[b]Territory of the [region]New British Empire[/region]. This region was once protected by [region]The New British Empire[/region] when it was an active region. Then a group of fascist rebels formed a false empire known as [region]NBE[/region] who proceded to take this region. Luckily the remaining active mebers of the true NBE formed the [region]New British Empire[/region] to honor and carry on the legacy of the original NBE and its noble leader [nation]Brition[/nation]. They now have liberated this region from the oppression of [region]NBE[/region].[/b]
