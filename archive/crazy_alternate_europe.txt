Welcome to Crazy Alternate Europe. 
 This Region is dedicated to me and some friend&amp;#39;s version of Europe. After a amazing victory in WW1 by the central powers, the Germans stood on top over the French and British throughout the 20&amp;#39;s and 30&amp;#39;s. After French forces attack German soil in 1935 over a land dispute. The Second Franco Prussian War, changed history.
Now, A New Democratic Germany and a Fascist Roman empire dominate the European landscape
