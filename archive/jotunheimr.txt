[b]From J&ouml;tunheimr, the giants menace the humans in Midgard and the gods in Asgard. The river Ifing (Old Norse, &Iacute;fingr) separates Asgard, the realm of the gods, from J&ouml;tunheimr, the land of giants. Gastropnir, The protection wall to the home of Menglad, and &THORN;rymheimr, home of &THORN;jazi, were both located in J&ouml;tunheimr, which was ruled by King Thrym. Gl&aelig;sisvellir was a location in J&ouml;tunheimr, where lived the giant Gudmund, father of H&ouml;fund. Utgard was a stronghold surrounding the land of the giants.[/b]
