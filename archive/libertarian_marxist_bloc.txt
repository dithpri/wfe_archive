[color=red]Welcome to the region for all revolutionary, non-Leninist Marxists including, but not limited to autonomists, Bordigists council communists, DeLeonists, left communists, Luxemburgists, workerists, and world socialists. We believe in a very democratic and decentralized dictatorship of the proletariat comprised of all the workers to lead the world from capitalism, through socialism, and to communism.
