[B]For Nations in and Allies of [color=red]Co-Prosperity Coalition[/color] and [color=red]Free &amp;#26481;&amp;#26041;Project Coalition[/color], we do not accept nations into the faction unless you&#39;re a Touhou Project nation or a nation that we really really like and accept.[color=blue] If you&#39;re an ally, you can join as well but I recommend as a puppet/second nation of your nation.[/color][/B]

[B]Everyone from The Dominion&#39;s Touhou Project universe stands united under one flag.
The outsiders have made Touhou Project suffer enough.
Our Universe Dimension will be free from their taint.[/B]
