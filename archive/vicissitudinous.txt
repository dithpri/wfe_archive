The land of Vicituria is a turbulent, violent place, where changing times and shifting alliances serve to fuel continuous warfare between its many occupants. Nations of Victuria are encouraged to fiercely compete against one another in several different tech-eras, creating alliances, sabotaging rivals, and play their cards well to come out on top. Of course, the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
