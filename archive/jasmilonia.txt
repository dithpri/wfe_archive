Hello and welcome to Jasmilonia. As a fledgling region, we are small and fragile. In this time we must focus on growing our numbers and defining a regional focus. As soon as we have ten nations inside of our region, we will hold elections. Until then, the supreme Matriarch, Queen Jasmine, will organize several polls to help our region become as prosperous as the larger regions! 

Meanwhile, who wants to help QJ with factbooks and regional history?
