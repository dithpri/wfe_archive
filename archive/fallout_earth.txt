[color=#BF8080]A war with zombies, disease and invasive species has ended up with more than 98% of the world&#39;s nuclear weapons fired throughout the globe, resulting in a nuclear holocaust which has killed billions. Those who have survived remain in hiding in fallout shelters across the US, Russia, Northern China and Central Asia for years until today, where they finally emerge out of hiding. With the remnants of aliens, zombies and other undesired creatures prowling the globe, they will only have themselves to depend on.[/color]
