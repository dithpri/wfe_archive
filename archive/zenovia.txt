Zenovia is a newly created region meant to house and govern the recently divided territories of The Former Holy Empire of Cornholiah: The District of Zenonia, East Zenonia, and West Zenonia. In order to preserve their liberty and legitimacy as independent nations, the Regional Government of Anteovia, the Sultanate of Jarrath, and the Republic of Anteopia have decided to allow the three nations their own region in order to better settle disputes.
