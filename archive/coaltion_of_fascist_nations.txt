[b][color=red]The CFN is now a colony of [region]Altay[/region]. It is fully[/color]

This region was once raided and taken over by some Antifa folks. I&#39;m not sure which one, though. It was then neglected and left to CTE. Its corpse was unattended for a weirdly long time (a few months). They really must have strongly forgotten about it. It was then refounded by general [nation]Qussultan Ochirbat[/nation]. You know, cuz it&#39;s better to surrender to a libertarian than to Antifa. Now it&#39;s really packed with freedom and civil liberties in here.
