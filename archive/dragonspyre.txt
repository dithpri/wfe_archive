Welcome to [color=red][b]Dragonspyre[/b][/color]! We are a region of ranging technology and political types that promote equality among all nations.

The [color=skyblue]United Nations[/color] of Dragonspyre will be established soon, where each participating nation has equal say in laws and regulations passed in the region.
If you have a law or regulation you wish to be passed or repealed, please contact the current WA Delegate and/or Region Founder to have a poll started.

Following passed laws and regulations is [color=red][b][u]MANDITORY[/u][/b][/color] and breaking them will bring consequences up to scale with the severity of the act done.

You are allowed to have a maximum of 2 nations in the region, having more is greatly frowned upon.

Most importantly, have enjoy your stay and have fun!
