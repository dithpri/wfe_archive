This region is for those who want to focus on their own empire without too much outside interference or too many neighbors. All government types are supported, and any interactions are allowed, providing they do not significantly harm the region. No application is necessary, just join in and send me a telegram if you have any comments, complaints, suggestions, or ideas! Roleplaying is definitely encouraged in this region, and all are welcome to join! The type of roleplaying done can be decided by the first few to enter, and then changed should a significant majority of the nations and the founders/delegates want the change to happen.
