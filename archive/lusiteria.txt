The region of Lusiteria is a moderately sized region with many different climates and diverse animal and plant life. The region is ruled by the militaristic but also happy-to-aid Kingdom of Happsborough. The Kingdom has no tolerance for executions, despite their justification, as the Kaiser believes them to be morally wrong. However, punishments including hard labor and life imprisonment are accepted within the country and region.
