[color=gray][i]By the age of seven years, every human being has Three Lives:

A Public Life

A Private Life

and

A Secret Life[/i][/color]

This is a region of unconditional acceptance where narratives pertaining 
to any aspect of one&amp;#39;s Three Lives may be shared anonymously. It shall 
remain a sanctuary of thoughtful conversation, dignified self-exploration, 
peaceful inquiry, and mutual respect.

Our individual paths are often strange, at moments dark, and always 
filled with wonder. May we teach and learn from each other, and be 
forever compassionate in our journey.
