[color=orange][u]ASHFORD ANTHEM[/u][/color]

Fire burns 
Illuminating the dark, 
Eradicating the ignorance,
Symbolizing freedom.  

We, the nations of Ashford
Will build a more peaceful world
Together, ever united, 
We shall preserve our Ashford.

Ashford, we pledge 
To be loyal and devoted.
To never follow the wrong path,
To be just and generous.  

Love and protect us, O Ashford. (3 times)   


 -The Anthem Of Ashford.
