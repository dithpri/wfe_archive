[u][b]Why are we here?[/b][/u]
This region consists of a few nation-states, brought together by the need to survive in a world where the rise and fall of countries is commonplace. A union would better guarantee the safety of its members, and it would also provide numerous new and far more easily facilitated opportunities.

[u][b]What does this Union look like?[/b][/u]
There exists a very small but effective council heading the union, making decisions only to dictate the actions of the union as a whole - to determine specifically the actions of the Dark Continents wholly. This council is made up of the official leaders of each of the member-nations, who they delegate and discuss issues facing the Dark Continents.
