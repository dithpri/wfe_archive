The [b]East India Company[/b] (EIC) was an English and later British joint-stock company, which was formed to pursue trade with the East Indies but ended up trading mainly with the Indian subcontinent and Qing China.

Originally chartered as the &quot;Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies,&quot; the company rose to account for half of the world&#39;s trade, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, salt, saltpetre, tea and opium. The company also ruled the beginnings of the British Empire in India. &#151;Wikipedia [hr]
