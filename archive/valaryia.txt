[color=0095A5][b]Valaryia is a region built on friendship and freedom, constructed to give its residents the ability to discuss things, participate in roleplays, engage in vibrant conversations, and enjoy the community as they please. However, that doesn&#39;t mean you can be rude, remember that Valaryia is also constructed on kindness, so always remember to treat each other with respect and hold out discussions with elegance and kindness.[/b][/color]
