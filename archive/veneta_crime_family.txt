This is a mainly RP region for those interested in the workings of the mobs. I honestly find myself fascinated with the New York families and I&#39;m making this one solely for RP.

The region will have your basic roles:
Don- Leader of the family
Consigliere- Adviser of the don
Underboss- Second in command of the don
Capo- Officers of the family
Made Men- Basic units of the family
Associates- Those who aren&#39;t in the region but still work with us.

Our current Don is: [nation]Project 505[/nation]
Our current Consigliere is: [Vacant]
Our current Underboss is: [Vacant]
Our current three Capos are: [Vacant], [Vacant] and [Vacant]
