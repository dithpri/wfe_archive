we are a region set in greek-roman times (just after the roman empire fell). The romans may have defeated the greeks but ironically the small part that survived the fall of the empire was the graeco-roman part (greek/roman). we represent what could have happened if that part became another empire. we love roleplay and everyone may join. we would prefer it if you had a name that had to do with ancient culture or something to do witha legion.
