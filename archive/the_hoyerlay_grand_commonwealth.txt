All nations The Kingdom of Hoyerlay are accepted, with current and former members of the Hoyerlay Empire being given priority. To join, members are agreeing to accept the de hire sovereignty of the Monarch of Hoyerlay (this position has little real power, with the power residing with the democratically elected prime minister of Hoyerlay, and of the other colonies). All member states trade goods freely, with the Grand Commonwealth being a multilateral free trade area. (Note that member states can determine the other features of trade policy, ie trade with non-commonwealth countries).
