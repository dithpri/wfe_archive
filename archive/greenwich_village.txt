[b]&amp;quot;The Earth is an Indian thing.&amp;quot; - Kerouac

It&amp;#39;s maybe 1956 or 1962, or some other time, because a calendar is just a map of time. The Village is a Beat community of poets, artists, musicians, writers and thinkers.

Kerouac also said, &amp;quot;It is because I am Beat, that is, I believe in beatitude and that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son to it... Who knows, but that the universe is not one vast sea of compassion actually, the veritable holy honey, beneath all this show of personality and cruelty?&amp;quot;

Beat? Make yourself at home here. The espresso is hot, the pastry is fresh, and the soup will be ready in a few minutes.[/b]
