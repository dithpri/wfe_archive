A heavy hand makes heavy work. Heavy work makes a strong people. And a strong people is indestructible. That is the code lived by the Ministry of Freedom. It is, of course, well-known that freedom is slavery, so in order to best protect its citizens from destruction, the nations of the Ministry of Freedom seek to ensure security for the common person by protecting them from their own bad decisions. Businesses and government work hand in hand to make the major decisions so that citizens don&amp;#39;t have to. There is much work to be done, so the average citizen does not have time for such things as politics, crime, or terrorism. And yet, this means that the members of the Ministry of Freedom have some of the most powerful economies in the world.
