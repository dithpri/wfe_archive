 [b] [color=purple]Freedom[/color] lies in the ability of man to simply coexist with man, without [color=red]force[/color], without [color=red]violence[/color] and most importantly without [color=red]dependency[/color] [/b]

Welcome to the amiable establishment of [b][color=purple]The Non Aggression Principle[/color][/b]. Here we praise ideas of [b][color=purple]Voluntaryism[/color][/b] and [b][color=purple]Unity[/color][/b] while condemning the ideas of [b][color=red]Force[/color][/b] or [b][color=red]Subjugation[/color][/b]. We believe in a completely free society, where we find our own way rather than try and impose our structure upon each other. No ideas are constrained, no knowledge withheld, no nationalist means of control are compelled and no opposition met with force.[b][color=purple] Freedom is life[/color][/b].
