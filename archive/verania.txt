[region]Verania[/region] is a small region founded on the ideas of democracy, capitalism, free trade, and imperialism.
 
Verania is relatively new and aims to be a more realistic approach to how an imperialistic region and nation would act. 
This includes allies, enemies, colonies and a more self-centred approach to situations involving foreign entities.
