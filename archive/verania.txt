The Region of Verania is a sprawling landmass with few countries or colonies existing within it. 
Any new countries wishing to send colonies to the region, or populations wishing to create their own countries inside the region would be met with little to no resistance, and perhaps open arms. 

With plenty of resources ripe for the taking, Verania is waiting.
