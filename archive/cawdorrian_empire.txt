The Cawdorrian Empire consists of a variety of separate and very different nations. Cawdorr&amp;#39;s influence is limited in the politics and running of member states and in many terms its dominion is simply a ceremonial role. The leaders and governments of member states remain independent providing they swear fealty to the High King Of Cawdorr. Membership is largely beneficial to member states as they gain access to imperial trading routes at lower tax rates.
