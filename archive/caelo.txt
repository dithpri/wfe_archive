Welcome to Caelo! After a catastrophic experiment, a large piece of the American Northwest was lifted to the edge of the stratosphere. Here, the moisture in the clouds condenses into beautiful lakes, and the temperature is always warm. The people here are a liberal, welcoming, hardworking bunch, all eager to meet you. Due to its position, Caelo is the perfect place for space launches, so nations here tend to be less militaristic and more science-oriented. Just don&#39;t fall off the sides, ladies and gentlemen!
