[hr][i]&quot;Alright now, for all you boppers out there in the big city, all you street people with an ear for the action, I&#39;ve been asked to relay a request from the Gramercy Riffs. It&#39;s a special for the Warriors, that real live bunch from Coney, and I do mean the Warriors. Here&#39;s a hit with them in mind.&quot;[/i] &#150; The DJ

Born under flickering streetlights and baptized in subway grime, [color=red][b]ThE WaRRioRs[/b][/color] are a tight-knit outfit from the wrong end of the map and the right side of every fight. They don&#146;t fly banners so much as they leave a calling card: a sudden silence, a new boss, and the uneasy feeling that something important just changed hands while you weren&#146;t looking.
