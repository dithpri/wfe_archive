Ulfheim is an ancient land, driven by an equally stoic set of peoples, some have roots that go back to a time when mankind was barely off it&amp;#39;s feet, others the end result of rampant colonialism and one or two are the survivors of those who fled from one of mankinds great wars. Overall, they have banded together via something called the &amp;quot;Ulfheim Pact&amp;quot;, an establishment of regional prowess, both militarily and economically, through war and peace.







The Flag of this militaristic region was designed and very aptly put together by a genius artist from the Fordorsian Academy of the Fine Arts.
