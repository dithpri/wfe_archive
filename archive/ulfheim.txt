The region of Ulfheim is home to multiple hyper-militant nations, Ulfrans are living on the mainland and are savage to a level that makes foreign observers physcially ill, Fordorsians live off of the western coast, close enough for a binocular-set to see a coastal gun battery. Vyntraskans make the south-eastern peninsula their home, yet the Kroytkans make the north-east, the glacial hell that it is home. All avoid the deadlands in the north-east, and all help defend against the Fordorsian Forbidden zone.
