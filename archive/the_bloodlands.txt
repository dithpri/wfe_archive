The only nations in this region are the Dominion of Krasnokrai and the Theocracy if Balzonchia. They are perpetually in armed conflict, as agreed to in the Treaty of Kiev. Their leaders are good friends, and cooperate with one another on the world stage, and will come to one another&amp;#39;s defense. They essentially play a giant version of Risk with actual human lives in the balance, as is demanded by the great and powerful spirit of Murderbeast. The conflict is a way of appeasing their deity with the deaths of their populace, which must occur in battle.
