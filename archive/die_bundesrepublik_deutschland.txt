[b]Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland has been refounded by [color=red]The Red Fleet[/color] to prevent another region dedicated to a democratic and free Germany from falling into the hands of Fascists and Nazis.

The historic Bundesrepublik might have been a state that allowed many former Nazis to be reintegrated into society and that followed an anti-communist paradigm in some ways but it is imperative that Germany always remains free from Fascist barbarity to prevent the repetition of history.

Never Again! Never forget! For a free and democratic Germany![/b]
