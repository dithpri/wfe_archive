The Convention of the Universe; is a convention for political triumphs and defeats. This does not seek to take power, but set up it&#146;s own international laws that govern the actions of several states. Authority is only given to those who seek to be a mediator in conflict. This is rather a way to settle disputes in a conference room than in a trench. Let us all avoid conflict rather than create it.
