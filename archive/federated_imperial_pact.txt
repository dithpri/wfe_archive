The FIP falls under direct leadership and control of it&amp;#39;s leader Western Imperial Union. It is fair to all types of players but is mostly a roleplaying and political debating group. It is oriented in a sci-fi style and likes to have fun with Nation States. However this does not mean it is never serious as political discussion is welcome and debate is encouraged.We will be in an almost continuos roleplaying state. For more information on this setting check the Western Imperial Union&amp;#39;s factbook titled history of the world.

Join FIP and I believe you&amp;#39;ll enjoy Nation States even more than you do. If you would like in to at-least try it message me so we can talk.
