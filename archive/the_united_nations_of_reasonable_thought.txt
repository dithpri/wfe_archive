[b]East Coast Canadians are a subspecies of primates that originated in wildland forests of eastern Canada. Their culture is recognized to have developed from the first species of primate to develop a distinct socialised community-based trend of behaviour. East Coast Canadians only became a distinct subgenre after bears from the specific region started accelerating natural selection among Canadian primates.
