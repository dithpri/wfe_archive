[i][color=blue]Picnic time for Teddy Bears
The little Teddy Bears are having
A lovely time today.
Watch them, catch them unawares,
And see them frolic on their holiday.[/color]

[color=green]See them gaily gad about
They love to play and shout,
They never have any care;
At six o&amp;#39;clock their Mommies and Daddies
Will take them home to bed,
Because they&amp;#39;re tired little Teddy Bears[/color][/i]
