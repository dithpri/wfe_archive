A deserted land-scape, full of thriving wild-life, in an universe where twisted and fictious physics law are changed and the creation of portals is possible by the human race by means of technology, being so able as to create a resonance cascade that opens up a portal to another planet and brings in alien creatures to Earth. After declaring war on these dominant species known only as the Combine or Universal Union, human race struggles for survival in an ever dwindling chance for survival as the seas are drying out and any vestige of civilization has been long gone, buried under the scrapes of a forgotten old world.
