A region based of on the Half-Life 2 Universe and it&amp;#39;s surrounding landscapes. Think of it as a place where alien life forms took place and the landscape remains nothing but a deserted wasteland, with refugee camps from the remnants of humanity and last hope of humanity&amp;#39;s survival being long gone, with many Urban Centers sprawling along and citizens being relocated around a lot of times by a dictatorship regimen along intercontinental cities via railways, sometimes to never be seen again. The only hope are raising rebel movements founding their own nations in which are at war with the supporters of the established regimen.
