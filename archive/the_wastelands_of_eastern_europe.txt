A region based off on the Half-Life 2 universe of City 17 and it&amp;#39;s surrounding landscapes with inhospitable locations and a barren, lifeless world, taken over by a mysterious and enigmatic race known only as the [b]&amp;quot;Benefactors&amp;quot;[/b]. Think of it as a place where urban centers are decaying for the general citizen, an underground opposition is taking place along areas of the vast wilderness of the wasteland and seeks to overthrow the radical right-wing system of the &amp;quot;Benefactors&amp;quot; (which stands for nothing more than an inter-galactic amalgm of genetic modified species that seeks to impose an inter-dimensional dominion of other species and integrate then to their own, while being mockingly called the [b]&amp;quot;Combine&amp;quot;[/b] due to that).
