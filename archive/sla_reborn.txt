Originally the Ssotab-Lalaela Alliance, SLA for short, SLA Reborn is coalition of twelve nations, mostly small.
A number of nations have recently risen from the dead, as SLA&#39;s three month hiatus resulted in many a nation in coma. SLA Reborn, however, has taken all the things you liked about SLA (approx. one) and tripled it. Having actually administrative force really benefits the region&#39;s security.
Home of the left-wing socialists to complete anarchies, SLA Reborn will accept just about anyone, so long as they&#39;re not raiders. (Note: You may have up to two countries in this region maximum) 
Please enjoy yourself while the region hasn&#39;t imploded yet.
