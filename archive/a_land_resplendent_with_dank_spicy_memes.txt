[b]Blame it all on our roots, we showed up in boots, and ruined your region&#39;s flair. You were the last one to know, we were the last ones to show, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] were the last  ones you thought you&#39;d see there. And I saw the surprise and the fear in your eyes when I put your region to shame, so now we&#39;ll toast you and then we&#39;ll be through, and we&#39;ll never hear you complain [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]here.[/url]
