[color=blue]Welcome to Secret of the Outcasts[/color]

This is a place for anyone lost, confused, or [color=blue]b[/color][color=orange]o[/color][color=red]r[/color][color=green]e[/color][color=purple]d[/color] as hell. This was created to meet new nations and talk to cool people. Also, the founder has no life and nothing better to do. SO, there you are, and I hope you will choose this region because it is obviously [b]the best thing ever[/b].
