[b]Mr Oliver stands with us and I have felt the purity of his righteousness.

I have witnessed His glory burn away the darkness.

I have seen the Imperium&#146;s indomitable ferocity unleashed upon its countless enemies. 

I saw courage and honour displayed in Oliver&#39;s name. 

I saw the unwavering loyalty and righteousness that He inspired. 

No fortress could withstand Oliver&#39;s wrath, no fury could overcome His protection.
 
Mr Oliver&#39;s light cleanses even the darkest corruption, sunders even the strongest curse. 

His glory brings salvation to those who embrace His ideals. 

Even the Fallen are offered a chance at redemption in Mr Oliver&#39;s service. 

Through death, sacrifice, duty, honour. These are what Mr Oliver requires of us.[/b]
