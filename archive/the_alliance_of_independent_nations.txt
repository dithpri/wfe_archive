This alliance was formed to facilitate greater co-operation between single, independant nations in the areas of trade, defense, etc. Fundamental principles:
1. A continuous defensive alliance exists between all member nations, i.e. if one member if invaded, all other members are obligated to provide reasonable military assistance.
2. Member nations may not declare war on one another, may not raid one another and may not deliberately disrupt trade to or from a member nation.
3. Meetings of the governing body, the Deliberative Council of Independent Nation, may be convened by any member nations, which all members are free to attend. Any treaties or declarations made by the council are binding to all signatory nations.
