[u]Order of the Golden Toad[/u]

&quot;Where sovereignty croaks eternal.&quot;

Founded by the Federation of Toadsian, this region honors the sacred toad &#151; symbol of resilience and national spirit. Guided by the First Directive, we uphold unity, militarism, and reverence.

Toads are sacred.
Defense is doctrine.
Law is eternal.
Unity is enforced.

Only the loyal may leap with us.
