Greetings, Kingdoms, Democracies, and Constitutional Monarchies! Welcome to The United Shires.

Our Region of newly founded nations was formed by Glashan, Romanshire, and with help from Saxonshire. It is made of peaceful governments. In the United Shires, we value the freedom of the people over Euros/pounds. We work towards solving issues that benefit Civil Rights.
