~Welcome to Red Pacifica ~  Capital of Pacifica[/color]

Founded by the [b]Glorious Chairman Mailograd[/b] as a base for Operation: Free Minnow, this region represents the unsung leadership of all GCR&amp;#39;s. It is and never has been the will of the Glorious Chairman to lead, but merely to guide the proletariat to freedom. Hail the Glorious Chairman!!!!
