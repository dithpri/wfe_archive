[color=ff4f00]HELPFUL TOOLS:
- [url=http://texasregion.net/nsdossier/]Dossier Tools[/url] (from region of [region=Texas])

This region plays [url=http://texasregion.net/nsdossier/embassyOracle.aspx][b]Embassy Oracle Game[/b][/url]
- the theme of this game is to create a long chain of regions
- each region is linked by their embassy (each with only 2 embassies) to the region before and after in the order of the update; 
- Embassy oracle regions cannot have any outside embassies, as these will short circuit the chain
- Eventually, all of these region&#39;s WFE will only show the region name in bold green type
- This region and the final region on my list will only have one embassy.
- My [b]Matrix List[/b] is represented by [region=United States of America] and [region=Great Britain and Northern Ireland] in the middle of the chain
- as of 2019 Aug. 15th, this is Region Alfa of my embassy oracle list[/color]
