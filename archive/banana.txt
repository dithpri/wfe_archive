&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Chiquita banana and I&amp;#39;ve come to say
Bananas have to ripen in a certain way 
When they are fleck&amp;#39;d with brown and have a golden hue
Bananas taste the best and are best for you
You can put them in a salad
You can put them in a pie-aye
Any way you want to eat them
It&amp;#39;s impossible to beat them
But, bananas like the climate of the very, very tropical equator
So you should never put bananas in the refrigerator.&amp;quot;
