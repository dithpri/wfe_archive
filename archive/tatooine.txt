[b][color=cc6600]Welcome to the desert planet Tatooine.[/color] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPcUrHsD8A][color=darkred]Birth place of Darth Vader.[/color][/url][/b]
[color=cc3300][i]Once it had large oceans full of marine based life and a world-spanning jungle, but this biosphere was destroyed when the myopic Rakata razed the planet, drying up its riverbeds and boiling away its oceans. Tatooine&#39;s twin stars (Tatoo I and Tatoo II) heat its surface, making water and shade hard to come by. The planet&#39;s indigenous lifeforms&#151;such as the Womp rat, bantha, Sarlacc, and Krayt Dragon&#151;are well-adapted to its arid climate, but human settlers often become moisture farmers and live in subterranean dwellings in order to survive. The planet&#39;s lack of resources, brutal heat, and decentralized population have made governing the planet nearly impossible.[/i][/color]
