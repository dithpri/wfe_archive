[hr][i][color=0099FF]Once it had large oceans full of marine based life and a world-spanning jungle,[/color][color=FF6600] but this biosphere was destroyed when the myopic Rakata razed the planet, drying up its riverbeds and boiling away its oceans.[/color][color=CC0000] Tatooine&amp;#39;s twin stars (Tatoo I and Tatoo II) heat its surface, making water and shade hard to come by.[/color][color=663300] The planet&amp;#39;s indigenous lifeforms&#151;such as the Womp rat, bantha, Sarlacc, and Krayt Dragon&#151;are well-adapted to its arid climate, but human settlers often become moisture farmers and live in subterranean dwellings in order to survive.[/color] The planet&amp;#39;s lack of resources, brutal heat, and decentralized population have made governing the planet nearly impossible.[/i]
