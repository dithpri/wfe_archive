[color=cc6600][b]Welcome to the desert planet Tatooine.[/color][color=darkred] Birth place of [/color]Darth Vader.[color=0099FF]
[hr]It once had [/color][color=00FFFF]large oceans[/color][color=00FFCC] full of marine based life[/color] [color=00FF99]and a[/color] [color=00FF66]world-spanning [/color][color=00FF33]jungle,[/color][color=99cc66] but this[/color][color=99cc33] biosphere was[/color][color=cccc33] destroyed when the[/color][color=ffcc33] myopic Rakata razed the planet,[/color][color=ff9933] drying up its riverbeds[/color][color=ff6633] and boiling away its oceans.[/color][color=ff3300] Tatooine&amp;#39;s twin stars (Tatoo I and Tatoo II) heat its surface,[/color][color=cc3300] making water and shade hard to come by.[/color][color=993300] The planet&amp;#39;s indigenous lifeforms[/color][color=663300]&#151;such as the Womp rat, bantha, Sarlacc, and Krayt Dragon&#151;are well-adapted to its arid climate,[/color][color=663333] but human settlers often[/color][color=993333] become moisture farmers and live in [/color][color=990033]subterranean dwellings in order to survive. [/color][color=990000]The planet&amp;#39;s lack of resources, brutal heat, and decentralized population[/color][color=330000] have made governing the planet nearly impossible.[/color][/b]
