This region is a humid place, with bulldogs roaming everywhere. The scenery is grey and everything looks like castles. There&amp;#39;s a giant beautiful lawn that nobody can walk on and a place for everyone to eat, but trust me when I say it sucks. Be sure to keep an eye out for chairs, too. It has been know for them to be thrown on a regular basis.
