Terestus, cradle of civilizations, and witness to the rise and fall of empires. During the constant rise and fall of man, a golden age has been reached, the once impossible now possible, and the very precipice of man&amp;#39;s dreams at his fingertips. An era of prosperity and discovery, the future is as bright as ever.

Or so it would seem.

Power plays by the influential and affluent threaten to change the very nature of the world stage as moves made by parties both global and local seep through the now constant-grinding gears of industry and science. It is up to mankind themselves to preserve this golden age, and this age of prosperity.

Or destroy it.
