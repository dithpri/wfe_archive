 Welcome to the NetZellan Trey. This region is home to the best nations, such as: Unistate.

All nations in this region are subject to the Logic Doctrine, which bans emotional reasoning. A decision affecting any nation in this region must be supported by science, mathematics, history, language &amp; fiction.

Examples:
Emotional decision: Darlockion has attacked us! They will pay for this &amp; we will destroy them!
Logical decision: While I am angry that Darlockion has broken our peace treaty, I want to remain calm about this. I feel that Darlockion is a threat to our people now, so lt would be in our best interest to defend ourselves against them.

We all hate Darlockion, but let us remain calm &amp; form a plan of action to deal with them.
