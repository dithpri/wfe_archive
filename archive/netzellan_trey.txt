We kindly welcome you to the NetZellan Trey. This is a region of libertarian countries that believe authoritarianism should only be used to ensure that liberty is maintained, defending lt from those who seek to impose their illogical, draconian &amp; discriminatory will over their country. We believe in a strong government, but also a strong people to keep corruption in check. A good balance is vital. We support freedom insofar as nobody is directly, unconsensually harmed. We are strictly opposed to restricting freedom for superficial reasons. If you believe people should have the abstract space to live life to the fullest, this is the place for you.
