The Hyborian Peninsula was once inhabited entirely by barbaric tribes that were constantly at war. These tribes allied with one another to protect themselves. These alliances became confederacies, and those confederacies became the nations that make up the peninsula today. Despite their war-filled past, Hyborian nations have since all made peace with one another and, for the most part, have eliminated armies almost entirely. 

The region of Hyboria is well known for some of its very distinguishing features which include:

Very Small Number of Drug Laws

Beautiful Environment

Rather Poor Economy

Liberal Ideology

and Love of Pigs
