[color=purple][b]Welcome to [region]Imandrem[/region], and thanks for setting foot in our [i]awesome[/i][/color][/b] [color=grey](okay, maybe not so much, but...)[/color] [color=purple][b]territory![/b][/color]

We wanted to write a really long post to tell you what our region is like, but the World Factbook Entry doesn&amp;#39;t allow long posts, so if you&amp;#39;d like to know more about the region and (hopefully) join us, please do take a look at our dispatches, which we will be updating soon.

You may also take a look at the region&amp;#39;s tags, which describe the region in a nutshell: [b]Democratic, Anti-Fascist, Casual, Independent, Eco-friendly, Isolationist, Socialist, Liberal[/b], and[b] Libertarian[/b]. All nations except tyrants, fascists, dictators and the like may join and will be warmly welcomed.
