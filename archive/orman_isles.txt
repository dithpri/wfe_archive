The Orman Isles are geographically unique and large chain of islands, many of which defy science and make meteorologists cry in corners, while making seismologists and geologists alike drool. While there are several volcanoes along the island chain, the most significant one is Grand Orma. A volcano unique for it&#39;s constant, smoothly flowing lava, Grand Orma is rich in minerals and farm land where crops can be grown. Along the islands is a wide spectrum of habitats and biomes, the weather is often unpredictable, leaving for a unique variation of tropics, plains, swamps, tundras, and anything in between.
