The Federal Republic States of Ameriku is a region that consists of 13 districts and 65 states. Whitasher&amp;#39;s Ameriku colonies broke with the mother country in 1780 and were recognized as the new nation of the Republic of Ameriku following the Treaty of Veatu in 1790. During the 19th and 20th centuries, 52 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the Ameriku continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation&amp;#39;s history were the Civil War (1902-1915), in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist theocracy of 12 western states, and a depression in 2007, an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs.
