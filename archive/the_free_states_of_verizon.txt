[b]Washed upon the shores we fell. We were booted from our original region. I poured alot of hard work in to it. I say come hang with us. We&#39;re a simple region, we believe in free speech and democracy. An open source of ideas and policies. You will be given a chunk of land here for you troubles. More to come down the road. We have some great leaders here. If you&#39;re new and you want something laidback and chill. Please come be a part of something great. [/b]
