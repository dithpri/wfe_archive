The [b]Strait of Juan de Fuca[/b] is a body of water about 83 nautical miles long that is the Salish Sea&#39;s main outlet to the Pacific Ocean. The international boundary between Canada and the United States runs down the center of the Strait.

It was named in 1787 by the maritime fur trader Charles William Barkley, captain of Imperial Eagle, for Juan de Fuca, the Greek navigator who sailed in a Spanish expedition in 1592 to seek the fabled Strait of Ani&aacute;n. &#151;Wikipedia [hr]
