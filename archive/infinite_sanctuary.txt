What is Sanctuary ? Well it&amp;#39;s not one of those nations with those fancy governments and all. No sir! Sometimes a nation wishes to leave it&amp;#39;s home to flock to a new one, maybe to escape persecution, hate, corruption, raiders or someone who just likes to wander! But they don&amp;#39;t know where that region is that they want to call home now! Well you can stop looking! Because this isn&amp;#39;t it! What do you mean Uncle V? Well I&amp;#39;ll tell ya! Sanctuary  is a place for nations to go in between moves to hang out, and just look around for other nations. Nations may share past regions they have been to, or places to avoid or just have friendly conversation. The world is your oyster, and we&amp;#39;re here to give you a temporary place to stay!
