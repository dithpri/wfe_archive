To join the peaceful lands, you must have at least 100,000 McDonald&#39;s around your nation, and at least 2 naked mole rat shelters to protect and preserve the endangered naked mole rat. If you would like to join, spam the Nation of Florindale with telegrams once you have set up your McDonald&#39;s and Mole Rat shelters. After that Florindale will give you permission to join the peaceful lands. If Florindale is not responding to your telegrams, send more! We want to see your commitment to joining our amazing region. Joining without permission will result in being banned from Peaceful Lands.
