[b][region]Vangmar[/region]: The home of the criminal population of the [region]Confederation of Corrupt Dictators[/region].[/b]

Those who are sentenced to reside here are violators of Imperial Law, the law upon which all Confederation member states live, and die, by.

The purpose of this region is to rehabilitate the guilty, reforming them into becoming better citizens and imposing upon them the love and fealty expected from each Confederation citizen.

A small population of dedicated guards, civil administrators, and their families call this region home, too, but make no mistake. If you are here, you [i]are[/i] a criminal. 

And either by words or by whips, you will be reformed.
