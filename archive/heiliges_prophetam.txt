The [i]Heiliges Prophetam[/i] is dominated by vast vegetations of its sacred forests and mother nature&#39;s beauty. It neighbors the Southern and Eastern pacific. The region stretches at least 7.02 million mi&sup2;, dominated by vast green plains and vegetations from many of its sacred forests. This region received its name when several religious missionaries and explorers from the South Pacific region, had mistakenly adventured off and landed their ships off the coast of the region. They believed they found &quot;sanctuary&quot; that&#39;s a gift from the Gods. Therefore, they named it [i]Heiliges Prophetam[/i].

Welcome to the holy grounds of [i]Heiliges Prophetam[/i].
