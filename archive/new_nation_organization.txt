President James Jasheen established the New Nation Organization (NNO) which is a region that is intended to help new nations prosper and shine in a non-competitive environment. &quot;This is a step forward in the right direction,&quot; says President Jasheen. &quot;New nations struggle to succeed and gain attention in the ever-growing world. Djier-Jeele offers a region where new nations will succed, prosper, and feel at home.&quot;
