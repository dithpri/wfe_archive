We, the nations of the NSRO (Nation States Regional Order) hereby declare ourselves a sovereign state, working against the imperialism and dictatorship that has become known as the World Assembly.  

Here are the orders of conduct:

All regions joining the fight for freedom send ONE regional delegate to this region.

Proposals/Repeals will be voted on similarly as the WA, but we will use the RMB.

We will continue to fight until the WA realizes we are powerful and serious.
