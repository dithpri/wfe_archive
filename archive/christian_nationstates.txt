This region was home to a proud yet open-minded Christian. It has been refounded and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] to prevent possible [b]fascist[/b] misuse.

Anyone who wants this region can have it (contact [nation=short]BlackGreenWhite[/nation]) except bigots. This includes those who would use the region to promote &amp;quot;postive Christianity&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;Christian Identity&amp;quot;, hardcore Christian fundamentalism, or anti-Christian bigotry, and all other forms of hate.
