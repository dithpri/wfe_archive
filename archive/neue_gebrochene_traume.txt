Welcome to [b][region]Neue Gebrochene Traume[/region][/b]. A region of nations that really shouldn&#39;t be working together. Now here in Neue Gebrochene Traume we love good chaos and mischief as much as the next region but there are a few rules we must all abide by.
1. Ask a minister before inviting another nation.
2. No more than one nation per person. If you have a duplicate nation here you can keep it. But [b]NO MORE[/b]
3. Try to add a bit of lore to your country and make a decent flag.

Also please endorse our World Assembly Delegate,. Now get out there and cause problems for your people and fellow nations, and remeber! If it&#39;s peaceful we&#39;re doing something wrong~
