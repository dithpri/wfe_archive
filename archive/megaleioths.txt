[b]Welcome to Megaleioths! A region founded on both state&amp;#39;s (national) rights and individual liberty. This region will attempt to preserve the culture and civility of our real world while adding our own creative and innovative twist. It is also our goal to establish a tradition of open, participatory, and transparent democracy in the world council. Beware though; this is like no other region. No one government runs all and alliances are a must![/b]
