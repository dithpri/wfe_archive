As Europe&amp;#39;s multicultural elites manage to devastate Western Europe culturally, the younger generations of Europeans begin to search for answers. 

We look to what our forefathers did in the times of great turmoil and realize that the only way we can save Europe is to embrace the principles of our ancestors. 

Principles of  

Strength
Honor
Sacrifice
Martyrdom

In this, we have no choice. We must again embrace these principles or see our culture and our people perish.
