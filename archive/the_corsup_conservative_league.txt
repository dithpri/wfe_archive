A region, military organisation and free trade bloc for nations that support conservatism and capitalism, led by Adreshashushi. All goods move freely in the region (free trade, but not free movement of people). In the event of a raid (or if we decide to retaliate by raiding) all of our militaries will be joined together under the control of our Defence Secretary. We also do have a military, the Corsup Armed Forces.

We are no longer affiliated with the Corsup Defence Satellite as they have been raided and their leadership consists of our foes, the raiders. We are, though, in charge of the Corsup Dominion and their officers and we work closely with them.
