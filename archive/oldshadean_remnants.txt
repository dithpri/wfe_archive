The United Socialist States of Oldshade, stood for nearly a century as a paragon of industrial might and ideological unity. Its sprawling cities and collective farms testified to a grand vision of progress, yet behind the steel fa&ccedil;ades and propaganda banners simmered deep divisions. When a brutal civil war erupted, it reduced the once-great federation to smoldering ruins. Now, from the rubble, Oldshade&#146;s remnants have coalesced into a fragile new region&#151;fractured by history yet determined to forge a fresh start. Even as it grapples with old wounds, this fledgling territory&#151;carved from the core of a fallen superpower&#151;carries forward a sliver of Oldshade&#146;s indomitable spirit.
