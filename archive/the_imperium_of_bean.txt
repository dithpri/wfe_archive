The Imperium of Bean demands devotion the Beanperor and that all individuals are ideologically pure. There is no greater honour than giving you life for the imperium that will remove impure people and cleanse the land they occupy. There is no need for false gods only one exists and that is the Bean Cults Deity, we do not refer to this God in government. We cannot rely on the deity, we must prove ourselves to it with technological advancements and unrivalled military and political power. In Beans we trust!
