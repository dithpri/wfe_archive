Most people will look at this region and think I&amp;#39;m nuts but guess what I believe...I believe that education,military, and good health care for people. I may be a dictator but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean I can&amp;#39;t run a good region :).anyway if you are interested join this region. &amp;quot;I believe in a better nation,&amp;quot; says the Head of Hydras council Jeffery Sherbert. People in my nation &amp;#39;Hydraship&amp;#39; will agree with my following campaign to run a region. Thank you and I hope you all have a wonderful day.
