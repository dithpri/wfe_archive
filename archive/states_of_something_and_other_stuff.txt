Something states should unite, it&#39;s a rp region, you choose a place where to start (north west, south west, north east, south east, island 1, island 2 and island 3) and... just be a country, expansion should happen every Friday (I guess), I need to think of war mechanics or rp will not be nice, hmmm. Now there are lines coming from islands to mainland of &quot;continent&quot; to show from where you can go to them or from where they can go to mainland
nations:
Republic Of Something Land Or Something (SomethingLand for short) - green
The Holy Empire of Avarden (Avarden for short) - red
