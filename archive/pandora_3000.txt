[u][b]An Introduction to the World of Pandora 3000[/b][/u]

Pandora 3000 was founded by a small group of friends dedicated to the creation of an in depth nation management, as well as immersive and compelling storytelling through each person&#39;s cast of characters, including a small cast of Heroes. How each person&#39;s nation progresses through the ages, and stands the test of time, is up to them.

This world is one populated by all sorts of fantastical creatures and races. Where magic is a force of nature. Where Myth and Legend are matters of historical fact. The World Before ended in Fire and Water, and new nations now emerge, either to find new paths, or repeat the mistakes of the Old World.
