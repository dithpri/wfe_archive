[u][b]An Introduction to Pandora 3000[/b][/u]

A thousand years after the World Before ended in Fire and Water, the World After has found some stability, with New nations rising from the ashes of the Old, and Heroes emerge to influence nations and create stories to last the ages. The only question... in a World where Myth and Legend are Historical Fact, and Magic is a force of nature as old as time itself, will your nation prosper into the future and stand the test of time... or succumb to the mistakes of the old world?
