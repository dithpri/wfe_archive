[u][b]An Introduction to Pandora 3000[/b][/u]

Pandora 3000 was founded by a small group of friends dedicated to the creation of an in depth nation management, as well as immersive and compelling storytelling through each person&#39;s cast of characters, including a small cast of Heroes. How each person&#39;s nation progresses through the ages following the end of the World, and stands the test of time, is up to them. Only question is: In a world where Magic is a force of nature, and many a Myth and Legend of our world was indeed Historical Fact... How will you do it?
