The Year was 2102. It had been 86 years after the great war had destroyed the planet. Before the war the world was filled with thousands of cultures, languages, and religions, but those marvels in human society soon became the causes of war. On April 24, 2016 the world began to unravel as the super powers contested for power. Within one action the world saw the blaze of nuclear fire, killing billions. We are the remaining peoples of this war, we are the force that will make sure it never happens again. 

We are the National Council of Auralia.

(Note. Neph if you&#39;re seeing this, we want the old Auralia back. not some oppressive regime with Dormill)
