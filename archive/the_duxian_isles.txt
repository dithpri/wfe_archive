The Duxian Isles is an Independant entity in the world, a collection of nations bound by little other than close proximity.
The Duxian countries cherish their freedom to do as they please and will not bow to any outsider, especially the likes of groups like &#39;The Black Riders&#39;. While this region has fallen to them, like all interlopers, they were eventually expunged.
