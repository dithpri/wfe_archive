The Duxian Isles is an extensive area which encompasses all kinds of lands.
There was once a large governing organisation which held the nations together in a grand alliance known as the UDA, but those days are long gone. Today the Duxian Isles are largely independant states which are bound by little other than relatively close geological ties and trade.
