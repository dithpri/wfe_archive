&quot;I forgive those who murder and steal because they did it out of necessity, but a traitor never.&#148;   
     &amp;#8213; Emiliano Zapata   


&quot;There are three things in this world that I hate. Fools, liars and traitors.
A fool I can teach, a liar I can forgive, but a traitor I would shoot, as he is both a fool and a liar...&quot;
     &amp;#8213; A general whose name is lost in memory.

&quot;Everyone suffers at least one bad betrayal in their lifetime. It&#146;s what unites us.
 The trick is not to let it destroy your trust in others when that happens. Don&#146;t let them take that from you.&quot;
    &amp;#8213; Sherrilyn Kenyon
