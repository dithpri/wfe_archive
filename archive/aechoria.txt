Aechoria is a fictional planet I created for my D&amp;D campaign. I am the DM, and there are three nations on the planet of Aechoria. An overview of the nations:
Ehramica is a capitalist democracy of various species, predominantly humans, elves and tieflings.
Vohrohk is a capitalist honor-bound nation of dragons, dragonborn, and aarakocra.
Aethron is a communist dictatorship of aasimar and humans.
