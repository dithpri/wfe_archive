A Region for all Sebastians to reign supreme. This great region occupies a large continent of valleys and mountains, covered in a vast Mediterranian forest. The central mountain is dominated by a wise and powerful nation known as the Oracles of Sebate, who watch over the great land and maintain its culture and heritage. It has been contested many times in its history, but Sebastians have always pulled through in the end.
