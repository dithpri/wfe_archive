A beautiful region, with buildings based in the style of the regional hegemon, Livenikastan. Livenikastan is considered the cultural, economic, and military leader of the region, and as a result the other nations (being less prestigious) have adapted their cultural style and appearance to mirror the Superior Nation.

The Free Land Of Brett State is noted as a very beautiful and lush region, similar to Livenikastan but without the volcanic activity. The Republic of Dillon State is perhaps most well known for its off-putting fecal odor.
