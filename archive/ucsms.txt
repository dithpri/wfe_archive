Welcome to The United Confederacy of Soviet Minecraftian States.

The UCSMS is an international federation lacking borders, existing only as a concrete entity in both time and space.
As a form of official policy, the UCSMS adopts no official state ideology but Minecraft.

Endorsing the Republic of Captain Planet automatically enrolls you in our Regional Guard, which serves to defend us from outside raiders.

Additionally, admission is limited to three (3) nations per 24 hour period.
Satellite States of current nations are obviously exempt from this rule.
