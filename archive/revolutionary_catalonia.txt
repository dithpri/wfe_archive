[b][color=666666]Revolutionary Catalonia[/b] (July 21, 1936 &#150; 1939) was the part of Catalonia (a region in northeast Spain) controlled by the anarchist and socialist trade unions, parties, and militias during the Spanish Civil War. 

The growing influence of the Communist Party of Spain&#39;s Popular Front government and their desire to nationalize revolutionary committees and militias brought it into conflict with the CNT and POUM, resulting in the Barcelona May Days and the eventual replacement of the CNT by the PCE as the major political force in Catalonia. &#151;Wikipedia[/color][hr]
