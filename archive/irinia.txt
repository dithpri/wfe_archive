Welcome to Irinia. 

In this Region we are aiming to establish a supranational entity 

In order to succesfully participate I need the names of your ministers of Regional affairs (or the person in charge of these affairs, your overlord or whatever). 
These Regional government debates will occur in the regional forum. Descisions are made by unanimity.
For the rest the Regional Forum is used to talk to your fellow nations and to post newsflashes about your nation. Remember evrything is RP, which implies that your post will have to be posted by an individual within your nation. if your leader is saying somthing it has to be posted like this: 
President Solume Verlator: &amp;quot;blablabla&amp;quot; 
((OOC post have to happen between brackets))
