[b][u]WELCOME TO THE STEEL ENTENDRE![/u][/b]
[i]&quot;A darker today, for a brighter tomorrow.&quot;[/i]
The Steel Entendre is a roleplaying region that looks to create a storyline based plot revolving around the distant future of the universe- particularly the impacts it has inside the Sol System. Alliances, war, conflicts, and more will result from what will come for the leaders and their states. A document displaying the starting countries and themes will be presented somewhere below. Will update this later for something better as a presentation. Those wishing to join, message one of us for the password.
[i]&quot;The future is as bright as the steel we are armored in.&quot;[/i]
