Dear God, please give me strength when I am weak, love when I feel forsaken, courage when I am afraid, wisdom when I feel foolish, comfort when I am alone, hope when I feel rejected, and peace when I am in turmoil. Amen.&#148; &#147;O Lord, we are at the limits of our power to help. For what we have left undone, forgive us.
