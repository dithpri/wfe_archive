Day 1

   I spotted a Coati in its natural habitat today... almost lost my spork.


Day 2

     Spotted another Coati attempting to find food... after consulting my journal, I gave it an offering of a cracker.  I never knew that Coati claws were that sharp.

Day 3

  Attempted to find some baby Coatis for the camera.  Discovered a wild Nathanjer instead.  Shame I forgot the tranquilizer gun.
