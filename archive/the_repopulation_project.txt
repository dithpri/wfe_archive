After scurrilous rumours of a zombie infestation, and unacceptable outside interference in the affairs of the sovereign state, Baron Michael led &amp;quot;The Repopulation Project&amp;quot; to a new location, cold, barren, and inhospitable, yet an ideal canvas for the Baron to continue developing his vision of a strong nation.
