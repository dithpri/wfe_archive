The nation &quot;The Repopulation Project&quot; was founded by Baron Michael. 

After scurrilous rumours of a zombie infestation, and wholly unacceptable outside interference in the affairs of the sovereign state, Baron Michael led &quot;The Repopulation Project&quot; to a new location, cold, barren, and inhospitable, yet an ideal canvas for the Baron to continue developing his vision of a strong nation.

There are absolutely NO ZOMBIES in the Repopulation Project and anyone who says otherwise is probably one of those rotting, stinking traitors who retain some ambulatory ability  post-mortem.
