World Death destroyed the earth, so humanity boarded a huge space ship called the Artificial Satellite to seek another world. they discovered Futurum, that already had a humanoid civilization on it, the futurans. that cant do, the artificial satellite went into orbit around the planet and waged war on it. 
the Artificial Satellite seems to be made of many complexes. The Hundred Line- Last Defense Academy showcases the Tokyo Residential Complex. but that naming convention implies more complexes. 
The New Jersey Residential Complex is one of many domed cities on the satellite.
