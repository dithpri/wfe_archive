Welcome to the [region]Unusual union of random countries here[/region]! We are a group that is not very like-minded, but this region is just a way to express our diversity, from Corrupt Dictatorship to a New York Times Democracy. We feel that we can strongly reflect a fraction of the diversity of the Nationstates world with our large differences in ideologies. 

The group is currently limited to a band of schoolmates just looking to try it out, but we may open up in the future!
