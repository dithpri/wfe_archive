[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been infiltrated and occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr][/color]

[color=#ED4719]This region was previously a despicable gathering ground for fascists and monarchists. It even had embassies with [region]Fifth Empire[/region] at one point. The glorious empire of [region]Appalachia[/region] subsequently planted a covert agent in this cesspool long ago, and after months of waiting, it achieved governor status without the empire&#39;s knowledge&#133; 

Inactive as the empire may have been, General Grievous was eventually made aware of this success, and this region has now been permanently [b]OBLITERATED[/b]! 

Even when he&#146;s not around, he keeps winning![/color]
