[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]This region was previously a despicable gathering ground for fascists and monarchists. It even had embassies with [region]Fifth Empire[/region] at one point. The glorious state of [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation] subsequently planted a covert agent in this cesspool long ago, and after months of waiting, it achieved governor status without him knowing&#133; 

Inactive as he may have been, General Grievous was eventually made aware of this success, and this region has now been permanently [b]OBLITERATED[/b]! Even when he&#146;s not around, he keeps winning![/color]
