Welcome friends,

This region is a safe haven for the vast and vibrant LGBT community on the internet. While we&amp;#39;re all very different, we share a collective identity as at least semi-politically active gays who feel they have some ability to change the world. Whether through the ballot box, civil activism and volunteering, or violent overthrow (...) We all feel we have the ability to change NationStates (and the world) to be a better and more inclusive place.
