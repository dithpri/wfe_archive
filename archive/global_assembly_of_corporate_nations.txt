W.I.P 

The Global Assembly of Corporate Nations or G.A.C.N for short. It is an organization dedicated to the joint protection and development of like-minded corporate nations. Our mission is to ensure the maintained status quo and cooperation between all members of the assembly. As the world increasingly turns against our policies of prosperity and enlightenment. We created this assembly to ensure that our guidance over the global stage is not disrupted or, worse, destroyed.

This region is a casual role-play region, countries here are allowed and encouraged to RP as hard as possible.

Remember: Profit Leads to Power and Power Leads to Prosperity.
