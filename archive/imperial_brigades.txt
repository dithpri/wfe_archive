[b][color=black]Indefinitely self-strengthening under the banner of the unbreakable [i]Fasces[/i] and in tune with the souls of our deceased comrades, we -The [i]Arditi [/i]of the Emperor of the [i]Quinto Imperio[/i]- are fighting with uniform determination against the rotten enemy collective which seeks to spread the weakness of spirit and the miasma of decadence across the borders of mankind; to destroy the little dignity left in the heart of man. [u]No[/u], to destroy the heart of man and to replace it with the heart of the feral beast. 

[/color][color=orangered]There can be no salvation for the world of NationStates without Fascism and its bold soldiers; the true protectors of humanity and its pride.[/color] [color=black]Our spirit will light the dark.[/color]
