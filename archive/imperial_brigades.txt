[b]~ [color=red]FOR THE[/color] GLORY[color=red] OF THE[/color][i] EMPIRE[/i] ~[/b]

This region serves as the Military HQ of the eternal [region]Fifth Empire[/region].

Indefinitely self-strengthening under the banner of the unbreakable [i]Fasces[/i] and in tune with the souls of our deceased comrades, we -The [i]Arditi [/i]of the Emperor of the [i]Quinto Imperio[/i]- are fighting with uniform determination against the rotten enemy collective which seeks to spread the weakness of spirit and the miasma of decadence, and to destroy the little dignity left in the heart of man. [b]No[/b], to destroy the heart of man and to replace it with the heart of the feral beast. 

There can be no salvation for the world of NationStates without Fascism and its soldiers, the true protectors of humanity and its pride.
