[b][color=red]The Imperial Brigades comprises the fighting forces of the social community of the [region]Fifth Empire[/region][/color]. [color=orangered]Our legions are an obsidian altar of conviction to the[i] monolith of righteous struggle[/i]; to force of principles, purpose and direction.[/color][color=black] We stand firm as one whole; an exaltation of the sacredness of noble war, the manifest return of the warrior spirit and the sweeping defiance to weakness in its most [i]diabolical forms[/i]. Souls of the wicked find no rest nor reprieve so long the legion stands at guard; a laser hot sword of the materialized and focused passions of the knights of Fascist justice cutting through tendrils of darkness to establish the [i]Kingdom of the Strong [/i]where virtue and integrity reign supreme.[/color]
