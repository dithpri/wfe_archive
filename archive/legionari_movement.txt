Free and open debate is welcome here, but please be advised that the Mods do not believe in free-speech and so have withdrawn my ability to post on the message board (this was done without giving any reason). [nation]XENI0S[/nation] will respond to personal messages and I am truly sorry that any debate here cannot happen in the open!
