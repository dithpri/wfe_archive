Imgur is an online image hosting service founded by Alan Schaaf in 2009 in Athens, Ohio, United States. Imgur describes itself as &amp;quot;the home to the web&amp;#39;s most popular image content, curated in real time by a dedicated community through commenting, voting and sharing.&amp;quot; It offers free image hosting to millions of users a day, and a comment-based social community. The company supports itself with revenue generated from ad sales, Pro accounts, commercial hosting and merchandise.

The official Imgur mascot is the Imguraffe, which was created originally as an April Fools&amp;#39; Day joke, but was &amp;quot;too cute to give up&amp;quot;, thereafter becoming the official mascot.
