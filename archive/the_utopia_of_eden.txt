Greetings, new leader! I am sure your country could be very successful under your leadership. Of course, happy citizens are a key factor in having a healthy leadership. Which is why I propose to you, The Utopian Dynasty. No matter what we do, darkness will always be there and crime will almost always become a heavy burden on our large cities, like New York and L.A to the U.S.A. However, your citizens can become happy citizens, and your nation will become flourished with happiness, beauty, peace, and prosperity. Everything will never be perfect, of course, but we are trying. So join us in Eden and bliss. And although we&#39;ll never be perfect, dang, we got close. And light would never be light without darkness. Glory to Utopia!
