Sili (Samoan for Grand) is a region in the west pacific who is pro-authoritarian. Any democratic nations are not allowed. Sili&#39;s goal as a paradise is territorial and ideological expansion and eventually becoming an inter-regional powerbroker. Although when not planning for becoming a hyper power Sili is a calm (but interventionist) and proserpous community.
