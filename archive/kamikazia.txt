Kamikazia has long been a small and prosperous region, spanning great archipelagos, oceans, high mountains, vast plains, enormous forests, and gigantic cities.

Ancient legends speak of a god: Roos, who created Kamikazia. Some archaeologists claim there were lesser gods: Urg, Green, and Brian. For ages, Kamikazia was divided into dominions, ruled by various races. Some evidence suggests that there were other factions lorded by lieges. Great wonders of the world were built and destroyed in the many wars fought against (and amongst) good and evil forces.

The population quickly dwindling from all the war, Roos one day used his godly powers and ended it all. The remaining rulers scattered across other regions and, some say, worlds.
