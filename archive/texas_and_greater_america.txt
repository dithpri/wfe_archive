Texas is home to The Republic of Texas and Greater America. Constituent nations who make their home in Texas submit wholly and completely, of their national authorities&#39; own free will, to the law and supremacy of the government of The Republic of Texas and Greater America (hereafter, &#39;The Republic&#39;). The Republic is a large territory, home to vast natural resources, and supports multiple flourishing urban centers.
