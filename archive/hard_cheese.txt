You thought you had it all figured out
You had a plan, a goal, a route
But life threw you a curveball
And you stumbled and took a fall

Now you&#39;re feeling low and blue
Wondering what you did wrong or who
But don&#39;t let this setback define you
You have the strength to pull through

If water could defend you
I&#39;d send you the sea
If cheese could defend you
I&#39;d send you me
