Welcome to the Encampment- a place for fellow nations seeking a place to stay, have a drink, and spend the night. Our regional government is focused on member&amp;#39;s comfort and wellbeing here. Think of this as a place away from those war-hungry and too-big-to-focus-on-individual-needs, and as a region where you can focus on growing your nation at a speed comfortable to you. Mind you, we still are interested in a government, and you will be able to vote for (and run for these coveted positions) leaders and pass regional laws. So sit back, listen to some music, and have a drink. All&amp;#39;s good at the Mossy Rock Encampment.
