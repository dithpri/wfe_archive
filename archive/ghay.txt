The GHAY (Global Humanitarian Association Of Young Nations) is a region of roughly libertarian (basically anything that isn&#146;t an authoritarian dictatorship) leaning nations. It encompasses a wide swath of countries, and is a place of diplomacy and cooperation.
If you&#146;re a person who cares about other people, GHAY is for you!
