The [b][color=red]F[/color]ascist [color=red]S[/color]olidarity [color=red]A[/color]xis[/b] (FSA) is the inter-regional association of the main active Fascist regions in NationStates.
The FSA&#39;s role is to push back against the dissemination of degenerative and maladaptive ideologies in this space whilst also providing its signatories with a rich social environment of brotherhood and cooperation- as well as the numbers and the tools to triumph in their specific regional missions as they take part in the preservation and expansion of positive worldviews.
