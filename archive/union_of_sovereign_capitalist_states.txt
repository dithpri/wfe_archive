Hello! If you believe that capitalism is the only way of creating a happy, efficient nation, You are welcomed into the Union of Sovereign Capitalist States, or, USCS. While we despise communist ideologies and their followers, We do not judge them for their ignorance. As always, free speech is a HUGE part of our union. You can speak your opinion, and hear the opinion of others. 

Our voice will be heard in the World assembly by a poll between nations to decide how the WA delegate will vote. 

For any questions regarding the USCS, or you would like to join, please send me a telegram (Benetosia)
