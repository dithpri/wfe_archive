[b]The Abandoned Playground[/b] is a region lost in time and space, although some scientists suspect it is located behind a sketchy Chinese restaurant somewhere in South Central Los Angeles. Its population of countries consists almost entirely of the puppets of much larger nations, although nobody really knows how or why they have ended up in this deserted urban playground.
