[b]The Abandoned Playground[/b] is a region lost in time and space, although some scientists suspect it is located somewhere behind a sketchy Chinese restaurant in South Central Los Angeles. Its population of countries consists almost entirely of puppets, although nobody really knows how or why they have ended up in this graveyard of dreams.

All nations are welcome to play among the sandbox, but please be advised that eating the wrong mushrooms growing here could be deadly (but they&#39;re probably super awesome)
