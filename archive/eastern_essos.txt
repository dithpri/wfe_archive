Essos is an immense landmass located to the east of Westeros, extending into the far east of the known world. The Free Cities are located on its north-western shores, with the Dothraki sea located deep in the continental interior and the cities of Slaver&#39;s Bay on the south coast. The continent extends far to the east, around the Jade Sea, to the distant and fabled lands of Asshai and the Shadow. Essos climate is temperate in the northern and western portions, and subtropical in the southern &amp; eastern portions. Rainfall generally decreases as one moves eastward in Essos.

The extreme eastern end of the continent has not been fully mapped. 

People or things from Essos are referred to as &quot;Esossi&quot;.
