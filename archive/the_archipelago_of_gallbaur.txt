      The archipelago of Gallbaur is a fictitious collection of islands off the coast of Europe. The island was initially uninhabited, but after Europe sent settlers to the region, the mainland was quickly inhabited by the &quot;Vocondites&quot; (see the Rogue Nation of Vocondus&#39; history for more details). Since then, many nations of different cultures and powers have found the islands, claiming the land as their own.
