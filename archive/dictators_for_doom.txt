News bulletin: Smealton actually best nation

After many challenges and surveys, it appears that the Republic of Smealton is actually the best nation in the Region of Dictators for Doom.  
This may come as a shock to other nations, as Smealton is only a Vice-Delagate, and is not a WA member.  But, actually, it is much, much cooler than all of you fools, ahem, other nations.
I mean, really guys.  I&#39;m a higher level for challenges, I have a strong economy, excellent civil rights and political freedoms... Y&#39;know, the like.  I&#39;m really cool.  Like, really cool.  I even have a larger population than you, Megan!  
Seriously, if you can&#39;t tell by now that I&#39;m super rad, you need glasses.

Smealton OUT.
