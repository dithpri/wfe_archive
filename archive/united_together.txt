Countries of our region gather because we have chosen hope over fear. Unity of purpose over conflict and discourse. Anything that has for far too long have strangled our politics.

Greatest is never a gift. It is earned. Our journey will never be one of short cuts or settling for less. It won&#39;t be the path for the faint hearted, for those who prefer leisure over work, seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, we are the risktakers, the doers, the makers of things. 

Each day, we work towards creating opportunity and possibility, earning prosperity, and repairing this world.
