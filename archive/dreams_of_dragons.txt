[b][color=blue]The [region]Europeia[/region]n Republic Navy set out to sail once again, this time with a new sailor in our midst! With calm waters on the seas, the Navy took it nice and relaxed, getting our new sailor his sea legs, and while we were at it, taught Pichto a thing or two about pointing! Overall, this region is ours now! Move along! :)
