Tweljaysie IV is an independent Minshara-class planet in the Tweljaysie system, located along the Romulan Neutral Zone.  Its inhabitants, mainly composed of the humanoid Tweljaysians, but also including several humans, Vulcans and other species attracted by the planet&#39;s natural beauty, have refused to join the Federation (although it has a non-voting representative on the Federation Council, and Starfleet is tasked with defending it in case of attack) to preserve their neutrality and peace. The several nations on the planet band together in the Summit Nations of Tweljaysie, similar to the late United Nations of Earth, and elections are regularly held to fill its various positions.
