Vartilan consists of thick forests and snaking caves. Most of the island before it was colonized had many savage inhabitants. The island was found by the war like nation of Rukenburg. Rukenburg, being the war like people they are, hunted the natives to near extinction. Rukenburg made a agreement with the natives to stop attacking, as long as they got all of the island except for the cave city the natives lived in. Ever since then, the island of Vartilan has had a very peaceful history.
