Several hundred EY ago, the Milky Way Galactic Council decided that the galaxy, while not ungovernable, needed to be separated into smaller regions. Thus, came Quadrants, which split the galaxy into four. Then came fiefs, awarded to beings of particular accomplishments, some composing of the empires of multiple species, and some only of a single system. 

This is Quadrant B. Stomping grounds of humanity, The Triumvirate, and HMASBC. The most volatile quadrant by far, but also the most powerful.
