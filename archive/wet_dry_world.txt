Wet-Dry World is the eleventh course in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS. The entrance to the course is the large painting with the Skeeter on it on the Mushroom Castle&#39;s second floor. Unique to this course is the ability to raise or lower the water level based on where the painting is entered; the lower the painting is entered, the lower the water level, and the higher the painting is entered, the higher the water level.
