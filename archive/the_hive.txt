A massive super city surrounded by many lush forests and open countryside. Located in the region of Sargatha whilst having been officially exiled from it. The Hive is home to the zergs who&amp;#39;s collective will is spoken through The Hive Lord Tim, who has recently divided the city into nation districts as part of a social experiment, was offered by his oldest ally to reincorporate the first of these nation districts back into Sargatha as an independent nation, doing so however would disconnect it from the collective consciousness leaving the zergs there essentially lobotomized and waiting for death.
