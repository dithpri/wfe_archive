According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. 
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway  because bees don&#39;t care what humans think is impossible.

LONG LIVE THE QUEEN.

LONG LIVE THE HIVE.

LONG LIVE ALVEARE NUCLEI

Nuclear war will be won. Give us some time.
