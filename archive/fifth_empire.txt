[hr][color=darkred][b][i]Founded in 2012 [/color][color=red] The Social Community of the Fifth Empire[/i][/color][color=orangered] is the oldest active Fascist power in the world of NationStates.[/b][/color][b] [color=black] 

Our culturally and racially diverse membership is united by our [i]superculture[/i] of Fascism and by our affirmation of the premise of [i]Meritocracy[/i] and the Caesarian model of the [i]Third Position[/i]. We reject the norms and ideals of the post-modern democratic society and its cult of [i]individual narcissism[/i] in favor of the [i]brotherhood of men[/i] under the care and guidance of the [i]Fascist Corporate-Ethical State[/i][/color].
