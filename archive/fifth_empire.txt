Our international and class-conscious membership is united by our [color=red]Revolutionary Egalitarian[/color] culture and unwavering commitment to the principles of Dialectical Materialism and the Leninist model of the [color=red]V[/color]anguard Party. We reject the decadent values and illusions of bourgeois liberal democracy and its cult of selfish individualism, in favor of the proletarian solidarity that builds and is guided by the Dictatorship of the Working Class.[color=red]![/color][/b]
