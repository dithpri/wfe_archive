[b]Z-Day Order: [color=red][i]EXTERMINATE[/i][/color][/b]

[hr][color=darkred][b][i]Founded in 2012 [/color][color=red] The Social Community of the Fifth Empire[/i][/color][color=orange] is the oldest and largest active Fascist power in the world of NationStates.[/b][/color][b] 

Our culturally and racially diverse membership is united by our [u]superculture of Fascism[/u] and by our affirmation of the premise of Meritocracy and the Caesarian model of the Third Position. We reject the norms and ideals of the post-modern democratic society and its cult of individual narcissism in favor of the brotherhood of men under the care and guidance of the Fascist Corporate-Ethical State.
