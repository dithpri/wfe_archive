The Fifth Empire Ideal  is built upon the pillars of Loyalty, Honor, Obedience, Dignity and Respect.

Those who serve under the Shield of the Fatherland are worthy of its protection.

The Fifth Empire is not a mere territorial empire. It is a spiritual and linguistic body which spreads throughout the entire world. It represents the ultimate form of fusion between material (science, reason, intellectual speculation) and spiritual knowledge (the occult, mystical speculation, cabalism). It is the pinnacle of all the work undertaken by the previous empires throughout Human History.
The Fifth Empire, led by &amp;quot;the hidden one&amp;quot;, will unite the entire world spiritually and culturally.
