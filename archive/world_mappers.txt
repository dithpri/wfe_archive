The World Mappers are countries, big or small, new or experienced. But, all strive by ambition, and here is where that is channeled. I&#39;ll be rooting for you, and whatever adventures may come when facing all sorts of conflicts, alliances, and so much more may come to your hands. So welcome, comrade, to this World simulated roleplay!

The possibilities are endless.
