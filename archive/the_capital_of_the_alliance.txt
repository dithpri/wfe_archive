ATTENTION: In light of recent events, I believe we need to create a regional constitution. To do so, we must right it then put it to a poll. I ask that all who read this send either I, or the regional delegate, your suggestions, concerns, and criticism, and beliefs on the matter. All thoughts will be taken into consideration. I ask that you do this to help our region prosper.
