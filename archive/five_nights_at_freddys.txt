Welcome to the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s region!  I hope you like it here so far.  Here we do lots of roleplays and make sure to keep everyone&#39;s interests in mind. Be warned, though.  There will be treacherous paths that you follow, so make choices wisely! This region is one of freedom, mystery, and warnings. If you love to solve mysteries and follow treacherous paths to solve cases, this nation might be the one for you!  We are a peaceful region, unless provoked, and like to consider all ideas. If you do have any questions or advice, let me know.  If there are any polls I should bring up, then bring it up.  Basically, if there&#39;s anything I can really do to help you, let me know and I&#39;ll do everything in my power. I hope you enjoy it here! :)
