The United Republic of Athearia, commonly known as Athearia, is led by Olechander Moshcalopsis and is known for its few political freedoms and powerhouse economy. 

The Republic of the Kingdom of Kabosu, commonly known as the Kingdom of Kabosu or KiKa*, is currently electing its leader, and is known for its fantastic civil rights and strong public transport industry. 

Both nations, despite being very different, work together in this small group of islands to meet the end goal of world domination.
