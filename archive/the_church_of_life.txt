**The Church of Life**

**Collective Defense**: One of the core tenets of the Church of Life is the commitment to protecting and supporting its members. In the event that a member is under attack or facing external threats, all other members rally to their defense and provide assistance in various forms, including diplomatic aid, military support, and moral encouragement.

 **Ambition for Power**: The Church of Life harbors aspirations of becoming the most powerful region within the NationStates community. While power and influence are pursued, the region aims to achieve these goals through unity, cooperation, and the collective strength of its members, rather than through aggression or domination.
