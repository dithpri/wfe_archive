Located north of Papua New Guinea, the small string of islands contain the largest nation the Federation of the Ten Disciples, once separated feuding tribes, now bound together through peace by the ways of the French Empire. Today the French provide little aid to the region as the Federation has grown large enough to sustain itself. Islands that surround the Federation are colonized but yet have to be developed into sprawling infrastructure as advanced as the FTD.
