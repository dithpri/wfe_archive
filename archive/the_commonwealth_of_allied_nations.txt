Founded 3/31/13 by members of the Allied Republics, we set forth to start a new legacy and a new region. This region shall be a new pillar of democracy to be built completely by scratch off the sweat of our brows. The Constitutional Writing Committee shall work on our founding document to cement the basis for our new region. PM the founder if you wish to join the committee. All ideas are welcome.
