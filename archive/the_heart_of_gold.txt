The unique thing about the Heart of Gold is that it is powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive, a small golden box at the heart of the ship &#151; hence its name. This is, of course, powered by an infinite improbability generator. As soon as the ship&amp;#39;s drive reaches infinite improbability, it passes through every point in the Universe, thus allowing the ship to go anywhere without all of that mucking about with hyperspace and what not.
