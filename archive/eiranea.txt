A huge archipelago of islands spanning everything from sun-kissed atolls to the snow-covered subcontinent of Crealir in its south-west.

Eiranea is most famous as the heart of the vast maritime empire of Falastur, which from humble beginnings as a tiny port on the north-easternmost point of the archipelago expanded across numerous continents and regions, absorbing rivals great and small as it did so.
