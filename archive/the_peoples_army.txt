[b][i][u]This region has been dominated by [nation]J o J[/nation]![/u][/i][/b]

The Simo H&auml;yh&auml; of region snipers is here to take out another disgrace with a clean headshot. This communist region name was once a holding of [region]Antifa[/region] forces, but they have failed to maintain it. Now, the forces of the non-degenerate world have marched upon this smoldering ruin of a region, and have hoisted the [region]J o J[/region]ian flag over the rubble. This region was in the hands of the red menace since 2011 according to WFE Index, but now I have [i]swiftly ended[/i] that streak thanks to their carelessness.
