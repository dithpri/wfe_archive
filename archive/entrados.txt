Tonight, some of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] took their a quick spin around the block in Serboro&#146;s sick ride from their [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]nest[/url]. 
&#147;Are you sure you remember what you&#146;re doing?&#148; asked Captain Alexander, who was riding shotgun. 
&#147;Pfft, of course,&#148; replied Serboro, &#147;like riding a bike, right?&#148;
&#147;You don&#146;t know how to ride a bike.&#148;
&#147;Pfffft. Fight me&#148;

They ran into 3 people and 7 trees.
