A former British possession and a haven for the like of pirates and those beyond reach of the law, the Pirate Republic of Nassau is a nation of thieves and cutthroats. Every pirate, regardless of his ideology, is welcome on its shores. Each ship is its own sovereign law! Let the powers that be tremble before the thunder of our cannons and cower before the might of the nation of pirates!
