[i][b][color=crimson]Hello everyone, and welcome to [/color][color=gold]Allarend![/color][/b][/i]

Allarend is a place for everything and everyone, and I like it that way.
What else is in store for you? Well, allow me to repeat what was in the brochure/recruitment telegram (Shut up, it&amp;#39;s not lazy)

[b]Allarend has elections![/b] [i](Actually it&amp;#39;s more of a dictatorship led by yours truly)[/i]
[b]Roleplay![/b] [i](None at the moment, although I would like to get one started with enough participants)[/i]
[b]Intelligent conversation and discussion![/b] [i](I mean, if you really want...)[/i]
[b]A free buffet![/b] [i](Actually that&amp;#39;s the second turn from the right, you can&amp;#39;t miss it)[/i]
[b]Daily raids![/b] [i](Raiding the buffet)[/i]
[b]&amp;#39;Round the clock defenses![/b] [i](Defending the buffet from buffet raiders)[/i]


[color=gold][b][i]Allarend,[/color][color=crimson] &amp;#39;tis a silly place[/i][/b][/color]
