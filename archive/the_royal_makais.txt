The Royal Makai is a Region of fully-fledged warmakers and peacekeepers, we enforce law and order in places that do not have it. Our combined military strength&#39;s and our single military strength&#39;s will make all of us a sight to fear. A sight to flee from. 

Those who join our Nation will be met with all of our hospitality, from soon-to-rise roleplay boards, to talks about the Region&#39;s next political move. 

The Royal Makai is based off of Mge, Or MonsterGirlEncyclopedia. Our sword enemy is the HLF, And we will stop at nothing to tear their throne of power down, and restore
our rights across our land. 

Rules, are simple.
Treat people with respect. 
Don&#39;t attack you neighbors. 
Speak your mind.

Enjoy your stay.
