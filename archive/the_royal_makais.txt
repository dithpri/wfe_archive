Welcome, to the Royal Makai&#39;s, A Region for the best of people, our enemy now the HLF. We welcome you to the Region, and hope you enjoy your time here. Our goal&#39;s are to take out the bad, plagued, corrupted nations, and those who kill for peace, but not for the greater good. War, ranks, and even promotions will become available to all whom join. Our set of rules are simple, and are based upon common Morales.

- Do not Raid your friendly, allied Nations.
- Say your word, nobody shall be kicked or exiled for free speech!
- Do enjoy yourself, negativity makes the Nation quiet, and putrid.

As the leader of the Royal Makai&#39;s, I bid you all farewell, until events are initiated.
