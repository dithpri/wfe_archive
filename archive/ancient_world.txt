[i][b]Welcome to [color=orange]Ancient World[/color].[/b][/i]

We are a region loosely based off of Stanley Kubrick&#39;s and Arthur Clarke&#39;s century old poems and films that remained in our hearts forever, primary on the [i]2001: A Space Odyssey[/i] franchise. In this roleplay universe, the Earth as we know it was born from a series of monoliths, which caused apes to develop sentience and establish society. All biological processes remained the same, however, this created a large gap between empires in the world.

[b]Quite basically, this is a region based in the modern day with ancient morals, philosophy and technology, aimed at nations which take more pride in discovering themselves than innovation.[/b]
