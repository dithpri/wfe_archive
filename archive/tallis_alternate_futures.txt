[color=darkblue]You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that NPA ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Darn you Stormcoats. NS was fine until you came along. NPA was nice and lazy. If they hadn&#39;t been looking for you, I could&#39;ve stolen that horse and be halfway to winterfall. You there. You and me - we shouldn&#39;t be here. It&#39;s these Stormcoats the NPA wants. We&#39;re all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. Shut up back there! And what&#39;s wrong with him, huh? Watch your tongue. You&#39;re speaking to [nation]9003[/nation], the true High King. 9003? The Minster of Defense? You&#39;re the leader of the NPA. But if they&#39;ve captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?
