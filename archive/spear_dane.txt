[i]The Spear Danes[/i], as the Grey Wardens refer to themselves; were a former &quot;defending&quot; group that called raiders darkspawn. This was done due to the theme of the lovely group, based on a video game. They also pirated their flags from said game. 

Initially leadership was not a problem however personnel left &quot;the deep roads&quot; in order for sunnier pastures within GCR&#39;s. Spear Danes are now a rare appearance, and in micro numbers compared to their former deployment ability. As their fires burn low and finally are extinguished regions like this are captured from their former clutches and narrative is provided for the future. 

TITO always wins. Nice go at it, TGW.
