Bourbon Monarch of the Week: Charles X. Is there truly a better way to follow up the first Bourbon than with the last? No. I didn&#39;t think so. Anyway, born on October 9, 1757, Charles X was the younger brother of Louis XVI (the king during the French Revolution). His most successful achievement as king, was invading Algeria. He ruled for about six years until he stepped down during the July Revolution of 1830. After he stepped down, he was exiled and died on November 6, 1836 in the Austrian Empire.
