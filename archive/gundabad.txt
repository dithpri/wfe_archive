[b] [u] Welcome to Gundabad [/u] [/b]

Gundabad was a region formerly owned by the Orc Chieftain Skoth until his defeat at the battle of Gundabad 12 years ago. The Dwarves led by Gwalin son of Balin had come from the nearby Dwarven city of Erebor and conquered the mountain from Skoth who was beheaded. Angmar had to act with the Dwarves only needing to cross the Northermost segment of the Misty Mountains to reach Angmar. The Witch King dispatched Gothmog to Gundabad , after a 2 month siege the Dwarves attempted a break out charge but ran into Gothmog&#39;s archers and Gwalin was slew by Gothmog personally.

[b]A victory for Angmar!   
Hail the Iron Crown![/b]
