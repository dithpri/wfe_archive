[color=#B8860B][b]Behold the planet Carcinus![/b][/color]

Our region was founded upon the principles of national sovereignty, peace, prosperity, and acceptance. You will find no government here. Laissez-faire philosophy is taken seriously as it pertains to the region&amp;#39;s governance over the nations within it, however nations are free to do with their people as they choose. 

We understand that there is no single, proven method to govern that will lead to happiness and prosperity for all citizens, so we encourage the nations that reside here to experiment with new laws and new ideas in hope of one day finding the perfect formula.
