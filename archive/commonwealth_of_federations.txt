Hello and welcome

This region is meant for people who like a little bit of roleplay and good governance.
And the most important thing is that this region is for people who like to talk to others.
Being part of this region means that you want to socialize with people. We don&#39;t want this beautiful region to fall just because of silence, am i right ?
Besides that, this place is ment mostly for newbies, but NS veterans are welcome too.
