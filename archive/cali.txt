This region is dedicated to the degenerate, the champagne soaked erudite groups that manipulate language and culture for money and power. True Cali behavior. Twisted and broken, dry and breaking, the land has been so offended by the abuses done by the feet of those traipsing it, it becomes dry, hostile, angry. 

Then the land invites the fire to burn it, so that the fires may show the mistakes of those who consider themselves so superior. None are superior without water, when night comes and the heat keeps draining the earth at the same time the thirsty do. This most liberal paradise! Why is it so dead? 

Because they believed their own lies.

Let us learn from their errors.
