A place to just relax, pull-off edgy pranks with your boys Sam Pepper and SoFloAntonio, or higher tier pranks such as the notorious &quot;copyrighting prank&#153; [gone wrong&#153;]&quot; of the word &quot;react&#153;&quot; by the Fine Bros&#153; which led to downfall of their YouTube&#153; channels.

We do not role-play, because that&#39;s just a waste of time in my opinion, handling imaginary problems... ughhh, but that&#39;s just my opinion, you don&#39;t have overreact to it like [region]The West Pacific[/region] xdd, where they overreact to almost anything thrown at them. Because who the fk am I? I&#39;m just some random guy typing over the Internet. xD.

We are not formal, nor we are strict in messaging rules, idk why I have to suppress what you can&#39;t. This, this is the Internet.
