This is Lord Jack speaking. If you wish for safe haven, come to the dragon&#39;s lair. We&#39;re not the biggest, the worst, but we are the bravest. Don&#39;t back down from fear. Death is not the end. We empower one another here. As for the dragon&#39;s legendary treasure, long live sanctity of our nations. Time is a treasure. We don&#39;t want the prettiest gold or the prettiest gun or most powerful whatever. Life is a treasure. Want your nation to have a long life expectancy and live with a time titan, join us. Hoorah to piracy of life. Arrgggghhh!?
