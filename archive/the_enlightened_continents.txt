So much to say but so little space to tell it in.

I&#39;ll make it quick.

The original founder Istabraq left and let the late-updating region die.

And [nation]Star Federation[/nation] refounded.

To make it a military jump point for the future Bozarkian army.

Maybe one great day?

Maybe a day where regions are freed by us, a frontier.
