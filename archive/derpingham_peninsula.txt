The Derpingham Peninsula is a large peninsula that extends into the Derpingham Sea. On the South of the Peninsula is the Golden Straight which connects the East and West and is the center of trade in the world. Several Countries to the South of the Straight are considered part of the Region due to cultural similarities and historical associations with nations on the Peninsula. 

The Akriean Empire controlled the Region since the start of the Common Era. In 432 CE, the empire collapsed with the death of Emperor Mikaek. The Empire was divided into four kingdoms with distinct cultures, which are still clear today.
