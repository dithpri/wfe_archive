[b][color=blue]New Coruscant is a Protectorate of the [region]Mandalorian Crusaders[/region].[/b][/color]
[i][color=green]If you mess with us, you mess with the [region]Mandalorian Crusaders[/region], a large alliance of regions, of which some are colonies (forcefully taken over and colonised by the Mandalorians), some are outposts, some are homeworlds (created for and by the Mandalorian Crusaders), and some are Protectorates (autonomous regions whose founders entrusted the safety of the region to the Mandalorians).[/i][/color]

[b]Welcome to New Coruscant![/b]
We are a democratic region, and welcome nations of all ideologies.
