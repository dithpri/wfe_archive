Coruscant also known as the Imperial Center during the Imperial Era, is a planetary ecumenopolis in the Coruscant system of the Core Worlds. Arguably one of the galaxy&#39;s most influential and important planets, its cosmopolitan culture and location at the end of several major trade routes gave it the unofficial designation as the &quot;center&quot; of the galaxy. In this new age(3000 ABY) after the event known as the Medding all kind of structures, both old and new have reemerged.
