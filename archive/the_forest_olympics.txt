Things you need to do to participate in my challenge. 1. [b][u]Create[/u][/b] a puppet nation. 2. Telegram me your puppets username and your main nations username so I know who is in my challenge and I will let your puppet into my region. Region is called The Forest Olympics. I will let in 20 nations, not including me. Each day I will pick a world census category every day or maybe a couple times every day. The lowest 2 ranking participants will then battle using the challenge feature. The participant who loses the challenge will be kicked from the region and be eliminated from the competition.
