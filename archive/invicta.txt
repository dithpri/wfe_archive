```[b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]The Eastern Pacific Armada[/url] sensed some unusual suspicious activity in your region and we decided to send a patrol out.

[color=#e8ef2b]As our sailors practiced navigating the international waters, we saw a mysterious object in the water.[/color] 
 
[color=#194b19]It looked like a meteor, but it floated unlike what one might be expect. Sensing abnormalities afoot, our newest sailors took aim with their barrels and blasted it out of the water[/color] 

[color=#e8ef2b]If you would like to enlist with the EPSA to blast things out of the water, come join us![/color]
