The first democratically founded region of Newingtonia! 

Hopefully it works.

[color=violet]Our newly elected Prime-Minister of Invicta is [nation]Rhedia[/nation]. Please endorse him![/color]

[color=red]Only WA nations are allowed in the region. If you aren&#39;t in the WA, join up! Please store puppets in [region]Libertia[/region], our brother region.[/color]
[color=blue]A constitutional convention is currently convened, so the region is closed to the public for the moment.[/color]
