[b]Welcome to [color=blue]I[/color][color=orange]N[/color][color=Blue]V[/color][color=orange]I[/color][color=Blue]C[/color][color=orange]T[/color][color=Blue]A[/color]![/b] 

We are a magnificent bastion of [color=orange][b]Freedom[/b][/color] and [color=blue][b]Democracy[/b][/color]!

Founded on the notions of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, Invicta prides itself on being an egalitarian society for all. Whenever tyranny has reared its monstrous head, it has been slain, whenever communism has crept in, it has been shown the door and whenever corporatism has arisen, it has been brought to its knees. We are the light.

[i]We[/i] are the cure.
