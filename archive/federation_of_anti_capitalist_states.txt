We are a Federation of Socialist and Communist states that are fighting to resist worldwide Capitalist hegemony, imperialism, and domination of the World Assembly. If we are able to take significant power in the World Assembly, we will fight to pass through legislation that will empower the working class, let the workers take over their institutions, run their corporations, nationalize the banks, and build homes, schools, hospitals and guarantee a job to every single person on Earth. Fighting Capitalism also means fighting right wing Fascism, extreme nationalism and racism! Strenuous racial and ethnic divisions only divide the global fight against Fascism and Capitalism!
