[b]Administered by [region]The Mongol Alliance[/region][/b]

[b]Viceroy:[/b] Daran Guilagch

Once a populous, strong, vibrant region, Russia SSR&#146;s time has unfortunately come to an end. Owing to the departure nearly all of our population, [region]The Mongol Alliance[/region] has officially dissolved the government of Russia SSR and established an interim administration. 

Should our former members, officers, or founder return, Russia SSR will be reconstituted; however, for now, the Mongol Administration will maintain this page as an homage to the former region.

New nations will not be admitted unless the former administration returns. Instead, please consider joining any of the other Mongol realms: [region]Chinese People Liberation Army[/region], the [region]Turkic Union[/region], or [region]The Mongol Alliance[/region].
