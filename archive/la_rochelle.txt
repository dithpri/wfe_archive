[b]La Rochelle[/b] is a city in southwestern France and a seaport on the Bay of Biscay, a part of the Atlantic Ocean.

La Rochelle became very active in triangular trade with the New World, dealing in the slave trade with Africa, sugar trade with plantations of the West Indies, and fur trade with Canada. This was a period of high artistic, cultural and architectural achievements for the city. The city eventually lost its trade and prominence during the decades spanning the Seven Years&#39; War, the French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
