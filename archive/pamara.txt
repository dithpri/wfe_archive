The United Citizen&amp;#39;s Confederation of Pamara is a continent-spanning international organisation dedicated to human rights, free trade and diversity of states and peoples. It is comprised of many different formal states (Republics), non-formal states and communities (Communes, Commonwealths and Tribes) and other areas (the Wilds), all of which are bound by different treaties regarding their involvement with the central organisation. 

The Pamaran continent is home to many diverse environments, from arctic landscapes in the far north to deserts and jungles in the far south, and is very resource rich.
