We are the Central Bank of NationStates. The bank is open for business to all regions and nations. 

If requested our region can also be used as a mediation point for nations to come together and discuss important trade agreements and other financial matters.

As the bank has only been established recently our services are limited as we organise our offices more efficiently.

James Casey
Governor of the Central Bank.
