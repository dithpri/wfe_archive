A region formed from the union of two great leaders, the States of Infernum was once a region of a bloody civil war which had divided the region into two, painting the land red but two leaders of two different nations, &quot;The Holy Empire of Sunset-Depravatos&quot; and &quot;Helios-ONE&quot; were able to bring peace to the lands with an iron fist and tactical operations. As a result, they had formed the States of Infernum to remember the hellish world they once lived in.
