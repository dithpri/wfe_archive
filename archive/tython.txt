[color=purple][b]Tython was a terrestrial planet located in the galaxy&#39;s Deep Core region that was shrouded in myth. The first Jedi cults built the Martyrium of Frozen Tears there, and some Jedi scholars made the case that Tython was the site of the Jedi Order&#39;s first temple.

Former Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano instructed the Mandalorian Din Djarin to take the Force-sensitive child, Grogu, to Tython. Djarin did so, and placed Grogu on the seeing stone. The stone activated for him. Meanwhile, the bounty hunter Boba Fett, along with Fennec Shand, tracked Djarin there to ask for his armor back. They were attacked by Moff Gideon&#39;s Imperial forces, and after a skirmish, the child was ultimately abducted by dark troopers.[/b][/color]
