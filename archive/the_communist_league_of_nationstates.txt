This region was under occupation, possibly by fascists. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinism[/color][/b] in solidarity with other like-minded groups.
