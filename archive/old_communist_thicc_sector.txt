[region]Old Communist ThiCC Sector[/region] is a small but orderly and powerful region. We are on the rise and will continue to expand. We prefer you to be an empire, fiefdom, peoples class, jingoistic states, or republic class. Although you are not required to be of these classifications, if you are you have a better chance of getting an officer position or endorsements. Embassy&#39;s cannot be made with anyone who is directly allied with our enemy&#39;s. DO NOT expect to hold your position as an officer, they change based on performance. WA delegate only gets authority over the WA for our region. Very limited spots are available for a command position. We will accept you with open arms, however, satellite states will be terminated. Yeet.
