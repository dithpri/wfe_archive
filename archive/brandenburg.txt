[color=black][b]Brandenburg is one of the 16 states ([i]Bundesl&auml;nder[/i]) of the Federal Republic of Germany. It used to be one of the seven electoral states of the Holy Roman Empire, meaning that its ruler was one of the men who elected the Holy Roman Emperor.[/color]

[color=red]In 1618 Brandenburg merged with Prussia to form Brandenburg-Prussia, eventually just becoming a part of the Prussian state. It continued thus until after the Second World War, when Prussia was dissolved. Brandenburg was dissolved by the DDR in 1952.[/color]

[color=orange]Brandenburg was re-established on 14th October 1990, and a merger proposal between it and Berlin was rejected in a plebiscite in 1995. Its capital is now Potsdam, and it surrounds the [i]Stadtstaat[/i] of Berlin.[/color][hr][color=black][region]The Union of German Nations[/region] welcomes you to Brandenburg![/color][/b]
