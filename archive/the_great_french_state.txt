&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Frenchy is my founder, I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down in free regions;
He leadeth me beside the militia.

He restoreth our soul;
He leadeth me to the paths of democracy for our sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of dictatorship, I will fear no tyrant;
For thou art with me;
Thy rule and thy crown comfort me.

Thou preparest a region for me in the presence of thine enemies;
Thou anointest our leaders with choice;
My hope runneth over.

Surely freedom, liberty will follow me all the days of my life;
And I will dwell in [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=union_of_liberal_nations]the Union of Libs[/url] forever.
