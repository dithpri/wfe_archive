[b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]The Eastern Pacific Armada[/url] decided to visit your region for some cake!
 
Cake is great. It&#39;s sweet, just like us, and that&#39;s just the icing on top!

Beneath the icing lies a deep and complex cake, full of layers and flavours. Again, just like us here in the EPSA, full of personality and life. 

If you would like to explore the EPSA, come join us!
