All nations are free to join this region. No matter what kind of state your nation is, no matter in what state the economy is.

Every nation is free to focus on individual development and interests. 
There are only some rules:
-The members of the Union help each other where they want, but are not obbligated to do it. But actions which harm other nations in the Union are not accepted.
-All things that nations want to say in the name of the Union should be discussed first.
-Pay attention to your economy, a strong economy is a strong region. The economy actually will never be a reason to kick some nation out of the Union.
-Foul language, racist remarks or what so erver will never be accepted.
