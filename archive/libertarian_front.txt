Hello to all the Libertarians out there!

Please consider the Libertarian Front! Open to all forms of Libertarianism, this is a new region so you could get an official role.
If you are not a Libertarian in any form I wouldn&#39;t consider joining,
dedicated to the preservation of free speech and autonomy towards each nation and other regions, hopefully we can get a lot of discussions and debates going through polls, the RB and discord.
Role play as much as you want, I will go along with it, however this isn&#39;t dedicated to role playing.
Cartographer is needed!
