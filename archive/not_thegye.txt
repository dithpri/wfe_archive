Welcome traveler, to the wonderful lands we call [strike]Not[/strike] [color=green][b]Thegye[/b][/color]! We have all kinds of wonderful folk, residing along our warm, scenic coastlines and even warmer folk in the northern arctic regions! We have a national round table of intellectuals who decide what goes down across the lands! Enjoy your stay, and be sure to join the WA to endorse our lovely WAD...that we don&#146;t have yet. Don&#146;t worry about the details, it&#146;s fine. I promise.
