The Cospus-Orskan-Doodlepants Federation of Intelligence and Security of the Homelands.

Founded by the supreme overlords of the militaristic nations known as The Armed Republic of Cospus and the Holy Empire of Orska, this region is known for its efficiency and strong isolationist views. The &#39;Democracies&#39; of this area are fair and just, answering what the people want, whether they want it or not. Then, the Rogue of Nation of Doodlepants relocated to the region, and is currently disputed over between the two major powers. However, we are all allies in this region, and anyone who is/was not an ally has been nuked.

Long live Cospus!
Hail to Orska!
... Doodlepants?

The Almighty Region of CODFISH
