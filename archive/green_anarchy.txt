&amp;quot;What is wrong with our culture is that it offers us an inaccurate conception of the self. It depicts the personal self as existing in competition with and in opposition to nature. When we destroy our environment, we are destroying what is in fact our larger self. The notion of the personal self in competition with nature is a delusion&amp;quot;.
