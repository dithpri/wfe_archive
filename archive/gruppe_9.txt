[b][color=red]Gone Fishing you Say? Looks like you gonna need a bigger boat against [u][region]The Red Fleet[/region][/u]![/color][/b]

[b]It seems [region]Gruppe 9[/region] was a new Invader region, with their last target being [region]A Socialist Paradise[/region]. Unfortunately for them it appears they were multiing with WA puppets, and they were booted from the WA, suggesting an army of just one.[/b]

[b][color=red]As revenge for their invasion of Comrade region [region]A Socialist Paradise[/region], [region]Gruppe 9[/region], an Invader region, has been torpedoed by[/color] [color=yellow]The Gloria Al[/color] [color=blue]Bravo[/color] [color=red]Pueblo Armada[/color] of [u][region]The Red Fleet[/region][/u] and has been sent to Davey Jone&amp;#39;s Locker, with [region]Gruppe 9[/region] seemingly unaware that in attack, one should defend their home base.[/b]

[b]A hand against one Comrade region, is a hand against us all, and we stand in Solidarity with Comrades.[/b]
