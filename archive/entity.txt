[i]The Self Is Not Bound[/i]

No one who chooses to still be bound to the mores and social customs of the worthless normal world that they were born into is welcome inside [b]Entity[/b]: only those who have embraced the truth that masks are useful only as tools to hurt others, and that if anyone is to truly be friendly and honorable with anyone else, the masks between them must be destroyed; no exceptions.

With that in mind, all Entity members must use a unique nation flag.  Generic country flags will be considered illegitimate, and grounds for temporary ejection until compliance, and the resulting compulsory self-expression, is forthcoming.  Thank you for your understanding in this matter.
