[i][b][color=dimgrey]The Lands of the Darkness.[/color][/b] A mystical place coexistent with but separate from reality as most know it. A place where anything can and will happen. A place where stories are written.[/i]

TT is a roleplay region welcoming players of all experience levels and skills. However, this is intended to have the unique focus of chronicling events--recording history as it happens. Nations are encouraged to preserve their own tales of events, complete with their own legends, bias, and alternative facts.

An OOC regional government will be set up as necessary and with input from nations.
