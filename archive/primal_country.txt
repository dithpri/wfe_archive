This is the planet where the Primal Form of everyone is able to roam free! If you want to join Primal Country, you must use our secret password to get a spaceship that is automatically routed to our location 10 lightyears away. Communication has to be done with high-tech Wi-Fi systems just to connect to the phone network. Expect Wi-Fi to be extremely similar to Earth&#39;s usual.
