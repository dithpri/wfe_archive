[hr][i][colour=#456d16]An ash I know, Yggdrasil its name; With water white, is the great tree wet; Thence come the dews, that fall in the dales, Green by Urth&amp;amp;#39;s well, does it ever grow. Thence come the maidens, mighty in wisdom, three from the dwelling, down &amp;amp;#39;neath the tree; Urth is one named, Verthandi the next,-- On the wood they scored,-- and Skuld the third. Laws they made there, and life allotted to the sons of men and set their fates.[/colour][/i]
