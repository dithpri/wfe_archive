[i][b][color=crimson]Welcome to PowerPC. The closest thing we have to hell on earth.[/color][/b][/i]

[i][color=axis]Founded as a puppet storage, we have fostered nothing other than 70+ alt accounts so i can easily farm for cards. If you care enough to pop by and say &#39;(Variations of telling someone that they will die in 3 days unless they give them their bank pin)&#39;, you are welcomed to.[/color][/i]

[color=darkred][b]And yes, embassies are (mostly) open.[/b]

IF YOU GOT KICKED, WE ARE SORRY, BUT THIS WILL NOW BE A CARD FARM STORAGE FROM NOW ON.


[nation]Legoaphere[/nation] will now take over all future operations regarding PowerPC.[/color]
