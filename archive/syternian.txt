Syternian.

In the north, mountains.
In the south desert.
To the west hills and grasslands.
To the east rivers lakes and flats.
Forests stretch from north to west.
A great sea sits between the east and south.
Many islands spatter between south and west coasts.
One large island sits between north and east.

A beautiful continent.
