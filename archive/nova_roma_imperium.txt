[b]A Brief History (OoC)[/b]

The precedence of New Rome is nothing new. Established ten years ago by Emperor Darckk Trilam on the platform called Second Life, New Rome was established as an SLMC (Second Life Military Community Group). As it stands today, New Rome looks back on the past and learns well from it, just as we look upon the future with intent to forge a greater future for her imperium.
