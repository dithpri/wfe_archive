A largely flat poverty stricken area of the world, the inhabitants of Humberside often scratch a meager living, either from the land or mining for chip spice of which there exist many rich seams. The grim skyline holds few features save those of the shrines to the regional deity, the Lord Prescott. Little is known of regional customs, mostly drinking and competitive austerity.
