New Country International District is based in America however our ties run throughout the whole world with many countries joining NCID each day. Being founded in 1767 NCID allows you to be free to run you&#39;re country in anyway you may like, however please refrain from declaring war upon anyone outside NCID as it would case International and Diplomatic problems that the higher ups would have to solve. We don&#39;t have a communications server in service as of now and it is being considered however it remains to be put into motion. The leading country in charge of NCID is [Algon] with no current successor.
