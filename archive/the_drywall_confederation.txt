[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] love plushies. The more the merrier. After all, who doesn&#39;t like plushies?

[color=aqua]Plushies give you moral support in everything from cooking to hiking, to gacha rolls. Plushies can be found from the bottom of the sea to the highest peaks.[/color]

Unfortunately we noticed that your region did not have plushies, so we stopped by to give you some!
