Welcome to Ardon!

Ardon is a region for all nations. Regardless of whether the state is in complete anarchy or under an absolute totalitarian autocrat, almost any nation can become a member of government.

Ardon is also open as storage for puppet nations: [spoiler]If you want to store more than one of your nations here, we ask that you telegram the Founder and state your intention to do so. This is meant to avoid corruption, such as one person controlling multiple nations in the government. If only one of your nations is in government but you have other puppets here, no problem; we just want to know which ones they are.[/spoiler]

(This is a very young region; the factbook will be updated with more details soon.)
