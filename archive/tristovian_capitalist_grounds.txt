After A Uprising Starting And Continuing From April 10th 2017, The Tristovian Rebellion Forces Wanted An Area To Be Themselves. This Area Was Destined To Be Small For Sure, But The Rebels Felt Like They Had No Choice But To Fight For Their Need To Be Themselves. They Were Crushed. Destroyed. Annihilated. But The Head Of Tristovia Government Decided That It was Only Just That There Should Be An Area Made For These Outsiders, Less They Must Destroy Their Own People Again. Thus, The Tristovian Capitalist Grounds Were Born. Sure, They were Tiny, Minuscule Actually, But They Were Everything The Minority Group Wanted.
