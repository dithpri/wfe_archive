[u][b]The World Presidium of Bhumi[/b][/u]

Bhumi is a modern-tech roleplaying region, with a focus on realism in demographic, economic, and military statistics. If you want to create a non-human population, please check it through with the administration first. We also accept any and all political ideologies and government structures, from Scandinavian liberal democracies to Absolute Monarchies to Fascism. Variety builds more interesting roleplay!
