The Nordic Tribune is an ancient council of Scandinavian nations dissolved shortly after World War II. Under President Jor&uuml;nd Akeson of the Democratic Staes of Friht, the Tribune has been rebuilt. New members are welcome, as our great region is being constructed. Thank you! &amp;#10084;&amp;#65039;
