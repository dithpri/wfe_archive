A respectable bunch of young adults gathered together under one banner, that banner is our God and Saviour Haddon. Those who oppose shall be perished by his mighty Haddon hammer. We are for Capitalism, Socialism and Authoritarianism respectively. Mainly democratic, potentially slightly mad. If you want to join, go right ahead, if you want to contribute, go right ahead, be productive and happy. May Haddon watch over you always.
