The Keystone Islands is an embassy of the Keystone School. All students are welcome here. We encourage a friendly community and good discussions. We don&#39;t want anyone to get mad, so treat everyone with respect. Don&#39;t kick anyone out unless you have their permission or the majority&#39;s permission.
