[hr][b][u]Explanation of War Status:[/u][/b] [nation]Kitcheners Folly[/nation] is at war with [nation]The Tribes of Fenris[/nation]. I don&#39;t know what [nation]The Darwinian Industrial States[/nation] is doing. He just does whatever.
[hr][b][u]Recent news:[/u][/b] In the immortal words of Dredd Scott-Douglass-Saget-Kitchener: &quot;Oh balls, we seem to have seceded from a secessionist nation.&quot; [nation=short]Kitcheners Folly[/nation] has broken away from [nation=short]The Darwinian Industrial States[/nation] and declared themselves independent from their corrupt government. Will this lead to war? I hope not, because our regional economy is not strong enough to finance a prolonged engagement (more than approximately five minutes of sustained warfare).
