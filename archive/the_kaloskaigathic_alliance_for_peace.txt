Overview
The Kaloskaigathic Alliance for Peace is a voluntary alliance of autonomous nations committed to stability, dialogue, and shared prosperity. It exists to reduce uncertainty, harmonize interests, and ensure that freedom is never left undefended. 

Founding Principle
Peace is not the absence of force, but the certainty of order. When balance is clear, conflict becomes unnecessary. 

International Engagement
The Framework promotes cooperation first. For those not yet aligned, structured engagement and, when required, decisive stabilization ensure that liberty has the space to grow.
