&quot;The Federation&quot;, is an interstellar federal republic composed of planetary sovereignties. The planetary governments agree to exist semi-autonomously under a single central authority based on the Utopian principles of universal liberty, rights, and equality, and to share their knowledge and resources in peaceful cooperation and space exploration; each member world retains its own political and social structure, with the Federation itself serving as a &#39;United Planets&#39;-type advisory body.
