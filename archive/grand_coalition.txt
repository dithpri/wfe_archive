When the Areinnyi became aware of the existence of states, they saw a world divided.
It was then, already thousands of years ago, that they set out the goal of uniting all sentient life under one banner.

First they tried to do so by fire and conquest, but they saw resentment and distrust in those they brought into the fold.
and the world united against the &amp;#39;Agressor from the East&amp;#39;.

Now, they try to do so with Reason and Gold, trying to unite all nations, peoples and creeds in the name of peace and co-prosperity!
