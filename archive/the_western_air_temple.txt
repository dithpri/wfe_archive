[color=orange]We are a small region who wants nothing more than order and justice for all nations in our borders. How we achieve this goal is yet to be determined, but whether it be by science, religion, law, military action, or even something as small as a tasty pie, we will embrace it with open arms. We welcome all, but if you do cause disturbance among our group expect to be punished. In short all we ask is you treat others with the respect they deserve.[/color]
