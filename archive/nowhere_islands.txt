From November 30, 2009 to March 23, 2011, Nowhere Islands was the seat of power for the EarthBound community while in exile from its original home, [region]Eagleland[/region].

During the exile, the EarthBound community was led to Nowhere Islands by Zultistan (Brihutch2021) and led by Zultistan (12/2 - 12/6/09), Ehrfurchtiglund (Dr Shlub) (1/20 - 1/23/10), and [nation=short]Defenestrators[/nation] (Picky) (12/7/09 - 1/19/10 &amp;amp; 1/24/10 - 3/22/11).  After Zultistan faded from existence, Nowhere Islands began to have trouble with invaders.  This struggle forced its refounding under [nation=short]Tazmily Village[/nation] (Picky).

Today, [region]Eagleland[/region] has returned to power and Nowhere Islands is a secondary region in the EarthBound community, mostly home to non-World Assembly nations.
