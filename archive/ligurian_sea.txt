The [b]Ligurian Sea[/b] is an arm of the [region]Mediterranean Sea[/region], between the Italian Riviera and the island of [region]Corsica[/region]. The sea is probably named after the ancient Ligures people.

The sea borders the countries Italy, France, and Monaco. In the east, the sea borders the Tyrrhenian Sea, while in the west it borders the Mediterranean Sea proper. Genoa is the most prominent city in the area. The northwest coast is noted for its scenic beauty and favourable climate.

The Gulf of Genoa is its northernmost part. The ports of Genoa, La Spezia, and Livorno are on its rocky coast. It reaches a maximum depth of more than 9,300 feet. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
