Simply put, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t tread on me&amp;quot; applies 101% here.

A place for nations of any sort who promote a real sense of personal and individual freedom. A little pacifist, in the not getting involved elsewhere kind of way, but in no way passive aggressive otherwise. No interest is had in this region of attacking or working with other regions. These nations all want to be left alone.

New players welcome here as well.
