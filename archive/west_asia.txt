Welcome to West Asia! 

We welcome anyone with any form of government!

Rules are simple: 

1. Endorse our WA Delegate, Monzarista.

2. Be nice and do not cause controversy. (Failure to acknowledge this rule will result in consequences of my choice.)

3. Address any concerns and or suggestions to me (Monzarista) and I will take care of them.


Thanks for joining us and we hope you enjoy your stay :D
