[b][color=red]Welcome to the [i]active[/i] Not Lucerna[/color][/b]

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the galaxy is the mostly harmless and completely [i]active[/i] planet Not Lucerna. Separated from the rest of the NS world, Not Lucerna is home to a multitude of [i]active[/i] nations.

Casual, serious and [i]active[/i] players welcome. Focused on the NS forum. Balanced role-play and realism oriented. Don&amp;#39;t be [i]inactive[/i]!
