The previous region named &amp;quot;German East Africa&amp;quot; was one of the oldest in the NationStates world. It was founded by German imperialists and so named so they could glorify the brutal exploitation their ancestors visited upon the native black population from 1885 to 1919. The NS occupation lasted at least three years, but probably much longer because the records only go back that far.
It took UMOJA forces 133 days to liberate it, starting on Aug. 21, 2012, and completing it on Jan. 2, 2013. The imperialists and fascists will no longer be able to glorify their villany here.
