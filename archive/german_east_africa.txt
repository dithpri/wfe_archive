[color=fire][i]Territory of The Dominion[/i][/color]

German East Africa was one of the oldest in the NationStates. It was founded by German imperialists &amp;amp; the NS occupation lasted at least three years, but probably much longer because the records only go back that far. A group known as [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=tanganyika_and_zanzibar/detail=factbook/id=286313]UMOJA[/url] liberated the region, starting on Aug. 21, 2012, and completing it on Jan. 2, 2013, a total of 133 days. Once their operation ceased, the region of German East Africa was annexed by the imperial forces of [b][region]The Dominion[/region][/b].
