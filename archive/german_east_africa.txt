This is no longer &amp;quot;German East Africa,&amp;quot; this is now [b]East African East Africa[/b], because
[b]another piece of the mother continent has been liberated by [region]UMOJA[/region]![/b]

[b]WE ARE [region]UMOJA[/region][/b], the United Movement Of Justice for Africans, an alliance of black nations both African and Diasporic committed to mutual defense against those who would harm the black people and black nations of the world.

[b][region]UMOJA[/region][/b] fully supports and will never dispute the German people&amp;#39;s right to rule Germany, and in return, we expect the German people to respect the East African people&amp;#39;s right to rule East Africa.

Germany for the Germans,
[b]EAST AFRICA FOR THE EAST AFRICANS![/b]
