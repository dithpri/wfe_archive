Culland was founded by our glorious leader, Robert Mc&amp;quot;Culley&amp;quot; Campbell over 400 years ago. He aspired to create a perfect society, in which all citizens hold equal rights and protections and the horrors and inequalities of western capitalism are left far behind. Elections take place on a yearly basis, so that politicians are always in touch with their constituents. It is home to the Democratic Republic of the Flying Saucy Spaghetti Monster - the greatest nation in the world.
