[i]&amp;quot;Jutland (Danish: Jylland; German: J&uuml;tland) is a large peninsula that juts out from Northern Europe toward Scandinavia, forming the mainland portion of Denmark. It is surrounded by the North Sea on the west, the Skagerrak on the north, the Kattegat and Baltic Sea on the east and Germany on the south. Much of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein is part of the Jutland Peninsula. The Danish parts of Jutland belong to either of the three administrative regions North Jutland, Central Jutland or Northern Schleswig (Slesvig).[/i] ~ Wikipedia[hr]
