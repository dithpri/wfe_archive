The Sambucan Archipelago is a remote chain of islands smack-dab in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It was settled in 1823 by a bunch of idiots too repulsive for even Australia to take in. Nobody likes them or wants to have too much contact with them, so remote they remain.

Repulsive as their inhabitants may be, the islands themselves are quite beautiful. Of course, mankind has taken its chunk out of the space, as it always does; literally, in some cases. There used to be a coral reef there. It was eaten. Still, varying amounts of wilderness remain on each island. Some nations appreciate it more than others.

Democratic socialism is the most prominent political ideology in the region.
