The Arid Badlands, at one point in time, was a very productive industrial park owned by Dahl. The main area of note now is the town of Fyrestone, a once booming community now experiencing a steep economic decline. The Badlands also contain an old Dahl gravel processing plant and a still-operational wind farm, supplying much of the electricity to the nearby settlements.
