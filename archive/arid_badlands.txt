  It&amp;#39;s not for us to calmly rot in graves.
we&amp;#39;ll lie stretched in our half open coffins,
and hear before the dawn the cannon coughing.
The regimental bungle calling gruffly 
from highways which we trod, our land to
save.
  We know all the rules and regulations.
What&amp;#39;s death to us? A thing we despise.
Lined up in graves, our dead detachment lies.
  Awaiting orders for generations to come. 
When talking of the dead, be wise;
dead-men have ears and eyes
for truths and lies.
