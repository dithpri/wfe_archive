[B][color=green]It is said that as Shakyamuni Buddha sat in [I]Dhyana[/I] the demon host tried to unseat him. Mara, the demon god of delusion and destruction, claimed for himself that place under the Bodhi-Tree.

As the demons proclaimed their masters power, Mara demanded that Shakyamuni Buddha produce a witness to confirm his enlightenment. Shakyamuni Buddha touched the earth with his right hand, and Mother Earth immediately responded &#147;[I]I am your witness[/I].&#148; Mara and his demon host disappeared as the morning star appeared in the sky.[/color][/b]
