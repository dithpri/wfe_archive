Strategic Weaponized Organization of Regional Delegations

Hello and welcome to SWORD. This is our game of Ooo within nationstates. SWORD will be the equivalent of the United Nations within Ooo.

SWORD was founded by The Skandzan Rjge, The Republic of Oceanius, and the New Teutonic States in an effort to create a diplomatic and easily accessible medium for all countries in the land of Ooo. Dranlec, who would have been the fourth founding member declined membership which fueled concerns of a demon incursion from the still open Hell Gate below the nation which connects it to its Underworld allies.
