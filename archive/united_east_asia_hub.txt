After being forced out of our former hub from the rotten corpses of our Pan-Asian kin, we have taken vengeance against the undead across the entirety of the East Asia frontier. We have sacrificed millions of our lives to find a new place to settle down and to do business, rebuilding it from scratch, and uniting the peoples into what is now called United East Asia. We have nothing implanted against our own peoples or cultures; we want to save this side of Asia from being decimated by tycoons and tyrants.

Anyone with peaceful intents can enter this region, so long as they adhere to Rebelian law as well as international protocol, enjoy your stay.
