[color=#285F9F]This is a advert to [region]The Schism Collective[/region], also in memorial to The Holy Empire of Evil, a great region of its time. The Schism Collective is a great region, full of opportunities to grow and prosper. You can try your hand in regional politics, running for one of the officers (in the Political Officers Dispatch). You can also join our collective army, with many members under the grand rule of [nation]Lord Traya[/nation]. Whatever you like, whatever you play NationStates for, The Schism Collective has it all![/b][/color]
