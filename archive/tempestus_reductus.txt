I, Lord Revenant the Undying, address my loyal citizens this day, as our nation, once a fledgling empire, has grown to such great size that not even the veil of the cosmos could hold our expanse. On this day, The Paradise World of Nova Raptus, will hereby and henceforth, be &quot;moved&quot; to an unexplored section of the Milky Way Galaxy to form itself as a planet. Astronomers and scientists believe with our advancements in technology, our massive nation shall survive the transport. Upon our arrival, the NRSMC shall be waiting for us and then our lives within the Tempestus Reductus shall begin and our prosperity will continue, as always.
