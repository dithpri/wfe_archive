The region of The Blanks. Built upon the love, wisdom and faith of its past, this region is now among the richest regions in its corner of the world.
Their literacy, science and public safety are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately they lack a little in fuel efficiency and housing.

The Blanks is a autocratic region. There are no opposing groups against the current leadership and this has been so for quite some time.
However, the current greatest threat to the nation is air pollution, but the current leadership is supported by the people to solve this issue.
