Here in The Dictatorial Paradise, we worship our Lord and saviour, Ricardo Milos. We pray to him every morning and every night and hope that he finds his way to our homes to enrich us with his unfaltering beauty and wisdom. Ricardo Milos&#39; nation is [nation]The Commandant[/nation], who we hope will have mercy at our misdeeds, such as refusing to move to [region]Nord Ostliche Militarregiung[/region]. 

Remember! Ricardo is God, and [nation]The Commandant[/nation] is Ricardo.
