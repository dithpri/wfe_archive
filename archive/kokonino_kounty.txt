It is wrong to seek to concentrate power when it should be dispersed. Remain safe in your cages, take orders from, and seek to engratiate yourself with authority like snivelling curs, or fight power wherever it is. Abandon your vain founders, leave them hermits and go out in the world and take the delegature of small founderless regions with only a few close collaborators and revive them. Take power for yourselves. Move from region to region, the revolution should be continuous. Wherever power has settled, it should be overturned.
