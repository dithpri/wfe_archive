The Thug Left is a region formed to represent anti-totalitarian Leftists who reject oppressive regimes in all forms; autocratic, religious and ideological. We are Anti-anti-war and believe in the Jeffersonian idea of the &amp;#39;Empire of Liberty&amp;#39;. Following the Marxist principles of previous centuries, we support the democratic forces in any conflict that will move the world towards an internationally enlightened, secular and egalitarian global society. One in which the proletariat is able to choose their own destinies regardless of nationality and accident-of-birth.
