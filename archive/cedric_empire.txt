Economic, Technological and Military Development.
This region is led by a Governing Body which consists of:
President : United States of Seth Empire
Vice President 
Cabinet Ministers 
Advisors 
Oversight Body
Special MPs

This body aims at promoting fairness, equality and good governance.
It has executive powers to take decisions affecting the Regions and also International affairs.
The President and vice are hand selected by the Founder himself.
We do not have a WA Delegate yet as we do not wish to limit the growth of the region by WA policies which some are unfavourable but at the right moment we shall have a WA Delegate selected.
