This is the former Holy Empire of Alegasia. 10 years ago a group of seperatists, led by 3 individuals, rose up against the religiously tryanical government. The World Assembly had to eventually step in and bring a tense peace to the region. This allowed for the 3 seperatist leaders as well as what remained of the former government to set up their own states in the now war torn region.
