The region of Grand Serachrista, formerly the Kingdom of Serachrista, lies between the Seral and Thanic oceans. It consists of over 21,000 islands, including Serachrista, Port Lisse, Synoda, and parts of Old Arctaea and the Faln peninsula in its territory. After the assassination of King Ehdral II, The Kingdom of Serachrista divided into many warring states, some as small as to compose the crew of a single ship, or a settlement on a lone island. Home to billions of people, priceless trade routes, and abundant natural resources, Grand Serachrista poses an enticing opportunity for forces of statecraft.
