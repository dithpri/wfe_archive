 [b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were recently made aware of a threat to regional sovereignty: [color=red]The World Assembly Elite[/color]! Apparently, these elite nations use their extra World Assembly votes to force policies on smaller regions, and even go so far as to [color=blue]rig elections[/color]! 

After some research, the Hawks found that only World Assembly delegates get extra votes. So, we searched far and wide for delegates that were approving the most [color=red]ridiculous[/color] proposals, and brought them to justice. Another crisis averted.
