A continent of free and spirited democracies united in their indelible and inalienable hatred for [region]The Black Riders[/region]
Long may we reign, free, over this great continent of ours. 

[i]Invasion and instability has lead the Fouder, the most glorious, [nation]Douzx[/nation] to declare a Union-wide state of emergency. Borders have been closed, government buildings fortified. With strength and unity through this challenge our Union will emerge ready to welcome into its Democratic fold the numerous nations of the greater continent; once the miring and dubious actions of [b]The Black Riders[/b] have been undone.[/i]
[u][i]Together, united, we can endure.[/u][/i]

Proposed WA DELEGATE: [nation]Douzx[/nation]
[b]Remember to endorse the WA DELEGATE[/b]
