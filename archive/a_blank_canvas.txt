Welcome to [color=silver]A Blank Canvas [/color], a region that is built just for [color=gold]us[/color]!
[color=silver]A Blank Canvas[/color] is just that, a space of [color=green]infinite possibility [/color]and [color=red]choice[/color], and here [color=gold]us[/color], the [color=blue]South Pacific Special Forces[/color], are the artist. There is only one constant here, that [color=gold]we[/color] choose everything about the region. Feel it needs more tags? Too bad. Want separate RP Forums for different settings? Then join [url=http://thesouthpacific.x10.mx/index.php]TSP&amp;#39;s Forum[/url] and join us in our various RP&amp;#39;s! Want to remove the brutal dictatorship of a government? Go whine to the defenders! Except that last one would probably fail. Most people are smarter than that. But hey, you tried!

Please remember to endorse the [color=blue]SPSF WA Delegate[/color]!
