[u]The Grand Alliance of Conservative Nations, effective as of October 2023, is a Protectorate-class [i]directly subordinated territory[/i] of [region]The New Social Movement[/region], dedicated to upholding the tenets of the Sarasti-Varis tradition through the conservative perspective.[/u]  Nations are invited to join the GAoCN to discuss conservative issues and topics, to promote a more refined conception of conservatism and advance, through their participation in the NSM network, the productive cooperation of comrades under the [color=black]black[/color]-[color=blue]blue[/color]-[color=gold]gold[/color] banner of our awakening.

&quot;[color=red]Conservatism is the other half of progressivism. The Conservative soul and the progressive soul are not diametrical but symbiotic in ensuring the healthy character of the nation[/color]&quot;
