[b][color=#0c123a]The [/color][color=#f26e06]Duskhyn Confederation[/color][color=#0c123a] is an alliance of nineteen provinces, spanning the Western Continent. It is ruled by the Great Council, which is composed of the Lords of each province. The seat of the Great Council is Goodhope, Eastmark.

The provinces each have legislative, military, and financial independence, though they have a shared culture and currency (the sol). The Great Council can only request the cooperation of its member lords and has no way to enforce its mandates.[/color][/b]
