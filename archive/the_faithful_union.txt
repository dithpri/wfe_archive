A frequent violator of the NS World Assembly, The Faithful Union is a revival of spirituality and morality striving always for a structural, peaceful, prosperous, harmonious, orderly and stable world. A world where there are combined Judeo-Christian values and Confucius values, and emphasizing the family and friendship as the building block for society. A world where people respect their superiors and inferiors, their bodies, and others.

In an age of rot and decadence, the Faithful Union serves as a remembrance of morality!
