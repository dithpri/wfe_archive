Have you ever seen what a nation&amp;#39;s like from the penthouse of a skyscraper? No? You probably never will. What we DO have to offer you is something that fits your lowly, shallow lives: a home, a dog, a slave-wife, and beaches that (despite you never being able to enter them) look and feel like your life is actually worth something. With all that to gain, I&amp;#39;m sure our income tax of, well, all your money will suit you just fine! Join today, and learn that you&amp;#39;re not AS meaningless as you assumed.
