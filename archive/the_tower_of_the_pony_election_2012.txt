This is the building that will go down as the first Pony Election Headquarters Of Equestria. It is in here that all the news, speeches, voting, and propaganda is created for the &amp;quot;My little pony president&amp;quot; posts and threads. In the top floor of this famous bilding is where me and my fellow ponies decide how we do all this. Joining is 100% acceptable for any pony, as long as you take part of the discussions of the pony elections and become a brianstorm of ideas for news, propaganda, est. If you are interested, go to the &amp;quot;My little pony president&amp;quot; topic in the general section of the forums to understand this message fully.
