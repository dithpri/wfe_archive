[b]OVERVIEW[/b]
Terra Edisonia is a geographically diverse continent, home to many nations of greatly differing political leanings. There is no central union of the states, but they do meet occasionally in a loose confederation to deal with problems both foreign and domestic. This assembly of states, dubbed the WEACT Meeting, can be called by any nation on the continent, though participation is optional.

[b]HISTORY[/b]
The land of Terra Edisionia was once ruled by a vast empire, but those days have since passed. The old empire fell into disarray and saw massive political strife. It collapsed into a large number of newly sovereign states, some being along the same borders they had as political subdivisions of the empire, others being entirely new entities.
