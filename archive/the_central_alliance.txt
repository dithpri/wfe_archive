[region]The Central Alliance[/region] saw it&#39;s founding to protect the values of [nation]The Federationn[/nation], and still today it stands as a mighty pillar of integrity and power within the borders of our alliance. The true glory of this many-splendored land will see a resurgence in times to come but for now we stand for our own as we have done throughout the ages. Forever may the people of The Federationn and The Central Alliance live in security and unity to respect and protect tradition and to allocate progress when it is warranted. May Cheesus be thy true savior! Abschied!
