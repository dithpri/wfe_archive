Humanity began on the Old World, or so the legends say.  In time, they defiled their home with conflict and greed.  In a desperate effort for survival, the nations of man reached out into the stars.  Great vessels were constructed and drifted out into the darkness, carrying the next generations of mankind forth in frozen slumber.  Now, in this new age, man has awakened to survive, build and grow on new worlds.
