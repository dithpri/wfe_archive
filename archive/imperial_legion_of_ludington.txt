We are an Empire ruled by the majority! An Empire ruled by a new Constitution! An Empire of laws, not of politicians! An Empire devoted to the preservation of a just society. Of a safe and secure society! We are an Empire that will stand for years to come!&amp;quot; -Benjamin James Jensen

Imperial Senate Rules are being spoken of and debated upon. More members are welcome.
