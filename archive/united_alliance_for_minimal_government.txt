[b]Welcome to the [region]United Alliance for Minimal Government[/region]![/b]

Hail to our returning president in interim, [nation]PresidentCatop[/nation]!

[b]The yellow on our flag represents liberty and capitalism; the coiled rattlesnake represents how we only attack when cornered, and we warn before striking, along with eternity. Black represents determination, victory, and the dead who have gone before us. Our flag is minimalistic, just like our politics.[/b]
