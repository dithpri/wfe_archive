After a second invasion by enemy forces, members of the Iron Corps created a similar region.

This region is open to new members although not necessarily meant for it, as most members know one another IRL; this is the reason why a password is not needed. We are of course welcome to knew members, and I will be patrolling the chat.

We specialize in extremist states, as most of our members are either totalitarian or anarchic. All political views are accepted; although if we believe a member is antagonizing another nation based on its political beliefs, that member will be kicked, and, if the offense is repeated, banned.
