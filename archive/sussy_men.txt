[b][color=#B0171F]Tonight the Sekhmet legion did absolutely nothing. Even if we wanted to raid a region it would be impossible because, as the WFE of [region]underground[/region] put it: &amp;#8220;Just saying, raiders, WA Delegate has no powers so it&#39;d be practically impossible to raid us :^)&amp;#8221;[/color]

[color=orange]So instead the legion along with friends from TBH and PRAF decided to just watch anime (I suggest bocchi the rock and lycoris recoil), talk about air quality (it&amp;#8217;s not good), and investigate whether or not qek is joe biden (they are thankfully not)[/color]
