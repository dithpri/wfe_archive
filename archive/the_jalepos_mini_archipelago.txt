The Jalepos islands was once one island, named Cesac island, completely controlled by the nation of Cesac. However, due to unforseen circumstances, many new islands near Cesac island have formed with varying degrees of size and resources.

RECENT NEWS: Due to Newer Hendar putting up a tough fight against Cesac while Cesac being the clearly superior nation, Newer Hendar proposed a peace treaty that Cesac would have all of their islands except for the island of Ulisod. The peace treaty went through and the two nations are no longer in war.
