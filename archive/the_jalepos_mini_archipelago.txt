The Jalepos islands was once one island, named Cesac island, completely controlled by the nation of Cesac. However, due to unforseen circumstances, many new islands near Cesac island have formed with varying degrees of size and resources.

RECENT NEWS: Many defectors from Cesac have started a new nation called &#147;The Opressed Peoples of Hendar.&#148; Cesac and Zeazi plans to destroy Hendar.

Note: the two middle islands that are painted in the cyan color are undiscovered, not ocean. It happened because idk theres a bug? Xd
