The Jalepos islands was once one island, named Cesac island, completely controlled by the nation of Cesac. However, due to unforseen circumstances, many new islands near Cesac island have formed with varying degrees of size and resources.

RECENT NEWS: A new country has come to the Jalepos archipelagos. A large corporation recently asked Newer Hendar for control of one of the smaller unexplored islands. Newer Hendar obliged, and the large corporation has split from Newer Hendar and started a country peacefully.

Note: the map i made is outdated, too lazy to make another one, maybe later.
