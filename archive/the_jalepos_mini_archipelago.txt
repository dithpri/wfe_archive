The Jalepos islands was once one island, named Cesac island, completely controlled by the nation of Cesac. However, due to unforseen circumstances, many new islands near Cesac island have formed with varying degrees of size and resources.

RECENT NEWS: as water levels lower nearby the archiplegaos, many new islands emerge, and nearby islands even combine together. However, there is still a moderate ammount of water, so it *PROBABLY* should not lower anymore. In other news, for some reason, the islands are being pushed further apart. Currently, nobody has an idea of why, but the islands are being pushed apart.

Note: the map i made is outdated, too lazy to make another one, maybe later.
