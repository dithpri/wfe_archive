Welcome to the [region]Venarian Mountains[/region], a rugged, inhospitable but beautiful and lushly forested mountainous region dominated by the two main mountain ranges; the Legendary Three Venar; a series of snow topped monoliths that hold back the Bolshin Glacier in the north and the Rocky Namlins in the south, a lower but wider range that encircles much of the southern coastline.
