[color=red][b]The [u]Sekhmet Legion[/u] of [u][region]Osiris[/region][/u] along with some of their friends decided to go out and celebrate the 4 year anniversary of one of the least special person on nationstates: our moshir Wascoitan! Unfortunately, it didn&#146;t go entirely as planned as some party goers got far too drunk and others seemingly decided to form a circus. Next year I think I&#146;ll just tell people to send a condolence card.[/b][/color]
