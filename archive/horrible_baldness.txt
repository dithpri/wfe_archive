
[b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]The Eastern Pacific Armada[/url] decided to visit your region as part of a training run!
 
We introduced your port of call to our newest recruits joining the navy, and found it quite a warm and pleasant place.

We rate it a 9/10 would visit again.

If you would like to enlist with the EPSA, come join us!
