The GCA (Grand Colombian Alliance) was founded in North America between the nations of the Republic of California, the Kingdom of Deseret, the United States of Arizona, and the Federal Republic of Greater Columbium as a defensive and economic pact in North America against the European empires. So, it is basically an alliance version of the Monroe Doctrine, yet far more imperialistic.
