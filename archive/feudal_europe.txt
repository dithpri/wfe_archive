In the wake of Rome, both East and West we stand to elevate one of the noblest of men to the throne of both of the old empires. To assure the protection of the states in this realm we are to elect one to sit on this imperial throne and declare that Imperium to be restored to the fractured empire which shalt stand once more. Bust as to fall to direct rule of the Imperium, the empire is to pass by elect not by birth unless we so chose and the rights of us princes to rule out land is not to infringed upon. I the name of God we are to extend the faith to the people of the North German Tribes and the moors of Andalusia and those east to where the empire never reached.
