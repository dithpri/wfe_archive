Tis Year one of the Second Age. The foul armies of Giokras the Defiler were crushed and scattered three generations before the start of the Second Age, the last three generations were filled with civil instability following the War of Freedom for Aesanctus. From the ashes rose a great many nations of varying races, elves, humans, gnomes, dwarves, orcs, goblins, and many more. Orcs and goblins would forever be know as creatures of evil, even those that resisted Giokras the Defiler&#146;s corruption. What the Second Age will bring is unknown but it can be said with truthfulness, the Second Age will not be without strife. The Second Age will be a new and trying time in the far-flung and fractured lands of Aesanctus.
