Here in this region, we focus on providing regional members with a platform to perform Warfare on games such as Sid Miers Civilization V or VI. We then post the outcome of any war in-game on a map designated for the region and game currently in session. This will include Space Battles setup on either Space Engineers and or Sid Miers Beyond Earth.
