[colour=red]Welcome to Aperture![/colour] We are a generally laid back community. (so not like the real Aperture then. [color=blue]You  know, the one that kills eryone with portals and science...[/color])
We don&#39;t really concern ourselves with all the wars going on and prefer to stay neutral, so if you want to fight, this Region probably is not for you...

[colour=blue]We only have 2 members right now, and are looking for more! [/colour]
But, if you are here to join Aperture or not, we hope you are having an awesome day!
