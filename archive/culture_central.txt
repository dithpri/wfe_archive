[region]Culture Central[/region], accurate in moniker, is the cultural center of NationStates. Though a newcomer to nationhood, it is no neophyte in the arts. The name of its first member, [nation]Chagall[/nation], was named after Chagall Guevara, the great one-album rock band of 1990 (which coincidentally, got its name from Jewish painter Marc Chagall &amp; Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara, thus the motto &quot;[i]Revolutionary Art[/i]&quot;).  We are more interested in cultural advancement than global domination, and we want war, not peace. Don&#39;t think though, that we will back down when our culture is threatened.
