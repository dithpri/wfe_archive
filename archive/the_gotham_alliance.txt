We have built these great nations from nothing. For so long, we have worked blood, sweat, and tears to create a safe place for people. Now there is evil rising from the governments wishing to destroy the human sanctity of life. The Alliance is here to defend the people from those countries, in hope that our children can have a place they can call &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;. And for the survival of democracy.
