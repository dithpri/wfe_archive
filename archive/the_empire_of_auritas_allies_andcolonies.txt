This region is made of The Holy Empire of Auritas and its Allies, Colonies and Commonwealths. Every nation within this region has pledged its allegiance to The Holy Empire of Auritas. They frown upon any nation attempting to join that may be infected with the zombie plague and demand that any nations attempting to join have a zombie population of 0 (zero) before joining. Whatever you do to achieve this will have a blind eye turned to it, be it dumping the zombies upon your former region and abandoning it, researching a cure or mass-extermination.
