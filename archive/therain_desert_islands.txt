Located west of Rio, Cuba, the Therain Desert Islands are a series of islands inhabited by Illmanic people. It used to be a military settlement for nearly 30 years, but recently there have been &quot;movements&quot; by it&#39;s &quot;people&quot; for a more open immigration system. 


It&#39;s basically a desert. Why would you settle here?
