[b]PLEASE EVACUATE THE REGION ASAP SO WE CAN REFOUND IT[/b]

[b][color=red]TO ALL RESIDENTS WHO HAVE EVACUATED[/color][/b]

I know you are as impatient as I am to begin rebuilding our region. We are waiting on [nation]St Theordos[/nation] and [nation]Princi[/nation] to co-operate, but so far they have refused.

We must consider the likelihood that they are raider nations who were planning a takeover of the region, but have been thwarted by the fact the region has been locked down. They may be hoping for an opportunity to seize the region.

Please be patient. They will be dealt with, and the region will be refounded.
