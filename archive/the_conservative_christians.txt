Welcome! if your are a truly Christian and conservative then this is the place for you. This is a new conservative, Christian and capitalist region that has very nice people. Since we are new, We ask for your help in building this soon to be powerful region. We believe in building each other up not in having pointless arguments that convince no one only drive wedges between member nations.
