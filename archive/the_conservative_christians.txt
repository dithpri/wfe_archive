[b]PLEASE EVACUATE THE REGION ASAP SO WE CAN REFOUND IT[/b]

[b][color=red]TO ALL RESIDENTS WHO HAVE EVACUATED[/color][/b]

I know you are as impatient as I am to begin rebuilding our region. We are waiting on [nation]St Theordos[/nation] and [nation]Princi[/nation] to co-operate, but so far they have refused.

As they have repeatedly ignored requests via the RMB and personal telegram, it is now clear [b]these two are stealth raider nations[/b] who may have planning a takeover of the region. They have been thwarted by the fact the region has been locked down. However, [b]they may still be hoping for an opportunity to seize the region[/b].

Please be patient. They will be dealt with, and the region will be refounded.
