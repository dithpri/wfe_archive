Welcome! if you&amp;#39;re TRULY a Christian, capitalist, pro-life, and conservative then this is the place for you. We are a region that has a lot of nice people. We ask for your help in building this region. We believe in building each other up not in having pointless arguments here. BUT NO LIBERALS ALLOWED!

Please try not to make this region your nations final resting place. We don&amp;#39;t want this place full of dead nations, thank you.
