Greetings! We are a fun, and faith-filled group of like-minded conservative nations. Anyone who endorses the principles of conservatism is welcome here. We do value constructive debate, and sharing opposing views, however, griefing, spamming, trolling, etc. are not tolerated here. As noted above, we are in a re-building stage, so please telegram the Founder or Council members of your intent to join our region beforehand. 

Thank you and have a nice day!
