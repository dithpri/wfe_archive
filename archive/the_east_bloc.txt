&quot;Hello there&quot; - Comrade Hakim.

We are The East Bloc! We are a primarily anti-revisionist Marxist-Leninist region here to represent ML values in the World Assembly. We will allow debates on resolutions and have a region-wide vote on which side to support, after which, supporting the popular consensus is mandatory (abstaining is also an option). We wish to operate as a Vanguard for the masses of NationStates, and accept all! (no trots, succdems, or anarkiddies tho [love you all tho {not the trots tho, ice-pick go brrrrrrrr}])
