Founded in Early June 2016, The Capitalist Alliance of Ethiopia has always followed 3 essential values:

1. A successful region requires a fair Democracy.

2. A fair Democracy requires a successful region.

3. Communism is the worst ideology to ever exist. 

Previously, the founder The United States of New York Giants, was in The Communist Alliance of Ethiopia, thriving to create a democratic scene in a highly communist region. After becoming WA Delegate and bringing many of these democratic values, the nation felt out-of-place, and decided to create an exact opposite region, opposed to them. 

The Region is TEMPORARILY open to ALL. Join now while everyone still has the chance!
