This region is located in the west of the east of the northern part of southern Sunny D Islands. These islands are mostly uninhibited, which is why Solaires Sun Bros decided to settle here after escaping religious persecution at the hands of Dark Sun Gwyngolin of The Kingdom of The Dark Sun. Once Solaires Sun Bros stumbled upon these islands during their escape from The Kingdom of the Dark Sun they decided it would be a safe place to settle and place Solaire of Astora, their religious leader, at the head of their new nation. Solaire established this region so that he may gain allies and partake in jolly cooperation, be the intent malicious or compassionate. New nations of any kind are welcome and accepted.
