Acronym is [b]III[/b], [b]Triple-I[/b], or, called by some [color=red]dry humorists[/color], Three. A region open to [i]anyone[/i] who happens to stumble upon it (we do maintain and enforce a list of rules, however).

If you are reconsidering your move to this region, perhaps [color=magenta]our terrible senses of humor[/color], [color=magenta]our inviting rationale[/color], or [color=magenta]our intended use of a nomial exclamation mark[/color] will sway you otherwise (we thought it would look better with it, but the rules of region-founding don&#39;t allow, sadly).
