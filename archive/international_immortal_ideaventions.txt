Acronym is III, Triple-I, or, called by some [color=red]dry humorists[/color], Three. A region open to anyone 
who happens to stumble upon it (we do maintain and enforce a list of rules, however).

If you are reconsidering your move to this region, perhaps [color=pink]our terrible senses of humor[/color], [color=pink]our 
inviting rationale[/color], or [color=pink]our intended use of a nominal exclamation mark[/color] will sway you otherwise 
(we thought it would look better with it, but the rules of region-founding don&#39;t allow, sadly).

all themes (rift and dark covers most of them)[/b]
