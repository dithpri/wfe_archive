If you&#39;re reconsidering your move to this region, perhaps our terrible senses of humor, our inviting rationale, or our intended use of a nomial exclamation mark will sway you otherwise (we thought it would look better with it, but the rules of region-founding don&#39;t allow, sadly). Of course, the use of an enthusiastic/powerful exclamation mark would sway you away from this region.
