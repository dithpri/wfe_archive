This prosperous region stands where, long ago, mythical Anteovia stood. Many encompassing nations provide free-trade and aid to one another in case of national crises. Years ago, the region (along with the rest of the world) was infected with a vicious and infectious disease. It came as a surprise to most in the region, and because of that very few survivors remained. After cures had been administered, the remnants of the fallen region cleared the messes in their nations and continued on as before. Gelissia is Protelian for Shining Emerald. This name was chosen because for the many vacant years the region&amp;#39;s grassland overgrew through much of the pavement and the natural environment was greatly restored.
