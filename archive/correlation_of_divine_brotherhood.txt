Welcome to the CDB! 
Matthew 28:18-20
18 Jesus came near and said to them, &#147;All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
19 &#147;Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 &#147;teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you. And remember,fn I am with you always to the end of the age.&#148;
