The former Romano-Gothic Empire is comprised of all of the Romano-Gothic Empires imperial colonies and territories prior to the invasion of Bavaria and the Treaty of Geneva. These nations, as newly sovereign states, agreed upon a mutually beneficial decree that states that they shall support and aid each other. To help insure unity, the strongest nation, [nation=hellazar], has created a specific region for them. As [nation=hellazar], being of importance in the rest of the world, he will only stay in the region a few times a month. If your nation was a former colony of the Romano-Gothic Empire, please join to request a safe transition into brotherhood.
