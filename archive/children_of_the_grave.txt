[color=red][b]CHILDREN OF THE GRAVE[/color][/b]

[color=black][b] Once one of the finest raiding outfits to ever take NS by storm. Infamous for its blitzkrieg raids, original executors of the 12 Raids of Christmas, a friend of the great raider nations of the past, some fallen, some still in existence and always the bane of any fendas at the UD witching hours.

We are Children of the Grave, the unrelenting Grave Raiders, we are COTG and as our anthem states:

[i]Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
and all the hate that&amp;#39;s in their hearts
They&amp;#39;re tired of being pushed around
and told just what to do
They&amp;#39;ll fight the world until they&amp;#39;ve won
and love comes flowing through[/i][/color][/b]
