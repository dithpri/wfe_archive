Seemingly tiny, impossibly large, the Magical Girl Subcontinent is an ambiguously large region of land in an unknown location that was built for the purpose of being a save haven for Magical Girls of all types from across the world. For any Magical Girls out there facing a difficult time in their life, on the run from persecution, or looking towards deaths door, the Magical Girl Subcontinent is the perfect safe place for you to retreat to. So come and join us in our sanctuary of magic and whimsy and wonder. 

(It should go without saying that this is a [i]casual[/i] anime-like roleplay region, many are welcome, and severe change is not expected, but please try to stick to the common theme.)
