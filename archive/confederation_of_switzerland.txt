The Confederation of Switzerland was founded on two basic principles: mutual defense between member states and the preservation of democracy. It is our belief that our member states deserve not to have their autonomy infringed upon by the Confederation, but that our alliance exists to defend our individual nations&#39; sovereignty.

We are a confederation of independent states encompassing many languages, cultures, religions, and ethnicities who wish to remain as we are- free and unique.

Switzerland is located in a great mountain range dotted with lakes, making it a perfect defensive location for the Confederation&#39;s member nations to unite together and take on outside invaders.
