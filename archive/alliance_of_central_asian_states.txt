This is the [region]Alliance of Central Asian States[/region] ([b]ACAS[/b]), where each member state has a democratic say on issues that concern the region as a whole. This region was designed for, but not exclusive to sovereign states located in Central Asia, but of course all are welcome here.

A regional government and other features will be introduced when more people join. If you have any questions or requests about the region, telegram the founder (me, [nation=short]Slovaskstan[/nation]).
