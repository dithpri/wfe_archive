Welcome to the Imperium of Sanul! This is a Steampunk Fantasy Asian region for Ulvena and its colonies/puppets. This region is the mystical continent of Sanul, a place where magic, technology, and divinity can coexist. The main landmass known as Sanul is nearly completely dominated by the Confucian Empire of Ulvena.

However, Ulvena&amp;#39;s power is being challenged every day by a separatist group to the northeast, a Euro-centric nation in the southeast, and the unknown powers to the uncharted waters of the west.
