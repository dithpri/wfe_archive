Consisting of everything in creation (at least according to the dictionary), the Cosmos is a very large region. It was created 13.7 billion years ago and is still expanding today. The origin of the Cosmos is shrouded in mystery, some believing some divine creator made it, while others believe science was behind it. Enjoy your stay in the cosmos, and we hope you&amp;#39;ll stay awhile*.

The Cosmos is fair and balanced. Although it has rules - make sure not to break the Laws of Physics - it isn&amp;#39;t too judgmental. Have fun, and don&amp;#39;t forget your towel.
