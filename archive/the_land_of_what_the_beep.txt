The Land of What the BEEP a region of Earth near the center, with millions of fire demons roaming around and giving random strangers various presents. Prepare to be surprised by their gifts.

We allow all types of governments, and anyone can join. Don&amp;#39;t expect much, though - we don&amp;#39;t do too much here. Mostly fight off the water demons before they extinguish the friendly fire demons.
