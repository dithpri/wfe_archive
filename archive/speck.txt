Sing along with the theme song!
Ride on the Magic School Bus
Cruisin&#39; on down Main Street
You&#39;re relaxed and feelin&#39; good 
Next thing that you know you&#39;re seein&#39;
Octopus in the neighborhood!
Surfin&#39; on a sound wave 
Swingin&#39; through the stars
Take a left at your intestine
Take your second right past Mars.
On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS
Navigate a nostril
Climb on THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS
Spank a plankton, too
On our Magic School Bus 
Raft a river of lava
On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS
Such a fine thing to do!
So strap your bones right to the seat
Come on in and don&#39;t be shy &#151;
Just to make your day complete
You might get baked into a pie
On THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS...
Step inside &#151; it&#39;s a wilder ride!
Come on &#151; ride on THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS!
