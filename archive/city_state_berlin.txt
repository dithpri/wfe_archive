[b][region]The Greatest German Reich[/region]

Berlin had been part of the Province of Brandenburg since 1815. In 1871, Berlin became capital of [region]The Imperial Reich of Germany[/region] and in 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg. The Greater Berlin Act was passed by the Prussian parliament on 27 April 1920 and incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. Through this law, it became possible to implement integrated town planning across the whole of [region]City State Berlin[/region]. The act was an important foundation for the rise of Berlin to a cultural centre of Europe in the 1920s.[/b]
