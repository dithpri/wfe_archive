Dragons. We&#39;ve all heard of them. Giant, fire breathing beasts, ready to tear you apart at a moments notice.
But some are different. There are some who are loyal. Who will fight.
In the Claws of the Clouds, we are those dragons. We will conquer any invaders, we&#39;ve done it before. We are ruthless and a force to be reckoned with.
Will you join us?
*** I am SOOOOO sorry to everyone right now! We are still recovering from an invasion, but all involved with this coup have been ejected and banned. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s under control! ***
