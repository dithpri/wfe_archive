Dragons. We&#39;ve all heard of them. Fire breathing beasts, ready to tear you apart at a moments notice.
But there are some who are brave. Who are loyal. Who will fight.
Those who hail from The Claws of the Clouds have no fear of dragons, rather, they live alongside them. Become like them.
We are strong, powerful, fierce and fast. We will fight for what we believe in, and we are a force to be reckoned with. 
Will you join us?
