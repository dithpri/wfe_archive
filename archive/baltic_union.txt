This is a peaceful region. We are situated around the Baltic Sea, we have a very close link to Nordic People ,but at the same time we share same cultures like Eastern Europe. Most of us came from the region [Central Eastern Europe]. DO join it! It is a active region. We only left on a temporary basis, to see how this region works out.
We are situated North of Central Eastern Europe North-West of Eastern Europe and south of Nordic Lands.
