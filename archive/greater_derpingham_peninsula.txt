Nations surrounding the Derpingham Peninsula and Golden Straight.

Once part of the Ancient Akriean Empire, the nations of the peninsula have since grown, changed, and developed into the states they are today. After the fall of the People&#39;s Republic of Derpingham in 1990, the four nations, who share unique cultural, linguistic, and historical bonds, created the Greater Derpingham Peninsula Regional Alliance (GDPRA) in which they share a common currency, have free trade and travel for citizens, as well as a military alliance and regional Charter of Rights.
