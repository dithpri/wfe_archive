[color=blue]The New Pact is a chance for newcomers to this World to really make a difference on the world stage.[/color]

[color=purple]We would love for [b]any nations[/b], with [b]any form of government[/b] to join us. [/color]

[color=blue]You will be [b]guaranteed a say in how we are run.[/b][/color]


[b]We oppose [region]The Black Riders[/region] &amp;amp; [region]The New Blacklands[/region][/b] and aim for their destruction.

[color=red]From now onwards, the founder is to take [b]no action[/b] within the region, [b]unless appointed Delegate[/b]. [b]All power[/b] lies with the [b]delegate[/b].[/color] (Apart from this text!)


Endorse our noble WA delegate, [b][nation=full]Woodrovia[/nation].[/b]

Remember: [b]LONG LIVE [nation=full]Woodrovia[/nation], [nation=full]Frezland[/nation] and [region]The New Pact[/region][/b].
