[color=blue]The New Pact is a chance for newcomers to this World to really make a difference on the world stage.[/color]

[color=purple]We would love for [b]any nations[/b], with [b]any form of government[/b] to join us. [/color]

[color=blue]You will be [b]guaranteed a say in how we are run.[/b][/color]


[b]We oppose [region]The Black Riders[/region] &amp;amp; [region]The New Blacklands[/region][/b] and aim for their destruction.

From now onwards, the founder is to take [b]no action[/b] within the region, [b]unless appointed Delegate[/b]. [b]All power[/b] lies with the [b]delegate[/b]. (Apart from this text!)

[color=red][b]Good News![/b] It&amp;#39;s time for our first ever Delegate Election! [b]Any Nation Can Participate![/b].
I will be [b]removing delegate powers until 12:00 GMT on Thursday 25th July[/b] at which point the delegate will be chosen.[/color]
