The Allied is a region that is meant for a friendly community and to help others.
We do have RP though, but we are still working out the kinks. More will be worked out soon!
As of now there is not much information due that we are a new Region.

[u][b][color=red]The Destiny of the Allied[/color][/b][/u]

The Allied has a major goal to hit, and that is to achieve world recognition from other regions and Nations.
 To achieve that, we will need to gain more nations in the region, and get better stats.
