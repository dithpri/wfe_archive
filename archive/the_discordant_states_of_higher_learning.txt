The Discordant States of Higher Learning (DSHL) is a politically fragmented yet intellectually vibrant confederation of autonomous academic territories, originally founded following the controversial recess of the 119th United States Congress in the late 21st century, wherein members of Congress chose to avoid releasing the Epstein Files. Driven by ideological, pedagogical, and epistemological differences, these territories united loosely under a charter promoting academic freedom, perpetual debate, and decentralized governance. Despite their discord, the states maintain a common defense pact, a shared digital library, and a highly competitive Intercollegiate Games system.
