A region dedicated to contain puppets to hopefully be made into collectible cards next season. The theme is featured around the Catholic Church approved Marian titles and devotions. If you&#39;re a Catholic like me, don&#39;t forget to pray the rosary and pray for the souls in purgatory. Most importantly, don&#39;t forget to go to Mass and go to confession. God bless!
