[hr]Roman Nation needs capable people to join as citizen and to rebuild this nation. This is somehow intended for real life.
Nations and peoples changes but fundamental laws and virtues do not changes. We are a millenary civilization on a planet on the brink of destruction. It is our duty to found back our nation and to save it. [i]Vae victis![/i]
Morality, virtues, democratic principles and human rights shall be the cornerstone of the new Roman nation.
