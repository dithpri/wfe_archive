Ashysmoke is not really the kind of place you&amp;#39;d wish to live in. Actually, most of her inhabitant are here becaus they couldn&amp;#39;t go anywhere els.  Scorching deserts, wild jungles, arid mountains... The peasants have a hard time here. The people only survive here due to one thing: Dreams. Because their dreams shape this world. They create, imagine, draw, write, seam, hunt, sculpt and we&amp;#39;ll, that&amp;#39;s what we sell to our neighbours. We aren&amp;#39;t rich, but we are free.

Still, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean we&amp;#39;re carebears. The inhabitant have to deal with a lot of issues, and mostly the monsters roaming our lands. Everyone here is a born warrior, a powefull wizard or a sneaky rogue as well as an artist, and if we have to fight, we&amp;#39;ll fight fiercely.
