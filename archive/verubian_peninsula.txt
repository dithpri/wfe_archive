A landmass, dominated mainly  by mountains and forests, stretching into the (self claimed) South Veyshin Sea, the Verubian Peninsula has been dominated by the Confederated Territories of Veyshin for a long time. 

However recently new nations have sprung up around it both encroaching from the North and East as well as claiming several of the nearby island ranges. Whether Veyshin can tolerate these new challenges remains to be seen.
