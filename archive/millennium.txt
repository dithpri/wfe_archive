Refounding the old Millennium, an old region of many, many years that once consisted of a few people but shrunk to just myself.
A region lost because I forgot to toggle Vacation Mode (whoops).
A tribute to the old, held by myself.
Should any of the old recall my name, or this region&#39;s name, you&#39;re more then welcome to say hello.
