Diosyn is a remote island region founded by the nation Ranoc. Diosyn was untouched land that long ago was seen as a holy land to a religion since purged from the world. When a tribal people re-discovered the land, they sought to make Diosyn their home. The region has no absolute ruler and allows other nations to do as they please while within their borders.
