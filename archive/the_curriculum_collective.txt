[b]Welcome to The Curriculum Collective![/b]

This is a region for students, by students! Create a nation based on your favorite (or least favorite!) school subject.

[b]How to Get Started:[/b]
1. Pick a subject that inspires you.
2. Tell us about your nation on the [region]Message Board[/region]!
3. We might even create a regional map where you can claim your &quot;subject&quot; as territory.

No pressure, just fun. Let&#39;s make learning (or rebelling against it) a communal experience!
