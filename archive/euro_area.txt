The Eurozone Ort The Euro Area is a group of nations that use the same currency, the euro, and have an integrated economic and monetary policy. Our goal is an ever closer union, where borders between nation states are non existent, and where all of the individual countries in the region are united into one, without the giving up of their sovereignty.
