     The New European Coalition is a new alternative to the European Union, as the EU steps closer to radical rhetoric and inflammatory actions, such as compulsory transitioning into the Eurozone, the Economic and social unification of all European Union candidate states, and the lack of reforms in the Military headspace. 
     At this time, it has been evident, that the bonding and creation of the European Union, has failed at what they were created and intended to do, to bolster a country&#39;s strength through the integration of foreign bonding, not the merging of a country. 
     This is why it&#39;s paramount for a new union to emerge, to take what was the goal of the original EU idea, and redefine it, the New European Coalition.
