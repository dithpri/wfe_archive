[b][url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=antifa][color=red]Anti[/color][color=black]fa[/color][/url] [color=black]is the result and continuing work of the Antifascists of NationStates that extends back years. From past and present, several organisations and individual Comrades have participated in one cause that unites them. Their determination to smash Fascism in NationStates. Their Antifascist activism in NationStates has led to over three hundred Nazi and Fascist regions and growing being confiscated and turned into anti-fascist and anti-nazi regions, never again to be used as platforms of hate.
