Lost Age is a Medieval Fantasy roleplaying group. We&amp;#39;ve been quiet for a bit but check out our previous RPs and if it interests you feel free to spark some new activity into things! Or just look at [url=http://sdrv.ms/1a00MDa]our map[/url]. I like maps.

Discussion and planning take place on the forum thread linked above. The region is just somewhere to put [nation]Lost Age[/nation] admin account really.
