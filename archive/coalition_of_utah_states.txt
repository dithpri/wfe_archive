Here are some ground rules
1. Be civil. What makes the COUS so great is that we have a diverse group of governments, it&#39;s okay to argue, but be civil. Please don&#39;t do it on the message board. If you want to have a discussion message [nation]East Utah[/nation] on Nation States or Google [url=https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SerialDisappointerHalifax] here[/url] and we will make a chat were you can have your debate/argument/discussion, and others can provide their insight. 
2. You don&#39;t have to endorse everyone, but try to. The more votes we have the more powerful.
