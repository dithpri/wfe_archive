Here are some ground rules
1. All names must have Utah in them.
2. All flags must be Gadsden or otherwise approved by the Vice Dipster
3. Be civil. What makes the COUS so great is that we have a diverse group of governments, it&#39;s okay to argue, but be civil. Please don&#39;t do it on the message board. If you want to have a discussion message [naiton]East Utah[/nation] on Nation States or Google [url=https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SerialDisappointerHalifax] here[/url] and we will make a chat were you can have your debate/argument/discussion, and others can provide their insight. 
4. You don&#39;t have to endorse everyone, but try to. The more votes we have the more powerful.
5 Any questions need to be sent by TELEGRAM or GOOGLE to one of the Admins.
6. [color=red]ALL WORLD ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MUST ENDORSE THE WA DELEGATE[/color]
