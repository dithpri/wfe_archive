[b][color=#A60000]Midras[/color][/b] - the land that dreams and yet crushes hope, from the frozen north to the Safavid deserts, where the pennants and colours of its nations flutter in the wake of their destruction and diplomacy - a land so foreign and yet, home to billions of people who populate the very land upon which they toil, fight, and die.

And, of course, the talented writers and roleplaying community who make this possible. This is Midras - and this is our story.
