Don&#39;t ever give up.
Don&#39;t let frustration knock you down.
Don&#39;t let fear stand in your way.
Don&#39;t let time get in your head.
Who cares how long it takes or how many times you try.
YOUR ONLY COMPETITION IS YOURSELF.
And when you finally succeed, the struggle will all be worth it.[/color]
