A island divided between three nations, the western being populated predominantly by natives and the Eastern by more recent settlers. The middle between the nations is a independent protectorate, which us run by two councilmen that are elected (The councilmen usually originate from the two primary countries). 
Tropical weather, rarely marked with hazardous weather makes the island a warm place to live. Forests, and beaches make up a major part if the island, but urban environments are quickly growing as all three nations are modernizing continuously.
