The A.-S. D. completely heads the Doomsday March with the help of Pildron and anyone who would like to survive the Apocalypse would be wise to come here. Or not. BWAHAHAHAHA! Also, if you disobey the code of honor of the Doomsday March, you will be formally annexed by Pildron and Anti-Soviet Doorknobs and your leader will be eaten by roly-polies.
