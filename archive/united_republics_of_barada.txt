The URB is a region filled with turmoil and constant political upheavals, however, it has somehow managed to run itself as a confederacy of separate states. They have certain obligations for example defense, everyone must come to each other&#39;s defense. As of this writing, the only three stable states in the URB are Milnovia, Fin Asaga, and the Kal Republic. Recent encroachments from the Kingdom of Barcia have threatened to eradicate the whole region entirely. It is unsure if the URB can get its act together before its almost inevitable doom.
