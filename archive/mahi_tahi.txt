Mahi Tahi is a recently discovered region that has an incredibly diverse range of biospheres.  There are a number of recently formed nation states that have been identified as participating members within this region.

Due to the varying range of political, social, cultural, and religious beliefs held by these states, there is a degree of tension between their borders. Furthermore, the presiding authority over this region is the Armed Republic of Einhardt Incorporated, managed by the High CEO Grant van de Wetering.

Only the ever-advancing march of time will show how this region develops and makes itself known on the world stage.
