[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] wanted to check out the spooky sights of Halloween. [colour=green]So, we met up with our friends from EPSA[/colour] in case anything decided to possess us or steal our strategic candy supply. We discovered a mansion that was SO OLD, it must have been made way back when people could afford to build one. There were a bunch of ghosts inside, but they weren&#39;t scary at all. In fact, they were kind enough to give us cookies and teeth to eat them with. They said they&#39;re going to open an ectoplasm shop next week, isn&#39;t that great?
