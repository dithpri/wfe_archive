The world beyond the plasteel domes is a desolate wasteland. The choking gas, once a weapon, now hangs heavy in the air, a sickly green fog that twists around rusting skeletons of skyscrapers.  Skeletal trees claw at the sky, their leaves long withered and lifeless.  Silence reigns, broken only by the occasional wheeze of the wind scouring the cracked earth, whispering of a lost civilization.
