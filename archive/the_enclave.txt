This region was first based on the Enclave from Fallout, but after several changes in ownership, it has come to this current incarnation. This region, after its first incarnation disintegrated, was refounded by North America and Great Britain following fears of civil war in a ([i]now defunct[/i]) region by the name of the New Enclave-- a region founded due to inactivity in said first incarnation. This region, though small, made a lot of allies during its peak and stands as a memorial to years past and nations now ceased-to-exist.
