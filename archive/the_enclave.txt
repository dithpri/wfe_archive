[b][u]Welcome to the Enclave![/b][/u]

We welcome you to this great region warmly, and hope you enjoy your stay! (Well, so long as you don&amp;#39;t cause any trouble.) We are dedicated to preserving the liberty of regions long oppressed by hegemony and are here to help.

This region was declared autonomous on April 13, 2413. (2013, O.O.C.)

This region will remain under executive lockdown until further notice. I, as the president, urge you to continue on with your daily activities.
