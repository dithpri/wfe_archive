Welcome to the Enclave! At this point, this region is being used as a puppet dump by its former founder, [nation=short]the United Terran Republics[/nation]. Close to two years ago, this region was the staging point for interregional diplomacy between the former regions Alamiralia and the Solar Empire. Through its storied history, the Enclave has stood as a bulwark against the hegemony of other regions seeking to cause harm to its allies and their sovereignty.

Nations that originally hailed from this region and the related defunct region, the New Enclave, were based originally on Fallout lore for prime roleplay purposes.
