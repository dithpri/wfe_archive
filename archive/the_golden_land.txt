Hey everybody, this is gonna be a great place for anime lovers everywhere,
Every once in a while i&#39;ll try to recommend an anime or you guys can recommend some. As for games and stuff, i will only upload fan-made games that are no longer available for official purchase, in short, if you can still buy it then i wont supply it and i don&#39;t do torrents.

This is also a good place for sharing friend codes, oh and dont be afraid to anime role play in the message board, but be ready if i put up an official message.

only one real rule
you HAVE to like anime.

Also, outside of me i refer to the Delegate as &quot;Beatrice&quot;
(bay-uh-tor-each-A)

Now that formalities are out of the way, Welcome to the golden land.
(if you got either reference please join)
