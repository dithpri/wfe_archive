Rages deep within. 
Heart&#39;s on fire, fever&#39;s risin&#39;, high
The moment of truth draws near
Time will not allow you to stay still, no
Silence breaks the heart and bends the will
Defense is guilty passions out of control
Rules and regulations have no meaning any more
Heart&#39;s on fire, strong desire, rages deep within
Heart&#39;s on fire, fever&#39;s risin&#39;, high
The moment of truth is here
OH!
Is here
Oh yeeeeeaaaaaah!
