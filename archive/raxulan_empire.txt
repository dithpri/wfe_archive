[b][i]The Empire dies on the 20th and I will stop playing N.S. on that date as well, I will also leave all servers that have anything to do with N.S. and block anyone from N.S. so that I am 100% cut off from it for hopefully forever, can&#39;t believe it&#39;s taken me almost 2 years to realize it but I have finally accepted that this is all a complete waste of my time, I will never be great, I will never have a great Empire, I will never have some great world beating army, and my life will never amount to anything in either the real world or a non real one.

Death be to my Empire, my dreams, and my pointless life that I hate more then I can describe.[/i][/b]
