[Hr][hr][Color=goldenrod][b]Today marks the 2 year Anniversary of the passing of Her Imperial Majesty Lady Morrighan the Great of Bunicken. We pray that God accepted her into his Kingdom and that she is now living in the presence of our Glorious Lord and Savior. We also pray that God be with all of her friends and family and to give them comfort, and we also pray that the light she reflected from you onto others never goes out, and never stops spreading your goodness and glory. Thank you God for sending your Son to die for us so that when we die we can be with you, and be reunited with our late friends and family that have accepted your salvation. In Jesus name, amen.[/b][/color][hr][hr]
