States are not moral agents, people are, and can impose moral standards on powerful institutions. In this possibly terminal phase of human existence, democracy and freedom are more than just ideals to be valued - they may be essential to survival. For in reason, all government without the consent of the governed is the very definition of slavery. It is hard to feel individually responsible with respect to the invisible processes of a huge and distant government. Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a delegate and representatives and government officials, but the voters of this region.
