 Formed under the idea of creating nations the creators take relatively serious. No cookie currency, absurd stockpiles of WMD&amp;#39;s that make no sense and unleashed on others &amp;quot;just for the hell of it.&amp;quot; I want to eventually form a realistic region that takes themselves and their nations serious enough to have informed debates, offer true trade and agreements, and RP as if we were really nations and states that existed in the real world. No promises here of invading other regions, defending others, and the like, just a promise that I will take you as serious as you take yourself.
