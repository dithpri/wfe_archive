The Kingdom of Floptropica

The Kingdom of Floptropica has a rich history, and was founded in the year 1420, after a decade long struggle for independence from a harsh empire. The kingdom came after the amalgamation of three member states, The Most Serene Republic of Flop-Tok, The Principality of Northern Floptropica, and finally The Holy Empire of Trishland. The third and final state joined later, in 1569, when Trishland relocated the capital of their empire to an island in the region. 

Nowadays, all is controlled by a central government, with countries cooperating and operating in a monetary union, allowing citizens to work and live wherever they want in the kingdom.
