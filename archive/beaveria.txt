[region]Beaveria[/region] is founded on the belief in two things: beavers, and freedom.
[b]While in [region]Beaveria[/region]:[/b]
-Join the WA. Endorse [nation]Insannus[/nation].
-Scout for nations to raid. Because of our limited size these nations must be frontiers, preferably with only one or two WA members. Remember: [b]We raid to expand the interests of [region]Beaveria[/region] to encompass the world.[/b]
-Remain free. Nations are required to have political freedom below average or better or be democratic. Nations not fitting these requirements cannot hold regional office.
