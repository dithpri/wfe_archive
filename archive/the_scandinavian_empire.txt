The house of Lords make laws. After they make laws, the people can do a poll to see if the laws should be in. If the voting is yes, then it goes back to the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the Dukes and Lords, and the Minister leads war. The minister can veto those laws. If the voting says no, then the House of Dukes will try to compromise with the people. If the Prime Minister vetoes the law even with the poll saying yes, The House of Dukes make a compromise with the Minister.[/b][/color]
