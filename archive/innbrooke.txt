[b]Welcome to Innbrooke, a small village in the middle of nowhere. Ask the villagers and they&#39;ll tell you that &quot;We&#39;re beside a deep forest, filled with berries and game - and on the other side a beach filled with crustaceans. Eh... that&#39;s all.&quot; You must be here for an NS vacation, eh?

Take a break from your high-rise regions and visit the Inn, even if for a short time. Have a drink, tell tales of battles: of raiding and defending honorably or talk of tanks or Obama. It doesn&#39;t matter. Welcome to Innbrooke: a village worthy of your second home[/b]
