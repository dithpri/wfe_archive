We Mandalorians exercise military and economic influence over a dozen systems in our region of the galaxy. These include Breshig, Cheravh, Concord Dawn, Draboon, Gargon, Harswee, Hrthging, Jakelia, Mandalore, Ordo, Vorpa&#39;ya, and Zanbar. The area we control, located in grid sector O7, has contained upwards of thousands of inhabited worlds in the past, although currently it stands around a few dozen.
