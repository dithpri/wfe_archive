History: [nation=Halcones] previously refounded this region as a colony of [b][region=New Britannian Empire][/b], holding FRA rangers down for an entire week, who were duped into thinking Halcones&amp;#39; puppet was a native. It caused great embarrassment for them, particularly seeing that the puppet Halcones used was dirty!
