Greetings, visitor! First off, I&#39;d like to point out that Changelings are not bugs. Just because we live in a hive, that doesn&#39;t mean we are insects or something. We were once ponies, but once we showed different thoughts than Princess Celestia, we were cast out and changed. It is our lifelong goal to get revenge on Celestia, though I have tried and failed failed a few times. If you&#39;re not up for revenge, that&#39;s fine, you don&#39;t have to be. I just hope you support our side of the story. Any questions, concerns, and/or other comments can be brought to the founding nation of [nation=short]Nuclear Launch Codes[/nation], who can most likely answer, reply, and/or consider them. We hope you enjoy your stay, and please tell anyone else you know on NationStates about us!
