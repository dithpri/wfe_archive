The Rules were made to increase freedom  and good experiences, not to restrict it.
Rule 1. Do not violate another&amp;#39;s freedom. Exception: if the freedom in question violates this rule and is not covered by this exception that freedom is to be violated within reason.
Rule 2: Do not insult choices made by others, unless said choice violates Rule 1.
Rule 3: Do not insult or assume based on unchosen facts about others.
