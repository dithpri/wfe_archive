We&amp;#39;ll keep The Red Flag flying here.[/color][/b]

    [color=red][i]The people&amp;#39;s flag is deepest red,
    It shrouded oft our martyred dead,
    And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold,
    Their hearts&amp;#39; blood dyed its every fold.
                           
                         (chorus)
        Then raise the scarlet standard high.
        Within its shade we live and die,
        Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,
        [b]We&amp;#39;ll keep the red flag flying here.[/b][/i][/color]
