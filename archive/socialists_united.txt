[region]Socialists United[/region] is a Socialist region, welcome to all Left-wing Comrades and random region travellers.

Refounded by [region]The Internationale[/region] after the Fascists and Nazis failed to keep their hands on the region.

We&amp;#39;ll keep The Red Flag flying here.

The people&amp;#39;s flag is deepest red,
It shrouded oft our martyred dead,
And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold,
Their hearts&amp;#39; blood dyed its every fold.

(chorus)
Then raise the scarlet standard high.
Within its shade we live and die,
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,
We&amp;#39;ll keep the red flag flying here.
