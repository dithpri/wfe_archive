[b][color=orange]HAPPY NEAR YEAR[/color] from [region]Europeia[/region]!

The [color=green]Europeian[/color] [color=red]Republican[/color] [color=navy]Navy [/color] went on the prowl to mark the beginning of [color=pink]2021[/color]. Sailing through the seas, zippy as can be, switching fast and jumping past the fenders on the seas. Not even alcohol could stop the triggers from occasionally being okay!
