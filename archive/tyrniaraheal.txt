Welcome to Tyrniaraheal!

[u][b]Current News[/u][/b]:
So it just hit me today that I kept choosing regions to belong to that were sporadic and random about rp&amp;#39;ing or loads of inactive users, and I felt like I had so little say. So I decided to just up and create my own region. I&amp;#39;m looking for active NS users who would like to help me shape and build a great active region that allows users to be creative and have fun. Lots to do, lots of hopes and goals!!!
