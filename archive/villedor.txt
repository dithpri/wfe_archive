[b]In the wastes of a zombie infested world, one city stands. This city, Villedor, is all that stands between the Human race and extinction. As the factions of the city battle, trying to take control of the resources, changes were happening in the world outside. Towns collapsed, factions rose to power, and new, [i]terrifying[/i] infected variants appear.

The factions of the City are sending groups out, out through the few holes in the walls. What will happen when these people, people who have known luxury compared to those outside, meet the crazy people outside the walls?

Welcome to the end.[/b]
