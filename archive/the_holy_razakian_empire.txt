Only join this region if you wish to be part of the Holy Empire. If you do join you are still allowed to govern your nation, but your ruler has to swear alligence to the President of Razakia, alter their flag so that there&amp;#39;s a mini version of the Razakian flag on it, and change their motto to the Razakian motto. You also have to change your government type to a Holy Empire. It is highly recomended that each country should make one puppet nation in order to make the empire stronger.
