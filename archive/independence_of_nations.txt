This day marks the second anniversary of Chorua, Chorutmo, Tanmai, and hundreds of many other nations that were made by Patrick Whiting. It was fun to create many random nations and see how powerful or imperial they would get, I never planned on playing this for 1 year.

Long live the Armed Power revolution!
