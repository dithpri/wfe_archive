The CIC is a coalition of independent, sovereign nations. Nations that seek to practice trade and commerce with other nations without meddling among entangling alliances. The CIC welcomes nations of all variances, so long as hostilities within the Cooperative shall not muster. Over the coming days, as more members are elected into the Council, the CIC Constitution shall be drafted. Also, upon members&amp;#39; approval, it shall be ratified.

Together, we will make great, prosperous strides towards future Innovation.
Best regards, [nation]Relicuum[/nation]
