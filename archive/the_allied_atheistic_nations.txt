[b]What is Atheism?&quot;[/b]
[i]&quot;Atheism is the arrogant belief that the entire billion galaxy universe was not created for us.&quot;[/i]
Atheism is the disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.
And for some reason, [i]some[/i] religions think that this is ridiculous. *cough*Christianity*cough*

[b]Yes, the Religious tag is just a troll.[/b]
