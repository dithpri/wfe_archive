Welcome to Nova Terra
The lands of Nova Terra are renowned for their vast mountain ranges, sprawling forests, and hilly landscape. The region is made up of 4 great landmasses, surrounded by numerous smaller islands. A large portion of the North-West is currently occupied by The Emirate of Saint Riviera, which keeps a watchful eye over the surrounding lands. The East is occupied by the United Districts of Rania and its surrounding satellite states. Nova Terra is open to a wide spectrum of political orientations, and does not itself represent any one philosophy, however tensions are escalating between the two largest and most influential nations, the United Districts of Rania and The Emirate of Saint Riviera.
