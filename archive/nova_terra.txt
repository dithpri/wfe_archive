A small, select group of nations that fight among each other over almost every issue. Founded by the United Districts of Panaven, along with Saint Kabbek and Taorominastan. There is currently a power struggle between the three as to who should lead. As the big three fight they divide the smaller nations against each other, causing a three-way civil war.
