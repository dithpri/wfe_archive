I wish I was in the land of cotton,

Old times there are not forgotten;

Look away!  Look away!  Look away!  Dixie Land.

In Dixie&#146;s Land where I was born in,

Early on one frosty mornin,

Look away!  Look away!  Look away!  Dixie Land.



I wish I was in Dixie, Hooray!  Hooray!

In Dixie&#146;s Land I&#146;ll take my stand

to live and die in Dixie.

Away, away, away down south in Dixie.

Away, away, away down south in Dixie.
