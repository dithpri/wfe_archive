A land of machines. Though they call themselves people. They are made. Manufactured. And aren&#39;t really people. But they adapt, and learn. The network must bolster more machines.


Humanity had long since left this land behind, none know how or why or even exactly when, just a long time ago it was. Fragments of data are all that remain, and now the machines use these many fragments to form various scenarios to try and be human, though it is an impossible feat.
