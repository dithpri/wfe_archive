A region for defenders of [color=blue]Argentina&#39;s sovereignty[/color] over the [b]Malvinas[/b] (Wrongfully named &#39;&#39;[color=red]Falklands[/color]&#39;&#39; by [color=red]British imperialists[/color]) islands, as well as San Pedro island and South Sandwich islands. 
The fact Britain [i]illegally invaded them[/i] in 1833 is indisputable, since they had abandoned their original settlement over 60 years before, and the Spanish had a more recent presence there.
We support the islands being returned to our country by any [u]non-violent[/u] means possible. 
You can come in no matter your political ideology (as long as it isn&#39;t discriminatory). This region IS about Argentine Sovereignty over the Malvinas, you can argue about your ideology somewhere else.
