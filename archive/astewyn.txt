Astewyn, the realm of civilization, and the home to man, beast, and things yet unknown. From lush, fertile river valleys, to the coldest and most cruel mountains, the great continent of Acherus holds home to the greatest empires, kingdoms, and lands that have ever seen the light of day, and is bristling with beautiful, rolling landscapes, and ripe with resource. This land is the cradle of civilization, home to thousands of years of ancient history and untapped knowledge. The land itself has been rife with war, fire forging it&amp;#39;s bloodied histories. Soon, however, with troubled times and turmoil approaching, the entirety of the realm may be facing a fate most unknown.
