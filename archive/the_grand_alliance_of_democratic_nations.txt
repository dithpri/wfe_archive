[b]The Zombie Apocalypse is upon us, research a cure quickly![/b]

Until Z-Day is complete, the Grand Alliance is instating martial law to maintain order in the region. The region is password protected and all officers positions are suspended for the time being. All are greatly encouraged to start working on a cure immediately and begin curing other infected members when they have found one. Thank you for your compliance.
