Welcome to the Grand Alliance of Democratic Nations!

Next to the Gulf of Blong, several nations gathered to bring a message of peace and freedom to the world. They have united as &quot;The Grand Alliance of Democratic Nations&quot;. The members help each other, value the opinions of all, and hope to further the reach of democracy throughout the world.

We seek for allies and members to spread the word of trust, unity, freedom and hope. We help the weak to ban each sign of fear and despair. United we will bring peace to the world.
