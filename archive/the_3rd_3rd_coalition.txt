Originally founded in 1854, participated in the American Civil War, World War 1, World War 2, Korean War, Persian Gulf War, Iraq War, and the Syrian Civil War.

In 2019, our longtime WA Delegate lost the election. However, he had powerful friends, including the founder. He ejected almost everyone from our region and slaughtered those who resisted.

Now, the 3rd 3rd Coalition has risen from the dust of the 3rd Coalition. 

Thank you for joining the 3rd 3rd Coalition
