Saved by [region]Libertatem[/region]! Once a member of [region]The Libertatem Empire[/region], this region was entangled in a Communist plot to destroy the region by a wave of invasions by [region]The Black Riders[/region] and even [region]The FRA[/region]. [region]Libertatem[/region] restored and stabilised the region, but when all of its nations ceased to exist [region]The Impact Federation[/region] was no more.
