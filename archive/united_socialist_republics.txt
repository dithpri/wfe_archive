Normality has been restored to the [region]United Socialist Republics[/region].

The occupation by invading forces from [region]The Revolutionary Corps[/region] has come to an end.

As a long term resident, we are proposing a general election to return the USR to democratic control when the turmoil is over. See the message boards for the latest developments.
