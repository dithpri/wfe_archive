The Authoritarian States of the East Pacific was founded by the remnants of the National Socialist German Workers&#39; Party on the 20th of November, 1946. Their ideology consisted mainly of Fascism and Authoritarianism which led to the fast success of the new nations led by the remnants. Fast forwarding to the early 2000s the Authoritarian States of The East Pacific are considered to be one of the most brutal and unforgiving nations that the world has ever seen.
