OLD TALE, NEW TRADITIONS

The legend immigrated to the new world with the Irish, and it collided with another old world tradition and a new world crop. Toward the end of the 19th century, jack-o&#146;-lanterns went from just a trick to a standard seasonal decoration. In one of the earliest instances of the jack-o&#146;-lantern as Halloween decor, the mayor&#146;s wife had several pumpkins&#151;lit from within and carved with faces&#151;placed around the party, ending Jack O&#146;Lantern&#146;s days of wandering, and beginning his yearly reign over America&#146;s windowsills and front porches.
