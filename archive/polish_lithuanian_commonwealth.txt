[b]Death to all Kings! The regional royal family were all hung publicly in front of their palace, before it was burned to the ground and replaced with a collectively owned, public assembly area. Down with all Gods, all Monarchs, all Tyrants and all Rulers! Poland and Lithuania are now free from statist oppression![/b]
