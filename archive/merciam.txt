[color=blue]Founded September 21, 2016. Even as we grow, let us remember our small beginnings.[/color]

A Region where all nations, Totalitarian and Benevolent; all people, Black, White, Asian, European, American; and all Religions, Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, can find a place amongst friends.

[color=red]We are small, but we can grow. We are weak, but we can become strong. You can go to big regions, just to become another statistic, or you can come here and help create something to call your own. Will you just become another member, or will you help make a lasting difference that you can be proud of?[/color]
