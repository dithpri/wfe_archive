[url=https://i.sli.mg/fNvGDw.png]I don&#39;t think so.[/url] I&#39;m pretty sure it was obvious that you were trying to invade [b][region]Psychotic Dictatorships[/region][/b] with your petty nation (which is absolutely impossible, as we all know), I think [b]DEAREST LEADER[/b] deserves to take over your land as a punishment.
The victims can telegram me though, if they praise me enough I might give them the region back, since it holds no value to us dictators.
