Supporter of Comradeship for we either live united or die divided, Humanism for understanding this world and expanding your horizons to unlock the future, Atheism for the concept of god is faulty at best and terrifying at worst, and Authoritarian Democracy where everyone has a say, but the leader chosen by the people for the people is the one who makes all the critical decisions helping keep politics clean and serene and not the clown show of most democracies today. The military is the righteous backbone of society, they keep it from falling into chaos, and they are the ones who make human rights worth a damn, support it so that they can support your country and everything you stand for. If you can respect that then you are welcome to join.
