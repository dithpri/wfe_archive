Grettings fellow Steampunk enthusiasts !

This region is based on my own steampunk and clockworkpunk universe. It is, as the name suggests, an endless cloud ocean with rock-solid isles of various size floating in the eternal sky. Basically, you can have any form of government here, as long as you limit your technology to 1914.

Please endorse The Dominion of Captain Beckett as the WA delegate.

Have fun !
