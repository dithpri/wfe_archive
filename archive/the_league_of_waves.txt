Here we enjoy a healthy balance of stress, memes, and the occasional crying fits.  In this region you are allowed to do as you seem fit; however, please keep it appropriate.  The region is run by elected officers and the Founder/Delegate.  Legislation is passed through the Supreme Council.  For more information about the governance of the region or election cycles please refer to the regional constitution.

Elections are currently held once every three weeks.
