The Sovereign Islands are a group of island nations that have split from the &amp;quot;mother country&amp;quot; differing views. They felt the &amp;quot;mother country&amp;quot; was too far away to control the islands and so they joined together to write &amp;quot;Declarations of Independences&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;mother country.&amp;quot; Knowing that the mere majority of the islands and even some of the &amp;quot;mother country&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; population wanted the independence of the island nations. The Parliament in the &amp;quot;mother country&amp;quot; accepted the declarations and all governments are on peaceful terms with the &amp;quot;mother country.&amp;quot; The nations have joined together to form a political, cultural, trade, defense, and welfare organization (like NATO) simply called &amp;#39;The Sovereign Islands.&amp;quot;
