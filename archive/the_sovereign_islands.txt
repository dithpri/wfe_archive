The Sovereign Islands are a group of island nations that have split from the &quot;mother country&quot; differing views. They felt the &quot;mother country&quot; was too far away to control the islands and so they joined together to write &quot;Declarations of Independences&quot; to the &quot;mother country.&quot; Knowing that the mere majority of the islands and even some of the &quot;mother country&#39;s&quot; population wanted the independence of the island nations. The Parliament in the &quot;mother country&quot; accepted the declarations and all governments are on peaceful terms with the &quot;mother country.&quot; The nations have joined together to form a political, cultural, trade, defense, and welfare organization (like NATO) simply called &#39;The Sovereign Islands.&quot;
