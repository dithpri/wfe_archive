U.N.N. is a peaceful but defensive organization of nations, willing to come to each others aid in a time of need. Supporting each other both economically and Militaristically. The goal of the U.N.N. is to better further their countries by combining weaknesses and strengths so that there is a secure backbone for the countries of the U.N.N. The U.N.N. is like a committee in which they make important choices for better developing the U.N.N. as a whole. No one nation is more powerful then the other. Each one is equal in every way.

&quot;Coming together is the beginning. Staying together is progress. Working together is success.&quot;
