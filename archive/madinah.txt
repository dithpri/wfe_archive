Madinah (classically known as Yathrib) is the second holiest city of Islam. It is the resting place of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muhammad (peace be upon him) emigrated to Madinah in 622 CE, after which it became the capital of the Islamic Empire throughout the life of the Prophet and the Rashidun Caliphate. Madinah is centered around the Masjid An-Nabawi, which was built by the Muslims of Madinah and Makkah after the migration of the Prophet to the city. Every year, millions of Muslims from around the world visit Madinah to pay their respects to the Prophet and his Companions at their graves, which are located in the city.
