Greetings. If you are reading this, then you are probably a Fallout fan. If not, then I highly suggest you go search for information about Fallout. It is a great video game series. This region is based around an alternate Fallout 3 where the Enclave defeats the brotherhood. From there, the Enclave procedes to unify the wasteland and expand. Their Empire currently has control of all of the Capital Wasteland, and some regions beyond. They are working on conquering the Pitt and Point Lookout. They are trying to get the Rivet City cruiser operational and plan on setting up a base in Maine.
