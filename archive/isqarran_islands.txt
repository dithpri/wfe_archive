The Isqarran Islands are a small, sovereign maritime region located in a dispersed archipelago across the temperate southern oceanic belt. The region is composed of independent nations that share a common orientation toward structured governance, moderated political systems, and respect for intentional sovereignty.

Anchored by the Dominion of Isqarra, the region maintains a non-Frontier status, meaning regional governance is exercised directly by the founding state rather than by World Assembly populism. Entry is restricted and subject to review.
