The Fifty-Eighth Planet of the Gamma Planetary System. Currently under the control of the Principality of New Keron, Keronians have invaded almost every planet they come across, except for Pekopon, or as Pekoponians call it, Earth. Shamed by their defeat, the Keronians returned to Keron, and revolted against their commanders, founding the Principality of New Keron.
