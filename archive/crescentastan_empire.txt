700 years ago there were 4 great powers. These were; Islamastan, Shiastan, the Kingdom of Dohdalla and the almighty Mesometropolitania. When they coalesced, the gargantuan empire of Crescentastan was formed. This empire no longer exists today, but is immortalised by the new, economically-powerful nation of Shairland.

Join Crescentastan today and we will rebuild the Empire!

(REMEMBER - Islam is the only way).
