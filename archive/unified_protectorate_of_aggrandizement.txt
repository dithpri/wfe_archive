The Unified Protectorate of Aggrandizement (UPA) is a collective region of diverse world actors with varying motives. Each nation is believed to be notable enough that comradery has become a necessity. Peace between national actors is encouraged, but not a requirement of the UPA. Together, we follow the central goal of improving the power of member nations, regardless of the cost to others.
