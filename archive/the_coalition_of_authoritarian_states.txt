Welcome to the Coalition of Authoritarian States! Headed by [nation]Perpetuus[/nation], we are a friendly alliance of states that pride ourselves on our total control over our people. However, we respect other nations&#39; beliefs and governing systems, unless they try to force us to change our ways. Any region is welcome to extend embassies to us, and any authoritarian or totalitarian nation is welcome to join. [nation]Perpetuus[/nation] is not part of the World Assembly and does not plan to do so in the near future.

The Coalition was founded by [nation]Perpetuus[/nation] on the 11th of February 2016.
