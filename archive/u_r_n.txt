URN law will be updated every time we pass a law. If broken you will be punished. Traditionally, the last option on a poll is a joke, so it wont actually go into effect. If you want to be on the map, TG Paledonn. We have RP here in our region. Our motto is, [i]If you&amp;#39;re not first you&amp;#39;re last.[/i] If you have a funny video, tell the Paledonn and he may post it!
