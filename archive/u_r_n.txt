The [color=green][u][b]United Republic of Nations[/b][/u][/color] is dedicated to democracy within our region.  Our regional government is a Constitutional monarchy.  URN law will be updated every time we pass a law. If broken you will be punished.  Traditionally, the last option on a poll is a joke, so it wont actually go into effect.

[b]We accept embassy requests from regions with 10+ people.  We protect our embassies with the URN military if called.[/b]

Our motto is, [color=purple][b][i]If you&#39;re not first, you&#39;re last.[/i][/b][/color]
