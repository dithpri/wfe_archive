The [color=red][u][b]United Republic of Nations[/b][/u][/color] is dedicated to democracy within our region.  Our regional government is a Constitutional monarchy.  URN law will be updated every time we pass a law. If broken you will be punished.  Traditionally, the last option on a poll is a joke, so it wont actually go into effect.[b]We accept embassy requests from regions with 10+ people.  We protect our embassies with the URN military if called.  [/b]Our motto is, [i]If you&#39;re not first, you&#39;re last.[/i] 
 
[b]WE WILL NOT BE BULLIED INTO SUBMISSION![/b]  Raiders stay away.
