The [color=red][u][b]United Republic of Nations[/b][/u][/color] is dedicated to preserving our regional democracy. Our regional government is a Constitutional monarchy. URN law will be updated every time we pass a law. If broken you will be punished. Traditionally, the last option on a poll is a joke, so it wont actually go into effect.[b] We protect our embassies with the URN military if called. [/b] Our motto is, [i]If you&amp;#39;re not first you&amp;#39;re last.[/i] If you have a funny video, tell the Paledonn and he may post it!
