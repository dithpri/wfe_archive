&quot;Have you ever heard of the tragedy of Lord Maggius the Lize? I thought not, it&#39;s not a story the Jedi would tell you - it&#39;s a Biff Legend.

As the story goes, Maggius was a maggot. No, seriously, the man was a maggot hiding in a man costume. How was this possible? I have no idea either. I just know that Maggius had a good life, a family, a wife and a child - WHO WASN&#39;T A MAGGOT SOMEHOW.

Anyways, one day he was shedding his skin and got caught. That was about it, really. I&#39;m not really sure what the morale of this story was.&quot;
