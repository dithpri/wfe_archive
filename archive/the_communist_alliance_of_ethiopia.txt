The Communist Alliance of Ethiopia has been existent since the 1900s, in which Negus Yousef created the Communist Alliance of Ethiopia which was inspired by Karl Marx&#39;s ideologies. Negus Yousef had great intentions for the Communist Alliance of Ethiopia, but sadly were unable to spread the ideologies of Communism due to lack of military forces. Now, a century later, the Communist Alliance of Ethiopia thrives with the Communist, Iron Fist Dictatorship of Negus as their leader. With Negus in charge,they will set forces abroad to spread the word of Communism and hopefully, one day make the whole world a world of equality.
