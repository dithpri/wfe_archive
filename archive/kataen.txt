Hello and welcome to the great Kataen! After years of civil bloodbath and senseless violence, Kataen has united again, becoming stronger in the process. We united to create a better life for all the citizens of Kataen, striving for stability and safety. Kataen is a peaceful region that does not want to quarrel with any others, but be warned, if you choose to raid us, you might be biting off more than you can chew.

We intend to implement that with Unionism (look it up). 

Accepting all embassy requests.

All are welcome in our wonderful region.

Glory and honor to Kataen!

Endorse whomever you want. Current WA delegate is [nation]The Balreskan Union[/nation]
