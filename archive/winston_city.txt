Nobody is in Winston City because they want to be there.

It is a black whole of crime and corruption. Populated by people drawn in by its&amp;#39; dark allure but unable to escape the grasps of its&amp;#39; vices.

The local mob used to provide some resemblance to law an order while the &amp;quot;government&amp;quot; was happy to let the city burn, but recently the mob has been growing restless, and the citizens have to take justice into their own hands.
