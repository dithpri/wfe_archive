FASCISM: A totolitarian ideology hostile to any form of democracy. Most fascists move for military, unity, nationalism, and strong leadership. In democracy, leaders are weak and turn their backs on their people. In fascism, the leaders are strong and are to the total point of love and pride in their nation.
