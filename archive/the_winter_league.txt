The Winter League is an alignment of dire necessity
in the cold and often remote Northernly reaches of
the world. Trading partners, international allies, any
of these things at need - but only for the common,
mutual, benefit. There are no free dinners in the
frigid depths of winter.

The members of the league are held to their
pact by the otto, &quot;In Cold Necessity Bound.&quot;
