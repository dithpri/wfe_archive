Welcome to [color=darkblue][b][u]Kurona[/u][/b][/color], a world on the brink of conflict. Where heroes will be born and slain, alliances will be forged and broken, legends will be made and forgotten, and factions will compete and cooperate. This is a world where members are free to govern their nations as they see fit, where every choice has a lasting effect on the present and the future.
