Welcome to [color=ab9438][B]Osiris[/B][/color]!
[b]We&amp;#39;re the true home of glitter-automatons and the finest booze this side of Dali&amp;#39;s liquor cabinet![/b]

[hr]

We politely ask that you endorse our Pharaoh, [B][nation=short]Venico[/nation][/B], as well as our Security Council, composed of [nation=short]Cormac A Stark[/nation], [nation=short]the Imperial Crown[/nation], [nation=short]Diamete[/nation],  [nation=short]Biyah[/nation], and [nation=short]Dalimbar[/nation]. Doing so guarantees us a larger vote in the World Assembly.

We invite you (yes, you!) to our [url=http://goo.gl/9Y5Le1][color=ab9438][B]official Forums[/B][/color][/url], where you can become a citizen, as well as our [url=http://goo.gl/ZvG4Oj][color=ab9438][B]official IRC channel[/B][/color][/url].

We  ask that you observe our [b]endorsement limit[/b] of 40. 
We finally ask [B]RMB recruiters and their ads[/B] to go [B]elsewhere[/B], as you are [B]banned [/B]in Osiris. (And not particularly effective.)

[color=ab9438][B] &curren; In other news, please endorse our  new Pharaoh of Venico, and thank Asta when you see her! &curren; [/B][/color]
