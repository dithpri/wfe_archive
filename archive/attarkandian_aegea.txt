The continent of Aegea has fallen under Attark rule. Once home to the Cosmotellurian Dominion and a collection of city-states, a series of bloody revolutions and a war known as the &amp;#39;Lightning War&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;The War of Empires&amp;#39; left the entire continent in upheaval. The rapidly-emerging superpower of Attarkand, an offshoot from the Cosmotellurian Dominion, subjugated the entire continent through warfare and subterfuge, and the Norland family&amp;#39;s iron-fisted rule continues to this day.
