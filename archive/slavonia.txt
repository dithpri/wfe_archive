[b]Slavonia[/b]) is, with Dalmatia, Croatia proper, and Istria, one of the four historical regions of Croatia. Taking up the east of the country, it roughly corresponds with five Croatian counties: Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Po&#158;ega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Srijem, although the territory of the counties includes Baranya, and the definition of the western extent of Slavonia as a region varies. The counties cover 4,848 square miles or 22.2% of Croatia, inhabited by 806,192&#151;18.8% of Croatia&#39;s population. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
