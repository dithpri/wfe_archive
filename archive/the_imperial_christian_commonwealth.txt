The Imperial Christian Commonwealth is a geopolitical alliance of sovereign, culturally British nations bound by Trinitarian faith, shared imperial heritage, and a devotion to mid-20th century values. Inspired by the Commonwealth of United Australia, the ICC is both a union and a fortress: a radiant citadel of Christian conservatism in a world fractured by secularism, decadence, and disorder.

Formed in 1957 at the Charters Gate Accord, the ICC is not merely a military or economic bloc, but a civilisational pact. It unites nations across continents that never truly left the shadow of the British Empire.
