[b]A specter is haunting NationStates - the specter of [color=red]Communism[/color]! All the powers of Defenderism have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter, but [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to meet this nursery tale with a raid of [color=green]capitalists[/color], [color=purple]emperors, kings[/color], [color=blue]telemarketers[/color], and other generally wrong-thinking regions.
