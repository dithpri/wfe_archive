For those who seek power, glory, and success, welcome to Northern Dalrawduel! 

Founded to carry on the republic that once existed in [region]Dalrawduel[/region], this region operates under the law system known as the Medieval Compact of Dalrawduel (located below). If you wish to join the region, please read over the document so as to be informed of what laws you are required to follow. You need not read over the entire compact, but need only know what applies to you. Due to lack of members, we do not currently have a WA delegate or High Justice, but should we ever acquire holders of those two positions, we shall begin functioning as Dalrawduel once did.

We will be glad to receive you as a member of this fantastic region!
