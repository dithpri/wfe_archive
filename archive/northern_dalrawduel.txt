For those who seek power, glory, and success, welcome to Northern Dalrawduel! 

Northern Dalrawduel is an extension of [region]Dalrawduel[/region], a medieval-themed region with a great variety of nations. We have instituted its former regional constitution, known as the Medieval Compact of Dalrawduel (located below). Please read over this document so as to be informed of what laws you are required to follow. You need not read over the entire compact, but need only know what applies to you. Due to our current lack of regional members, we do not currently have a delegate or High Justice; however, as soon as we gain enough citizens, we will start up the government processes as needed.

We will be glad to receive you as a member of this fantastic region!
