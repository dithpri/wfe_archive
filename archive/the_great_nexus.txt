&amp;#127760; The Great Nexus &amp;#127760;
&quot;Where Sovereigns Converge, and Empires Are Forged.&quot;

Founded under the visionary leadership of Teufort, The Great Nexus was born from a simple but powerful idea: unity without submission, strength without tyranny.

Here, the diverse nations once scattered across distant worlds have gathered to form a singular beacon of civilization &#151; a hub of might, innovation, and destiny. The Nexus serves as both sanctuary and citadel, a place where alliances are forged, rivalries spark, and greatness is inevitable.
