Freezing Moon was created on April 15th, 2013 by Sorg, the leader of The Dominion of Sorg. The reason behind the creation of Freezing Moon was to have a region where metal would reign supreme and every member of this region is free to run their countries however they please as long as the countries are friendly to each-other and remain in alliance.
