The Kenntler Archipelago, led by the Kenntler Archipelago Legislative Authority (K.A.L.A.), is an industrial island paradise. K.A.L.A. is headed by the Secretariat of the region, with the WA Delegate leading right under the Secretariat. This board decides many of the major decisions such as communication and immigration. If any new leaders want to join under the authority please contact the Secretariat, or the current WA Delegate. K.A.L.A does impose many polls for the public to decide on for the safety of our great member nations. May luck befall our Secretariat and our WA Delegate.
