The [b]Socialist Popular Movement[/b] is a region that strives to uphold Marxist principles and establish a new socialist order. We at the SPM welcome any other comrades that share our same vision of a socialist paradise, whereby all factors of production would be within the control of the proletariat, the bourgeois would be overthrown through revolutionary methods and the people would finally be liberated from despotism and greed.
