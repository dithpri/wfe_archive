2000 years ago, a ton of goofballs all ran around in fun and games. Until one day these people found themselves in a new land. These inhabitants called themselves &quot;Bubbes&quot;, so the name Bubbesworl was founded. After the bub culture started involving more culture from other planets, they later changed the language to bubbian(https://lingojam.com/Bubbian) which later changed the name to Bub World.
