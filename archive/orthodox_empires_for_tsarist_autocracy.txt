Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationalism

This region I do by claim In The Name of the Tszar, Bosef I, to provide a chance for political and idealistic Protection and Proliferation of Tsarist Autocracy, Enlightened Despotism, Radical Centrism and Eastern Orthodoxy. This foundation is but a temporary materialization until this region harbors more like minded Autocratic Tsarist brethren to lend their efforts and tools of creativity to help guide the paternalistic, enlightened despotism towards our Glory. I await thee, noble Autocrats who reign supreme, wielding Iron Fists but wearing Velvet Gloves, to join levee en masse until we engulf each corners of all these collective Nation States with our Divine Right and Enlightened Absolutism!
