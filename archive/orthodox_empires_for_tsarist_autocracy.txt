Orthodoxy, Autocracy, Nationalism

This region I do by claim In The Name of the Tszar, Bosef I, to provide a chance for political and idealistic Protection and Proliferation of Tsarist Autocracy and Eastern Orthodoxy. This foundation is but a temporary materialization until this region harbors more like minded Autocratic Tsarist brethren to lend their efforts and tools of creativity to help guide the paternalistic, authoritarian direction towards our Glory. I await thee, noble Sovereigns with Iron fists and fiery hearts to join more and more until we engulf each corners of all these collective Nation States with our Divine Right of Repression and Faith!
