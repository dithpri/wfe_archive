The Cranial Gateway is a dimension between reality, fantasy, virtuality, and subconsciousness. Despite that, anything&amp;#39;s possible here, even the things that don&amp;#39;t make sense at all. The most important part of the Cranial Gateway&amp;#39;s infrastructure is the Central Cerebrum, which powers the entire dimemsion using hydrogen based, mechanical spheres called neurons. Below it, is the Central Portal itself, teleporting stuff to reality, fantasy, dreams, and even the virtual realms of Cyberspace.
