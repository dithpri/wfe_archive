A picturesque region west of the metropolis of Worcester, the region Wachu Land has all the attributes that bring nations in from near and near. Five Dunkin&#39;s, a plastics plant and a Pepsi bottler all attest to the economic vibrancy of the region. It boasts five public libraries (four after the Paxton town meeting), manicured lawns, and numerous ways to get lost in the woods. Holden will make sure that only thoroughly middle class people can call the place home, with strict zoning laws. It even has it&#39;s Mad Max outback region - Rutland!
