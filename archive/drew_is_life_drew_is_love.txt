Because... Drew

In a world ruled by AI, the real ruler is Drew.
He has created the world.
He has created its people.
He has set the parameters for their interactions.
He will not know where Nicaragua is.
He will mispronounce their names.

Timmy - for the Timurids
Martha - for the Marathi

All can be named after him:
Derusalem, Deruuu, Drew Hampshire, Xanadrew

Drew is love to every deep, dark fantasy.

Drew has brought thousands to NS.
Drew is life and love for NationStates.

Drew is Drew.

With artificial intelligence of course.
