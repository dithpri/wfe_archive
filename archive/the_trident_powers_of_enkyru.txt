[b]The Trident Powers are an group of nations from the geographical region of Enkyru, founded by [nation]Scytharum[/nation].  Nations of all shapes and sizes are allowed to join, and are welcomed.  Rules follow below:[/b][i]

[color=red]- Free speech is in complete exercise, you&#39;d have to say or post something ridiculously horrible(like a legitimate threat) to get your post deleted.[/color]
[color=green]- Don&#39;t double message in the chat.[/color]
[color=blue]- Respect other members of the region.  Their race, gender, disabilities, etc. that they cannot change are never grounds to slander, harass, or threaten someone.  In fact, don&#39;t do any of those things anyway.  Remember, what truly matters is the content of someone&#39;s character, not the color of their skin.[/color]
[color=gold]- Finally, make haste to endorse [nation]Scytharum[/nation].[/color][/i]
