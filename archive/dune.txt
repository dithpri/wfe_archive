Ah, Dune. Everyone wants a slice of that dry, sandy, worm-infested cake, but do they deserve it?
It is for this exact reason that our bravest crack squad of soldiers captured this infamously inhospitable yet incredibly valuable planet, as to shield its priceless reserves of spice from any unwanted plunderers. The planet&#39;s melange is safe in our hands. Any natives that deny this protection will be put in their place, and invading forces shall be dealt with in a swift and effective manner. If you want to help out with such spicy preemptive defences, you&#39;re always welcome to join our [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]Discord![/url]

To protect your slice of the spice, endorse the Delegate upon entry.[/color][hr]
