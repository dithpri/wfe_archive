Soon afterward, the last remnants of the Entente fell in their war of aggression against the free Syndicalist peoples of the world. Half a century later, as the revolution spread and Germany&#39;s allies were chipped away, fires arose from the heart of Europe. From the ashes came the global domination of Totalism, traditional Syndicalism, and Socialism.
