The United Imperial Territories (UIT) is a region of provinces banded together into one Empire, and by extension ruled by the central state of Imperial authority, the Unified Imperial States.

Each nation that joins the UIT becomes a province and is subject to it&amp;#39;s laws.

The Inquisition has authority to invoke emergency powers within each province on a vote by the Council, in which case martial law will be declared within that province.

There is a 13 seat Imperial Council for the most important provincial leaders (the 13th seat is reserved for the Emperor) as well as an Imperial Senate made up of all provincial leaders, headed by the World Assembly Delegate.
