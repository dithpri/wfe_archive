RidderDe is a continent made of a donut-shaped mainland with rigid peninsulas surrounding a medium-sized sea, as well as multiple large and small islands outside of the mainland. The climate of the region is normally temperate, though some of the more distant islands experience abnormal climates compared to others. The northern half of the mainland is largely mountainous, while the southern half is mostly made of flat plains and plateaus.

The Nations of the Continent of RidderDe are free to join the Regional Union, where topics important to the member Nations are discussed and resolved. The constitution of the RU is currently under construction.
