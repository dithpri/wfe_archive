How can you see into my eyes, like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I&#39;ve become so numb, without a soul
My spirit&#39;s sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up, wake me up inside I can&#39;t wake up,
Wake me up inside, save me,
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up
Bid my blood to run, I can&#39;t wake up
Before I come undone, save me
Save me from the nothing I&#39;ve become
