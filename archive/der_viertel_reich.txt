The Fourth Reich is the unofficial name given to us by the Americans after their discovery of our industrial complexes located under the ice in the gloriously isolated continent of Antarctica.

With over 90 active volcanoes, it should come as no surprise that hot springs  and similar geothermal voids and caverns would provide ample room for the continuation of our Secret Space Program.

With help from our alien friends, The Fourth Reich is and always has been 20-50 years ahead of the most Leading-edge technology that the surface dwellers have at hand.

Have you ever wondered why nobody can build, develop, or even visit Antarctica without a special permit? Because we won&#39;t allow it.
