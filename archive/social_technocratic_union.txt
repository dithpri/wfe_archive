The [color=#007aff][b]Social Technocratic Union[/b][/color] is a region dedicated to Technocracy in its many forms, and to the principles of responsible and qualified governance. 

We stand for government by those with the capacity to govern, for the benefit of mankind. 

We seek a world where rational thought and education drive every decision, a world of peace and plenty for all, and a world where every person may live their life on their own fully informed terms.
