The Transhuman Colonies have formed together to create a society for the future of humanity. Together, we will prepare ourselves to weather catastrophic threats of an existential nature to humanity itself. Our ultimate goal is to create a society that can colonize space itself. In order to do this, we face monumental challenges. We must redefine what it means to be human. Petty squabbles over individual whims cannot be tolerated. If we cannot work cohesively as a disciplined unit, we will become extinct. 

The Transhuman Colonies are now accepting applicants. Current stages include testing various models of governance and society to determine the best fit for surviving the worst conditions. Will you survive with us?
