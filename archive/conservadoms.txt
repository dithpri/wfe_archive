Here we come
Walkin&amp;#39; down the street
We get the funniest looks from
Every one we meet
Hey, hey, we&amp;#39;re the Domers
And people say we monkey around
But we&amp;#39;re too busy singing
To put anybody down

We&amp;#39;re just tryin&amp;#39; to be friendly,
Come and watch us sing and play
We&amp;#39;re the young Domeration
And we&amp;#39;ve got something to say

Any time, Or anywhere
Just look over your shoulder
Guess who&amp;#39;ll be standing there

Hey, hey, we&amp;#39;re the Domers
And people say we monkey around
But we&amp;#39;re too busy singing
To put anybody down

Hey, hey, we&amp;#39;re the Domers
And people say we monkey around.
But we&amp;#39;re too busy singing
To put anybody down.

Hey, hey, we&amp;#39;re the Domers!
Hey, hey, we&amp;#39;re the Domers!
