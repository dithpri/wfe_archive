The United Region of Tara is the ideal of Superpowers banding together under one banner, to Eliminate all that may harm them, and to build a Grand Nation Together.

Any nation who joins the United Tara Alliance will still retain it&amp;#39;s sovereignty and it&amp;#39;s independence, but will be considered apart of the whole; in times of Strife, War, and Greatness. 

The UTA is lead by a Council, with each National Leader being the representative on the Council, and the Council having a Grand Leader, to lead the Council.

We may be Small, but we will Grow in Time.
