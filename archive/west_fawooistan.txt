West Fawooistan is located on planet Fawoo in the Fawoo sector. The Fawoo sector and planet Fawoo were originally discovered by a team of explorers, Carlson Coombs, Temi Tayo Fayii, and Commander John Painap. The explorers set off many years ago searching for lands full of flavorful vegetables such as kohlrabi. When the planet of Fawoo appeared on the radar they had a feeling that this could be the next massive region. With Carlson Coombs at the head of the expedition the expedition was lead with a great risk-reward result. The Fawoo sector was full of empty land with a great future. This is when West Fawooistan was born. Luckily West Fawooistan came less than a light year before East Fawooistan, an enemy from the old world.
