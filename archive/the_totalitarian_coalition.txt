[b]TTC[/b] is a free-entry region and welcomes those who wish to join us. 

There is only one leader and founder of this region but the WA delegate status will change more democratic. No force endorsement.
We believe in strict order and deep totalitarianism system of our region, but preserving our high welfare and educational standards to our citizens.
