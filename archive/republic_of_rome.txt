The Republic of Rome.
 A Region torn apart by raids, war, and isolation.

This region is in dire need of activity and, for the most part, is inactive. Should you like to claim this Region as your own and attempt to turn it around, you are more than welcome to. Even if inactive, it does have a slight few people that hop on now and again, and due to it also is a nicer starting point than having no one at all.
