[color=purple][b]The Republic of Rome[/b][/color]

A Region torn apart by raids, war, and isolation... And yet begins to rise anew.

We&#39;re all glad to welcome back our Founder, [color=red]Roman Senator[/color].

With this, hopefully the Region will begin to regrow into something that prospers, rather than what it has become in his absence.

If you wish to join in on the reformation of an old Region, feel free to join and jump right in on our discussion of what direction the Region should take!

If you have any questions in regards to the Region, please message our Founder [nation]Roman Senator[/nation]
