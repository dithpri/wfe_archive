The International Alliance of Nations, known as IAN, is an intergovernmental military, economic and political alliance between various nations and smaller alliances. Although a new organization, the goals of IAN are to:

1) Establish economic, military and political cooperation between participating members.

2) Encourage and facilitate discussion between cooperative nations and alliances.

3) Provide support, both tangible (goods, aid) and intangible (intelligence, discourse) from one nation to another.

4) Create policy that can be adopted by the IAN and IAN-membership nations.

[Note that this is an RP region, we want to facilitate roleplaying of nations in this region. We also want to encourage cooperative and polite behavior between our members]
