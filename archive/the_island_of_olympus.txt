Just the Queendom of Emebear and her friends. This region is a large island in the middle of the ocean. It is isolated, leaving only the nations apart of it as company. The region is rich in crops and the overall environment is great. The overall crime rate is quite low, the economy is good, and the education is splendid. This region is everything a nation could want.
