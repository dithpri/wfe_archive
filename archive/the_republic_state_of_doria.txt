Geography consists of several mountain ranges, with large areas of both boreal and temperate forests. Large fields litter the country side, as well as farms and orchards.
Borders are enforced by each country in the region.
Xanandar has been in control for as long as most people can remember. Only a few number of senior citizens can remember the time when the now extinct Dorians were in control.
Any countries are welcome to join the region, but must follow the rules designed by the Central Xandarian government.
