Beautiful rolling hills, stretches of snow-capped mountains, and lush fertile plains accompany the better half of this region. The other half is a big desert and inhospitable salt ocean, both of which tend to kill careless individuals trying to settle the somewhat livable coastlines. We live timidly and cautiously in this mineral-rich Garden of Eden, surrounded by dangerous neighbors night and day. People here are nice, mostly, but competition is always a striving force in foreign relations.
