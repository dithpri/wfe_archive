If I should die, think only this of me:
      That there&#146;s some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever Breadland. There shall be
      In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom Breadland bore, shaped, made aware,
      Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam;
A body of Breadland&#146;s, breathing Breadlandian air,
      Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
      A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
            Gives somewhere back the thoughts by Breadland given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
      And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
            In hearts at peace, under a Breadlandian heaven.
