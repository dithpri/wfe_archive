The proud Imperial power of Llandovery on the fertile Von Haastian plains, the prosperous Confederacy of Like-Minded-People to the resource-rich west of Von Haastia, the dark and mysterious Jingoistic States of Yuhannistan in the eastern deserts, and the forbidding Kingdom of Daschberg, in the dark and damp forests of Von Haastia&amp;#39;s South.

Lady Liberty rides astride the modern, industrial, and politically mature nations of Llandovery and the CLMP, as they lead the way into the future, while the Iron-Fists of Dictatorship and Tyranny push Yuhannistan and Daschberg every forward into the unknown. Tyranny? Glory? The path is as yet unclear.

All glory to Von Haastia.
