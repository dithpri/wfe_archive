[i]A thought. A concept. A perpetual work in progress. A pool from which flows countless tributaries, each their own thoughts, each their own concepts; each countless and as varied as the stars which burn and glow high above, casting their gaze down upon the firmament in a wash of light and resplendence. May your thoughts flow free, may your concepts flourish. May your endeavors be just as free, just as flourishing, and and just as fruitful as those whom you stand beside and, in community, help flourish and bring fruitful their dreams.
