A lonely series of quiet survivalists and wanderers. The SE strives to protect its own, with little regard to anything going on outside of it. Scattered reports of undead, magic, and other similar tales are common, though few outside of the SE believe in such fantasies. Regardless, the Fallen persist despite the harsh realities of their homelands, and will continue to do so for many years.
