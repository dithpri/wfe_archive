The CCCS is a center-right to far-right coalition of states dedicated to pushing forward christian, conservative, capitalist, and libertarian policies to the WA and to member nations. The CCCS is happy to work with other regions on resolutions, and welcome anyone into our ranks, though holding the values of the region is strongly recommended. The CCCS intends to be a formal, well organized group of nations. The CCCS, though pro-WA, is dedicated to protecting national sovereignty, as well as dedicated to repealing the &quot;Reproductive Freedoms&quot; act, as the CCCS is pro-life. Also it is REQUIRED BY LAW that you endorse the WA Delegate [nation]Hatzisland[/nation]!
