Welcome to the Nations League Region.
We are a tiny community of independent nations, gathered in this region for the sole purpose of having fun. 
Please, if you decide to join this community, be reasonable, don&#39;t argue, don&#39;t insult, and finally try to be as realistic as possible.

Have fun!

P.S.
Please take a look at the map of our world and choose a territory that represents you on it. When you have decided, apply on the Regional Message Board. Thank you.
