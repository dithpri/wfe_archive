This unstable union of nations was conceived after a brief visit of Ethanovian delegates to Drak-&Euml;da, their prompt execution by dragon fire, twenty five years of war, and after a sudden realization of a lack of communication the war was stopped and an alliance was formed. The union is somehow still in force despite the vast differences between nations, and the only reason they do not erupt into brutal and everlasting war was a pinky promise between Supreme Ruler of Ethanovia Ethan Brown the 3rd and Bahamut himself.
