The West Continent, created and controlled by the Bridgian Union, is a glorious and beautiful land. It is located on the west side of Mundus Circularis, a planet unknown to most, made almost entirely of cubic blocks with side lengths of one meter. The West Continent is the center of power on Mundus Circularis, and will continue to be for a long time. Well, at least until one of the idiots on the East Continent finds a nuke.
