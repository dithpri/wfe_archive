This region was founded as a colony of [region]Espana[/region], but soon abandoned. It has now been refounded and reformed by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] to [b][color=red]prevent[/color][/b] possible [b]fascist[/b] takeover.

[b][color=00CCCC]Honolulu[/color][/b] is the capital of [b][color=990000]Hawaii[/color][/b] ([i]Hawai&amp;#39;i[/i]), one of the most beautiful archipelagos in the world and America&amp;#39;s 50th state. Lying on the island of Oahu, Honolulu and the surrounding cities are home to &amp;#39;Iolani Palace, home to the Hawaiian royal family until US fruit corporations deposed Queen Lili&amp;#39;uokalani in 1893, and the solemn naval memorial at Pearl Harbor. Not to mention quite a few fabulous beaches.

Feel free to stop by, but please do your best to respect the natural landscape and history, as well as the feelings of all.
