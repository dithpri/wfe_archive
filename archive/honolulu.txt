[i][color=FF9000]Aloha.[/color][/i]

[b][color=00CCCC]Honolulu[/color][/b] is the capital of [b][color=990000]Hawaii[/color][/b] ([i]Hawai&#39;i[/i]), one of the most beautiful archipelagos in the world and America&#39;s 50th state. Lying on the island of Oahu, Honolulu and the surrounding cities are home to &#39;Iolani Palace, home to the Hawaiian royal family until US fruit corporations deposed Queen Lili&#39;uokalani in 1893, and the solemn naval memorial at Pearl Harbor. Not to mention quite a few fabulous beaches.

Feel free to stop by, but please do your best to respect the natural landscape and history, as well as the feelings of all.
