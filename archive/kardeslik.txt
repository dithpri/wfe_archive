Welcome to the Great Island of Kardeslik. Surrounded by water filled with sharks that obey MY commands, this land is gaurded with the finest warriors in the Region. Protected with an invisible barrier that was placed by &amp;quot;The Ones Who Came Before&amp;quot;. In the center, is my nation, El Ahadi. There is four ways to come to my Region: Highway Macon (located at barriers), Airport Issac (located in El Ahad&amp;#39;s Capital City), Stronghold Express (underground supway), and the Malik Cruise (an indestructible ship). Everyone in my Nation is considered family, and family is my main focus. I will protect you no matter the cost. Though you must have a password to enter. Contact me for password and 90% of the time, I&amp;#39;ll accept your offer.

Sincerely, 

Mentor Celia
