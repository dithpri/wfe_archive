The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.

Fans of Robert Jordan&amp;#39;s epic fantasy series, The Wheel of Time, are invited to join the region and carve out their own little section of Randland. Since our original members have ceased to exist one by one, and NS has given us border control to prevent invaders from taking over, I&amp;#39;ve removed the password requirement. All fans are welcome!
