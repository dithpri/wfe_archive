Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
&#39;Cause nothing&#39;s as it seems
And spinning out of control
Didn&#39;t they tell us don&#39;t rush into things?
Didn&#39;t you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven&#39;t you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn&#39;t it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should&#39;ve slept with one eye open at night
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh, eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh, eh
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) in Wonderland
