[b]WELCOME TO THE CAPITAL CITY OF [REGION]NORTH KOREA[/region]![/b]

&amp;quot;[i]Pyongyang is a beautiful city, a gem of socialist classicism in Asia, there is no litter on the streets, and no homeless, the children run playing games and yelling, the elderly walk slowly enjoying the day and the working class bustle about their daily business. The air is clean and the city&amp;#39;s gardens are of a picturesque quality. Public; telephones, libraries, schools, hospitals, parks, sports arena&amp;#39;s and statues adorn the city. This is socialist paradise[/i]&amp;quot; - V Ming[HR]
