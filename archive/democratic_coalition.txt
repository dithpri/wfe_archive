The Democratic Coalition is a coalition of nations devoted to having free, fair and democratic elections. The Coalition accepts all who would like to join and smiles upon efforts to effect true equality in member nations. It prefers to settle problems with diplomacy, and welcomes debate. The Democratic Coalition does not desire to have a WA Delegate join, as it believes power corrupts.
