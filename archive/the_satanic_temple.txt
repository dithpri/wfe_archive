[color=red][b]Welcome to The Satanic Temple![/b][/color] Region currently under construction, more coming soon!

[u]Check out our [url=https://discord.gg/Jn86TPEXgD]Discord[/url] and RMB! [/u]

As with the real-world TST, our mission is as follows:

[i][list][*]Encourage Benevolence and Empathy 
[*]Reject Tyranical Authority
[*]Advocate for Practical Common Sense
[*]Oppose Injustice
[*]Undertake Noble Pursuits[/list][/i]

Please see the Seven Fundamental Tenants below for our core values and principles! 

[color=grey]While TST and our values are based on the real-life Satanic Temple, it should be noted that we are a non-affiliated, non-sectorial organization, and may draw inspiration from many denominations and sources.[/color]
