lmao imagine being such a pathetic group that the only regions you can invade are inactive ones.

I&#39;m unsure when our group will come back on NS but we&#39;ve been burned out due to most of our group not being interested in this.

If you&#39;re interested in joining us for some games our discord server is https://discord.gg/eubyHup

For those who&#39;ve watched our inactive group get invaded over this time: I appreciate that atleast some of the people we met in that time still have concern for our small region. As of reading this I&#39;ll discuss the possibility of getting our old and new members re-interested in this.
