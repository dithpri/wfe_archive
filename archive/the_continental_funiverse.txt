[b][i][u]Welcome the The Continental Funiverse![/u][/i][/b]
Founded by [nation=long_name]Funiverse[/nation]

We are a region of casual NationStates players who just look to have fun! Our goal is to expand and grow our regions power and generally participate in NationStates politics. We are also very welcoming to anyone who would like to join our region. All we ask though is that you are active and contribute to the region.

[i][color=blue]If you are here with intents of constructing an embassy we ask only a few things...
1) Your region has similar interests as our region.
2) [This was removed, need to make a new thing here]
3) You will work cooperatively to solve any problems between both regions.[/i][/color]
