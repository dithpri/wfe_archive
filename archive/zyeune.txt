[i][color=teal]Zyeune is a mystical planet in a transcendent parallel dimension&#151;a preternatural realm shaped by wandering celestials and ancient gods, whispered of in Earth&#146;s forgotten tales. It is the homeworld of immortal beings and diverse races&#151;elves, dwarves, orcs, dragons, humans, and more. Magic pulses through its vast forests, deep oceans, rugged mountains, and golden plains, resembling Earth&#146;s but with layers of enchantment. Civilizations rise and fall in cycles of prophecy, divine will, and arcane power. Its skies are watched by two distant moons, and its lands are marked by sacred groves, ancient strongholds, and thriving majestic cities. Zyeune stands as a bridge of dreams and reality, where time flows strangely and forgotten legends live on.[/color][/i]
