The Great Plains Nations are a coalition of like minded nations centered around The Reformed Great Plains Nation. The Northern Great Plains, The Southern Great Plains, The Great Western Plains, and The Eastern Wetlands all border the regions Capital of The Reformed Great Plains Nation. The nations are all independent of each other, with their own unique cultures and practices. However, as a pseudo-anarchist collective, they all are founded and operate on a set of basic requirements. Compulsory military service (which is treated more as a state funded opportunity to learn a trade) and complete social freedoms.
