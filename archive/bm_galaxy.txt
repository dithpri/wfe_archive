The Milky Way Galaxy in the year 2180 is heavily divided between the three powerhouse factions in the region, the UFSS (Unified Federation of Sovereign Systems), ECC (Earth Colonies Coalition), and the Rashaani Alliance. Large scale trade groups have also taken up in the region leading to massive regulated trade between the usually hostile nations. Territorial police efforts have made most centralized areas safe from pirate attacks, however beyond these boundaries and outside of shipping lanes criminal enterprises thrive.
