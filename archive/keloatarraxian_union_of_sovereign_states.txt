[b]KeloAtarraxian Union of Sovereign States[/b]

The [b]KeloAtarraxian Union of Sovereign States (KAUoSS)[/b] is a political and economic union of 6 member states. 

The KAU and KeloAtarraixan citizenship were established when the KAUoSS Citizenship Treaty came into force in 2020. The original members of what came to be known as the KeloAtarraxian Union were the Inner Six: Aixarata, Atarraxia, Dahstovia, Dhaaros, Kelos, and Qedestan. The KeloAtarraxian Union of Sovereign States can grow in size by the creation of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit.
