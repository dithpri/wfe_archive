This contains the three Mercury Superpowers, Olivschlovakia, Wakland, and Hallowbirthmasland. They each have 30% of land respectively. Olivschlovakia has the West, Wakland has the North, and Hallowbirthmasland has the East. The Fourth Region is Dulaes, named after the Ambassador of the Intergalactic Darylian Empire who proposed the idea of this previously empty and disputed territory.
UPDATE: The Borderlands of Hallowbirthmasland have agreed to give up one-sixth of their land, which they have done nothing with, to a new nation (which were actually anarcho-communist rebels), The People&#39;s Republic of Chevustak. Hallowbirthmasland still has %25 of the land on Mercury, and Chevustak has %5, and it&#39;s at the area bordering Dulaes.
