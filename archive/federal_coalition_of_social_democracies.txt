Federal Coalition of Social Democracies believes in the achievement of socialism via democratic reform rather than violent revolutions in situations where it is possible. 

The Federal Coalition of Social Democracies will fully support regions that have similar values to it&amp;#39;s own (such as Communism, Syndicalism, in some cases Anarchism).

The Federal Coalition of Social Democracies shall remain opposed to ideologies that go against basic human rights and freedoms, internationalism/cosmopolitanism, and public ownership (such as Nationalism, Fascism, and any forms of Capitalism)
