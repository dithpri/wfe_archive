The year is 1989. The War Of New - Amordeus has begun. The dictator king of Amordeus 1989 was outrageous that people stood against him, so in 1993 he dropped a bomb on Grenada. But instead of being weak, the people against him broke down his villa in Guarda, Jalesan. His name was Rex Malus. After the king died, his nephew took over the throne. His name was Julian The Kind, and his carreer as a king started in 1994, and in 1996 his nephew, the grandson of Rex Malus became king. Now Amordeus has a new king, Arthur The Kind is his name. Now there are three wars passed, and there is peace in entire Sarenara.
