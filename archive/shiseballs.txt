[b]Welcome to [region]Shiseballs[/region]![/b]
[i]A governorless region where no one takes anything seriously. It&#39;s just a little silly place![/i]

[color=008000]Our beautiful map is brought to you by [nation]Bollocksville[/nation] and contributors [nation]Ubrainia[/nation], [nation]Churchs[/nation], and [nation]Natzinville[/nation]![/color]

[color=008000][nation]Za Za[/nation] is, some time in the near future, going to work on a new banner and flag for the region and is taking any and all ideas through the form of direct telegram.[/color]

Watch out for raids, or don&#39;t. We might actually be a large region again.
