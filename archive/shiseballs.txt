[b]Welcome to [region]Shiseballs[/region]![/b]
[i]A governorless region where no one takes anything seriously. It&#39;s just a little silly place![/i]

[nation]Bollocksville[/nation] is currently working on the new map, make sure to vote in the poll if you want in.

[nation]Za Za[/nation] is, some time in the near future, going to work on a new banner and flag for the region and is taking any and all ideas through the form of direct telegram.

Watch out for raids, or don&#39;t. We might actually be a large region again.

[b]NO SWISS FLAGS EXCEPT UBRAINIA![/b]

[i]And remember, all is fair in love and war. (besides killing kittens. That&#39;s very bad!) (Are puppies okay?)[/i]
