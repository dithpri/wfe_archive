Welcome to [b][color=darkblue]The United States[/color][/b]! TUS was refounded after spending a long period under a raider founder in 2010. The region steadily rose, but fell apart in 2011 when the delegate ejected most of the region in a period of inactivity virtually killing the region.

[color=darkred]The United States is now attempting to rebuild to its former glory during this July 4 season.[/color]

[i][color=darkblue]We are sympathetic to the victims of unprovoked raids everywhere, each region should be able to maintain a quiet peace if it wishes.[/i][/color]

Founded: [color=darkred]February 5, 2010[/color]
Peak: [color=darkred]184 nations in January 2011[/color]
