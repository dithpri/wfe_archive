[color=darkblue][b]Welcome to The United States![/b][/color] We are in the process of moving from The States! 

[color=darkred]The United States, as a region, heavily supports [b]freedom[/b] for all players and the [b]tolerance and acceptance[/b] of all views. Further, we strongly encourage a [b]democratic viewpoint[/b] to all.[/color]

[i]The United States also sympathetic to the victims of unprovoked raids everywhere, each region should be able to maintain a quiet peace if it wishes.[/i] 

[color=red][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color] Our region is moving back to our home. Due to our new non-executive founder status, higher security is needed for the first few months. Until the delegate has more endorsements, a password is in place.

All WAs [u]must[/u] endorse [nation=short]Topid[/nation] until the region has more influence and endorsements for security!
