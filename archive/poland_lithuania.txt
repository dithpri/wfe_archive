It was established at the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the actual personal union between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania began when Lithuania&#39;s Grand Duke Jogaila became the king of Poland (1386).

In NationStates, Poland Lithuania was first established in 2013 and refounded in 2017.
