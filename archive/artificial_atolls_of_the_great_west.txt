A collection of artificial atolls on the waters of the Pacific where society is organized around numerous arcologies built upon each island. Ryouen was the first island to become a unified state after the owner of the Ryouen Arcology successfully bought all other arcologies on his island. These societies are generally economically libertarian corporatocracies where the social and political institutions are only limited by the arcologies&#39; leaderships (more often than not their private owners) desires and propaganda fund allocation. As a result, many have legalized drug use and slavery, with cults of personality becoming a common tool of propaganda and power acquisition.
