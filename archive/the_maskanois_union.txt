The Maskanois  Union is a union or region built up of the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas and Arkansas. We gained freedom and independence in the Midwestern war that lasted for three years after Russia invaded America and took over the government undermining the democracy. The midwest would not accept this tyranny and fought back. After 6.8 million lives war lost on both sides, Russia surrendered giving us freedom.
