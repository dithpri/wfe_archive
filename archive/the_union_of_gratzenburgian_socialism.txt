The Union of Gratzenburgian Socialism, the UGS, is a collection of socialist and communist nations that work together to prosper. All nations in the UGS are entirely dedicated to the spreading and protection of socialism. Stalinism and Marxism are also welcome in the great UGS. Countries must show an increased understanding of socialism for entry into the UGS.
