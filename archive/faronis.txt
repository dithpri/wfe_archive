Welcome to the region of Faronis!

With the Hambonian empire now in power, we demand that faronis cannont remain idle like this. No longer! We must become aggressive, and induct lesser regions into our ranks! Only then will our goal of growing be accomplished! And any who oppose will not be given a second chance.

(Espionage is punishible by death! Or five minutes in the sad box).
