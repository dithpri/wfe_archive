Due to extreme amounts of industrialization, this area is considered hazardous to the health of it&#39;s inhabitants. Or at least that&#39;s what is said by the heathens. This region is under the benevolent control of the Grand Duchy of Knessniet. We are a godly people, and are very much inclined to building as many factories as we possibly can. God told us to be fruitful, and our Dole MegaFactory produces up to 200,000 tons of canned fruit monthly!

The Wastes are ruled over by Knessniet, but the other nations have their say in matters. Any member is welcome to voice their opinion, as long as it doesn&#39;t involve blasphemy or environmental advocacy.
