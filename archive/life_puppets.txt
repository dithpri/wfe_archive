Bibeddibobbedibuuuu and we bring the party to you! No need to leave your bed because we will come by and invite ourselves to your region whether you&acute;re sleeping or not. 

And now for something completely different (it&acute;s poetry, like it always is):

It&acute;s late at night
I&acute;m sleep-deprived
So are you
We know it&acute;s true
Now drink some water,
It&#39;s time to party
Take a smartie
Thats it, farewell
Remember to hydrate,
Until next time, pal
