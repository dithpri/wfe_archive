[b]Rendanna[/b] is a broad temperate continent of rolling plains, deep forests, and long, navigable rivers that bind its regions together. Mild seasons and steady rainfall make its valleys fertile, while cool highlands and misty coasts foster diverse cultures shaped by trade and travel. Neither harsh nor gentle, Rendanna is a land of balance, where nature&#146;s abundance invites settlement but still demands respect.
