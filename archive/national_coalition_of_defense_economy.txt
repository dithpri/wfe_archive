Greetings from the NatCoDE! The NatCoDE (National Coalition of Defense and Economy) is a mutual defense and economic alliance with focus on member economic prosperity, member political stability, and ultimately the defense of member nation sovereignty! We are active in the RP community, host a private forum, and provide leadership positions to members within the alliance.

The NatCoDE operates via NatCoDE embassies defended by Evan Militia Cells providing economic, political, and defensive assistance to member nations. The NatCoDE&#39;s Evan Militia Cells are managed by a Department of Military Supreme General who directs NatCoDE assets and works to form positive ties with member nation leadership.
