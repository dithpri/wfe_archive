From the island of pirates one found a map,
With dreams of gold as all pirates have.
He sets sail as joyful as a pirate can be,
When a pirate is hunting for treasure out at sea.
He sets the sail and his ship does sway,
Destination: where the red cap Italian does play.
What&#39;s the name of the plumber&#39;s watery fray,
Where seven stars are hid and eels like to stay?
