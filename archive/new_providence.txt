New Providence is the most populous island in the Bahamas, containing more than 70% of the total population. It also houses the national capital city, [region]Nassau[/region]. The island was originally under Spanish control following Christopher Columbus&amp;#39;s discovery of the New World, but the Spanish government showed little interest in developing the island[hr]
&amp;quot;[i]The pirates ran their affairs using what was called the Pirate code, which was the basis of their claim that their rule of New Providence constituted a kind of &amp;#39;republic&amp;#39;. According to the code, the pirates ran their ships democratically, sharing plunder equally and selecting and deposing their captains by popular vote.[/i]&amp;quot;
