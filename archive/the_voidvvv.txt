The Void engulfs all light and soul outside of The vvv (pronounced The Evvevvevv), a collection of land masses surrounding The vvv sea, which is dammed off from falling into The Void by nine internationally founded dams. On the West lays the ancient continent, but the further West you go on, the stronger the static gets. The whole continent was covered in The Roman Empire, whose neo-liberal policies (and the falling of its capital city into The Void) lead to its collapse in the hands of the anarchist states of The Allied Statedom and The Seamen Stain, and the Balkanization of the Central Continent, the most fertile region in The vvv.
