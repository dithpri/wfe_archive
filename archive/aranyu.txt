South of the M&uuml;rakhan and east of Belahar lies a vast and vibrant land where the river valleys and scorching deserts give way to lush and humming rainforests, vast plains, and vibrant coasts. In this ancient, civilized land, shrouded in history and legend, a thousand cities flourish along the rivers that run through it like veins, while a thousand peoples vie for dominance over trade and territory. This is the land of Aranyu.

The subcontinent was once ruled by the Aranyese Heavenly State, the domain of a priestly order supported by an enormous legalist bureaucracy in the service of the Masraneist God. Yet this great holy empire collapsed during the global cataclysm known as the Fall, its ashes leaving fertile ground for new nations to rise.
