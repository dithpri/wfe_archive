South of the M&aacute;rakh&uuml;n and east of B&eacute;lahar, there lies a vast and vibrant land where the river valleys and scorching deserts give way to lush and humming rainforests, great plains, and wild mountains. This is the land of Ar&aacute;nyu.

Historically, the subcontinent was once ruled by the Ar&aacute;nyese Heavenly State, ruled by a caste of priests supported by an enormous legalist bureaucracy in the service of the Masr&aacute;neist God. The Heavenly State collapsed during the global century of upheaval known as the Fall. In its wake, new nations came alive.
