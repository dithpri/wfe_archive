South of the M&aacute;rakh&uuml;n and east of B&eacute;lahar, there lies a vast and vibrant land where the river valleys and scorching deserts give way to lush and humming rainforests, great plains, and wild mountains. In this ancient land shrouded in history and legend, a thousand cities flourish along the rivers that run through it like veins, while a thousand peoples vie for dominance over trade and treasure. This is the land of Ar&aacute;ny&amp;#363;.

The subcontinent was once ruled by the Ara&amp;#328;ese Heavenly State, ruled by a caste of priests supported by an enormous legalist bureaucracy in the service of the Masr&aacute;neist God. The Heavenly State collapsed during the global century of upheaval known as the Fall. In its wake, new peoples and states have risen from the ashes.
