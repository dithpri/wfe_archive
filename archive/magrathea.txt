This is a recorded announcement, as I&amp;#39;m afraid we&amp;#39;re all out at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit but regrets, that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. Thank you. If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone.

Previously, we had been in hibernation for millions of years but we are now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Irken Empire.  If you thought our fjords in Norway were nice, you should see our parking structure planet.
