Blue Water Roads is a region home to all sorts of nations, from isolationist to internationalist and liberal to authoritarian. We have frequent giveaways, lax rules, and niche groups for discussing specific interests. Elections are held the 12th of every month. More information about the region can be found in the dispatch below, if you have further questions, feel free to reach out to the reponse officer for a quick reply.
