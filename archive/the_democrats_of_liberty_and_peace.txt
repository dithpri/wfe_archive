[b]1:[/b] You [b]MUST[/b] use the &amp;quot;[i]Issues[/i]&amp;quot; feature.
[b]Why?:[/b] It prevent users from running the nation using &amp;quot;[i]factbooks[/i]&amp;quot; alone. They&amp;#39;re permitted and encouraged but as an additional feature. Factbooks aren&amp;#39;t always factual, as [b]MAX BARRY[/b] states, factbooks &amp;quot;are collections of &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; about themselves. I put &amp;quot;facts&amp;quot; in quotation marks because obviously [b]they will be full of [i][u]lies[/u][/i] and [i][u]distortions[/u][/i][/b]&amp;quot;.

[b]2:[/b] In the nations &amp;quot;Trend&amp;quot; section, your civil rights [b]AND[/b] political freedoms must be in the top half of the graph. If you fall below, you&amp;#39;ll be warned that you have [b]1 week[/b] to fix it or you&amp;#39;&amp;#39;ll be kicked from the region.
