Despite the name, Hairiestand is infact the leading nation of the Calentian River Delta.
The region is divided, so far, into 3 regions, the obviously named Hairiestand, North Calentian River Delta, and South Calentian River Delta. Most, if not all nations in the delta constantly fight over resources, such as the rich Plutonium and Magnesium deposits in the South Calentian River Delta.
Corruption is common, cased by the political instability, oil-fueled debauchery in the Gulf of Calental, and the arbitrary border divisions left by settlers that have left long ago, reaping the benefits of the lands, and enslaving local populations.
