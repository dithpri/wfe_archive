The Coalition of Haven has sought to forge heaven upon Earth; that the potter hath the power, but not the right, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor. Herein recognizing that lump of Earth and that lump of Heaven are now irrelevant under the potter, we beacon the region of hope.

Haven amast shall not quake; members, trail the habit of the disease: to help, or at least, to do no harm. 

Blessings,

The Republic of Rubyna.

Pillars of the Haven stand:

Hefera is the Marshall in Might.

Jayport is the Rhetorican Diplomat.

Anfarctica is Economic Contrapart.

The Coalition of Haven is headquartered in Andalusia, Republic of Rubyna.
