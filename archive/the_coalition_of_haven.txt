And did those feet in ancient time,
Walk upon Hefera&#146;s mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God,
On Jayport&#146;s pleasant pastures seen?
And did the countenance divine,
Shine forth upon Rubyna&#146;s hills?
And was Antfartica builded here?
Among these dark, satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold!
Bring me my arrows of desire!
Bring me my spear, oh clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire!
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Til we have built Jerusalem!
In Haven&#146;s green and pleasant land.
