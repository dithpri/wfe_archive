The Socialist Federation is guided in its activities by the Juche idea. The Juche idea means, in a nutshell, that the masters of the revolution and construction are the masses of the people and that they are also the motive force of the revolution and construction.
The Governments of The Socialist Federation steadfastly maintains Juche in all realms of the revolution and construction.
Establishing Juche means adopting the attitude of a master towards the revolution and construction of one&#39;s country. It means maintaining an independent and creative standpoint in finding solutions to the problems which arise in the revolution and construction.
