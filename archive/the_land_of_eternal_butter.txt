Now, I know that the name itself may cause you to simply set this region aside. However, I assure you, the Land of Eternal Butter is much more than the name implies. Take in the large, panoramic views from the mountains. Or, if you have great fears of such heights, then perhaps you will enjoy the great valleys below, where the grass is greener on our side.(and more luscious) If neither of those options intrest you, well, lucky for us, our region is very close to the shore of the Buttery Sea. The butter-colored sand, the nice, warm waters, the beautiful sunsets, the peaceful crashing of the waves...I&amp;#39;m not saying that this region is perfect for everyone,--it most likely isnt-- but it is certainly a sight to behold.
