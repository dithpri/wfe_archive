Tungvar Tract &#150; Home to the nation-state of Dheghomyewodr, Tungvar Tract is a region of strikingly varied terrain, dominated by rugged mountains with steep valleys and ridges that channel winds and rainfall. Fertile plains stretch across its central lowlands, nourished by rivers descending from the mountains, supporting agriculture and settlement. A smaller, more tropical forested area occupies a sheltered, humid zone, benefiting from consistent rainfall and protection from harsh northern winds. The interplay of mountains, plains, and forested lowlands creates a landscape where land, sea, and sky converge, forming a dramatic and diverse region under careful oversight.
