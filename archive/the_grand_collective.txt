Welcome, to The Grand Collective! A region dedicated to socalism and democracy but is still open to anyone willing to share their ideals. Roleplay is pretty simple, just be in character when typing in the regional message board but if you want to be out of character just type &#147;OOC:&#148; before your message.

Example:

&#147;We declare that Violetism is our new religion

OOC: how do I edit my factbook&#148;

And that&#146;s about all you need to know, so just kick back and relax in this wonderful region of ours.
