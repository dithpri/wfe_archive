&amp;gt;Greater Syria is a historical region located east of the Mediterranean Sea in West Asia, broadly synonymous with the Levant.

&amp;gt;Syrian nationalism advocates a &quot;Greater Syria&quot;, based on ancient concepts of the boundaries of the region then known as &quot;Syria&quot; (stretching from southern Turkey through Lebanon, Palestine into Jordan), but also including Cyprus, Iraq, Kuwait, the Ahvaz region of Iran, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Cilicia region of Turkey. It is a generally secular movement. The idea of a Greater Syria is not inherently political; it bases itself on culture, seeing that people from the region share many traditions.
