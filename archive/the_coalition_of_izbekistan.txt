The Coalition of Izbekistan is a region based in Central Europe. This coalition offers to bring solidarity between its nations and strive for a united world and peaceful resolutions to conflict. We try to have at least two weekly discussions between our nations to have a better understanding of situations for nations either independently or of two nations, also striving for more eco-friendly and political free nations with the economy only being our attention when it comes to serious conditions that are unfit for a nation to provide for its people.
