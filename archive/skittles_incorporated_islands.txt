I HAVE to have a World Factbook Entry? Really? Well then. This is the world factbook for the region better known as the Skittles Incorporated Islands. You might be asking yourself, &quot;Skittles, Skittles? Why does that region have the name of a candy in its name?&quot; For one, no I&#39;m not being paid to put that there, it&#39;s just that when I was naming it I bounced some names around with a friend and this is the name that stuck. So, if you&#39;ve somehow found this region (unless you&#39;re reading this from inside the region) then hello, how&#39;s your day? This region doesn&#39;t really identify with any political ideology, or theme, or anything really, just some people who wanted to found their own region, with ELECTRIC TRAINS and CAPITALISM and SKITTLES!
