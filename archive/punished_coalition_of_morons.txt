welcome to the [b]OFFICIAL[/b] region of the war on chickens. If you don&#39;t like em this is the place for you.

we encourage you to join our [url=https://discord.gg/hV4nkyQ]discord[/url] if you have not yet, so that you may help further the development of this beautiful, bountiful land. Issues being discussed now include:
-the adoption of a universal currency
-the regional anthem
-our potential role on the world stage
-the necessity of chickens in the first place
