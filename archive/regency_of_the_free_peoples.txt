&amp;quot;Unite the Free Nations, Liberate the People&amp;quot;

The Regency of the Free Peoples is a regional government which aligns a group of nations focused on civil liberties. It holds democratic elections for its political seats. There is an off-site forum which contains more information, including  the Constitution. 

*Note* As a new province, we are looking for more nations to join and take leadership roles.
