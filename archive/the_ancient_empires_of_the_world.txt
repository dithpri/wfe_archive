[b]Apologies to the nations whom were banjected in the simulation exercise.[/b]

Nations, I&amp;#39;m sorry for the trouble that I&amp;#39;ve caused. I have restored things back to order as much as possible. Everything&amp;#39;s pretty much back to normal, except the 4-5 banjected nations(don&amp;#39;t worry, ban-list totally cleared) and the 2 embassy requests I rejected. Other than that, things are fine.

What I&amp;#39;ve just demonstrated is a possible scenario in the hands of a rogue delegate. The defenses of this region are too low, and the nations, too naive AND inactive.

[b]THIS IS JUST A SIMULATED EXERCISE.[/b]

I will be leaving this game from today onwards - I will not be playing anymore. But I do wish you all the best of luck :)
