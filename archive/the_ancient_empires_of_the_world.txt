Some of you may have heard rumors that I am King [nation=short]Nephmir[/nation] of [region]The Eternal Knights[/region]. This is true. 
I am disgusted by the likes of this game; quite honestly, the lows that people sink to here are shameful and disgusting. None of you are worth my time or effort.
I will no longer be operating this region, or any other. If [region]The Eternal Knights[/region] fail, then I will leave permanently, and will not return this time. 
Thank you, and please do not disturb the peace of this isolated puppet storage. I wish to keep it open for all to use.
