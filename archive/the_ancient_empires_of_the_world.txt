[b]The Ancient Empires...political strife, war, peace; a story of both perseverance and loss.[/b]

I have moved on! My new region is [region]The Eternal Knights[/region], under my new identity [nation=short]Nephmir[/nation]. This region now stands as a memorial to a once proud but struggling Defender group. It fell on the 120th day of it&amp;#39;s existence.

Special thanks to [nation=short]Levethian[/nation] for keeping the memory alive.
