The Celestial Confederation was established by The Pleiades Federation in 2050. The Confederation headquarters is located in the city of New Eden of planet Centaurus (Pleione III). The Celestial Confederation was established to hold together a diplomatic bond between all the human colonies and civilizations spread through the universe. We have a modified government in the case we join the rest of the &#147;world&#148; and join the &#147;General Assembly&#148; and the &#147;Security Council&#148;. 
 This &#147;region&#148; is a roleplaying region. Everyone who join has started their government on a different planet. You are the person in charge of your ideal country.
