[color=#013BA6][b]The League of Defensive Regions (TLDR)[/b] is a interregional political union of small-medium sized regions with the aim of expanding their presence and influence in the World Assembly in unity while consolidating a greater cooperation among other fellow Members in one common focus and unity. The League hopes to speak for the people where they would otherwise be unheard and come together for peace and global cooperation and unity.[/color]
