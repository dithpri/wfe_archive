[color=purple][B]Welcome to the Hegemony of Man[/B][/color]
[i]founded May 2012[/i]

[hr]The Hegemony of Man is a multilateral coalition of various nations located in the same cluster of islands. This cluster, similar in size and shape to Earth&amp;#39;s Oceania, is home to a wide variety of ecosystems. Besides their geographical position, the only thing the nations have in common is the official language, French. Every member nation is allowed to rule as they see fit, keeping their own customs, laws and values. However, the members meet frequently to discuss trade and military issues between them and with other regions.
