These fallen shards of primal matter have fractured into their original composites: Radiant and Dire. In its pure form, each type of stone gives off a peculiar energy. For those who settle around the sites, they begin to feed on this unearthly power until they have not only harnessed the energy but made themselves dependent on it. They have built shrines around the Ancients and revered them, ironically, as godlike entities that have fallen to earth.

Around the Radiant, the effects are bright and colorful, evoking lightness and charm.
