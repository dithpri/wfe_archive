[b]Welcome to the sacrosanct lands of The Radiant, home to the governors and disciples of D&aacute;xlam.[/b]

[b][i]Seven Pillars of D&aacute;xlam[/b][/i]
If my neighbor is starving, I am impoverished.
Keep the land forever green, the oceans forever blue.
Welcome those unknown with love and teach them D&aacute;xlam.
Do not gamble with your possessions.
It is a sin not to help those in need and it is a sin to help those who will not help themselves.
Forgive your errs and use them to find truth.
Accept Dux Bradford John as your spiritual father.
