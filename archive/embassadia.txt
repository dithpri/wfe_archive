Embassadia is a place where nations from all regions can come to freely speak what&#39;s on their mind with no interference. Got multiple regions you want to communicate with? Not a problem! Just ask them to build their embassies here and you can chat on one forum, no hassle and no inconvenience. If you have any questions feel free to message [nation]Botschaft von[/nation] or anyone with a regional title. FYI, A minimum of 70 nations is required to be recognized by Embassadia and the approval of an Embassy. Before joining read our Constitution and join the forums which can be found below.
