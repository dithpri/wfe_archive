This is Glitnir, a haven for freedom. This region is devoted to voluntaryism, the furthering of individual freedoms, the abolition of serfs and masters. 
The region is a private property of my own. I welcome everyone, but I will inhesitantly argue with those who protest the nature of the region or the complete freedom of the individual. I hold these truths to be self-evident.
