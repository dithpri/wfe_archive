[color=red][i][b]Welcome to Hysteria![/b][/i][/color]

Hysteria was founded with a multitude of goals in mind, but they all come together to form one collective: to be a socially progressive, creative, and pleasant region, with opportunities for involvement and fun available to everyone. We&amp;#39;re just a group of friends who&amp;#39;ve been playing NationStates for a somewhat small amount of time, but we&amp;#39;re already very invested in the community and would love to make one of our own here on the site.

We warmly invite you to join us!
