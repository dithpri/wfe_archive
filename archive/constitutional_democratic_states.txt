[b]Earlier this week, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] discovered some intel regarding some prison escapees that had managed to have been spotted in [i]your[/i] region! Armed with such info, we surrounded your region and stormed into the headquarters, only to find that the evildoers had fled and moved to another region. Despite this, we managed to share a laugh about Youtube chat failing to play a game and some bloody good singing.[/b]

We here in The Black Hawks are always looking for assistance in finding criminals so if you&#39;d like to help us (or just talk about vtubers), [url=https://discord.gg/YudSM5B8]come join us![/url]
