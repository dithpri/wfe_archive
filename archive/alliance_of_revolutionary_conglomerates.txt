Founded as region where anyone can practice government as they wish, we now dedicate ourselves to maintaining regional sovereignty and ousting the influence of the WA.

-No posts shall be suppressed for any reason, unless it&amp;#39;s insanely inappropriate and violates PG-13 or any other rule that risks our region being shut down.

-No WA Delegate shall be elected, and those who attempt to endorse someone as a WA delegate will be promptly ejected.

-Upon entering this region all WA law is hereby null and void, and any attempt to enforce WA law against member states will result in ejection.
