The Promised Land is the claimed territory of the Holy Empire of the Sovereign People of God. Those who wish to enter the Promised Land must pledge unconditional allegiance and loyalty to God Most High and His Appointed One the Emperor. Those who do not abide by God&#39;s Will shall suffer His Wrath.
