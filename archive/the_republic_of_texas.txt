The Republic of Texas is dedicated all those kindred souls who not only believe in a free and sovereign Texas, but also believe in a Texas free of the poisonous effects of the modern world. To my brothers and cousins, both in blood and spirit, we live in increasingly dark times and I have some ideas how we can escape and keep from falling into another one pit of despair. I will post one or two dispatches per week as time permits that elaborates on these ideas, which are subject to change. Commentary is welcome and encouraged, whether via RMB or telegram, be it criticism or praise.
