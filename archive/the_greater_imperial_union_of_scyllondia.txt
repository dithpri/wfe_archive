The Greater Imperial Union is a medieval role play region dedicated to Scyllondia and her allies. Together we will found a new order.

All citizens should know of our code of laws, most importantly Act I of Part 1 Section 1. First, all members of this region must join the WA, or are considered to be unpersons. Second, on all issues on the WA, a poll will be posted. All people in the WA within the nation must vote according to what won the poll. Possible offenses include being put on the watch list, or being evicted.

Additionally, all member nations must incorporate elements of our regional flag, so as to represent our region as a tight nit, proud force in nation states.
