The story so far: 5 years ago, Emperor Erwin Reiker ruled verdant arcadia with an iron fist. The lord of Bresimar, Dekkard Holt, mounted a rebellion against Emperor Reiker. After a relatively short war, The Emperor was overthrown, and Dekkard Holt was placed in the throne. Concordia, the old capital, was too badly scarred to remain the capital, so it was abandoned, and Bresimar was made into the capital. Dekkard made his biggest supporters during the war into his wardens.
