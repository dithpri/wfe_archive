Five years ago, Emperor Erwin Reiker ruled verdant arcadia with an iron fist. The lord of Bresimar, Dekkard Holt, and all the other provinces mounted a rebellion against Emperor Reiker with his companions, the loyal Xavier von Maximus III, the cunning Antonio Raven-Feather, the peace-loving , and the blood-thirsty F&amp;#341;osk&iuml;er Rogan. Reiker was overthrown and Bresimar became the capitol with Dekkard Holt as monarch and his companions as his governors, his &#147;Wardens&#148;. However this is only the beginning.
The monarchy is currently run by Emperor Antonio Raven-Feather and his steward Artaxias Mithridates Machares.
