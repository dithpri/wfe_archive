The Confederation of Sovereign Nations was not always a unified entity. In fact, it was formed out of a long and complicated process of negotiation and diplomacy between several independent states.

After many months of negotiation, a compromise was reached. The Confederation of Sovereign Nations would be a decentralized entity, with power divided among the member states and a central government. Decisions would be made through consensus and cooperation, with each state retaining a degree of autonomy while working towards shared goals and objectives.
