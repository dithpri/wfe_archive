[b][i][u]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/u][/i][/b]

Just another CTE&#39;d &quot;museum&quot; which has been seized from [region]Antifa[/region]. They love to gloat about their museums and captured regions, but when they fail to maintain them, they become [i]my[/i] gloating material. This region will become a territory/occupied region of [region]J o J[/region].

[hr]Property of [region]J o J[/region][hr]Another one bites the dust as part of the [b]ANTI[color=red]FA[/color] Museum Seizure[/b].[hr][url=http://udl.taijitu.org/wfe_index/?nazi_dictatorships]Previous WFE, courtesy of WFE Index[/url]. Poor KPA couldn&#39;t maintain their promise to hold this region forever after. No surprise there.[hr]
