A region focused on doing all the thinking for the citizens. Dictatorships centralized on the working class and are not slave governments controlled by corporations.

No corporations, money or profit based governments, and no state religions.

There are no petty democracies clouding decisions. There shall be meetings among the dictators if decisions must be made. For example if the invasion of another region is discussed and a nation does not agree with a decision they may choose to simply not invade.

Any questions ask, only a select few are eligible to join so message me for the password.

Heil to Progress,
Dictator of Graysland
