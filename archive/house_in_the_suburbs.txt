A house in the suburbs, typical in every way, except that it&amp;#39;s the home of [b]Larson Johnson[/b], leader of [b][nation=short]Larson Land[/nation][/b].

Called &amp;quot;L.J. Savage&amp;quot; in his neighborhood, Larson Johnson is a &amp;quot;steroid pumping, papoose loving, dope dealing mutha f-ing G who kicks azz for a living.&amp;quot; He can do everything - &amp;quot;fight, deal, hustle, spit and get the b-ches.&amp;quot; One b-ch in particular, Lisa Larson, leader of [nation=short]LisaLarsonLand[/nation], who loves him so much that she has opened her home, taken his name and sworn to him her complete devotion.

Make no mistake. Though [nation=short]LisaLarsonLand[/nation] is listed as the founder, [nation=short]Larson Land[/nation] is the master of this house. This region and everything in it belongs to Master Larson, and the founder exists to serve her Master&amp;#39;s whims.
