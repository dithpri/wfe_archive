This region lives and breathes rugby. The people learn from an early age, and train hard if their nation has compulsory army recruitment. The nation with the best health is rewarded with the M&amp;#39;core Cup. This shall be rewarded every ten days.
The nation with the best economy, civil rights and parliamentary freedoms will be rewarded the Whareti Shield, rewarded every 3 days.
Politics is also a big part of our culture, we being in the world assembly with the elite.
