Hail, welcome to the fledgling region known as [region]The Collective of the Phoenix[/region] We are a proud region of nations who believe in the power of leadership and control by government. We strive to diplomatically reduce the strictness of the rules made by the World Assembly in the honor of sovereignty. There is strength in leadership, and honor in the collective.
