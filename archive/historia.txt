Starting in the Stone Age, and going past the Space age and beyond. This is history. History at it&amp;#39;s finest. Lead your nation through times of peace, war, and everything in between. Conduct diplomacy with other nations, or wage war with your enemies. Using earth&amp;#39;s locations, build up mighty cities for your nation, or destroy others. 

It&amp;#39;s up to you..

FORM history.
MAKE history.
EMBRACE history.
