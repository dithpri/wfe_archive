[b][color=#00CED1]Welcome to the United Northern Region[/color][/b]
Located in the Northern Hemisphere, the United Northern Region is a relatively new region, favouring Libertarian economic principles, liberal civil rights and a maximum of personal freedoms. Originally created to serve Arkolon and its two puppet Grand Duchies, as of mid-early May 2013, the UNR has opened its doors to all countries who wish to relocate to the Northern Hemisphere.
