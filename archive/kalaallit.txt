Kalaallit, an island, is about 60% ice capped. It joined the Versean Community (now known as the VU) but withdrew over a dispute. Kalaallit was granted self-government by the Lagettian parliament; the law went into effect the following year. Kalaallit voted in favour of self-rule and acquired it. Lagettia, however, continues to control over several policy areas on behalf of Kalaallit, including foreign affairs, security, and financial policy in consultation with Kalaallit&#39;s Self-Rule Government.
