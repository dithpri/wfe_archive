[B][color=red]Do you ever wonder where&#39;s Adi Hitler now? Surprise, he&#39;s right here! He lives happily in this region because he knows that it, unlike the other National Socialist regions, will never be raided and therefore he&#39;s safe &amp;#128522;[/color][hr]
Be sure to stop by and say hi to Hitler and he&#39;ll greet you back.
Me: &quot;Hitler, say hi!&quot;
Hitler: &quot;Heil!&quot;
Me: &quot;Ain&#39;t he cute?&quot;[hr]

Why did I make this thing? Just for fun.
