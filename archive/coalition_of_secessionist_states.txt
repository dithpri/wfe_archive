[nation=small]The Confederate Free States of America[/nation] formerly wishes that any nation receiving this is willing to join the forces of the Coalition of Secessionist States.
The criteria is very simple, but excludes certain governments from joining. 
A eligible nation must be Conservative, Liberal, Capitalist, Authoritarian, or Centerist.
[nation=small]The Confederate Free States of America[/nation] is a new player/nation that just founded a new region, so expect the region to be very laid back and casual, (and expect it to stay that way also!)
If you like history and the American Civil War, you will most certainly like this region!
Welcome to the Coailition of Secessionist States!
