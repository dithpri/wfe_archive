Welcome to Varia!

We are a region of peace, and we follow the ways of democracy for all nations. We have a legislature body made up of representatives of all nations enacted to make Resolutions, updated them, or even repeal them.

The executive body keeps thing in check and enforces such laws. We also encourage Delegation in the World Assembly and grant such power with executive authority, but limited authority.
