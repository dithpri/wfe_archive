The Domain of Corporate Nation States (DCNS) is a non-profit organization dedicated to removing the influence of government(s) in the lives of the consumer. The means to do this are subject to each DCNS member and their proxies, but the overall goal is to remove government from business-- entirely. As such, this group takes a hard stance against the World Council, the Security Council, and any other international governing bodies.
