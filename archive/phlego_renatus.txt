The region of Phlego used to be a thriving coast on a gorgeous sea full of world-famous reefs. Small countries grew in this fertile place and although greatly diverse, worked together for the greater good. Sadly, this paradise mysteriously disappeared one day underneath the ocean after a prophet predicted its fall a week before. All of Phlego was lost...that is until one day a few years later when the same prophet had a vision predicting the rebirth of Phlego. Millions drove out on their personal boats to watch the phenomenon as the land rose out of the sea.  Now, countries have spouted up in this restored paradise, and you can join them. All of them are united on one point though, keep that prophet far away from here.
