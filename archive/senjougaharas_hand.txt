The Southern Cross is an independent, neutral region, centered around the unrestricted exchange of goods and ideas. It is intended as a home for capitalist-leaning nations, although all are welcome. We believe in quality over quantity, not getting offended, and the idea that nobody has ever received a free lunch.

Ambassadors: Please read this before requesting embassies.

Proudly serving you since May 1st 2020 . Do NOT use this region as puppet storage.
