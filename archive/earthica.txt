This is a standard NS/MT region that I made for Roleplaying. The map is a pseudo Earth, with generalized and recognizable shapes, but much more  Landmass to allow nations to spread out.

Story: 20 years ago The Governments of Earthica faced the greatest economic meltdown in Human History, currencies failed, governments factionalized, some collapsed entirely. The world changed in ways we couldn&amp;#39;t imagine.
It is the year 2020, the world economies are finally recovered, however straining resources, environmental issues and international tensions threaten the delicate balance which has been forged in the last few years.
How will your nation rise to meet these challenges, here in Earthica...
