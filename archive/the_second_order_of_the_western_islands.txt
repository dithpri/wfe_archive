The New Order of The Western Islands is a young region, which was founded by the Republic of Nublucide, the founder of The Western Islands. The Western Islands was a prosperous region in NationStates until February of 2016. Serious disagreements between the two major parties of The Western Islands (one led by Nublucide and the other led by Funlove) divided the region, and led to civil war and the implosion of the Western Islands. The Civil War divided the region into three portions: The Western Islands, The New Order of The Western Islands, and The Normandy Nations.
