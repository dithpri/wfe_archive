[b]Nothing is left. Only scattered death and raging flames. They descended from the night sky and ravaged the lands, covering the lands with panic and chaos. Any who were stupid enough to stand against them faced an even greater brutality, and now feed the worms in pieces. Before leaving the land in decay, they placed a single item upon their prey. A flag, standing as a symbol against hope. A symbol of [region]The Black Hawks[/region].

The merciless hawks who dove in:
Corporal [nation=short]Knot[/nation]
Lieutenant [nation=short]Marselesk[/nation]
Sergeant [nation=short]Gladio IV[/nation]
Private [nation=short]Brombey[/nation]
