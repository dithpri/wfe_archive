[u]The MakroCivilization of the Underverse[/u]

The Underverse is a subspace inversion bubble physically isolated from the universe. It is elipsoid-shaped space has a diameter of ca. 250&amp;#39;000 lightyears (~ 19&amp;#39;650&amp;#39;000&amp;#39;000&amp;#39;000 cubic lightyears of space) and contains around 150 bio. solar systems. 

The Underverse with it&amp;#39;s 150 bio. solar systems is controled by the ultra-totalitarian, monolithic [b]MakroCivilization of the Underverse[/b].

Since the Underverse is separated from the universe, the [b]Underverse MakroCivilization[/b] can only hold contact to the universe by a sub-quantum tensor field system called &amp;quot;Embassy&amp;quot;. Today the &amp;quot;Embassy&amp;quot; facility can only contact the [region]Ulthuan[/region] region.
