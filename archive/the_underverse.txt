The [i]Underverse[/i] is a hidden isolated &#39;space-time bubble&#39; - basically a tiny isolated universe. It is hidden  deep inside of subspace and thus is extremely inaccessible - even for advanced space-faring civilizations.

The [i]Underverse[/i] was discovered and subsequently colonized by [b][nation]The Necromongers[/nation][/b].

The [b]Necromongers[/b] consider the almost impenetrable [i]Underverse[/i] an eternal sanctuary for the human species.
