The Underverse is a subspace inversion bubble physically isolated from the universe. It is around 25&amp;#39;000 cubic lightyears  in diameter and contains around 7.5Mio. solar systems. The Underverse is controled by the monolithic &amp;quot;MakroEmpire of the Underverse&amp;quot;.

Since the Underverse is separated from the universe, the &amp;quot;Underverse MakroEmpire&amp;quot; can only hold contact to the universe by a sub-quantum tensor field system called &amp;quot;Embassy&amp;quot;. Today the &amp;quot;Embassy&amp;quot; facility can only contact the Ulthuan region.
