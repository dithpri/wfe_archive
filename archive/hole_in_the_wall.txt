The Hole In The Wall is a region consisting of a small continent (named Cambria), Australia-esque, with a great desert on the west side, with a mountain range separating the arid west from the prosperous and fertile East. In the east lies the remarkable nation of Fluna, where Cats roam freely around the regions many lakes, and mountain climbers climb the many tall peaks in the small nation&#39;s borders. Of the coast of Cambria there is a large island chain. Slowly spreading throughout the isles is the nation of Rhorshak, an athiest nation where religion is not tolerated, and education is the paramount focus.
