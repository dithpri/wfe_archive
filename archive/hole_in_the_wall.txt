The Hole In The Wall is a region consisting of a small continent (named Cambria), Australia-esque, with a great desert on the west side, with a mountain range separating the arid west from the prosperous and fertile East. In the east lies the nation of Fluna, where Cats roam freely around the regions many lakes. The sole nation located in the east is the barren nation of Alsterya, where their national animal, the Hippocamp, is often seen sifting through the nation&#39;s trash heaps. Off the west coast of Cambria there is a large island chain. Slowly spreading throughout the isles is the nation of Rhorshak, an athiest nation where religion is not tolerated, and education is the paramount focus. Pugs are seen often in their forests.
