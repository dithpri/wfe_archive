We would like to congratulate the Mafia whatever bullcrap region that they successfully taken over an abandoned region, as majority of us left for another one as a group.

This is very impressive, I would like to congratulate y&amp;#39;all :)

Next thing you know, maybe you can take over a region without a founder, with idk, 30 nations?  Oh even better, maybe one that isn&amp;#39;t inactive!  Thanks guys for the laugh :)
