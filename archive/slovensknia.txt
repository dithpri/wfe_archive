[b][i]The Emperor calls to restoration, 
The glory of the Empire is immense, 
He calls and we come. We are the Imperial Guards,
And it is our duty and strength to protect the Empire.

Come friend, don&#146;t be afraid of the enemy,
Our victory is sure as well as the end of tyranny.
We live and die with most honour,
Never in vain, and always in the right hour[/i][/b]

Slovensknia is a glorious empire founded hundreds of years ago, when the terrible slovensks raiders invaded the old C&aelig;rian Empire. On the remnants of the old state, an hybrid civilization was born of the fusion of barbarity and refinement. We always welcome wanderers ; if in your foolishness you decide to pass by our old towns and lands, don&#146;t forget to introduce yourself!
