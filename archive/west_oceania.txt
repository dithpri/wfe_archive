West Oceania lies in the heartlands of the Indian Ocean.  Currently it is home to the desperate and lonely Alpha Centauri, the returned and unbanal Lady Feoras, the cold, dead fires of Solar Vengance, the where have you gone, Harvanis?, 0/3rds of the Holy Trinity and countless broken dreams and bygone memories.  The rest are nonpersons. Literally. This is what dying feels like, folks.
