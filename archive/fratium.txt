Sperrys, alcohol, tobacco, and b&amp;amp;tches are on birth control. Relations with Sororitium are oft and exclusive. Life expectancy- too Frat to f*$king care. We throw the sickest parties, f@%k the hottest b#@ches, and have the most money. Four Loko and cargo shorts are forbidden. We have a Frastle (Frat Castle) where all the parties are thrown. New members to our kingdom get hazed like the Japs in WWII, or whenever we nuked them. Our Regional Anthem is Wagon Wheel and we practice Reagonomics. We&amp;#39;re in constant war with GDIOPIA and haze- excuse me, beat the s#*t out of them- every day of the week. Entrance into our Region comes with a frat cap and croakies. 

All nations are encouraged to endorse a WA Delegate for Fratium of their liking.
