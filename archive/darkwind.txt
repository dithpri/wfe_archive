Darkwind is a region of extremes, in the north, we have ice and snow. In the south, we have hot weather and a few deserts. The middle of the region is a mix of tropical and temperate climate zones.
   In Darkwind, each nation rules itself the way it wants too. There are no regional laws. Every nation is accountable for its own actions.
