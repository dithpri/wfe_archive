Darkwind is a region of extremes, in the north, we have ice and snow. In the south, we have hot weather and a few deserts. The middle of the region is a mix of tropical and temperate climate zones.
   The nations of Darkwind meet in a place known as Skyfall, which is on the Highest mountain in the region. Skyfall is a massive palace built right into the mountain. This is the place where the nations meet and discuss legislation and politics. 
   There are two political parties, The Axis and The Allies. Each side has their own views on how Darkwind should be run. All regional laws that have been passed are stored in Reichsland&amp;#39;s National Archives in a file known as the Factbook.
  We hope you enjoy Darkwind.
