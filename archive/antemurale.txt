Welcome to Antemurale (Bastion in Latin). Here we come together to rule according to a politick inspired by the ideals and virtues of Greece and Medieval thought. Instead of opportunism and individual advancement we seek the good of all through community and true flourishing in its traditional sense. Things are still being put together, but we hope you can join us on this great experiment soon!
