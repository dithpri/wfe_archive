Welcome to [colour=green]Winleria[/colour], a region where you can chill and hang out.

We like to consider ourselves a neutral region, but will defend our comrades and the international interest. We value, [colour=green]peace[/colour] and [colour=green]democracy[/colour].

As we are still a newly founded region, we would appreciate if experienced nations assisted us with growing and gave us tips on how to function efficiently.

We are a member of the [colour=green]Brotherhood of Democratic Socialism[/colour], so you may freely move between [region]Winleria[/region] and [region]Communism is Life[/region]. We actively support [region]Communism is Life[/region] and will help them in any invasion they may begin, though because we value [colour=green]peace[/colour], we would prefer if they did not invade. :)
