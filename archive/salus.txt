[i]Salus is an island of tall, snowy mountains and open grassy plains. So dispersed are the nations that one would be hard-pressed to say where one ended and another began. The people of all nations work together, valuing life and peace above the pretty, war-causing desires of money and greed. Children are encouraged to look to the stars, and dream of new worlds, and adults are reminded to not forget the mistakes and sacrifices of the past. Salus values equity; ensuring that all individuals have what they need to survive. Salus does not discriminate against those of differing regions, nations, race, gender, sexuality or ability. All who value life and living in peace are welcome.[/i]
