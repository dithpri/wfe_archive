[b][u]In the beginning[/u][/b]
There where once two very great nations, Maunstra and Hippy Land, who decided to mesh together and form one of the greatest regions in the entire world. They both took the names of their National Animals and combined them into the greatest hybrid in the world, the Kopaca. It was in this great time that they finally decided to stop all of the war and evil that was going on (mostly in Maunstra) and unite to become greatness. Of course they could not do it alone. They needed help so they invited their friends to the great region to start building up our ranks.
