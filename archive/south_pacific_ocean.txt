The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth&#39;s oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.

The equator subdivides it into the North Pacific Ocean and [b]South Pacific Ocean[/b], with two exceptions: the Gal&aacute;pagos and Gilbert Islands, while straddling the equator, are deemed wholly within the South Pacific.&#151;Wikipedia[hr]
