Today is the end of the Fash Bash. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment in a system far from here, the Fash Bash lies to the galaxy while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Fascist. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Fash Bash will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.
