[b][color=black]If we had done as the kings told us five hundred years ago, 
we should all have been slaves. 
If we had done as the priest told us, 
we should all have been idiots. 
If we had done as the doctors told us, 
we should all have been dead. 
We have been saved by disobedience. 
We have been saved by the splendid thing called independence, 
and I want to see more of it.
I want to see children raised so that they will have it.
