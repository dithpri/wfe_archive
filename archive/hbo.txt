[i][b]Hi, my name is Samara and I&#39;m fourteen, or I would be if I hadn&#39;t died in Halifax. I was riding a bike when I fell on a barbed wire. The farmer laughed at me while I suffered, and after two hours, I finally passed away. Now you can help me to rest in peace, sending it to other three regions. If you don&#39;t repost, however, I will visit you tonight. On June 02, this message was ignored and Robb lost his mind. The same happened with Lysa, on May 18, and Ned, on June 12. Joffrey died because he deserved.  Break the chain, and you will watch the death of your favorite character with me.[/b][/i]
