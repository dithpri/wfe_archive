A Secret War waged by those of sound conviction is no less sincere just because those who do so withhold their names and identities.

Indeed, the very action of anonymity in warfare speaks of the highest standard of sincerity because what is left is the action itself waged in warfare, one that is done based on principles and conviction, and to that end, without seeking personal glory.

They seek resolution, not recognition.

In conclusion, those who have walked this path do so because their struggle is sincere, and sincere is their watchword.[/I][/B][/color]
