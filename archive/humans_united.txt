Welcome to [region]Humans United[/region]!
Our goal is to have [u]at least[/u] 10 regions until we start offering elections for the first WA delegate! The following positions are temporarily open:
-Executive
-Border Control
-Officer of Embassies
IF YOU TELEGRAM [nation]TheBubaloo[/nation] AND GET THE POSITION BEFORE WE REACH THE 10 NATIONS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO HOLD ELECTIONS ONCE WE HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE, WHICH MAY MEAN THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP YOUR POSITION- THIS IS ONLY BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW NATION AND WE DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF NATIONS WITH US.
