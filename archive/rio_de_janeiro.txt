[b][color=navy]Rio de Janeiro[/b][hr][/color][color=maroon]an [region=Ancient Lands] region[/color]
[hr][list][color=mediumblue]This region, like a few others of our regions, will continue to be maintained, as I have had a strong history with this region, same for a few other of our regions, like [region=0000], [region=Okanagan], [region=South China Sea] and [region=United States of America] among others. I will no longer consider closing this or my many former [b]home[/b] regions. Our current Home Region is [region=Ancient Lands], with [region=Ecuador] holding our overflow puppets (we do not want to have an overly massive home region). [region=Ancient Lands] holds only our oldest puppets, population cutoff is 10 billion, and the smaller puppets not being used as founders or agents, are located in other regions.
