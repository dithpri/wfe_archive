Welcome! I am [nation]Glorindale[/nation], the current Director of Shield.  I apologize for my lengthy absences.  I will shortly be handing the role of Director off to one of my good friends, while two of my other friends will be filling council roles temporarily.  I will remain occasionally active and use my founder powers to ensure that SHIELD is never compromised.  In this rebuild, we ask for your patience and trust as we strive to become better than we have been in the past.  Thank you.
