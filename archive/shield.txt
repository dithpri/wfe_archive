[b]S.H.I.E.L.D. - The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.[/b]

Obviously, someone wanted our initials to spell out &#39;shield&#39;.

S.H.I.E.L.D., based on the organization of the same name from the Marvel Comics and Cinematic Universe, is an organization that is dedicated to preserving and establishing order and stability in the world, and to prevent rogue actors from upsetting that established order. S.H.I.E.L.D. stands outside the Raider/Defender dichotomy, as both military tactics are useful and productive to our ends.
