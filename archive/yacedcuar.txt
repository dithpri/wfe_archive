YACEDCUAR (Yorkzh Antarctic Confederation for Economic Development, Centralization, and Unification of the Antarctic Region) is&#133; the name kinda gives away the point.

All residents of the region are within the control of the Yorkzh. No. Questions. Asked.
In return, you get all the benefits of being in the Yorkzh market! Which includes a terrible miserable life for most people, but you, the leader, gets all the benefit! Just accept a few corporate contracts, thats all.

The purpose of the region is to re-unify the Antarctic into one giant nation, just like the glory days of the Yorkzh... when the Yokzhi and Zhokzhi kept killing each other.
