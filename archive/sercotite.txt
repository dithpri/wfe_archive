[b][u] Welcome to the region of [region]Sercotite[/region].[/u][/b]

[b]A brief history of [region]Sercotite[/region].[/b]

[b][region]Sercotite[/region][/b] was born after multiple disputes between multiple other regions.
These disputes left the area now know as [b][region]Sercotite[/region][/b] desolate and Barren.
Many nations where destroyed during the the multiple wars now known as [b]&quot;The Wars Of The Continents&quot;.[/b] Which lasted 22 years.
But from the charred land left in ashes a series of new rapidly growing nations were founded.
These nations fought off the invading continental armies, retook the Region for them selves.
