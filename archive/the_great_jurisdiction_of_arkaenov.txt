[color=red][b]Yo![/b][/color]
[u][color=blue][b]Welcome to [region]The Great Jurisdiction of Arkaenov[/region][/color][/b][/u]
You&amp;#39;re free to join this region, and you&amp;#39;re free to not join. However, we&amp;#39;d prefer it if you did join.
Honestly, the deal with the Black Riders doesn&amp;#39;t effect us much, so we&amp;#39;re pretty safe, to say the least.

If you have questions about the game, please feel free to ask one of us:
[nation]Arkaenov[/nation]
[nation]Baeku[/nation]
[nation]Tenma Chi[/nation]

We&amp;#39;re generally laid back here, and, yeah, we&amp;#39;re kind of a little of a lot awesome. 
So, have a great (or possibly horrible--I dunno) day!
Adieu.
