Hello Everyone!

[region=The Great Jurisdiction of Arkaenov] is a region that will accept any nation, as long as they don&amp;#39;t try to invade or cause problems. 
We hold monthly elections that give all WA nations equal opportunity to be elected. Er...Rather, we [i]used to[/i] hold elections, before our collapse last December. Elections will resume once we have more than one WA member again, though!

If you need help or have questions about the game(or just about anything else, for that matter.), then you can ask on the RMB, or TG one of the following nations:
[nation=arkaenov]
[nation=baeku]
[nation=morvanus verindia]
[nation=tenma chi]

Note that we will help you whether you join the region or not! Happy NSing!
