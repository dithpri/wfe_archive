We here at The Great Jurisdiction of Arkaenov are pretty cool. You can join if you want, or not if we&amp;#39;re not really your style. We&amp;#39;re friendly enough, as long as you don&amp;#39;t try to invade or whatever. Even if you do invade, we don&amp;#39;t really care, because we can just repel you and then laugh! 

Anyway, whether you join or not, you can ask any of the below nations for help:

[nation=arkaenov]
[nation=tenma chi]
[nation=baeku]
