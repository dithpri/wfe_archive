The United Creative Countries is a Region for people who have fun silly light hearted nations. Like for example the Capital city for a country can be a lego town they made. Or the National Railroad can be a train set. It&#146;s the point of this region. Something else that&#146;s encouraged is to have the language that you are learning for fun or in school be your country&#146;s official language. For example the official language of Ezertzerland is German, the founder doesn&#146;t speak German natively but He is learning it. You can also use your native language or make up an accent to go with your native language or the one that you are learning. The whole point is to have creative countries with silly creative people.
