Melancholy Hill is a beautiful place where friends are made and nobody is judged for who they are. We do not tolerate any bullying, spamming, or trolling! You will be immediately banjected if you are caught doing so! We all want to be completely accepting and we will not judge you for who you are. 
This region is mainly here for us who are fans of anime, manga, video games, and music! But we gladly accept people of all kinds, regardless of what your interests are. Our goal here is to create a friendly and lively community where everyone is kind and accepting.
