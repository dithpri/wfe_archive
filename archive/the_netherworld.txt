A region of many different nations to come together and respect each others free thinking and personal life choices whether they be laws, religions, sexuality. The point is to respect one another, their race, cultures and choices regardless of whether one agrees with them themselves or not as long as they abide by the countries legal standard therein. When challenged, the nations while different in their own ways, all want peace and to keep this peace, all will fight together ferociously for the love of their countries, people and families/friends.
