TO OUTSIDERS: We are a peaceable but solitary region--do not take it personally when your embassies are declined. We do not create ties. Please do not contact [nation]The Specter of Death[/nation] wishing to join. It is up to them if you will be extended the option of taking part.

TO INSIDERS: Each of you are the future of the world. You have been chosen for one reason and one reason only: The success of Operation F. But do not worry, for just by being yourselves you are already fulfilling the Operation.

If you are here, you have been deemed worthy and passed the great test of admission. We are glad to have you join our formidable ranks. If you are not....well, maybe one day.

To all, I say merely, &quot;Callidus, partum, et amentes.&quot;
