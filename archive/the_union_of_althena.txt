The Union of Althena, is located on the continent of Althena which was created by several massive volcano eruptions. After the land formation of Althena, many of the already existing super-powers, The United North American States, Scandinavian Union, and The Slavic Union colonized the new land. A few years after the establishment of colonies, the colonies formed a coalition with each other to fight for their independence from their mother nations, however the coalition was short-lived after the success in gaining independence many of the newly independent nations had went separate ways, some declared war on each-other and others became isolated, or formed alliances.
