Standing forever beneath the eternal blue sky, the Mongol Alliance is the modern heir to the ancient Mongol Empire of Chinggis Khan. The Mongol Nation and its allies cover 20% of the Earth&#146;s surface and contain 20% of its population... and counting.

The Mongol Alliance fought a war with Swalinehariterstan, the invaders who briefly controlled Russia SSR. The Russian and Mongol people were victorious in their fight, and Russia&#146;s sovereignty was restored.
