&quot;The Land is nothing but suffering and sorrow. The people shall fall before our might and shall perish in the midst of the Chaos.  We will kill any and all survivors still standing to face us. We will cross the world and dimensions to destroy every living being we see. There is No Peace, No Hope, No Happiness, Only Chaos, Death, Destruction, and War.&quot;
