[b][color=blue]Welcome to the Carson Collective![/color][/b]

We are a small, fledgling region whom seeks no goal but inner happiness and purpose. We occasionally hold polls and basically do nothing within the World Assembly. We are open to outsiders, and welcome them with friendship. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t do much, due to our small status, but if we grow we will continue to do more and more.
