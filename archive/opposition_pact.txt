The Opposition Pact was founded to prevent war over political disagreement. Our stance of our individual nations do not match, but we each seek to defend our citizens, but apathetic and aware, from bloodshed over political disagreement. By joining this pact, as the highest representative of your nation, you acknowledge the non-aggression agreement written within the treaty, and validate your agreement to not engage any and all nations within the pact.
