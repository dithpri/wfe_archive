The Swedish alpine region is a collection of islands and mountains of the four Alps ranges. Descended from the Swedish, Turkic, Austronesian, Swiss, Perso-Keralan, Basque, Sami (Uralic/Finnish) Caucasian, and Scottish adventurers, the people of the Swedish Alps have developed their own unique culture, language, Christian faith, and traditions. The resources of the region are great and the produce the potential for a thriving economy. However, political unrest and the people&amp;#39;s close ties to nature and ancient traditions of the region limit growth.
