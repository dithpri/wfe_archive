This is alternate history. All areas are owned by Nazi Germany, Italy, or Imperial Japan. No countries are independent from the axis occupation.

-Brief lore-
Russia had remained neutral until the end of the war. They were sure they wouldn&#39;t be invaded by the slowly growing axis forces. By the time Russia had noticed the axis were planning on becoming hostile; it was too late. The whole of Europe had fallen to the axis forces. The war had ended in 1964, when Nazi Germany had raised their flag over Moscow.
