[color=#BF0000][b]P&AElig;DAGOG[/b][/color] is a roleplay group made up of veteran and beginner roleplayers alike who seek to collaborate on developing unique and interesting worlds to explore through the realm of play-by-post roleplaying. To this end, we support players with constructing their own languages, building their own nations and worlds, designing engaging roleplays based on unique and fun concepts, and in strengthening their abilities as roleplayers, game masters, dungeon masters, and - above all - as writers. We are based in P2TM but welcome role players from all areas of NationStates.
