[color=#BF0000][b]P&AElig;DAGOG[/b][/color] is a roleplay group made up of veteran and beginner roleplayers alike. We seek to collaborate on developing unique and interesting worlds to explore through the realm of play-by-post roleplaying. We support players with constructing languages, building nations and worlds, designing engaging RP based on unique and fun concepts, and in strengthening their abilities as roleplayers, GM, and - above all - as writers. We were founded by members of [region]The Apartment Block[/region] and are based in P2TM. We welcome role players from all areas of NationStates.
