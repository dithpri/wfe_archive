Founded by His Imperial Majesty the Holy Emperor Duncan II, the Holy Realm of Omnisius stretches far beyond the Empire&amp;#39;s borders, consuming much of the Mediterranean region from Israel on the East to Portugal on the West. Succeeding the legacy of the Holy Roman and Ottoman Empires, the Holy Omnisian Empire is set to become one of the world&amp;#39;s largest empires.

The vast region that extends beyond Omnisius is called the Holy Realm, plagued by religious preachers that would soon serve as keys to the massive expansion of the empire.
