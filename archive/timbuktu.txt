[color=green]I know you&#39;re tired but come, this is the way.

Everything you observe has its roots in the unseen world. 
The forms may change, but the essence stays the same. 
Every awesome sight will disappear, and every sweet word will fade away;
but do not be dejected&#151;for their source is eternal, growing, branching out, 
and giving new life and new joy. 

Why do you weep? 
The source is in you, and this whole world is springing up from it.

You are the universe in ecstatic motion.

Soul of all souls, life of all life - you are That.
Seen and unseen, moving and unmoving - you are That.
The road that leads to the City is endless;
Go without head and feet and you&#39;ll already be there.
What else could you be? - you are That. 

What you seek is seeking you.[/color]
