[hr]Led by General [nation=short]Pevvania[/nation], and supervised by six presidents, [region]Libertatem[/region]&#39;s most ambitious and successful operation to date managed to lead to the installation of a covert libertarian government that has held power for approximately 2 years since August 2012.
