[b]First of all, making a region glorifying a country that is still legally ruled by a dead guy (Kim Il-Sung) is just kind of off, don&amp;#39;t you think?

Second of all, this operation was brought to you by Eist, a member of the defender organization, Ten Thousand Islands Treaty Organization. Not that he actually raided this, but because he annoyed me, and the new rule is, when Eist Annoys me, I topple a delegate. 

So that&amp;#39;s why I stopped by to take your delegacy, change your flag and WFE. Well, that and it was fun, good practice, and proof [region]Kantrias[/region] can do this kind of thing.

Special thanks to our allies in [region]The United Imperial Armed Forces[/region] and our friends in [region]Asgard[/region] for the support. Apparently Koth was raiding shirtless.[/b]
