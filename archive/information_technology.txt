[b]Information Technology[/b] (IT) is the discipline of explaining to people
that computers only do exactly what they are told, even when no one remembers
telling them that.

It is officially defined as the study and use of computers, networks, and
telecommunication systems to create, process, store, retrieve, and transmit
information. This definition is correct, but unhelpful.

In practice, IT consists of moving files from one folder to another, changing
settings that were fine yesterday, and fixing problems by restarting things
until morale improves.
