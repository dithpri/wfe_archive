Our goal: Discover everything and anything via research and experimentation. All the laws we hope to pass to the WA represent this.

We endorse:
- The focus on the advancement of knowledge via research and testing
- Experimentation on all life forms (including human)
- High government influence of their respected people as long as it is in the name of research

Morals are out of the question
