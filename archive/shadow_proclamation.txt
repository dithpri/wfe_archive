we are a strong force. we look out for our own and we stick with our brethren

A Word from the current WA Delegate:

Welcome to the Shadow Proclamation
 
We are a relaxed nation that is against the policies of the World Assembly and seek that they change them.

On a side note: Have a merry christmas and a happy new year!
Next side note: If other regions threaten to invade just mention how much chaos we have and invite them to a bottle of it
