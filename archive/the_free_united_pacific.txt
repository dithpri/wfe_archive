After a long and severely destabilizing civil war in the Pacific, the Republic of Caspar - discontent with its power-mongering neighbors - set out to carve out its own destiny in the world, and found a supranational organization which would ensure peace and prosperity for all its inhabitants. This organization, the Free United Pacific, is firmly rooted in the fundamental rights of peace, sovereignty and self-determination. All like minded nations are welcome to throw of the ilk of repression and flourish in the safe waters of the Free World.
