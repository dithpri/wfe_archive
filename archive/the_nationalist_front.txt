The Nationalist Front is open to all nations who believe in authoritarian governance and national pride, with an enmity towards communism.  No Communist, Stalinist, or Marxist nations are welcome here.

So slip on your jackboots, wave your flag, and sing your anthem to the glory of the Nationalist cause.
