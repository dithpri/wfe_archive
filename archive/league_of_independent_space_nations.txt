The League of Independent Space Nations is a region set up to cater for all nations not bound to Earth. This ranges from inter-planetary empires to simple asteroid or satellite colonies. It also includes Earth based nations with space faring technology. 

Furthermore the L.I.S.N is not a strict association. International politics are free, open and decided fairly amongst yourselves. Friendly discussion on the region message board is encouraged. 

Open to the whole political spectrum, just so long as you have the adequate technology to operate a space-nation.

(that&amp;#39;s future tech in case you didn&amp;#39;t get that).
