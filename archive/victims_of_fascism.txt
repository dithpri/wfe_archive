Memorable quotes:

&#147;Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion.&#148;  - F. A. Hayek

&#147;The government cannot love you, and any politics that works on a different assumption is destined for no good.&#148; -Jonahs Goldberg

&amp;quot;The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.&amp;quot; - Michel Foucoult
