The Coalition of Democratic States is a region that was created out of the loss of our old region, [region]The Constitutional Democratic States[/region]. I hope we can rebuild what we had there and unite our old friends here, and maybe gain some new ones. I have several ideas in mind, which would include [color=green]weekly polls[/color] ranging from fun to serious topics, and perhaps a [color=orange]Sunday newspaper[/color] that would either be based on real-world events or events that occur within the region. If enough people join, I may even be able to start a [color=blue]football tournament[/color].
