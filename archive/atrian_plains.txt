The Atrian Plains are a desolate land that holds nothing but despair for those who inhabit it.

All nations in the Atrian Plains must submit to the rule of the Federation of Atriad.  The Federation High Districts are the ruling body of the Federation of Atriad, and laws passed in the High District apply to all nations in the Atrian Plains.

All nations in the Atrian plains are expected to maintain moderate (or better) economics, political freedoms, and civil rights.
