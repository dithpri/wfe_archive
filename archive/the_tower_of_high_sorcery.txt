The Tower of High Sorcery is the Official Residence of The Sorcerer-King C&eacute;sare of Imperial Virginia, located in Richmond. The Tower not only houses The Sorcerer-King but many other Sorcerers and Magi. It&amp;#39;s Libraries contain many Magical Tomes that can never exit the heaven piercing Tower. On the very top layer The Sorcerer-King sits on the Throne of The Black Fist with his Counsel of Sorcerers whispering in his ears.
