This region earned its name from its highly varying landscape throughout each country within. From massive seas of sand dunes to tall, snowy mountains and tropical coral reefs, just about anything you can imagine is seen in this region. Although not every country within is on perfect terms with one another, not one leader here will hesitate to protect their comrades.
