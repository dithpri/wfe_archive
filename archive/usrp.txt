This is a region created for United States Centered Roleplaying, though this really depends on the demands of the region and may change. Nations of all types are welcome, and we are big fans of those with detailed alternate histories. While we will accept any nation, fascist/communist, liberal/conservative, religious/atheist, supporters of equality/violent segregationists; we are also supporters of having a good time. Anyone who engages in conduct that conflicts with this one rule through spamming, rudeness, or by violating any pre-established NS rules will be asked to leave.


Thank You
George Wallace,
President of the CSA, 1969-77
