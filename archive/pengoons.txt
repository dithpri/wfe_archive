Join our [url=https://discord.gg/NeK4arG]chat[/url] and our [url=http://www.lonewolvesunited.com]forum[/url] to join in the festivities! 

A big thank you goes to our friends in [region]The Black Hawks[/region], [region]Social Technocratic Union[/region], [region]Osiris[/region] and [region]Karma[/region] for help in hosting this party, as well as keeping out the party crashers wishing to end the party too soon.[hr] [b][url=https://youtu.be/aKlxTfExsDM]Song of the raid[/url][/b]
