By the time the war ended 15 to 20 million had been killed and almost half of the dead were civilian. The war would also bring to an end four Empires, the Russian, German, Austro Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires would all cease to exist and a new workd would dawn from their ashes. Let us never forget those who fought, died, and that lived through this Seminal Tragedy of the 20th century.[*]Today we also remember the brave men and women that have served in the US military.[/list]
