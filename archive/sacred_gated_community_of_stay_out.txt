The Sacred Gated Community of Stay Out is a region within a region.

First founded in the North Pacific, the Community of Our People of Union and Perseverance founded their Sacred Gated Community of Stay Out in hopes that evil warrior people from other nations would not invade them and take away their awesome &amp;quot;FREEDOM of EVERYTHING&amp;quot;. The region is totally opposed to war with other region and probably won&amp;#39;t defend itself either. Oh well.
