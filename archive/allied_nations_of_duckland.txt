A region that reminds nations all across Nationstates to not take the game too seriously!

A group of 3 friends have created nations all varying in ideologies and seriousness to show that we can all get along.

We have no desire to spread any hate and we will NEVER invade or ally with anyone which clearly shows bias to one category of people.

Nationstates is a game. Not a actual political debate. If you disagree with anything we say, I personally beg you DO NOT RAID AND DESTROY US, WE ARE PEACEFUL AND WE DO NOT SPREAD HATE.
