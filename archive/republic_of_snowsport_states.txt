The Republic of Snowsport States is a group of nations with a common interest in snowsports. Countries are not required to have industries or teams related to Snowsports, but must appreciate them. Strapping fancy wood to your feet and sliding down a mountain. What fun. Welcome! (Formerly known as The Northern Bloc of Snowsport States)
