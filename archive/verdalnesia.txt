Verdalnesia is a diverse region, consisting of various states with historically unstable diplomatic relations in-between. Despite historical conflicts between the different states and nations, recognizing the outside threat from rising trends of centralization and imperialism in neighbouring regions, they have in recent time banded together into the Confederacy of Verdalnesian States. The Confederacy employs a government with executive authority in foreign affairs, while the states have full sovereignity over internal affairs, as well as their relations with each other.
