Welcome to the Model Model United Nations. Here at the MMUN, we pride ourselves on diversity of nations. Nations with all forms of government are welcome and encouraged to participate in our thriving regional democracy.

That being said, there are some important regulations that come with being a part of our region.

If you feel like you can follow [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=894216] these rules[/url], then the MMUN might be a place for you! Join today!
