[u][i][b]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/b][/i][/u]

A couple months ago, there was a wave of puppet CTEs by Aquaviva, so [nation]Nuevo Mexican Empire[/nation] and I teamed up to take over those released regions. About a month later, [region]New Reich of Bunicken[/region]-[region]J o J[/region] relations [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1309475]were terminated[/url], and NME later left NS, so his puppets CTEd recently without my knowledge. So now I have to go through here and occupy this crap myself. This &quot;crap&quot; will become regional territories, and no, NRB doesn&#39;t get to have any since they have been sitting around doing nothing to prevent enemy incursions, such as in the case of [region]Union Of Fascist Realms[/region].
