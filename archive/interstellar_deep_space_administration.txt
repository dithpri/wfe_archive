Welcome to the IDSA. The year is 3129. Humanity has long since moved on from the small rock they called Earth, and has colonized the stars of the Milky Way. However, they met hostile races on planets around these stars. Many wars were fought, but these races also knew the value of peace. The IDSA was created as a governing body with representatives from every race of every planet. Peace has since endured, but small wars still pulsate throughout the galaxy.
