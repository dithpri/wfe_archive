There are no people. Only possums. Immediately after crossing the border, each human abruptly morphs into a possum. No, it doesn&#39;t change back. If this doesn&#39;t sound great yet, we have flamethrowers and civil rights. Our climate is perfect. It rains profusely in one acre and is sunny in the next. Our wildlife consists of raccoons, naked mole rats, butterflies, and pretty much and animal that would like to join the possum lifestyle. Our plants are a bit zesty. Some are carnivorous. You should be fine though. Anyways, move to Possumtopia. It&#39;s a vibe.
