The Sentinel Union came to be after a successful coup done by the GSDF in Japan, completely overthrew the government in terms of Propaganda and Lethal Force. They didn&#39;t believe in democracy despite the National Security Force&#39;s attempt at turning Japan into a copy-paste of America - In return, the JGSDF reformed their name into &#39;Jinrai&#39; and spoke to the Japanese people after toppling the Prime Minister, the famous words being spoken: &quot;Withdrawal of Freedom, at the cost of protection.&quot;

Later on, The Sentinel Union was banded together by high government officials of the Jinrai in hopes of allowing their influence to spread world-wide.
