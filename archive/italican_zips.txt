Italican Zips, Formerly known as just &amp;#39;Italica&amp;#39; was originally founded by a grouped alliance, hoping to spread word of their land, and unify all together with hopes of power, untill one day the powerhungry leaders were pushed over the line and decided to attempt to attack in hopes of grabbing more territory and expanding their own.

Now we&amp;#39;re at war.

War, War never changes.
