Waldorf-Astoria is a region whose policies include systematic crack-down on crime, international domination, unification of countries through economy and trade, and military alliances. We will break the hegemony of the plutocratic Western powers, and we will defend our lands from the evils of communism. Autarky, power, military. All three powers of Waldorf-Astoria. 

We will rise. We will conquer. We will dominate.

Loyalty above all.
