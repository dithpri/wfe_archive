Welcome to the region of Emperia. We currently are a Work-In-Progress. Emperia is a grand-strategy region with a hint of role-play elements. Emperia&#146;s grand-strategy elements are very similar to that of the board game Risk and the game Europa Universalis 4.

Our map is divided up into many small provinces. These provinces are what will make up your country. The provinces which are not occupied by any country are turned into &#147;AI&#148; countries which normally are neutral, but they can be attacked, as well as attack others. Your country&#146;s population will mean how much land you start out with as well as how many troops you can make. Other stats will also be taken in effect.
