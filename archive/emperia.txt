An alternate world 1880s themed region (for roleplay anyway) where continents and nations are different but technology starts out as if t were the 1880s. Technology will progress just like it did in the real world but things don&#39;t have to be historically accurate (just don&#39;t make supercomputers in 1923 or something like that, make sure it is feasible with understandings of science at that time). I hope you find residence here and good luck! (Roleplay will be in a different region that will have an embassy here)
