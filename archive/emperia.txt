Hello! This region is still quite small, but [b][i]YOU[/i][/b] can change that! You have the chance to get a position as a regional Officer, OR you can even become a WA delegate in the region! The region also is about to set up roleplay in less than a week, so if you are interested then come and be one of the first people in the rp! Also please read the rules below they will help you avoid being banned.
[b][u]If[/u][/b] you are a WA member then endorse other WA members in the region. [b][i][u]ESPECIALLY EMNARIA!!!!!![/u][/i][/b]
