It has been a long journey for Grecia. From it&#39;s secession from The Five Orders and founding as a region in its own right, to the Greco-Alerian split, to the reconciliation that was Crassia, and then the Laconikas-Cadrean split. However, at long last, we have returned home. The Grecian flag waves proudly once more, and we are eager to get back to work.

All nations are welcome to Grecia, where we encourage national sovereignty and rp.
