Welcome to PPP, where our goal is to join together in a peaceful manner, whilst at the same timing working very hard to keep other nations in order. Violence is the furthest thing from the goal, but if a nation or region refuses to comply with what is right, Justice will be served, no matter the extent the PPP has to go to to enforce this Justice. The motto of the PPP is Preach, Pioneer and Prosper. This is always the ultimate goal and by following these three guidelines we, together as one, can go far and beyond our goals. Feel free to join if this region fits you.
