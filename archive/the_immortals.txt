We are a free, sovereign, serendipitous, serene, peace loving region. The leaders and citizens within strive to provide an eternal state of friendship and mutual respect and support of the nations in our borders. We realize we are all different, and we all believe in different values, and those values we will defend...forcefully if necessary. A true aly will defend you, especially if they don&amp;#39;t agree. We are all equal.
