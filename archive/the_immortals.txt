We are a free, sovereign, serendipitous, serene, peace loving region. Our leaders and citizens strive to provide an eternal state of friendship and mutual respect and support of one another. There are differences all around us, and those differences make us equal. We will defend those differences...forcefully if necessary. Any and all raiders will be ejected and banned.
