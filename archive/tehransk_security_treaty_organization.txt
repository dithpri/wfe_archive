Welcome to the Teheransk Security Treaty Organization (TSTO), an alliance forged in the brotherhood of arms and unwavering honor. Our region is a defensive military stronghold, where each nation is a link in an impenetrable chain of steel.

Any aggression against a TSTO member will be considered a declaration of war against the entire alliance. The nations of TSTO protect one another with all resources at their disposal. Our diplomacy is founded on collective security and absolute deterrence.

If you seek an alliance where security is guaranteed and retaliation is unwavering, you have found your home. If you want to be part of the organization, contact [nation]Montoral[/nation]to request your membership. War may come, but here we are ready.
