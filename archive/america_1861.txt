An RP region focused on the turbulent days of the American Civil war. Players joining will take the role of a state or territory a few days from the start of the war. They will then be tasked with maintain their territory, providing resources and men, and conducting domestic diplomacy. If you have an interest in the civil war, history, strategy, or just role play, this region could be for you. This region is not intended to be a primary region, but rather an RP region for puppet nations. No prior RP experience is necessary.
