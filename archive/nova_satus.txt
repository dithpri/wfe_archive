[color=green][b]Hello, and welcome to Nova Satus[/b][/color]
This is a region of fresh-starts and new beginnings. Because the rallying cry for the region, [i]Nova Satus[/i] means &#39;Fresh Start&#39; in Latin. All that is asked is that the opinions of others be respected, even if they happen to be different than yours. This region is perfect for New players to stretch their legs and wings and fly, or Older players to finally find a home that suits them. I hope you enjoy your stay, whether temporary or permanent!
