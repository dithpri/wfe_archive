Centered in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, the Great Rad Island is a generally hidden region, few knowing of its existence.
Among its many nation states is Radtonia, the finders of the island who have made their land in the middle of the Bowl, a round valley covered by mountains. Generally Radtonia word is law, yet many other nations have been set due to a lack of actual power.
