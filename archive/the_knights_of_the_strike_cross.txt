The Knights of the Strike Cross is a Neo-Knightly Order based on Chivalry and helping others, it&amp;#39;s goal in nationstates is to help regions stay independent from other raiding regions, the Knights strictly believe in independence for all, The Knights of the Strike Cross will help any region if invaded by a raiding region claiming to be &amp;quot;Uniting&amp;quot; nationstates, a example of this is &amp;quot;DEN&amp;quot;. Just message our Founder/Grand Master and he will send men to help your region.
