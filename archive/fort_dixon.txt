[spoiler=The NSCC Mission]Our mission is to unite Confederates throughout NS to form an alliance for military and economical gain. We are also interested in providing a common alliance for fellow confederates in time of war. Members are asked to donate troops to the cause, so that we can assist in relevant conflicts. We also hope to spread the Confederate message to other members of NS.[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Embassy Policy]Fort Dixon will only construct embassies with other Confederate regions or allied regions. Exceptions are rare but can be made.[/spoiler]
