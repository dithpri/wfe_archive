[b]Welcome to the World Circle of Peace and Justice[/b]

[i]We are currently inviting new members into our region.[/i]

As a relatively newly established region, we are currently under development. This will include creating a map, and official regional flag, as well as holding elections of regional offices. We invite you to contribute to these processes as we develop. If you have any questions or suggestion, please contact [nation]Cesenia[/nation].
