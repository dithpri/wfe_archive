[b]Welcome to the World Circle of Peace and Justice[/b]

[i]We would like to invite any and all Nation States, that strive to ensure peace and justice fall all, to join our region.[/i]

The officers within this region are appointed to World Assembly member states, and states outside World Assembly are appointed under exceptional circumstances.

It is the responsibility of this region to ensure that other region members are looking after their citizens and providing just and peaceful legislation. The members in this region will frequently review your Nation State&#39;s progress to ensure that peace and justice is upheld within your state, and recommend improvements and areas to focus on for improvement.
