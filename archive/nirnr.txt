Welcome to one of the most conservative regions in the world!
We believe in the free market and laissez faire economic policies combined with traditional conservative values, such as the belief that social inequality is natural and the rejection of the concept of social justice.

Nirnr is a region with:

- Strong attitude against socialism and communism.
- Total distrust for pacifist ideals.
- Complete desire to open the way to sciences and technological advances.
- Sign approval for the death penalty, abortion, euthanasia and other penalties.
- Contempt for the left political ideologies.

If these ideas go hand in hand with your country do not forget to join
