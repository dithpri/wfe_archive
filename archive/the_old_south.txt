Welcome to the Reconstruction!  Now that the Rebel Army has been crushed, it&#39;s happy fun time in the Old South.  We are now one big happy country since the stain of slavery has been cleaned from our great nation.  Make no mistake, slavery is bad and will not be tolerated.  Please do not make us smack you in the nose with a rolled up newspaper or cut a swath of distruction from Atlanta to the sea.  That would make us sad.  Thank you.  P. S. Since we are American patriots, no Rebel flags, please.
