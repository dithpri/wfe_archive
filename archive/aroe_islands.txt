[i][b][color=#00BF00]Hello, and welcome to the Aroe Islands![/color][/b][/i]

[b]The Aroe Islands are a diverse Northern Region, rich in culture.
 
Nations of the Aroe Islands socialize and often take part in role play with others. And so we would also like to encourage you to do so.
Here in the Aroe Islands all beliefs are welcome, and will often be discussed on our wall as that is what our topics drift towards so often.[/b]

When we have reached sufficient members, an official map will be created
