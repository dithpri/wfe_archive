Congratulations, Citizens of Realm of the Whispering Winds!

The repeal of a SC liberation that we [url=https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=39863884#p39863884]may or may not have[/url] had something to do with is a joyous occasion! With said repeal being imminent, your old pals from [b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region][/b] and [b][region]The West Pacific[/region][/b] have returned once again to throw a nice little soir&eacute;e, just for [i]you[/i]!

Thanks to [b][region]Carcassonne[/region][/b] for joining our little party!
