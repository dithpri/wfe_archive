Way out west there was this nat... nation I wanna tell ya about. Nation by the name of Coal Mountain. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. Coal Mountain, he called himself &amp;quot;Yosef&amp;quot;. Now, &amp;quot;Yosef&amp;quot; - that&amp;#39;s a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about Yosef that didn&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that&amp;#39;s why I found the place so darned interestin&amp;#39;.
