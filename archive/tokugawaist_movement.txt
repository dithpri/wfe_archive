Welcome to the Tokugawaist Movement! This region advocates the Pan-Asian Sonacist ideology of Tokugawaism.

Tokugawaism was created by the Japanese Shogun, Tokugawa Akihiro. This ideology takes influences from Martinezism and Pan-Asianism. Just like Martinezism, Tokugawaism advocates a centralized economy, authoritarianism, and nationalism.

This region is for nations that advocate Tokugawaism, or other Sonacist and Pan-Asian ideologies as well as allied states.
