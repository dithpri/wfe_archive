We are a roleplaying group, we do so with the voted technology, the first people in gets a authority rule as a Region Leader

Rules
No disrespecting authority unless deserved
Dont break the technlogy age that we are in (so if in WWI you cant have a nuclear missile)
If you want authority, (after people are assigned Region Leader are set) you have to make a faction. (just tell me what you want it to be called and boom your a faction leader
Have Fun :)
