The land of only one species, only beings, only saber-toothed squirrels. Where there are no sins, no imperfections. A place created by your god Nuttus, the almighty. The god who gifted us with wisdom, science, and medicine... And blah blah blah, anyway, this is the home of the lost city of Scratlantis, the city that appears for a few minutes in the fourth Ice Age film. The squirrel-like inhabitants stuff themselves with nuts and grains, especially acorns, which they are so fanatical about that a religion was created behind it...
