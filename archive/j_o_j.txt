[color=#ED4719]Check out the embassies at [region]J o Jian Military Network[/region] for a list of the vanquished, including: [/color]
[color=#ED4719]
- [region]Psomewhere[/region], the roleplay region of [region]the South Pacific[/region],
- [region]Traveling Wilburys[/region], an embassy collector region that had over [u][b]1000[/b][/u] embassies,
- [region]Anti J o J Coalition[/region], a multi-regional coalition dedicated to stopping me,
- and many, many more![/color]
