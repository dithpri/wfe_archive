Folkvangir was a mysterious archipelago where souls came to rest after falling in battle. Once a land without modern technology, mysterious forces have found a way to change that. Now tech from the 18th to 21st centuries, mostly weapons, are flooding in, causing the rise and fall of many nation states. Science and technology blend together here, capable of creating things not possible in either world. Once a glorious afterlife built on the concept of noble and fair combat, Folkvangir now is a scarred War zone where soldiers of past eras attempt to twist the World to their own vision of Utopia.
