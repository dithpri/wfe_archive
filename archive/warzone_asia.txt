Welcome to Warzone Asia, a Bon Devons region since December 2012. [nation]East Sussex County[/nation], which isn&amp;#39;t really a democratic republic, is CONDEMNED by this region for his terrible acts of tyranny (he ejected all nations from this region in the hopes of destroying it). [region]Bon Devons[/region] has decided to take it over. [nation=short]Metanoialand[/nation] will lead this campaign, and withdraw from the regional government when it reaches a self-sustainable size (around 26 nations, just like in Bon Devons). The bans ESC made expired a long time ago, but their emotional turmoil will never be erased.
