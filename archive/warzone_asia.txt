The forces of [color=blue]The Isles of Liberty[/color] and [color=blue]The Allied Republics[/color] were easily driven out and sent packing to TRR. We have plenty of kleenex to wipe those tears away. Do not forget to pick us up some BBQ. Cheers!

This warzone is now controlled by the collective forces of the [region]British Isles[/region], [region]Global Right Alliance[/region], [region]The Consulate[/region], [region]The Rejected Realms[/region], and [region]Balder[/region].

All incoming nations MUST TG [nation]Jedi-Gangsters[/nation] and endorse him. Or he will devour you and steal your beer.
