We exist together now, two corpses in one grave. But do not be afraid. For I am peace; I am salvation. Side by side, we will march as one, until all regions are consumed in a universe of flesh and mind and bone! Now the gate has been unlatched! Headstones are pushed aside! Corpses shift and offer room, to a fate you must abide! Join your voice with mine, and sing victory everlasting!

Let us begin...
