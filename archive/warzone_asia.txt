[b]Warzone Asia has been freed from the oppression of [region]The Liberators of NS[/region].  May this success serve as a testament to all who seek to interfere with the sovereignty of the Warzones.

Warzone Asia will be held by the forces of Warzone Europe until a native of Warzone Asia is found to lead the region.[/b]
