This Warzone was powerful and led well until a coup started and overthrew the delegate. 
The delegate used its last power to ban that nation. Then delegate position was given to a minister nation until we were attacked by the BR. That delegate then left for a task force region against the BR. Now I the current delegate look to building the region&amp;#39;s power and allies to what it once was.
