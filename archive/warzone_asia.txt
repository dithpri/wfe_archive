[color=0276FD][region]Warzone Asia[/region] is a proud member of The Warzone Federation! WZF Homeland is [region]Warzone Europe[/region], where 3 out of the 6 WZGCR&#146;s jointly negotiated a new government with representation from each respective state present. If you&#146;re interested in the WZF, head on over to [region]Warzone Europe[/region]!

This Warzone may be subject to R/D gameplay, which is fine. The heads of Asiastate in the Federation still lay claim to it.

Warzone Asia is currently host to forces from [region]Swedes[/region] (Far superior to [region]Finns[/region]), with whom the Federation are engaging in talks with on the note of a possible merger. WZAS remains an independent state of the WZF, but a state of the WZF nonetheless.[/color]
