[color=0276FD][b][region]Warzone Asia[/region], after having been occupied by Fascist invaders from CCD, was promptly liberated by the brave Legionaires of [region]the Pacific[/region], who were kind enough to offer those Fascists a one way trip straight to [region]the Rejected Realms[/region], free of charge. An embassy was proposed as a thank you for this good deed. 
Any WA nations who enter are to endorse the delegate, [nation]The Alnorudian Navy[/nation], or will also find themselves on the next bus to [region]the Rejected Realms[/region].[/color][/b]
