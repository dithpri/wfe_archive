[color=#4c4cff]Does the delegate have to right to choose? Then let this embassy close, of course you could stop it but meh. We decided that we didn&#39;t like francoism so we decided to stay a while and withdraw your embassy! This raid was brought to you be the ESA, been crushing francoists since well, yesterday. We disliked your policy of bulling and scare tactics to get what you want, we wish for them to cease. Heed this warning the ESA does not and will not tolerate these acts against us and our fellow userite pals. Grab a drink stay awhile, pick a side or just watch the fireworks. NPO delenda est!
