[hr][hr][b][color=red]You see your beloved city on fire,

Standing on the last standing spire.

The situation is more than Dire.

You watch, losing all faith ; it transpires,

The climatic ending to your empire.

After centuries, even you would tire,

After giving up all earthly desire,

To build from dirt and dust, an empire.

To see it fall and crumble, drawn your ire,

Towards your Sire who failed to aspire.[/color][hr][hr]
