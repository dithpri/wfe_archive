[region]Warzone Asia[/region] is a proud member of the Warzone Federation! The constitution has been signed and the implementation has commenced. Citizens of Asiastate will begin to move to homeland shortly.

All nations have been ejected in an encouraged move to homeland. This puppet shall stay behind, but all former WZAS members are encouraged to move to homeland, [region]Warzone Europe[/region] and endorse the provisional delegate.

Settlers may move in at a later time, but the members of Asiastate will always lay claim to it&#146;s legal rights in the house.
