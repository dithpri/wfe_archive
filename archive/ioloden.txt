It is the year 600 P.C., and the 4 great continents of Ioloden have recently come out of the Dark Ages. The people of Onath and their elite Knights quest to bring Onath to order while their court sorcerers and mages aid their rulers in guiding the masses into the future. The highly religious masses of Saudroris rebuild their once mighty armies with state of the art siege weapons, and monster storm troopers. The mighty northmen of Aegefus once again roam their lands, and tame the mighty beasts within their borders. The mysterious, and little known Obuneians finally are sailing the seas again and their unusual sleek ships are being spotted throughout Ioloden.
