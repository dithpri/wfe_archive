Welcome to The International Co Prosperity Sphere!

We are a Trade Bloc that promotes Business, Trade, Mutual Co Operation, and Prosperity.
To avoid Sanctions, Suspension from Polls or even Ejection from the Region you must comply by certain laws passed by the ICPS 

1) You MUST always take part In Democratic Elections and Polls organised by the Director-General.
2) All Nations have the right to Freedom of Religion and Government but all negotiations with other Nations and the ICPS as a whole must be Secular and Democratic.

New Laws are passed every week, so have your say on them and participate.

Yours Faithfully,

Director-General Ryan Harnell of the International Co-Prosperity Sphere
