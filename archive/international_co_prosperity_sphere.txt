Welcome to The International Co Prosperity Sphere!

We are a Trade Bloc that promotes Business, Secularism, and Prosperity.
To avoid Sanctions, Suspension from Polls or even Ejection from the Region you must comply by certain laws passed by the ICPS community.

1) All Nations have the right to Freedom of Religion and Government but all negotiations with other Nations and the ICPS as a whole must be Secular and Democratic.
2) All Nations must recognise and respect each other&amp;#39;s Faith, Sovereignty and Cultures.

Yours Faithfully,

Chairman Ryan Harnell of the New Prosperity Council
