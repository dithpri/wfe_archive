Welcome to the International Co-Prosperity Sphere, we are a Union which promotes equality, co-operation and prosperity.
  We follow 4 laws which are:

1.	All nations have the right to their own religion, opinions and Sovereignty and cannot be forced to change these. 
2.	Any nation can request to call a vote which doesn&#146;t contradict the previous law.
3.	All discussions, debates and negotiations with other ICPS nations and the ICPS as a whole must be democratic and civil.
4.	All inter-regional discussion must also remain civil and respectful and no offence should be caused.

Yours faithfully,
Chancellor of the ICPS, Jonathan Waddington of Der Einewahreland
