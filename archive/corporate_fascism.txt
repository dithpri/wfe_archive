It&amp;#39;s good to be home.

One may look at our region with confusion.  Some on the left and (shockingly) on the right even look upon us with fear and disdain.

If you want a longer explanation, the game won&amp;#39;t let us make one, so:

Corporate Fascism loves money and the tools (workers) and means (consumers/customers) who help us make money.  If you don&amp;#39;t like that, too bad, we&amp;#39;re here to stay.

As a wise man once said:  &amp;quot;Resources exist to be consumed.   And consumed they will be, if not by this generation then by some future...  Let us take what is ours, chew and eat our fill!&amp;quot;  Let that be our motto.
