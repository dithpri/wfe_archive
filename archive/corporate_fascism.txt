This user has to come clean.  He is a Communitarian who wished to conduct research on Corporatism and Fascism.  He has realized that he has opened a madhouse, and invites Socialists everywhere to help clean it.  

Debs once asked people to consider what workers could do for themselves.  Tom Lehrer once sang about people who would just sing The Internationale all day.  

Have NS Leftists done their fair share of volunteer work?  This user has done his own paltry share of volunteerism that doesn&amp;#39;t amount to much, but it&amp;#39;s something.

This user shall allow these Plutocrats to enjoy their remaining time here.  This account shall be left to rot, and Leftist forces are free to cleanse this mess.  The madhouse&amp;#39;s doors are hereby open.
