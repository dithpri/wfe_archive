
[color=red]PoFo Resolution 2 : Forum Membership[/color]

Unagia moves that the PoFo region be restricted to members of politicsforum.org, as is the case for the iirc channel (#PoFo), you will be expected to be a member of politicsforum.org and to make that identity known upon request, it could be taken as standard procedure to announce that identity voluntarily within one&amp;#39;s nation&amp;#39;s description. (We have no plan for enforcement, we await the sentiments of the region and we await a problem before we attempt to resolve it).

[b]If no one has any objections in the next few days it will be passed as our first constitutional resolution.[/b]

[hr]

[i]This region has no official connection to the politicsforum.org, nor should it be taken as representative of that forum&amp;#39;s members.[/i]
