Makrinesia is a geographic region bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the north and east, the Indian Ocean to the west, and the Southern Ocean to the south. It is comprised of several hundred islands that vary in size from small coral reefs which peek above the surface of the ocean to expansive subcontinents that stretch for hundreds of kilometres in all directions. The region&#39;s name is derived from the Greek words meaning &#39;distant&#39; and &#39;islands&#39;, and was applied by European explorers to visited the area in the seventeenth century.
