Makrinesia is a geographic region composed of more than two hundred islands scattered across the southern edge of the Pacific Ocean. The region&#146;s name is derived from the Greek words meaning &#145;distant&#146; and &#145;island&#146; and was created by Europeans who explored the area in the seventeenth century. Most of its islands are relatively small in size, though a few are regarded as small continents.
