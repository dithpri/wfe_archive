[color=gray][b]Nazareth[/b] or [b]Nasrath[/b] is the largest city in the North District of Israel. Nazareth is known as &amp;quot;the Arab capital of Israel&amp;quot;; the population is made up predominantly of Arab citizens of Israel, almost all of whom are either Muslim (69%) or Christian (30.9%). In the New Testament, the city is described as the childhood home of Jesus, and as such is a center of Christian pilgrimage, with many shrines commemorating biblical events. [b]-Wikipedia[/b][/color]
