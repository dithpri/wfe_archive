[b]Welcome love[/b] &amp;#9829;&amp;#65039; we are a true believer of Jesus alliance. Since this region was founded by a woman (Elfina), we believe wholeheartedly that babes in our savior Jesus Christ, need to be nurtured and guided. Although Elfina is the founder, the brothers in Christ are also in charge.
Thank you :3
