[b][color=FF0000]Welcome to [region]Puppet Imperium[/region]! This region is a place for me (and you if you like) to store random puppets. Use it as much as you like![/color][/b]

[b][color=000000]A thing to take note of:

- I have taken all the powers I can from the World Delegate position including Executive powers, so don&#39;t even think about it, [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. This is done for protection so if invaders come, they will have minimum power when they seize the Delegate postion. 
- That&#39;s pretty much it for now.
