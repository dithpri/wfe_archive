This Region was formed by getting Independence from Indianapolis. I welcome all.
I just formed this in 2020 so i had little time to make arrangements. if your a new commer,
I suggest you wait until your influence reaches hatch-ling before you get involved in international 
affairs. Also, you get warm welcome once you join the region. Share ideas, Thoughts and reviews on the chatboard. 

NOTE: You can only talk to the founder with the Permission from the Vice Minister. If he agrees go to the Minister of the Region. if he accepts, you can talk with me.
