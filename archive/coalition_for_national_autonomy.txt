We are founded to stand in opposition against the overreaches of the World Assembly delegations. We support these institutions, but they are used irresponsibly. We remain that as individual nations, we have the absolute right to maintain certain levels of autonomy. We will fight for more national control over military and domestic policies. Join us to fight for national autonomy!
