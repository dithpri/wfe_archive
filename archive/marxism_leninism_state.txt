Founded on the Principles of Marxism&#150;Leninism, the Marxism&#150;Leninism Alliance seeks to achieve universal atheism through the establishment of a communist society, with which religion would have &amp;quot;withered away&amp;quot;. It supports the creation of a single-party state; it rejects political pluralism external to communism, claiming that the proletariat need a single, able and unifying political party through which to represent themselves and exercise political leadership. Through the policy of democratic centralism, the communist party is the supreme political institution of the Marxist-Leninist state and is the prime legal force of societal organisation.
