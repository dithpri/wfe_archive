[i]The [url=http://www.imperialteutonicorder.com/id43.html]Germanic peoples[/url], united in the desire of peace and formation of our national tribes and homelands into one Reich, inspired with the will to serve the interests of integral nationalism in common faith and social order with respect to the individual Germanic nationalities of the Reich, have adopted the name and symbols of [region]The Germanic Reich[/region]

The purpose of the Reich State is to preserve and promote a community of human beings who are physically and spiritually kindred, each in their own Germanic State as the living organism of a people, and lead each people to a position of supreme liberty by the progressive development of the intellectual and cultural faculties.[/i][/color][/b]
