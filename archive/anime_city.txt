YAY! Anime City is once again free!

The meany face Black Riders will never step on this region again! YAY!

All the natives ceased to exist a long time ago. A cute nation named Kosang once lived here!

Maybe one day the founder will return to reclaim power and restore the region to it&amp;#39;s original cuteness. But for now Ozoi will be watching over it!  

Long live Kosang and Anime City! May the meanyface Black Riders fall off their horses looking all silly like!
