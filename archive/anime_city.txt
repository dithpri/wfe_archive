Do not believe the lies from other parties. There is only one founder in Anime City. Her name is Natalie, and she is just and kind - but firm. Pay tribute to her with your delegate vote, and you will find that your life is much easier. Cross her with heresy and ignominy and your time here in Anime City will be miserable and short. The choice is yours.
