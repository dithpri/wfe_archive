Welcome to the UCT, founded by the [nation=long]The Grob[/nation] to rival the regions which deem themselves &quot;technocratic&quot; but are, in reality, too scared to go out of their way to spread their ways.
We are different from many of the regions you will find here. If you are here expecting to find a region where you can sit down, relax, and do nothing willy nilly, then you are very, [i]very[/i] mistaken.
We are welcoming to all technocratic nations, and may our enlightened brethren find a way to enlighten the rest of the globe.

Our goal is to spread education, enlightenment, progressive ideals &amp; the strength of secularism to the rest to the universe. If you stand against one of us, you stand against all of us.
