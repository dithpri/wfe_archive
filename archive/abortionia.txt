Abortionia, a remote, vaguely fetus-shaped region, is a loose alliance of greatly varied nations. It is a land of great natural beauty, marred only by frequent coat hanger storms and marauding bands of Evangelical protestors (who have been known to set fire to themselves while attempting to burn regional leaders in effigy, creating the need for multinational &amp;quot;accidental cremation&amp;quot; cleanup crews). The nations of Abortionia typically have good relations with one another. However, their leaders are globally known for overreacting during diplomatic negotiations and throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. Tourism in Abortionia is almost unheard of due to the violent dumpling cartels which pervade the region.
