A collection of isles, with a major island in the center and smaller isles surrounding it make up this region. With dense forests covering many of the islands&amp;#39; inland, the denizens of the isles and visitors have dubbed it &amp;quot;the Gloomy Isles&amp;quot; as much of the land is covered in perpetual darkness.

From the shadows of the treeline there are many growing nations, taking a firm grasp on the resources the isles have to offer. While the isles hold many nations, each are to their own devices as they build their own navy to safeguard their trade routes.

War never changes.
