A wise man once said -

[i][b]I do not know the meaning of forever. [/b][/i]

And truly, forever is at its heart a representation of nothing - or as close as we can get to it. As to truly imagine something as intangible as infinity, you must be able to imagine something as tangible as nothing. They are interchangeable in our minds but not our hearts, they are the same bounds by logic. 

[i]Now we only know the meaning of what is. [/i]
