Capitalism is an economic system and an ideology based on the private ownership of the means of production and its operation for profit. The central features of this system include, in addition to private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system and competitive markets. In a market economy, decision-making and investment are determined by the owners of the factors of production in the financial and capital markets, while prices and distribution of goods are primarily determined by competition in the market.
