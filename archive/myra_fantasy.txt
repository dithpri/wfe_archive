The &quot;Projekt Myra&quot; is the idea to create a SharedWorld fantasy of many nationstates, cultures and dreams together, with an unlimited number of others*1  over an unlimited number of years*2. We do fantasy role-playing, LARP, storyytelling competitions and boardgames on this world. But most of all we do world-building. And challenging our nation states with the dilemmas presented here can help flesh out our cultures. (Non-players are welcome to the region as well). You can find &quot;Myra (Fantasy)&quot; on German de.Wikipedia and the world encyclopedia http://MyraPedia.eu at Wikia.
