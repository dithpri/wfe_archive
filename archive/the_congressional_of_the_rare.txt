The Congressional of the Rare is a community of Countries who have been brought together to grow, and prosper. We are Democratic countries that believe working together, not only united through gain, but  to make a stronger alliance with one another. We will protect the weak from danger, and be a beacon in the endless void. We welcome any country who wants to join us in this hard task of protecting the Democratic ways, and standing up against any foe.  

&amp;#10084;Rules&amp;#10084;:
---------------------
1. We ask that any individual only has three countries in the region at any time. 

2. We ask that you don&#39;t intentionally behave in a way that causes destruction to your country, or to the region.
