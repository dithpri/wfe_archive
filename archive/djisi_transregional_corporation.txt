The [b]Djisi Transregional Corporation[/b], owned by [nation]Djisland[/nation], refounds old regions under the direct control of the aforesaid nation via designated HQ states. These regions can be reclaimed if the previous owner wishes to do so. If not, then the regions will remain &#147;imperial&#148; territory of [nation]Djisland[/nation]. In short, the [b]DTC[/b] is the [i]informal empire of Djisland[/i], but we are willing to return regions to their old owners if reclaimed.
