&amp;#10014; Welcome to the ECCL! &amp;#128330;

We are sure glad you are here! 

We are a region that espouses Christianity, (Evangelical of course!), however, don&#39;t think you can&#39;t join because you aren&#39;t a Christian, because here, you are loved, no matter who you are. Our goal is to spread the love of our Lord, Jesus Christ. 

We know that all are sinners and deserve to go to Hell because of that, however, God came down as a man, Jesus Christ, and He never sinned, He then died on the cross for our sins and rose again, defeating death forever. 
In order to accept this most execellent gift of eternal life in Heaven, we must accept Jesus as our Lord (we must repent (turn from) our sins) and accept Him as our Savior.
