Calradia is a large planet filled with rolling plains, massive forests, deserts, and mountainous terrain. Despite it&amp;#39;s beauty, large city states have stayed isolated. In 1853, Vex Co. bent on control of the world secretly amassed an army and launched a surprise attack. The war lasted for 50 years ending with the creation of a world government and the utter destruction of several hundred cities in which billions were massacred.
