Calradia is a mineral rich island continent dotted with rolling plains, massive forests, deserts, and mountainous terrain. Despite it&amp;#39;s natural beauty, large tribal villages in the region have kept largely to themselves. In 1853, a rogue tribe bent on total control on the region secretly massed an army and launched a surprise attack. The war lasted for fifty years ending with the creation of a centralized Regional military and the utter destruction of several hundred tribal villages in which millions were massacred. Calradia has now started annexing lands from nearby landmasses.

The Universal Regional Currency for Calradia is the Calradian Credit
