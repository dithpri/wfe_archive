Calradia is an island continent dotted with rolling plains, massive forests, deserts, and mountainous terrain. Despite it&amp;#39;s beauty, large cities in the region have stayed isolated. In 1853, Vex Co. bent on control of the region secretly amassed an army and launched a surprise attack. The war lasted for 50 years ending with the creation of a regional government and the utter destruction of several hundred cities in which billions were massacred.
