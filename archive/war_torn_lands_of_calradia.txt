Calradia is a mineral rich region dotted with rolling plains, massive forests, deserts, and mountainous terrain. Despite it&amp;#39;s natural beauty, large tribal villages in the region have kept largely to themselves. In 1853, a rogue tribe bent on total control on the region secretly massed an army and launched a surprise attack. The war lasted for fifty years ending with the creation of a centralized Regional military and the utter destruction of several hundred tribal villages in which millions were massacred.
