    &amp;quot;Laa shay&amp;#39;a waqi&amp;#39;un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine. The wisdom of our Creed is revealed through these words.&amp;quot; 
    -Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli.

All Assassin&amp;#39;s Creed fans are welcome here, but this does not mean I restrict the region to just those who have played the games. This region is open to everyone who is willing to participate on the RMB. 

    &amp;quot;Our Creed does not command us to be free. It commands us to be wise.&amp;quot; 
    -Alta&iuml;r Ibn-La&amp;#39;Ahad.

And remember...nothing is true. Everything is permitted.
