Welcome Ravens, Here we will express the love of being a United Nations and bring peace among each other. Our army has a power so powerful that it just chants raven in the air of the battlefield. Together, We unite, We fight, We live. Join this collation and I trust that your country will be safe in the hands of the God of the Ravens!
