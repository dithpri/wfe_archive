The League of Allied Powers (LoAP) is a politico-military alliance founded in 1952. It seeks to defend its members from foreign aggression, providing a stable home for nations of all stripes. If you are lost, consider yourself found; if you are weary, consider yourself rested; if you are threatened, consider yourself safe. This is your home now, and democracy will be your shield.
