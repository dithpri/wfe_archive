The [b]C[/b]ohesive [b]A[/b]ssembly of [b]R[/b]egional [b]E[/b]ntities (also known somewhat informally as [b]C.A.R.E.[/b]) is a conglomerated union of assembled allied partners having absolutely no common interests or shared concepts. All of its members have developed extremely focused interests in their own personal development regardless of common needs, goals or ambitions.

The exact location of C.A.R.E. remains a mystery to most, although it is known it consists of a group of islands in a very large and empty ocean.
