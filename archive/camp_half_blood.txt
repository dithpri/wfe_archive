Camp Half-Blood is the safest place on earth for half-bloods like us, well unless you&amp;#39;re roman, then I suggest you go to California and find Camp Jupiter. Anyway, Since Mr.D&amp;#39;s time is up, our director is now Rebecca Walters, a daughter of Poseidon. I am camp scribe, Paige O&amp;#39;Larken. Good Luck Half-Bloods.
