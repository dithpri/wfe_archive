It&amp;#39;s been a while, hasn&amp;#39;t it?  The truth is, I am not Inaga.  That was only my alter ego for this region.  In reality, I am [nation=short]Redsward[/nation], who has settled in the East Pacific to begin a new life.  Timriirr is really [nation=short]Republic of Vietnam[/nation], the founder of [region=United Nations in Solidarity] (UNIS).  Roski Americans was a puppet of [nation=short]Roski[/nation], who currently resides in [region=Atlas].  Viet has been managing his region timidly, but hardly keeps in touch with his wartime allies.  Roski has lost our trust after he failed to coup UNIS.  I am now an aspiring WASC author, always trying to make the world a better place.  But I will never forget my time in Red Armor.  I am leaving &amp;quot;Inaga&amp;quot; to die, but his memories will live on in me.  Thank you, all of you.
