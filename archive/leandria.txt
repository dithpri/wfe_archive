Leandria was a uncolonized blissful world. After [nation]violencea[/nation] landed here that changed. Where [nation]Violencea[/nation] and [nation]Detytoviolencia[/nation] colonized at the opposite poles. ([nation]violencea[/nation] at that north. and [nation]Detytoviolencia[/nation] on the south.) the Environment started to slowy decay little by little. overall the environment around Leandrua is still amazingly good. with the exceptions of where its colonized.
