Leandria was a uncolonized blissful world. After [nation]violencea[/nation] landed here that changed. Where [nation]Violencea[/nation] and [nation]Detytoviolencia[/nation] colonized at the opposite poles. ([nation]violencea[/nation] at that north. and [nation]Detytoviolencia[/nation] on the south.) There is only two body&amp;#39;s of water on Leandria, The Small &amp;quot;Ocean of Kragith&amp;quot;, and the massive &amp;quot;Sea of Tarsus&amp;quot; which takes up 1/3 of the planet. The Southern Hemisphere of Leandria is Renowned for its Abundant natural Deposits of the Naturally Energy Producing Mineral Leandrium; which is used primarily in Weapons and Vehicles. And The Northern Hemisphere is Renowned for its unbelievably Nutritious grass.
