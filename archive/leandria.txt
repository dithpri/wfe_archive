Leandria was a uncolonized blissful world. After [nation]violencea[/nation] landed here that changed. Where [nation]Violencea[/nation] and [nation]Detytoviolencia[/nation] colonized at the opposite poles. ([nation]violencea[/nation] at that north. and [nation]Detytoviolencia[/nation] on the south.) the Environment started to slowy decay little by little. overall the environment around Leandra is still amazingly good. with the exceptions of where its colonized. Lately there has been tensions between the two major colonies. [nation]violencea[/nation] wishes for a peaceful solution. But [nation]Detytoviolencia[/nation] makes that look less and less likely as there uneasy companion ship comes to a close.
