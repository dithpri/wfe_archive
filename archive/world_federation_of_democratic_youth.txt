The World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) is a leftist youth organization, recognized by the United Nations as an international youth non-governmental organization. WFDY describes itself as an &quot;anti-imperialist, left-wing organisation. It was founded in London in 1945 as a broad international youth movement, organized in the context of the end of the Second World War with the aim of uniting youth from the Allied powers behind an anti-fascist platform that was broadly pro-peace, anti-nuclear war, expressing friendship between youth of the capitalist and socialist or so-called Eastern Bloc countries. The WFDY Headquarters are in Budapest, Hungary. The main event of WFDY is the World Festival of Youth and Students.
