The CFLC PM Alliance Region is a region that was constructed by the Republic of Carfeldlaichi and the Republic of Panda Maau in the aftermath of the war-torn battles against one another. Since then, the leaders have maintained peace using this alliance, and their governments strive to improve the daily lives of their citizens.

Since creation, the region is now home to other nations, including the Colony of Zane Insula, Basselland, and the Free Land of Fantasy Kingdom, all being very populated areas.
