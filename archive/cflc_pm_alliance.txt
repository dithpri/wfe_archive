The CFLC PM Alliance Region is made up of the Republic of Carfeldlaichi, and the Republic of Panda Maau. Together, we create a peaceful region with low crime rates and high standards for welfare and education, as well as excellent political freedoms and fiercely patriotic populations.

Since creation, the region is now home to three other nations; the Colony of Zane Insula, Basselland, and the Free Land of Fantasy Kingdom, all being very populated areas.
