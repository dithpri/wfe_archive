[b]The Nazi Worker League[/b] (NWL for short), is a region dedicated to National Socialist and Fascist values and promotes ethno-nationalism and the superiority of one&#39;s people.

Since the NWL is an up and coming region, anyone who joins has the chance to easily become a high-ranking official amongst the NWL, and we also advocate an open democracy regarding our WA delegate.

The NWL is friendly to newcomers and can offer a large range of support to fellow ethno-nationalists.
