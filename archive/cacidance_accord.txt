The Cacidance Accord (CA) is a politico-economic union of five member states. The Accord&#39;s origins dates back to the closing  of the Wintry Wars, a series of bloody conflicts engulfing the Federal Republic of Sentronia and the Kingdom of the United Behrlands. The Cacidance Treaty was  signed in the capital city of the United Behrlands, Cacidance, as a gesture of good faith between the former enemies. The Good Neighbor Treaty, as it will be called, put an end to the political strife between the two states and the rest of the continent. Eventually three more members joined the Accord. It has an estimated population of over 510 million.
