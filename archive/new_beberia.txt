[b][u]New Beberia ![/u][/b]

A small French-speaking community that fled the Moomin Valley after an illegal and disastrous invasion... 
We have a Discord to practice our semi-serious semi-fun RP.

We generally accept all embassy requests with a few exceptions.

For all requests to join the New Beberia region or the Discord server, please send a private message to the Founder or the WA Delegate.
