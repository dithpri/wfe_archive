An association of nations unified by geographical residence - these nations all co-exist within &quot;The Wasteland&quot;, a vast desert on the globe&#39;s southern hemisphere. Most of these nations are centralised around sparse oases; fertile areas in an otherwise unforgiving and inhospitable region. This centralisation of states &amp; subsequent competition for resources has sparked both conflict &amp; collaboration in the past, but recently the majority of nations have developed close ties &amp; commonly work together for the betterment of all Wasteland sovereignties. Only time will tell whether this fragile alliance can last.
