An association of nations unified by &quot;The Wasteland&quot;, a vast desert on the globe&#39;s southern hemisphere, with nearly all states centralised around sparse oases. This has caused intense competition for resources, sparking both conflict &amp; collaboration in the past. Recently, however, these nations have developed close ties &amp; commonly work together for the betterment of all in the region. Only time will tell whether this fragile alliance can last.
