The [region]Wallace Line[/region] is an empirical line drawn in 1859 by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, which separates the Southeast Asian and Australian flora and fauna from each other. West of the line is more Asian and East of the line is more Australasian. Wallace noticed this clear division in species during his travels through the East Indies in the 19th century.

The Line passes between some islands in Indonesia and the Philippines. The complex biogeography of the Indo-Australian Archipelago is a result of its location at the merging point of four major tectonic plates, and also reflects the effects of past fluctuations in sea levels. 

This region supports efforts to preserve the endangered species on our planet.
