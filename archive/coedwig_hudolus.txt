Welcome to this part of the enchanted Forest, I see that you are Seekers of Home? Well, while I am good friends with Lady Nimue of the lake, my old age has taken its toll. I am not really in the mood for going on a journey with you. I can however tell you that there is a species under my protection that will be able to help you. 
But what fun would it be to just tell you who it is? I&#146;ll give you a riddle instead: 
You shall seek those who swim in the ponds and speak the language of music 
Those who laugh with the sound of silvery bells
And weep with the winds,
Find the daughters of Water and Song
