The Empire of the United Harrowstormlands is the collection of kingdoms, fiefdoms and lordships under the sovereignty of the Emperors of the United Harrowstormlands. The Empire is semi-feudal in nature, with power being concentrated at the top, rather than the bottom of the hierarchy, thus holdership of a given fief is solely dependent on the will of the Emperor.
