The Multiverse is the near-infinite number of different planes. Nobody really knows how many planes there truly are. Urza for one believed that there is a finite number of planes, merely more than can ever be counted in the combined lifetime of every being in existence. However another source notes that the multiverse is &quot;boundless&quot;.
