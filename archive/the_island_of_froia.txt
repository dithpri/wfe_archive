This is a newly found island in the year 2024 a delegate of the world assembly sent a total of 15 million people which split into three founding nations Frocia, The People&#39;s Republic of Frocia, and Forcia. These three eventually worked together to make this island a great place to live. Although expeditions into the south side of what is thought to be a island have been done none have been successful in mapping whether this is a continent or island. The scientific research has been done mainly by Frocia whose ships broke down before reaching the antarctic circle due to large chunks of sea ice drifting northwards due to winter winds.
