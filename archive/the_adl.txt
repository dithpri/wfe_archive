Here&amp;#39;s what happened.

After the Jewish Justice League captured and refounded [region]Anti Defamation League[/region] from the forces of hate who created that region to make a mockery of civilized humanity, they created this one so they could continue making a mockery of justice here. So, after some time, we just captured this one from them.

Just another day at the office for the JJL. Sorry, Nazis.
