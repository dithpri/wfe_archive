Captured from neo-Nazis by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] on behalf of the [region]Jewish Justice League[/region] :)

[hr]Thank you very much, [nation=short]BlackGreenWhite[/nation]. Again, we owe you a debt of gratitude. And be &amp;quot;we,&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t just mean the world&amp;#39;s Jewish people, but all the people in the world who are committed to justice.

Here&amp;#39;s what happened.
After the [b][region]Jewish Justice League[/region][/b] captured and refounded [b][region]Anti Defamation League[/region][/b] from the forces of hate who created that region to make a mockery of civilized humanity, they created this one so they could continue making a mockery of justice here. So, after some time, we just captured this one from them.
Just another day at the office for the JJL. Sorry, Nazis.
