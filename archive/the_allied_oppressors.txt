We are the Allied Oppressors: the region where dictatorships and oppressors unite as one to form the ultimate army against the petty democracies and free lands. Even if you are not a dictatorship, we are not advocates of despotism and will not control how you run your own nation. If you are a World Assembly member, remember to endorse Rakushun and the WA Delegate of our region and we will be sure to endorse you back. If we forget, send the Panel a telegram and we will endorse you.
