In honour of my favourite television show, I now found this region. 

The Old Man, Starbuck, Apollo, Colonel Tigh, 6, The President, Helo and on and on, great characters for a great show.

BSG fans feel to join. I have no grandiose plans for the region but feel free to make yourselves home aboard The Battlestar Galactica and discuss any show related stuff you wish.
