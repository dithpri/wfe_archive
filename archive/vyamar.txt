This modestly-sized continent stretches across several climate regions. The continent sits close to the edge of a tectonic plate; the Eastern part of the land is separated by a small mountainous ridge. Vyamar has no volcanoes, and earthquakes are very rare and very weak. The seas surrounding Vyamar are generally calm.
