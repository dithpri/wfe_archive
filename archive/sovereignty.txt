[color=d87e5c][b]Sovereignty[/b][/color] is a region for nations who wish to advance [b]National Sovereignty[/b], an idea which means that each nation should instead decide economic and social issues which will not any have impact beyond its borders, rather than expecting the World Assembly to create one-size-fits-all economic and social policies.

Our region is organized as a Coalition of member nations who agree in some way with the cause.  Our region may form a government to represent the cause internationally, but said government will not violate the sovereignty of member nations.
