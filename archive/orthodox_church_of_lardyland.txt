A separation from the traditional Church of Lardyland. Orthodox Lardianism puts more of a focus on the Lardy deity Lolios, and portrays Captain Lard as an earthly manifestation of said deity. 

The hierarchy of the Church has been established, and several crusades have been concluded.

Many crusading nations have CTE&#39;d, leaving us with only the Holy Land and [region]New Andraxia[/region]. Efforts are underway to rejuvenate the crusading zeal in [region]Lardyland[/region].
