Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen.

For those of you who do not know us, we are NWO. Some of have said that our halcyon days have passed. This is simply not true.

Consider these dark times the entr&amp;#39;acte in an opera whose strength and power transcend the slovenly aspects of the temporal. 
Rest assured, mes amis, the magnus opus of the New World Order shall soon commence.

If you listen carefully, the drums of war have already begun to play their part.

We are waiting.

We are watching.

Yours sincerely,
