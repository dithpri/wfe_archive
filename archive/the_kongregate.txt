Yes, you heard it right, it&#39;s The Kongregate.
[hr] At 03.01.2021 here was an invasion made by [nation]Six Gumdrop[/nation](oh, he is dead now, great.) and turned this region in an advertisement of [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. He also scheduled opening embassies with [region]Plum Island[/region], [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]Frozen Circle[/region], and closure of all at the moment existing embassies.

And at 30.01.2021 they attacked us once again. Now, with an army of alts(7 nations), at 06.02.2021 he turned this place in advertisement [region]Plum Island[/region] by opening embassy with them, changed the flag and description, and closed previous embassies. Again. From 7th of February, this region became locked. So, only you, reading this, and me are left here.
