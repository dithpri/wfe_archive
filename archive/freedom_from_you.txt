we represent in the name of freedom.

we reason that the natural dictates one part of truth, while our ability to discern complex benefits or impairments to self and society as a whole is another aspect of truth.

Truth as a whole is the moral and natural good that produces true freedom.

We believe that without confinement to a set structure, true freedom can not exist.

Therefore we rely on nature to teach truth and freedoms not only for our moral rights and freedoms, but rights and freedoms physically guaranteed to humanity by nature itself.

We believe nature itself testifies of a Creator.

We believe that natural laws should be the basis on which we create our inspired laws.
