We are the Right Sektor. We are a confederation of nations that have a common goal of prosperity, peace, and the propulsion of Far-Right ideals.

Any member nation is welcome to share in these goals, as long as they remain a Right-Wing nation. 

Our Regional Security Coalition, or the RSC, is a volunteer international intraregional security force, made up of military forces from member nations.

Any member nation is protected under the alliance. Any military action against a member nation will be met with military action.

Leftism is not permitted. Any leftist nations will be sanctioned and eventually banned if their ways don&#39;t change.
