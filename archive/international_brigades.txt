The [b]International Brigades[/b] were paramilitary units set up by the Communist International to assist the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. The organisation existed for two years, from 1936 until 1938. It is estimated that during the entire war, between 32,000 and 35,000 members served in the International Brigades, including 15,000 who died in combat; however, there was never more than 20,000 brigade members present on the front line at one time. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
