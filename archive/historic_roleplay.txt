[b]HISTORIC ROLEPLAY[/b]

[i]Humble beginnings[/i]

Founded on the 7th of April in 2018, Historic Roleplay is a fresh region focused on quality roleplay and entertaining historical, political and other discussion while also providing players with gaming opportunities.

Players of all traits are welcome as long as the rules are respected and contribution to the regional experience is made through roleplay or other casual activities.

The roleplay is based on an alternate timeline set in the 20th century where empires, republics and many other nation states face eachother on finer or worse terms; the options have no limit but a players imagination and effort.
