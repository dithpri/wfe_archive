Sector 7 is a black-inked zone on most global maps, known only to those who were born there, exiled there, or escaped by miracle or madness. Officially listed as an &quot;experimental governance cluster,&quot; Sector 7 is, in truth, a closed-circuit dystopia ruled by a theatrical, tyrannical shadow regime known as The Court of Jesters.
