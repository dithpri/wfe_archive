[i]&quot;Hello, and welcome to the [region]Gamer Clan[/region]&quot;[/i]

Please, no girls. That is our #1 Rule. 
What is the most oppressed group of people in the world? Gamers. 
Women, Boomers, and Media all alike oppress gamers as if they were troglodytes

Make sure you remember to go to bed before 8 or mom will get mad.
Please no swearing my mom looks at my computer


(This is all just a joke ^)

But really, welcome to the gamers. We accept everyone and anyone.
Make sure to have fun!
