[b][u]HELLO AND WELCOME TO EUROS 2020![/b][/u]

A geopolitical simulation, based in a real world earth map. 

[b]How this works:[/b]
Each nation will grow by [b]2 provinces per day[/b].
Once a nation occupies at least one sea province, it may form a colony.
Colonies are formed by forgoing localized expansion for a period of [b]72 hours[/b].
At the end of that period, another coastal province, (far away and of your choice) will raise the flag of your Empire.
From that point colonies can expand as the home region, progressively overtime. 

More information on warfare mechanics and AI behaviors can be found in subsequent regional factbooks.

If you have any questions, or expansion requests, please contact [nation]Sommaire[/nation].
