[b]In Norse mythology, Vigrid or V&iacute;gr&iacute;&eth;r or &Oacute;sk&oacute;pnir is a large field foretold to host a battle between the forces of the gods and the forces of Surtr as part of the events of Ragnar&ouml;k. The field is where the two forces will battle foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn.[/b]
