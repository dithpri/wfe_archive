[b]In Norse mythology, Vigrid or V&iacute;gr&iacute;&eth;r or &Oacute;sk&oacute;pnir is a large field foretold to host a battle between the forces of the gods and the forces of Surtr as part of the events of Ragnar&ouml;k. The field is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The Poetic Edda briefly mentions the field as where the two forces will battle, whereas the Prose Edda features a fuller account, foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn.[/b]
