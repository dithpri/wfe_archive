The [color=D81919]Germanische Vereinigung[/color], or, in English, the Germanic Federation, is a loose federation of Germanic nations. This includes Dutch, Swiss, and, but to a much more limited extent, the Danish. The Germanic Federation will only allow Parliamentary Monarchies and other forms of Democratic nations to join.
