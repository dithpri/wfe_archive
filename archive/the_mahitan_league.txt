The Mahitan League is a region of powerful nations that work together to develop policy and alliances.  We are an invitation region, and nations can only enter if invited.  There are many nations of different policies here.  However, we demand that nations treat their people fairly, and encourage them to adopt European Socialism/capitalism policies that will help citizens.
