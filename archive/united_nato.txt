I WILL HELP AL......

What is love?
Baby, don&#39;t hurt me
Don&#39;t hurt me, no more
Baby, don&#39;t hurt me
Don&#39;t hurt me, no more
What is love? Yeah-yeah
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
No, I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re not there
I give you my love, but you don&#39;t care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign

[Chorus]
What is love?
Oh, baby, don&#39;t hurt me
Don&#39;t hurt me, no more
What is love?
Oh, baby, don&#39;t hurt me
Don&#39;t hurt me, no more

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-woah-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woah, uh-huh
Woah-woah-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woah, uh-huh
