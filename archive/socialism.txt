[i][color=red]The people&amp;#39;s flag is deepest red,
It shrouded oft our martyred dead,
And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold,
Their hearts&amp;#39; blood dyed its every fold.

(chorus)
Then raise the scarlet standard high.
Within its shade we live and die,
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,
We&amp;#39;ll keep the red flag flying here.[/i][/color]
