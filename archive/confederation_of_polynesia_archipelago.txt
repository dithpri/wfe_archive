Welcoming independent nation-states that want to remain in neutrality. In 1845, the Kingdom and other Polynesian states wanted to create a neutral regional group because of the ongoing international conflicts due to war and imperialism. The Confederation of Polynesian Archipelago allow nations to become part of a &amp;quot;free and safe&amp;quot; zone from imperial influence. The Polynesia Archipelago adopted the Confederation system of government because it allows nation-states to leave the confederation and allow states to remain independent and free.
