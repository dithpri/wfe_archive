&amp;quot;Repent, for the great lice-brush approacheth! Let no man or woman bare any hair or stubble upon thy face, lest thou knowest the wrath of the Great Bearded One!&amp;quot; -- The Right Bloody Reverend Billy Bob Kavendula

&amp;quot;The universe is in fact nothing more than a collection of tightly knotted cosmic temporal/spacial threads, extending outwardly from the Big Bang... what could be called a &amp;#39;Cosmic Beard&amp;#39; of sorts. Of course, the concept of &amp;#39;beard&amp;#39; is entirely arbitrary, we do not suggest that the beard belongs to anyone. The term &amp;#39;cosmic bodyless face-wig&amp;#39; would be more appropriate, although my colleagues do not agree.&amp;quot; -- Dr. Poppler Thundergrass, P.h.D.

&amp;quot;No comment.&amp;quot;-- The Great Bearded One
