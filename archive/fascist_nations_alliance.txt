[color=red]This former Nazi/Fascist region, founded by [nation=Nordic Saxony], founder of [region]Axis Nations Alliance[/region], originally captured by [region]The Red Fleet[/region], has now been entrusted to the mighty Anti-Nazi/Fascist Warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]

[color=purple]We are [region]ANTIFA[/region] and we are everywhere!
