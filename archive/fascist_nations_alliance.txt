[b]Another Fash region blown out of the water by [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=the_red_fleet][u][color=red]THE RED FLEET![/color][/u][/url]

This region was founded by [nation=Nordic Saxony], founder of [region]Axis Nations Alliance[/region], after he returned following the occupation of ANA by ANTIFA troops for over a month - so naturally upon his return he created a [i]new[/i] region that lasted just two days instead of kicking ANTIFA troops out of the region - and then left his new region vacant.

This made way for [color=red]The Nautical Brothers and Sisters of The Red Fleet[/color], under whose capable guardianship this region will stand as a memorial to Comrade La Pasionaria.
