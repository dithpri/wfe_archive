The Duxian Islands, only a few years ago were united under the UDI treaty between Sarxland and Toddlandia. However since then political and military aggressiveness from Aracion caused Sarxland and many others to leave the UDI in resentment.
Since then other nations on nearby islands have joined under the banner of Duxism. The old treaties which although do not prevent war, allow the nations to trade much more freely without Aracion&amp;#39;s iron fist on what and where trade could be.
The Islands oceans however, without the United Duxist Military to keep the peace have become stained with blood as warlords try to usurp current regimes and take control of their island homes.
It takes a strong nation to survive in the Duxian Islands.
