To all nations who hear this message:

The Shadowfall Alliance has fallen. Enemies of the Alliance have broken through our defenses and many have turned on eachother. We are no more. But do not give up, for in this Darkness we face the Light will yet break through, but we will operate in the Shadow as it falls, for we are the Shadowfall. Do not give up, do not give in. This region will be abandoned but others may yet take its mantle, and they will be Shadowfall.
