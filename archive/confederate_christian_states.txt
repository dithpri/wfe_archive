THE CONFEDERATE CHRISTIAN STATES (CCS) is a union of sovereign countries, united for purposes of common in relation to other states.
Our region is ruled by a similar system of the Confederate State of America where any country has a own law and is independent from others countries, but still we fight and protect each other from our enemies.
Our law is the law of GOD, and our enemies are those that do not have any respect for God and his holy and mighty word. We want to live in peace but we oppose ourselves to any LGBT, HERETIC (such catholics), PAGAN (such muslims), IDOLATER, AND ATHEIST COUNTRY.
We know that the strength is not made by the numbers, but it is come from God, who is our ROCK AND PROTECTOR.
