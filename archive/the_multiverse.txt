The multiverse is an infinite number of parallel universes. The Alpha and Omega - Beginning to End, there has always been the Multiverse and always will be.

Together, these parallel universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. 

The different universes within the multiverse are called &quot;parallel universes&quot;, &quot;other universes&quot;, &quot;alternate universes&quot;, or &quot;many worlds&quot; and in some of these parallel universes, components of The Multiverse are called &quot;Nationstates&quot;
