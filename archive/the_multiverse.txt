[b]Since the beginning until the end. There is only the Multiverse. The Alpha and Omega. [/b]

The multiverse is an infinite number of multiple universes and contains all that there ever was, all that there will ever be. 

Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. 

The different universes within the multiverse are called &quot;parallel universes&quot;, &quot;other universes&quot;, &quot;alternate universes&quot;, or &quot;many worlds&quot; and in some realities, the universes are actually called  &quot;Nationstates&quot;.
