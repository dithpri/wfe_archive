Kailelenana is a nation that, despite World Assembly lies, is a benevolent dictatorship, there is free speech (expect for Nazis), freedom of religious belief, freedom to organize, freedom to criticize the dictator/government etc. Just no criticizing the warriors and the dictator&amp;#39;s decision on war and the dictator has absolute power.
