A large floating island, which is somehow kept magnetically floating clockwise to the Earth&amp;#39;s counter-clockwise turn, was found by the [nation]The Elemental Nations[/nation], who were looking for a home. And so, they christened it &amp;#39;Inner Haven&amp;#39;! Lush forests, clean lakes and more are living in the valleys and plains. The mountains are filled to the brim with valuable ore and gems, and many animals unknown to the world live here. Please keep the enviroment in mind when settling here! This region shares a healthy relationship with their new-found allies [region]The Badlands[/region], whom had recently merged into &amp;#39;Inner Haven&amp;#39;.
