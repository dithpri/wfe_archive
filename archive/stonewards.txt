Those who join the Stonewards generally subscribe to a philosophy of team dynamics, on learning to work with others, and on being there for those who need them. The core tenet of the order is be there when needed. They seek to take a difficult situation with few resources and make something better of it. The order strives to exemplify resolve, strength, and dependability. They tend to attract those who are most interested in warfare, prowess with weapons, or athletics of any sort.
