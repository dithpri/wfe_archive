This region is being carefully evacuated, and more has been explained in the telegram I sent out. Please move back to [region]the Union of Democratic States[/region]. Your services are greatly appreciated! You have all remained faithful to our cause, and you are great fighting nations. The government needs to evacuate this region. Because I am not physically in this region, it remains a risk to security. So We need to refound with a puppet. You can all go back to the UDS. You&#39;ve all been great and you have worked hard! Please move as quickly as possible, to make the transition as easy and painless as possible.
