Welcome to [color=blue]The Free Region![/color], the region filled with the numerous graves of the nations who once dwelled here in this barren land. 

Here in [color=blue]The Free Region[/color] you can admire the total silence, the empty halls that were once filled with banter, the oceans and fields once teeming with live, and the massive hole in the ground we delivered unto ourselves. 

You may look on from behind the razor-wire fence, for this region is a husk of it&amp;#39;s former self and forever will be. It shall remain closed indefinitely, because irony is the most delicious memorial of all.
