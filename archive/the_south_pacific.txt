[i][color=#C6930A]This is [B]Coup Tuesday[/B]. From now on each Tuesday will feature a special WFE that might or might resemble that of a coup or anything else that I find interesting. Those who take it as a real coup or fail to have fun during the day will be summarily ejected. Today [B]the Montresors[/B], my NS family, will take over the South Pacific and change it for its dark and twisted motives![/color][/i]
