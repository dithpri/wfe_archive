As Delegate of TSP, I fully support the mass TG sent by  [nation]Hileville[/nation] which clarifies recent events.  Hile welcomed me when I first entered TSP and I will always remember how kind and helpful he was to a newbie. 

So far Hile has spent over $600 of his personal funds on our forums and this is an unfair burden to place on one member.  We appreciate his generosity and his assistance in helping us transition to another forum on a slower timeline that will give us time to adjust.
