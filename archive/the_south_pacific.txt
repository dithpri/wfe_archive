[b][color=#bc0000]The South Pacific[/color][/b] marches forward as we attempt to [b][color=#cfad18]free ourselves from the shackles of oppression[/color][/b] that the tyrannical oligarchy has strangled the masses with for far too long. The proletariat has been held hostage by those whom control the means of production: oligarchs who have lopsided &amp;quot;influence&amp;quot;. It is time for us to fight for our beliefs and reject this tool of oppression. [b][color=#bc0000]This is a protest.[/color][/b]

During our harmonious transition period, [b][color=#bc0000]everyone should endorse [nation=short]Milograd[/nation].[/color][/b]

[u][b]Note:[/b][/u] I will not be suppressing any posts on the RMB. Feel free to speak your mind about our government freely and truthfully.
[hr]I must thank [nation=short]Solm[/nation] for his contributions to inspiring and planning this. Without him, this wouldn&amp;#39;t have been possible.
