[b][color=navy]Dear TSpers, [u]there is no coup.[/u]

Hileville is an outstanding member of the TSP community. He has hosted the forums and paid out of his own pocket to keep them running smoothly for TSpers to enjoy.  He has been delegate of this region and done a fine job.

I do not approve of baseless character assassinations against a valued member of our community.
