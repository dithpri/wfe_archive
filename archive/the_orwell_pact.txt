An economic co-prosperity and mutual defense pact among democratic socialist states. Our core values are nonaggression, equality, and civil liberty.

We do not currently have any regional activities but you are welcome to join if you like. Member states that do not practice some form of democracy and some sort of socialism, or are not governed consistently with our core values, will be removed.
