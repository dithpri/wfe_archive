In fond memory of the late region [i]The Ancient Empires of the World[/i].

[nation=short]Levethian[/nation] resides here as a global observer, watching and waiting. My work continues elsewhere via my primary nation, the progress careful and the spirits high.

And from here, we shall see what comes with the days, the weeks, the months, and the years.

We think, we fight, we try, and we work, waiting to become the hammer or the anvil, success or failure, champion or martyr, victor or victis. 

Until the end,
[nation]Levethian[/nation]
