Several hundred years before 
A gambler and a monk embarked 
On a long trek through the endless prairies of the North 
They had a fierce debate 
About God and chance and fate 
and to resolve it agreed a game of cards indeed be played 

The game went on all day 
And through the next and next they played 
And around them a shelter was built to shield the rain 
A street around the shelter formed 
Then a church, a house, a bar 
And that is how the city of New Albion was born.
