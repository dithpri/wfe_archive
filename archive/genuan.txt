[color=green][B]The bastion of rebellion against [nation]Borduriaa[/nation] occupation of [region]Genuan Rebirth[/region] and the staging point for the conspiracy to topple Bordurian rule in GR,  [region]Genuan[/region] is now conquered by Bordurin forces.
Borduriaa shall not tolerate any dissent.[/B][/color]
We would like to remind that the legitimate ownership of [region]Genuan Rebirth[/region] belongs to [nation]Borduriaa[/nation].
The takeover of GR foundership was through deceit and lies and is condemnable. 

We urge the return of GR to the legitimate control of [B][region]Pax Imperium[/region][/B] --capital of [region]The Bordurian Empire[/region].
