COSITRIAN ATLANTIC REGION

Located on the coast of the Atlantic, the Cositrian Atlantic Region is home to the Federal Republic of New Cositri, a nation composed of 28 united states. The region contains the Atlantic Coast, the Cositri Mountains, and many, many, rivers, lakes, ponds, and other natural areas. Crops, especially corn, wheat, soy, and other agricultural products are native, as well as apples, cherries, and many more fruits. The elusive Golden Eagle soars the skies here, and can typically be seen flying through the majestic skies. The climate is typically warm during spring and summer, but can become frigid and snow during the winter.
