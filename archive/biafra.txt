Welcome to [b]Biafra[/b], a friendly and peace-loving African region! You are free to visit, join us, or pass through. 

Land of the rising sun, we love and cherish,
Beloved homeland of our brave heroes;
We must defend our lives or we shall perish,
We shall protect our hearts from all our foes;
But if the price is death for all we hold dear,
Then let us die without a shred of fear.
