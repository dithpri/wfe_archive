A tower in the middle of a desert calls your attention!

Out of curiosity, you enter through its old doors. You are surprised to find out that the doors are not locked.

Just a million shelves. Shelves filled with books, scrolls, and other print materials. Shelves that serve as a repository of knowledge!
