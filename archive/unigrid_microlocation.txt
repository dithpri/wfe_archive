
The [i]UniGrid Microlocation[/i] is a tiny space-time &#39;bubble&#39; located inside of a subspace singularity. Thus the [i]UniGrid Microlocation[/i] is extremely inaccessible even for advanced space-faring civilizations.

The [i]UniGrid Microlocation[/i] is (mostly) controled by [b][nation=noflag]the Sapiens Empire[/nation][/b] although some [b]Khralean[/b] presence remains.
