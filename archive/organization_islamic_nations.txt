[b]REFOUNDED BY THE SISTERHOOD OF MUSLIM NATIONS, FEB. 11, 2014.[/b]

The original founder, [nation]Bosnia-and-Herzegovina[/nation], was a good guy and we bore him no ill will, but he ceased to exist one too many times, thus demonstrating lack of competence to be a regional administrator, and this region is too important to leave its defense to someone less than fully competent.
That will no longer be a problem in the refounded [region]Organization Islamic Nations[/region], now under the protection of [region]the Sisterhood of Muslim Nations[/region].

Anyone interested in joining, please telegram the founder.

Thank you very much, and Praise Sisterhood.
