As sea levels continue to rise, a group of independent islands have formed an alliance to combat the environmental concerns threatening their existence.

Their aim, a world where public transport takes precedence, where the air is clean, the streets are safe, and the seas free of plastic and toxic waste. Where nuclear science is left to engineers and radiologists, not the military or greedy energy corporations, and pizza boxes are disposed of responsibly.

Aims:
No cars
No guns
No WMDs
Cannabis legal

Region Values:
Environmental Beauty
Eco-Friendliness
Tourism
Pacifism

You do not need to follow every aim or value to be welcome in this region, but member nations must show humanity and a general respect for the planet.
