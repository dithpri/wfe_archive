Founded by the Grand Duchy of Stargon, Rhinebergia is a feudal region led by a council of several nations with different influence. The hierarchy seems strikt and the rulers power is absolute, but it also leaves much freedom to the aristocratic leaders how to treat their people. Rhinebergians like to say: &quot;Pay your tax, pay your respect and recieve a bright future.&quot;
