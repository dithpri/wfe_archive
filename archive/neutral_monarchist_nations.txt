This is the NMN. Our region consists of six independent countries and two robust empires, and all of our members have their own monarchist governments (except there&#39;s one republic because reasons). Although our nations display very distinctive cultures and ideologies, they all follow a policy of neutrality and isolation regarding other regions.
We don&#39;t disturb and we don&#39;t like to be disturbed.
We&#39;re are proud to have a world of our own.
