All leaders will bend the knee to our great and mighty leader [b]Supreme General Harambe the Conqueror[/b]. All your incomes will be subject to taxation by our Supreme General, and troops may be levied from your populace as necessary. [u]Any actions made in opposition to the doctrines of our Supreme General by any member may leave them subject to eradication from this region.[/u] As we say in Obeynia, [b]&quot;Obey or Die!&quot;[/b]
