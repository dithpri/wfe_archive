&amp;#127787;&amp;#65039; Varyne Veil
Hidden beyond mortal sight, Varyne&#146;s Veil is a realm of mist, magic, and quiet divinity. Formed by the ascended heroine Varyne after the Great Shattering, it stands as a sanctuary of light amid encroaching darkness.
At its heart lies Aeralis, the Sanctum of balance and knowledge.
Its banner bears a silver veil on midnight blue &#151; a symbol of hope eternal.
