[b][u]Overview and Description[/u][/b]

[region]TPOE[/region] (The Price of Empire) is an RP region set in Mina, a re-imagining of Earth. Though Mina is a re-imagining and there will be many similarities and just as many differences. 
Things like politics, religion, race, culture, ethnicity, language, etc. may differ and may also be similar if not the same. We use Nationstates for our countries but do not use most NS stats. We use Men of War Assault Squad 2 for military and war related gameplay. We may at some point also create a discord server if we grow enough.
