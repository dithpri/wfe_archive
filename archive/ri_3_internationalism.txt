Nestled within the grand continent of Aurion, our region is a diverse land of competing interests, national pride, and ambitious leaders. The nations exist within a delicate balance of power, where diplomacy, trade, and conflict shape the future of civilization. Here, you will engage in negotiations, form alliances, manage your economy, and debate global challenges.

But be warned! The choices you make today will have consequences tomorrow. Will you be a champion of peace or a master of strategy? A defender of the weak or a ruthless empire-builder? The fate of your nation is in your hands.
