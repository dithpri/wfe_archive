The Alternative Alliance is a new, democratic region, that I invite anyone to join.  To request an invite, telegram me to request the regional passcode.  Before I open this region to the public, here are a few things that must be accomplished:

1.) A Strong, well-established World Assembly Delegate
2.) At least two established political parties with differing political ideals.
3.) Officers for the following positions: At least ONE democratically decided candidate for WA Delegate PER party, Lead Diplomat, Lead Poll and Voting manager, &amp;#9745;&amp;#65039;Supreme Court Justice, Lawmaking officials, etc. 
4.) Possibility for an offsite forum and chat, let me know if you guys are interested
5.) A decided upon constitution
