[b]Hello and welcome to Erchion![/b]

We are a science fiction themed roleplay region based upon an original universe.

Set primarily in what is currently known simply as &quot;The Cluster,&quot; civilizations mechanical, biological, and somewhere in between all ascend to the stars in their variety of forms and ideologies to carve out their place in the vast universe, unsure of what all could be out to challenge their respective destinies.

For those interested, please direct questions to our regional administration members and join our [url=https://discord.gg/RfPSvhZpCb][b]Discord[/b][/url]!
