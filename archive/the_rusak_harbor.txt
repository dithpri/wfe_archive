The Rusak harbor used to be abandoned. Now, since pirates showed up (which is the Rusaks) came in and rebuilt it and claimed it a region. It is the homeland for the Rusak pirate ship which travels through foreign seas. The Harbor is fairly big. But not enough to make the other nations welcome without permission.
