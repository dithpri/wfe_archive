This is Ridda, a region for map role-play. We are tolerant but not to any high extent.

When role-playing we use a website called NSEconomy to get facts about our nations with which we role-play on to set boundaries. The URL for this website is here: [b][u]http://www.broomdces.com/nseconomy/[/u][/b]

For population use when using NSEconomy for example military numbers you are required to remove three zeroes from the numbers.

One week real time = one year role-play.

A high council has been made consisting of [nation]Mandalorya[/nation], [nation]Thason[/nation] and [nation]Immomoria[/nation]. These nations will administer and create rules for role-play.
