You step forth into the Capital of the Empire, buildings tower over you and beautiful architecture surrounds you. You look to the center of the city and see a giant Cathedral with a Cross high up in the sky. The Cathedral is placed high on the highest hill in the city. As you reach the palace the large wooden and metal doors are opened by multiple guards armed with spears. They let you pass after you show them your invitation from the Emperor.
