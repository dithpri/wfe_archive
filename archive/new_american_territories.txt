After Years of rebelling in North America, the county of the United States split into two - West and East - But not only did America turn against itself, but so did Mexico and Vancouver Island as well. After years of war, The area between West and East America became known as the Borderlands, and people sought out to claim that land as an independent anarchist nation. Soon after, The old area of Texas thought it would be best to establish their own territory and are in the same place and live in the same way as before, but the only difference in that it it twice as big, but still in the exact same shape. There is still no word on Canada because no one thought they were important enough to be included into the New American Territories.
