The European Soviets, also known as the former Soviet Union, are the nations that emerged and re-emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics following its breakup in 1991. 

The First Nation to join the European Soviets was the Federation of Ukallingrad in 2021 - claiming continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1991. 

All members will also join the European Union and gain NATO membership.
