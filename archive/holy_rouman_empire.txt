Founded in A.D. 1600, The Holy Rouman Empire was created in lieu of the secession from the previous region. Hoping to give the world a taste of the culture and beauty they hold dear, the Roumans began conquest of surrounding nations. Flying their flag, these nations became subsidiaries of the Holy Rouman Empire, prideful of the might they inherited. Governed with an iron fist, this empire came to power in 1625 under the Christian religion and remains so in the current year 1632.
