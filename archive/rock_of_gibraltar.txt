The [b]Rock of Gibraltar[/b] is a monolithic limestone promontory located in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, off the southwestern tip of Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. It is 1,398 feet high. The Rock is Crown property of the United Kingdom, and borders Spain. Most of the Rock&#39;s upper area is covered by a nature reserve, which is home to around 300 Barbary macaques. These macaques, as well as a labyrinthine network of tunnels, attract a large number of tourists each year. &#151;Wikipedia
