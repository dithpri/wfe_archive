[color=blue]The League of Neutral Nations is a relatively new conglomerate of sovereign states whose allegiance lies neutral. We heavily encourage use of the World Assembly and quite often partake in diplomatic situations and economic conferences. Most of the nations here are politically free with low defense spending, and of course do not condone the use of military force against other nations. Not only does it go against our morals, but also breaks international law. This region is always open to nations who wish to become members and are not hostile towards newcomers.[/color]
