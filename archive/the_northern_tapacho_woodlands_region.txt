This is a Region where the mighty nation of Drawsburg lives. Unlike other regions Drawsburg is thousands of miles far away from any other region on Earth. Due to our extreme isolation Drawsburg has been able to prosper and grow large and discover new technologies that other regions dont quite have. The region is mostly woodlands with a big snowstorm every year from Early November to Late March. Outside of the Woodlands lies a desert littered with canyons called &quot;Sunset Valley&quot; which on summer days reach a temperature up to 133&deg;F.
