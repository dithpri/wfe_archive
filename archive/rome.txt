[b][color=red]Rome[/color] fell to the assassins of [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region] without so much as a whisper from defenders or natives alike.[/b]

[b]Stealing from the shadows were:
[nation]Venico the Night Father[/nation]
[nation]Ambroscus Koth[/nation]
[nation]Raxion[/nation][/b]

[b]No one can stand against [color=purple]The Brotherhood[/color], founder, delegate...all fall to the blade the same.
