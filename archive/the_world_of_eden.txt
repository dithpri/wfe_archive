At the end of Black &amp; White, the player leaves Eden and returns after a long while to find that much has changed. The villagers are now more technologically advanced (somewhere around real life Iron Age). Weapons and armies now exist and villages have been replaced by larger, more complex cities. Different civilizations make war with one another and the Aztec are the dominating power of the world.
