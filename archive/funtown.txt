Bring friends! Store puppets!  Whatever you want to do.  [b]Also, any WA nation must endorse our delegate [nation]Box Butte[/nation].[/b]  The Founder [nation=short]The Wild and Wonderful Wizardland[/nation] is active and will eject nations not following this rule.  A second ejection comes with a ban.  Look, I&amp;#39;m sorry for any inconveniences, but it&amp;#39;s a precautionary measure and it will be lifted if and when more WA nations show up and endorse our Delegate.
