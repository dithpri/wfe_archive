[b]DESCRIPTION:[/b]

The Free Thought Coalition is a region devoted to the thinkers of the world. It values not military power, nor economical concentration, it has no interest in might, nor political dynamic. 

This is a region for societies and nations which seeks to develop a system of peers, that can help to reflect and develop various ideas. To explore new concepts, and to experiment with new ideas. 

We have no measured criteria in terms of political allegiances or partisan stances. We measure the individual&amp;#39;s capacity to present and formulate him or herself. Petty bickering over which economical plan is the best economical plan is beyond us. 

Whomever you might be, the Free Thought Coalition would hear your case.
