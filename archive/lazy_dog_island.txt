Tired of noisy regions? Equally nosy leaders and bashing nations? Well, Lazy Dog Island, or just Lazy Dog is the place to go if you don&amp;#39;t want any activity in your life and just want to stay for a day, a week perhaps?, a month? a year? maybe forever? Either way, you can stay as long as you like. No BS, no strings attached and no responsibilities.
