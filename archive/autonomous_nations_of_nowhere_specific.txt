Welcome to the [u][b]Autonomous Nations of Nowhere Specific[/b][/u].
 
Our official motto is [b]&quot;whatever&quot;[/b], and we don&#39;t really care what people do, as long as it&#39;s not stupid.
We occasionally hold elections for vital positions, via the polls. read clause 2 for more information.
if you have a position, don&#39;t abuse it or you risk being demoted, or even kicked.

As more embassies are established, it&#39;s in my power to say that the region is neutral. We don&#39;t invade, nor will we be invaded, provided security measures are up-to-date.

So, If you are here to stay or, passing through on your way to parts unknown, welcome. welcome to the region.
