Welcome to the [u][b]Autonomous Nations of Nowhere Specific![/b][/u] (Or ANONS, depending on who you ask.)

Our official motto is [b]&quot;whatever&quot;[/b], and we don&#39;t really care what people do, as long as it&#39;s not [i]totally[/i] stupid.

We occasionally hold elections for vital positions, via the polls.
if you have a position, don&#39;t abuse it or you risk being demoted, or even kicked.

Please endorse me, [nation=short]United-Socialism[/nation]. I&#39;m your current [i]benevolent[/i] dictator.
Or vote somebody else, if you want another, maybe less benevolent, dictator.
Whatever floats.

Lastly, [color=red]Fear the Shanghai Noon![/color] (aka censorship of the message board)

Have fun!
