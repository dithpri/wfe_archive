The [b]Alexander Archipelago[/b] is a 300 miles long archipelago of North America off the southeastern coast of Alaska. It contains about 1,100 islands, which are the tops of the submerged coastal mountains that rise steeply from the Pacific Ocean. Deep channels and fjords separate the islands and cut them off from the mainland. 

The islands have irregular, steep coasts and dense evergreen and temperate rain forests. Most are accessible only by boat or airplane. The majority of the islands are part of the Tongass National Forest. They are rugged and have an abundance of wildlife. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
