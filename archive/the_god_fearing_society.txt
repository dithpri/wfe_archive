Welcome to this God fearing region. If you give God the respect He demands and deserves, then I applaud you brother. If you don&#39;t, feel free to stick around.

I won&#39;t tolerate:
Racism.
Sexism.
Mocking of one&#39;s views or beliefs.
Cursing is not forbidden, but please don&#39;t go crazy.

If you would like to start theological debates, go right on ahead. I might even have something to say. Please just don&#39;t go crazy.
