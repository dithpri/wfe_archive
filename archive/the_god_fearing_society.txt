Welcome, I expect most of you to believe in some way, shape, or form of God, but if you don&#39;t then that&#39;s fine.

There are things which this region does not tolerate:
&middot;Racist comments
&middot;Sexist comments
&middot;Hate-speech
&middot;Harassment
Cursing is frowned upon, but not restricted, just please don&#39;t go wild with it. Other than that, anything else is fine

I would like people to start theological debates. I may have input from time to time, but I will intervene and stop the conversation if it gets too hairy. Just don&#39;t hate on other people&#39;s beliefs and you&#39;ll be fine.
