The Constitutional Fourth World Order, founded May 7th of the prosperous year of 2012, is a region aimed at maintaining world order through national and regional sovereignty and a libertarian agenda. The Constitutional Fourth Worlds Order explicitly bans the act of going to war against another nation unless such war is in self defense of a nation within the region. The Constitutional Fourth World Order does not like to meddle in international affairs (but does establish relations with other regions), as it is mostly aimed at the defense, survival, well-being, and sovereignty of its own region.
