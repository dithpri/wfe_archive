History: The Mayans united and created an empire and brought the sweet potato up to North America along the Mississippi River. The Sweet Potato Trade caused a mass population boom along the Mississippi River basin and fighting for power among native populations. Fast forward to today and many native nations gained their independence from their overlords back in the mid-20th century. Though some with majority European populations have chosen to remain.
