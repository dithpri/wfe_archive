Long ago, the three nations lived together in harmony.
Then, everything changed when the ogrelord attacked.
Only the memelord, master of all the memes could stop him, but when the world needed him most, he was too slow.
A hundred years past and the weebs found the new memelord, a young hero named Sanic.
And although his dankness is great, he has a lot to learn before he&#39;s ready to save anydoge.
But I believe, Sanic can save the feminists.
