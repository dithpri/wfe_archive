Greater Immoria is a land divided between many independent nations, constantly at war with each other. The King in Immoria nominally rules the land, but in practice each individual territory is independent. Some rather large nations have formed in the years of conflict, and the Immorian nobility seem satisfied in brokering power between the many warring states.
