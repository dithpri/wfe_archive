Greater Immoria is a land divided between many independent nations, constantly at war with each other. The King in Immoria nominally rules the land, but in practice each individual territory is independent. Some rather large nations have formed in the years of conflict, and the Immorian nobility seem satisfied in brokering power between the many warring states.

The old Empire of Alnum looms over the borders of the Kingdom of Immoria, strengthening its forces in hopes of capturing the weaker, loose fiefdoms that break away from the rule of Imasir. Meanwhile, the Principality of Midrock has consolidated the northern fiefdoms and has taken to formally oppose the King. Greater Immortal is a perilous and warring land.
