Set in a different timeline, the Austrian People&#39;s Republic is a Soviet Satellite State and a member of the Warsaw Pact. Before the official agreements, Stalin successfully managed to put his hands on Austria to pull it into the Soviet sphere of influence. The Soviet Union agreed to pull out of Iran in exchange for Austria. Franklin D. Roosevelt feared that Austria might be a threat and wanted to divide Austria like Germany, having a Western capitalist puppet and an Eastern communist state. Before the Communist unification, Austria was divided by the victorious allies into four zones, as well as the capital city. It was established in 1947 and dissolved in 1989.
