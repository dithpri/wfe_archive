 Welcome to the Balsamic Vinaigrette! We are a picturesque mixture of liquids renowned for our pitch-black vinegar and olive-green oil. This region is not only a prosperous center of imperialists and braggarts, but also rather tasty salad dressing.
 
 We warmly invite you to join our forum located [b][url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Island_dressing]HERE[/url][/b].
 
 We are also home to BVTO - Balsamic Vinaigrette Treaty Organization, and [i]say[/i] that we have over [b][color=red]2000[/color][/b] successful missions to date! We stand against the bullies and thugs of this game, but only the [b][url=http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=8021985#p8021985]tricky[/url][/b] ones. If you want to fight against the evil in NationStates, you need to seriously update your definition of evil!
