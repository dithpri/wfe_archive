[b]History:[/b] After seceding from [region]The Holy Sha Alliance[/region], which was corrupt, on December 16, 2022, [nation]Xenofly[/nation] &amp; [nation]Federationalism[/nation] voted to found a new region; Outcasted Losers. As a region, our goal is to be way better than the Holy Sha Alliance in every way possible: Better admins, laws, and experience. Unlike the Holy Sha Alliance, we determine bans by admin vote, rather than outright banning people just because you can&#39;t take an insult. 

DOWN WITH THE HOLY SHA AND UP WITH OUTCASTED LOSERS!!
