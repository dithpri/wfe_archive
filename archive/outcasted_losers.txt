[b]History:[/b] After seceding from [region]The Holy Sha Alliance[/region] on December 16, 2022, [nation]Xenofly[/nation] &amp; [nation]Federationalism[/nation] voted to found a new region; Outcasted Losers. Free from the scrutiny of The Holy Sha, the Outcasted Losers has since taken on many other members who support and fight for our cause. 

[b]DOWN WITH THE HOLY SHA AND UP WITH OUTCASTED LOSERS!![/b]
