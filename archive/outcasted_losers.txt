[b]History:[/b] After seceding from the most corrupt and cringey NationStates, [region]The Holy Sha Alliance[/region], on December 16, 2022, [nation]Xenofly[/nation] &amp; [nation]Federationalism[/nation] voted to found a new region; Outcasted Losers. As a region, our goal is to provide the utmost best experience while playing NationStates. Unlike the Holy Sha Alliance, we determine bans by admin vote, rather than outright banning people just because you can&#39;t take an insult. 

DOWN WITH THE HOLY SHA AND UP WITH OUTCASTED LOSERS!!
