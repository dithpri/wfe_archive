&amp;#128205; Capital: Veyanagar  
&amp;#128367;&amp;#65039; Motto: &#147;We don&#146;t bark. We hunt.&#148;

The Alliance of BloodHound is a haven for the misfits, the ambitious, and the unbroken. Founded by Rudra Veyan, this region is built for nations that don&#146;t follow &#151; they lead, they fight, they rise.

This isn&#146;t a democracy. It&#146;s a pack.

We value strength, loyalty, and purpose. We don&#146;t care where you came from &#151; only what you&#146;re willing to become.

Optional faith: *Vy&amp;#257;pak Dharma* &#151; for those seeking power through order and inner fire.

If you&#146;re done pretending. If you want to rise with wolves &#151;  
**Welcome to BloodHound.**
