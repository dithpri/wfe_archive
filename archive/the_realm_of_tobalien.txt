The Realm of Tobalien was found to be Tobaliens own region. This has become necessary because the holy emperor of Tobalien is not pleased to be part of the controversy among the socialist opressors of the South Pacific region. Tobalien shall stay in indepence until the glorious day Milograd ceases to be the tyrant/delegate/member/what you want of the South Pacific!
