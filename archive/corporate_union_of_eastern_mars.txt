The Corporate Union (CU) is an alliance created by Osir&#39;s Corporate Union Doctrine. The Doctrine was first drafted by High Director Manacure as a message to all planets and Martian Nations that Eastern Mars was under Osirian protection from Colonization and Osir had the right to build Industrial Complexes in Eastern Nations. The Doctrine was amended 73 years later as High Director Arion created the Arion Pact as his first document in his Directorial position. The Arion Pact stated that Osir had the right to interfere with all Eastern Martian Nations decisions for the protection of Osir.
