My tiger friend has got the sled,
And I have packed a snack.
We&amp;#39;re all set for the trip ahead.
We&amp;#39;re never coming back!

We&amp;#39;re abandoning this life we&amp;#39;ve led!
So long, Mom and Pop!
We&amp;#39;re sick of doing what you&amp;#39;ve said,
And now it&amp;#39;s going to stop!
