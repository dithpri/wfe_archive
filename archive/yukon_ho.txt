My tiger friend has got the sled,
And I have packed a snack.
We&amp;#39;re all set for the trip ahead.
We&amp;#39;re never coming back!

We&amp;#39;re abandoning this life we&amp;#39;ve led!
So long, Mom and Pop!
We&amp;#39;re sick of doing what you&amp;#39;ve said,
And now it&amp;#39;s going to stop!

The great care-free mile-long warehouses of the Yukon house the main Staging Point for the [b]Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army[/b], as well as Puppet Storage.

This is NOT a jump point region!

[b]Be sure to leave to [region=Fargoth](PEF and TEP main jump region) BEFORE :21 on Minor Or Major, or else you will be stuck here![/b]
