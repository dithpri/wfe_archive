Let&amp;#39;s talk about your government, dear America, shall we? The Enclave. Just who is the Enclave? Why, now that&amp;#39;s simple. The Enclave is  you, America. The Enclave is your sister, your aunt, your friend, your neighbour. And, well, yes, the Enclave is me as well. As your president, it is my responsibility to preside over our great democracy. So, as your president, I am the voice, I am the heart, and soul of the Enclave. That is to say, I am the voice, heart, and soul of America. But only together can we hope to reach our full potential. One Enclave, One America. Now and Forever. And now, dearest America, we must say farewell. For there is much work to be done, and the Enclave never rests.
