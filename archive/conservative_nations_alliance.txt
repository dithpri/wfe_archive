The Conservative Nations Alliance believes in a voice for all nations and their inhabitants. We are an alliance that believes in peace with other nations, but if necessary force. We prefer nations to get involved in the region and support and help. We believe in equality and peace our goal is to bring more nations together to unite as one!!! Officers and delegates will be added, and many of the nations that join will be able to become one :)
