For thousands of years, our ancestors have fought against the devils who control the minds of the weak willed. They use their telekinetic ability to control these unfortunate souls and like sheep, they flock to these fiends in the thousands.
A great man once said &quot;Thou should not think with thy phallace&quot; and that is a quote that we, the Anti THOT crusaders live by.
Beware the THOTs, for they are ever increasing in numbers and can be anywhere, at anytime.
