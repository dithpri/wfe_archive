Hallmark is a casual place to get away from the NS gameplay/government mechanics.  Our region and especially our Discord promote positivity and wholesomeness, a safe place for people to be themselves as long as they&#39;re being respectful to other members.  As long as you follow our simple rules that mainly translate to &quot;No drama,&quot; then you&#39;ll fit right in.  You don&#39;t even have to move your nation in! We welcome NS nations, foreign visitors, and non-NS users alike in our active Discord server.  We hope you enjoy your time here!
