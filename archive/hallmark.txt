Welcome to the region of [color=#ff0000]H[/color][color=#ff7f00]a[/color][color=#c3c302]l[/color][color=#62e101]l[/color][color=#00ff00]m[/color][color=#00ffff]a[/color][color=#0000ff]r[/color][color=#9600ff]k[/color], a region that is all about being warm, open, and friendly, with the only caveat being to be respectful and civil/friendly to those in the region/server.



Hallmark is a casual region to get away from the NS gameplay/government mechanics.  A place for anyone to get involved in other ways: We&#39;ll be having writing, RP, and other events as well as a newsletter down the road, festivals, and gaming nights with our various Discord gaming bots.

As long as you follow our simple rules that mainly translate to &quot;No drama,&quot; then you&#39;ll fit right in.  You don&#39;t even have to move your nation in! We welcome NS nations, foreign visitors, and non-NS users alike.  We hope you enjoy your time here!
