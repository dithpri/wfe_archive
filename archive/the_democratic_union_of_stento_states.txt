[color=blue]DUSS is a total democratic region, as so all decisions will be made by the states who are in DUSS. This includes, but is not limited to the kicking/banning of states, the voting of a WA Delegate, the giving of power to states and changing the flag. The dispatches below will go into detail the rules and punishments. If there is any complaints, please send them to the WA delegate and the Founder. We will put it to a vote.[/color]
