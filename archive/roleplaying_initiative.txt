My goal is to put roleplay on the map for this game. With outside roleplayer&#39;s going from the age of iron, with knights and kings dotting the lands, to the space age of galactic travel with new worlds over the horizon. My point is, if you can think it I aim to make it. But in order to actually start I need players, what&#39;s the point of roleplay if you don&#39;t have other people? If I have your interest, all you have to do is join and soon if I (and you) am/are lucky we&#39;ll have a thriving roleplay player base that will always support the imagination.
