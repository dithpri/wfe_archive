[i]&quot;Here can be found the Abomination.
The Destroyer, the Traitor.
He who ruined his own home.
Who beat his friends and served his enemies.
Who sought power and domination.
Who looked into the Abyss and was consumed.
Now he stands alone in utter silence.
Alone, in poverty, forgotten.
A narcissist, a fanatic, a disillusioned nobody.
Pass on and refrain from such existance.&quot;[/i]
