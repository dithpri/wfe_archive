[b][u][color=#004080]Welcome to the Region of Concordia Ultima[/color][/u][/b]

[i]&#147;When the world order fell, the last embers of unity gathered here.&#148;[/i]

Once, there was order. Nations stood in uneasy alliances, borders held firm, and great powers dictated the flow of history. Then came the Collapse &#151; a cascade of wars, economic implosions, and political betrayals that shattered the old world.
In the chaos that followed, survivors, visionaries, and rulers of the remnants gathered in this last great bastion: [region]Concordia Ultima[/region].

Here, amidst the ruins of yesterday, the future is forged.
[b]This is the final concord &#151; the last place where order can be rebuilt and the world reimagined.[/b]
