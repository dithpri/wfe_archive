Welcome to Concordia Ultima
&#147;Where the last great peace is forged.&#148;

Once, the world was fractured &#151; divided into realms of war, greed, and distrust. But here, beyond the dust and ruin of the old age, rises Concordia Ultima: the Final Concord, a union built on cooperation, mutual respect, and a shared destiny.

Our lands are diverse in people, culture, and history &#151; yet bound by the belief that peace and progress are worth defending. In this region, every nation has a voice. The decisions we make are shaped by all who dwell here, for Concordia Ultima is not ruled by the few, but guided by the many.
