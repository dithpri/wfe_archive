Welcome to Animal Rights Utopia, a region where aim to eliminate speciesism, the assumption of human superiority leading to the exploitation of animals. 

Us humans are perfectly capable of living a long and healthy life on a meat-free diet; the survival of the fittest excuse has long expired, in the modern era foreign animals are slaughtered for profit and to keep up with global demand, nothing more. Other animals&amp;#39;s are living creatures just like us; foreign species such as cows and pigs may have a lower level of intelligence when compared to humans, but this doesn&amp;#39;t mean they suffer or feel pain less acutely. It&amp;#39;s high time we stop deluding ourselves with the idea that we&amp;#39;re an &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; species and actually start acting like one.
