[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] were out and about searching for a good recipe for [colour=orange]EGG CAKE[/colour]. Once we assembled the fabled recipe from the scraps in [nation]Zizou[/nation]&#146;s trashcan, we headed down to the shops to buy only the freshest and finest ingredients. Unfortunately, when we went to bake the cake, our oven was broken, but we will return to finish the job&#133;
