The [region]Australic Ring[/region] region is a tight-knit circle of nations in the south, placed on large, fresh plates formed by underwater volcanoes by the Australian continent.  Currently home to two countries, the Ring favors liberals but is open to any viewpoint as long as it is logical. The region boasts endless tropical and desert biomes to tourists, immigrants, and other nations, as well as their strong ability to preserve them.
