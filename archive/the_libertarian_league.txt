A league of nations looking to extend the blessing of freedom to the world. Seeing fit that civil and political liberties be held at utmost height the actions of these people look to reflect a better society. One with less regulation, free markets, and kind humans. Tolerance to those looking to bring humanity forwards, rebuttal to those who hate and look to take humanity away from those with no voice.
