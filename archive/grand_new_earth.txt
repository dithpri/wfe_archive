GNE Origin
After the Great war, many countries were left destroyed, irradiated, or crumbling. So many countries left the original Earth in search of a new home.
A coalition found said home, those involved being the Tri-Sovereign Empire, and New Sino-Japan. Others arrived and Revolutions were staged. Thus creating the New Earth.
