We welcome new and old nations, but only give authority to those we trust. We let the people decide all of our decisions. We hope to maintain the style of region that East Korea and Vorence once were, and expand on this. Our biggest contribution to the world of NatinStates is our role-playing. We hope to become a strong region without any major issues.
