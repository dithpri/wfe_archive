A long, long time ago, I had my own little show, was a beautiful, lovable, Angel, but he took the spotlight shining so bright and left me to fade away, but honey now the turn is Mine!

You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to drown away,
In a puddle of shame!

You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to loose cry in vain,
And to fall from your fame!!
You, yes, you

Made me insane!

But not anymore,
I&#39;m in control (I am in control)!
I have the stage,
You can&#39;t turn the page,
Now do as you&#39;re told (Encore, hit the beat, boys)!
Focus on me (Focus on me)!
I&#39;ll be all that they see!
I&#39;ll make them sway,
No, can&#39;t run away!
Now all eyes on me,
Now all eyes on, all eyes on me![/b]
