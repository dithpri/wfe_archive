third refoundation
same founder
this has born as a region against the [region]BENEVOLENT EMPIRE[/region], but then fallen and was refounded one second time, now i have changed idea about the benevolent empire, now we have another enemy
we accept any ideology but we hate raids, we will organize a government system
but only if you join

we are also against regions such as [region]The Glorious Nations of Iwaku[/region], because they are immoral and their nations are corrupted by a terrible hate against their planet, they don&#39;t dare to save it, what a shame
