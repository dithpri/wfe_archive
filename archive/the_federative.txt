What if our world had progressed along a slightly different path? This is a roleplay region currently set in the WWII era, with a bit of a twist! Join us, and engage in diplomacy, backroom dealings, wars, and other miscellaneous (and fun!) things!

The region is currently preparing for a timeskip to 1967.
