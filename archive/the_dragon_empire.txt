Reborn from over a decade of absence, the Dragon Empire rises to assert itself on the world stage once again. A realm safe for Dragons as overseen by the Dragon Emperor, Maelstrom Vortex of Dragonisia, servitor of Franco, nemesis to all Userites around the world. Note, you do not have to be a nation of Dragons to join the region, just be supportive of Dragon Rights and recognize Dragons as persons.

The Dragon Empire is a proud provincial member of the New Pacific Order. While members here shall not be required to join the order, it is recommended and encouraged.
