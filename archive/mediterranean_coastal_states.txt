Stretching all the way from Spain to Lebanon, the Mediterranean Coastal States is an alliance of Mediterranean and European nations. Although it is mostly neutral, the MCS have been known to bulldoze over enemies that threaten the sovereignty of any of the member nations.

Ideology: Neutral/Centrist. We accept any ideologies.

In MCS, we have role-play organised by members of staff and if requested, normal member states. If any issues are present with any members, we hold votes and have a judicial system. Absolutely NO ONE is exempt from punishment. New members may be elected for office in polls whenever requested by more than 5 people. We also hold debates at will, and host them on instagram.
