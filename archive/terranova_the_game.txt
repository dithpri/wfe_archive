[color=gold][b]Terranova is a Discord- based Roleplaying region which has a world map, an active community and a throughly tested warfare system.

Set in the 24th Century, the Game takes place on a planet which has only recently been colonised by settlers from Earth. As space travel is not fully developed yet, the settlers are outside Earth&#146;s oversight and operate with complete autonomy.

Registered players will receive territory, a starting population of settlers, and a channel with which they can begin building their nation.

Nations created in Terranova can be inspired by any culture found on Earth, but must accurately reflect any referenced historical details[/b][/color]
