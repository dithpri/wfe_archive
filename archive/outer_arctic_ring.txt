[b][color=purple]Welcome to the Outer Arctic Ring.[/color][/b]
We are a proud region that takes care of the glorious Arctic Ring. Due to classified details the inner ring needs to be taken care of. With 6 Great nations do their part in protecting these lands. 

Since the Great Outer Arctic Ring was invaded (and dealt with) we have set a password to enter and restricted any powers from any WA delegates until we gain a member possible.
