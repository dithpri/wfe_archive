[b][color=purple]Welcome to the Outer Arctic Ring.[/color][/b]
We are a proud region that takes care of the glorious Arctic Ring. Due to classified details the inner ring needs to be taken care of. With 7 Great nations do their part in protecting these lands. 

The Arctic Ring is a large frozen island located on a distant planet. A secret operation was launched and we ventured out to colonize this planet. As we discover what is on this planet we have groups set up to contain and hide information. These regions include [region]Outer Summer Circle[/region] and us.
