[b][color=purple]Welcome to the Outer Arctic Ring.[/color][/b]
We are a proud region that takes care of the glorious Arctic Ring. Due to classified details the inner ring needs to be taken care of. With 8 Great nations do their part in protecting these lands. 

Since the Great Outer Arctic Ring was invaded (and dealt with) we have set a password to enter and restricted any powers from any WA delegates until we gain a member possible. 

The Arctic Ring is a large frozen island located on the planet HD-324569b. A secret operation was launched and we ventured out to colonize this planet. As we discover what is on this planet we have groups set up to contain and hide information. These regions include [region]Outer Summer Circle[/region] and us.
