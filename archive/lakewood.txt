[b]We at [region]The Black Hawks[/region] have recently developed a secret weapon. We call this weapon &#147;Codename Raider Kitty&#148;, it is a fearsome tool, that strikes fear into the hearts of many. This region has been claimed by [url=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/354500109087801344/370618832655482881/IMG_20171019_120642978.jpg?width=266&amp;height=473]Raider Kitty[/url], and his blinding speed. His speed rivals that of the moves of Jakker, and his accuracy is pin-point. [url=http://s4.zetaboards.com/The_Black_Hawks/index/]SUBMIT TO THE RAIDER KITTY![/url]
