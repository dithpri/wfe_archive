The Free Realm of Cazurnian Authority (Or FRCA) is a region in Nation States where there are no rules! Designed to protect the freedom of nations and political ideologies, any nation can stay here no matter their political beliefs (Yes even controversial ones, as long as they obey site rules) Cazurn still holds authority over the region, and can decide to change these rules (or lack thereof) if necessary.
