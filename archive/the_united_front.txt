We are a formerly active region that once boasted 50 members in its prime. Now we are just here to vibe every now and then when we log in.

In the United Front:
- Communism is cringe
- Democracy is non-negotiable
- Corruption is justice
- Authoritarianism is epic
- Asian &amp; consumerist states are welcome

The United Front is an alliance between Communists and Nationalists to repel Oriental Imperialism. Communists are still cringe but oh well.
Also, shoutout the the boys in [region]DICTATORSHIP FASCISTS[/region]. Their original region [region]Fascist Region[/region] was overrun by the communist horde.

Fascism with an Asian twist but there is a communist among us.
