[b]HI! And Welcome to [region]The United Front[/region][/b]

[region]The United Front[/region] is a conglomerate of nations that take pleasure in doing nothing. I, [nation]Falangist Yunnan[/nation], love doing nothing. I also am notified that a few people (like [nation]002 is Hot[/nation]) like doing nothing. If we could all do nothing together, then I guess we can be classified as an Entente of Nations.

However, if doing nothing does not fulfill you, here are some things that you [b]can[/b] do in the wonderful United Front:
1) Engage in the great [b]Waifu Wars&#153;[/b]
2) Chill in the message boards
3) Take part in our polls
4) Argue over who has the best country
5) Take over the world         

[b]&amp;#9994;LONG LIVE THE UNITED FRONT&amp;#9994;[/b]
