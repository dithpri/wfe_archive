[b]Greetings, and welcome to [u]The [color=#DF0101]United[/color] [color=#DF0101]Front[/b][/u][/color]

Formerly an extremely active region numbering over 50 nations, disrepair, neglect, and the fall of many true comrades has rendered this region effectively dead. My last message as Falangist Yunnan, founder of this Front, is for all of you leaders of whom brought such joy and life to this once great region to never forget this: life, cirumstances and problems may seperate us, but the catalyst of true kameraderie is through what you do. Go forth, for the Front is now adjourned. 

[b]LONG LIVE THE UNITED FRONT![/b]

It was a great run, comrades.
