[b]On my honour I promise that I will do my best
To do my duty to God and my Country;
To help other people at all times;
To obey the Scout Law.[/b]

The Scout Law varies significantly between nations, but it encourages character traits such as trustworthiness, loyalty, helpfulness, courtesy, good cheer, thrift, and moral courage that help Scouts realize the overarching principles of the Promise.

[b]Notes[/b]

&#149; Most TSP nations share one controller, so we have a Puppet Storage tag. But we welcome all who identify with Scouting principles.
&#149; The map has the first 11 nations on it. A second map area is under development, and a few nations will choose to stay off-map.
