The Scout Promise is made by every true Scout. This example from the World Association of the Scout Movement is typical:

[b]On my honour I promise that I will do my best&#151;
To do my duty to God and the King (or to God and my Country)
To help other people at all times and
To obey the Scout Law.[/b]

The Scout Law varies more widely, typically encapsulating seven to ten character traits encompassing loyalty, brotherhood, respect, cheerfulness, and courage.
