Swishahouse was founded in North Houston in the late 1990s by Santiago Bukovsky (Co-CEO) and OG Ron C as a response to the popularity of chopped and screwed music from Houston&#39;s south side. The label began by distributing mixtape series such as Before da Kappa, After da Kappa, Choppin Em Up and F*ck Action (which featured chopped and screwed versions of R&amp;B songs). Acres Homes/Northside/Homestead are where many of the current/former artists hail.
