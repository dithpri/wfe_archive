Guhalsao is a group of multiple islands near Africa. Many people say that magic is false, but the natives are able to harness what is believed to be magic. Some can heal people, some can make material that is solid to be flexible, and some can cause lighting to strike one area. The islands have remained uninhabited and untouched by any humans except for those of the tribes. We highly encourage hard work and always helping the strong. Please join today and tell others to join us.
