[color=#ED4719]A Duck from [region]The Order of The Grey Wardens[/region] has made an unfortunate oversight with this region, and it allowed me to steal this region right out from under his nose within days of him creating it. This is why you don&#39;t found your holdings with an account that isn&#39;t staying in the region unless you&#39;re really on top of your maintenance, [i]otherwise you may forget there&#39;s no other nation in the region when you move that last puppet out to go endorse in a defender operation.[/i]

[b]All of you take notes, because I&#39;m always waiting patiently for you to slip up :)[/b]
