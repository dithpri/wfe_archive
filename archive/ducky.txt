[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been dominated by [nation=short+noflag]J o J[/nation]![/color][/b][hr]

[color=#ED4719]A Duck from [region]The Order of The Grey Wardens[/region] has made an unfortunate oversight with this region. This is why you don&#39;t found your holdings with an account that isn&#39;t staying in the region , [i]otherwise you may forget there&#39;s no other nation in the region when you move that last puppet out to go participate in a defender operation.[/i]

This region is now held as a territory against the Wardens, and as a tribute to ducks, the best animal :)
