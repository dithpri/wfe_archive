welcome to Disboard! the region where everything is decided by games!

this idea was taken from a show called no game no life, if you have not seen it, that&#39;s ok, I can explain the rules easily.
in this region, all matters of conflict is decided by gambling and games. this will take place in an RP. as for how we will play the games, if you don&#39;t know me or other people in the region IRL, then the games you can play are restricted to what we can play online, and still control who we play (online chess for example)

introduce yourself on the message board and check my (eldea) factbook entries on the region. they will help explain the rules and help you make an RP.
