Hello, welcome to my own little region, dedicated, but not limited to, transgender users or those who wish to be educated in the issues, struggles and rights of transgender people. This will be built up in time.

Rules:
1. No -phobia stuff. This is obvious. Do it, expect a ban.
2. Advertising. Not cool. Not here.
3. Hugs. &amp;lt;3

Embassies~

While the region starts to get off the ground, we will only accept embassy requests from regions that are either LGBTQ+ centric, or who I know users from. Thanks.

If you wish to help build, improve or promote the region, telegram this nation, or Val Halla.
