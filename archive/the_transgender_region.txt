Welcome to NationStates&amp;#39; premier (and fledgling) transgender region! We are centric to the many identities outside of the cisgender norm, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you aren&amp;#39;t welcome here if you are cisgender! 

Please:
1. Be polite
2. Be respectful
3. Avoid making uneducated statements without being willing to learn.

Embassies~

While the region starts to get off the ground, we will only accept embassy requests from regions that are either LGBTQ+ centric, or who I know users from. Thanks.

If you wish to help build, improve or promote the region, telegram this nation, or Val Halla.

This is work in progress. Over time I hope to add a number of things, such as resources, education, polish and more!
