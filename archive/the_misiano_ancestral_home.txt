[strike][color=#BFBFBF][i]The Misiano Ancestral Home is a living monument to the family that once had a 105 year long rule over Nuovoiork. We now dedicate the Misiano Ancestral Home as a place for (former) Duce Daltonio Misiano III to live out his days. Located in the suburbs of Nuovoiork City, it is truly a place to behold.
All friends, allies, and members of the Misano Family are welcome.[/i][/color][b]Not anymore, coward. This Daltonian sinkhole in the woods has been corrupted by [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=angvar][color=#800000]Angmar[/color][/url]&#39;s Plague Bearers![/b][/strike]
