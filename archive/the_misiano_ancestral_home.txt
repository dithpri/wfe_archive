[color=green][b][u]The Misano Ancestral Home is a living monument to the family that once had a 105 year long rule over Nuovoiork. We now dedicate the Misiano Ancestral Home as a place for (former) Duce Daltonio Misiano III to live out his days. Located in the suburbs of Nuovoiork City, it is truly a place to behold.[/color][/b][/u]

All friends, allies, and members of the Misano Family are welcome.
