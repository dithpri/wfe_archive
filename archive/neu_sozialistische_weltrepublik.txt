[b]The NATO Ministers shout it
Listen, don&#39;t you hear it?
Their cry is not more whispers
Listen, yes you not hear it?
You cry out for profit of their war industry
And upgrade to the crusade, again like never before
Their army is ready for aggression
Against you and the Soviet Union
Workers, farmers, fixed arms
Today, that&#39;s sacred duty
Ever start the criminals, crime
The people of their weapons breaks
Today, socialism is world power
Today, the peoples are no longer alone
Drum solid unity, the fight will be worth
Then in the world is always peace
Drum solid unity, the fight will be worth
Then in the world is always peace.[/b]
