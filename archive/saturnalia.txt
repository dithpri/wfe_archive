[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQrOMtpCl90][b][color=scarlet]Saturnalia[/url] was an ancient Roman festival in honour of the god Saturn, held on the 17th of December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to the 23rd of December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms: gambling was permitted, and masters provided table service for their slaves. The poet Catullus called it &quot;the best of days&quot;. Saturnalia is also believed to be the pagan predecessor of Christmas.[/b] [/color]
