The region of Und das Hei&szlig;t Erika,

The region itself doesn&#39;t have any single ideology, with nations ranging from socially traditionalist, to ultra-progressive, and economically Socialist to Laissez-faire Capitalist. This region is indeed diverse in its politics and accepting of those who are willing to offer mutual respect to one another. Most of our nations are fairly new, the oldest ones being only 2-3 years in age, however, we are willing to help those who are just starting out.

Thank you, enjoy your stay in the region.
