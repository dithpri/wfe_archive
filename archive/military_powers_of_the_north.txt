The President is voted in by members and is also the Delegate.  To vote for a Delegate, endorse them.

This region is based upon the idea that everyone deserves a voice in regional government and should have a chance to become President/Delegate.  We also believed in a strong economy and protecting those who are weak.  We promote growth and prosperity as well and hope to grow into a larger region. We are also in a regional alliance, The Glorious Charter for the Counsel of Free and Allied Regions.  In this alliance we defend our allies and defend what is just.
