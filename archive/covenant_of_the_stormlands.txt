The Stormlands is located south of the Frostrend Mountains, bordered on the west by the desolate Reach, south by the Shivering Tundra, and to the east by the Shipbreaker Bay. It&amp;#39;s a large and desolate region, a land of harsh mountains, stony shores, and treacherous marches. The March of Hjaal, located south of Camlarn and the Kingswood province, serve as an buffering zone between the major old rivals of Arstotzkaya, to the east, and Tzarak, to the west. For centuries it was a regular battleground, changing hands more than once until the formation of The Stormland Covenant, forged between the regional powers of The Kingdom of Camlarn, The Dictatorship of Arstotzkaya and The Dominion of Tzarak, and the remote island-kingdom of Svearjende.
