The Stormlands is located south of Winterhold, bordered on the west by the desolate lands of the Reach, south by the Shivering Tundra, and to the east by Rocky Bay. It&amp;#39;s one of larger and more desolate regions, a land of harsh mountains, stony shores, and the vast Forest of Kingswood, where Camlarn is located. The March of Hjaal, located north of Kingswood, serve as an buffering zone between the major old rivals of Arstotzkaya, bordering the Reach, and Tzarak, bordering the Shivering Tundra. For centuries it was a regular battleground, changing hands more than once until the formation of The Stormland Covenant, forged between the regional powers of The Kingdom of Camlarn, The Dictatorship of Arstotzkaya and The Armed Republic of Tzarak.
