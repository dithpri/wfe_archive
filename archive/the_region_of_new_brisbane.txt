The region of New Brisbane is a confederation of nation-states that once inhabited the former area of South East Queensland and Northern New South Wales. New Brisbane was formed after the Australian Civil War where the former states and territories feuded over natural resources as well as the unequal distribution of Goods and Services Tax. The brutal civil war led to the splintering of all former Australian states and smaller micronations took its place. As the rebuild commenced, the microstates formed security and economic pacts to ensure a rebuild of a once prosperous land.
