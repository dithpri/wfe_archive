Pull yourself up by your bootstraps. Flat tax for all, everyone pays the same dollar amount, not percent. The first $25000 you make for each person in your household annually goes to the government. Billionaires and single working mothers take up the same tax burden footprint. How is it fair that the Profit Jeff Bezos or the apostle Bill Gates should have to pay more for the same basic government services provided as a freeloading, welfare dependent, poverty addicted liberal arts major. Can&#39;t afford your child&#39;s tax burden? Good news, the minimum employment age has been abolished. Invest in the future. Purchase somebody&#39;s tax burden in exchange for services provided minus living expenses.
