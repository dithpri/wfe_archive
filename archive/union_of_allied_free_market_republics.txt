The Union of Allied Free Market Republics was established with the goal of promoting democracy and freedom of religion, speech, language, press, economic activity, and life and providing an opportunity to engage in productive free market trade and economic/political exchange. Founded on the principles of freedom, equality, and capitalism, the Union of Allied Free Market Republics is open to any free, democratic, free market republican nations (or limited constitutionally monarchies) that wish to share in productivity, peace, and economic prosperity.
