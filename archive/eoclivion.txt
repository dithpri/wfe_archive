[B][Color=#1919A3]Welcome to Eoclivion![/Color][/B]
[B][Color=#29A3CC]Beyond the stars and beyond the galaxy, lies a massive realm where freedom reigns and sillyness spreads across the land. Here, all nations are gathered to live among their own opinions and free will! In Eoclivion, we do A LOT of role-playing, do weekly polls, Music, YouTube Videos and talk about why Chocolate Chip Cookies are better than Oatmeal Cookies.[/Color][/B]
