We the Nations, of the House of Slaughter, in order to form a more perfect terrorist alliance, and promote peace and stability throughout the world, we do establish this Supreme Oligarchy. All powers shall be vested in the founder, and everyone he appoints to be apart of the Council.

Our goal is to end the oppression that so many regions have caused to the world.  

We created this region after hearing a member of our old region, named [nation]Cylthropia[/nation], say to us:

&amp;quot;Death to liberty! Death to freedom! Death to YOU!&amp;quot; 

Ever since that day we swore we would do everything in our power to rid the world of this kind of this sort of evil.
