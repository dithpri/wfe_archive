The founding nation of this Empire, Jekin, was established in September of the year 2012.  Since it is an Empire, Jekin governs its people through the combination of a Senate and of course an Emperor.  The fact that Jekin has not gone to war yet in its existence may be due to an intimidation factor in that all citizens of Jekin are required to complete one full year of military service; this keeps the surrounding nations in check and allows everyone to realize what a force they are to be reckoned with.  With 13 million citizens and growing every day, Jekin remains one of the safest nations around.  Join the collective!
