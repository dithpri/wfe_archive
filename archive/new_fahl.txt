Welcome to Fahl, the Land of Many Kingdoms. The world will never be at permanent peace as long as there are those who hunger for war. Will you fight to unite the many rulers under your crown, or will you attempt to carve out a secluded land filled with peace? The world is full of Magic, Dragons, and other creatures of medieval times, for you to utilize or fight. Only time will tell the future of Fahl, for it is in your hands.
