Welcome to the Kingdom of Anglia. King Alfred the First leads this kingdom, which someday may reach some sort of vitalization.

Surbery is the capital, Anglia being a kingdom settled by the Anglo Saxon&#39;s, but always being open to being diverse.

Fascists will be publicly humilitated and thrown over to NationStates Hell (a catcher region, which oddly enough isn&#39;t the worst place you can go... UNLESS YOU&#39;RE A FASCIST!!!)
