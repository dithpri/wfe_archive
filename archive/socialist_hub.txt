Salutations! and welcome to the [b][color=red]Socialist Hub[/color][/b]. This region is dedicated to all forms of Socialism and strictly opposed to Capitalism. We welcome most leftists to our region with the exception of communists. This region is dedicated to people who want to take care of the poor and downtrodden, increase social equality and impose a firm rule over the nation, to keep it stable. Communism equals anti-statism and thus is not what we want to represent.

[b]ANARCHISTS[/b] not welcome.
