[u][color=red][i][b]Well Hello There! And Welcome to the Assembly of United Nations. We are a welcoming region with an organized structure but plenty of room to have fun. There are lots of things to do here! If your the politcal type then run for President or butter up the President to get a top government post. Or you could make it rich by playing the random stock market and racking up our regional currency, RUNICS. Also play in our AUN Olympics held on the last Saturday of every month. Misery is banned and so are haters, have fun and prosper! .[/b][/i][/color][/u]
