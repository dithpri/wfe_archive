[region]North Ustaynga[/region] is an active, roleplay centered region. Founded by [nation]Zhokinland[/nation], and represented by [color=blue]WA Delegate [nation]Kharsgayland[/nation][/color], nations in North Ustaynga strive to provide a lighthearted roleplaying experience.

Nations inside of North Ustaynga are able to propose and vote on new bills that dynamically alter the region and it&#39;s development, similar to how you address issues in vanilla NationStates. You can see a list of every active bill [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=876183]here[/url].
