North Ustaynga did not always exist. The small but growing region had initially been formed when disgruntled nations decided that the regions they were in did not offer enough for them to grow. Driven by the need to advance their civilizations and peoples, they banded together to create a new realm where they controlled their own fates, and fought wars for their own ideals, and not for what they&#39;re told is right. Although initially a tough decision to leave their former homes, the freedom and sovereignty they gained was more than worth it.
