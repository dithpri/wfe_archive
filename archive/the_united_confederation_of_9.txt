&amp;quot;Despite the fact that many of us hold different ideals, and different opinions, we all share the deeply held values of happiness, life, and Marijuana. We Are All 9. And we of the 9 must not forget that.&amp;quot; - Felipe Hernandez, President of Againstia

[region]The United Confederation of 9[/region] (UC9) is a region of near like-minded governmental entities bonded together by heavy drug useage, ninedom, and jolly co-operation. The nations of the UC9 have great pride in their membership of the illustrious confederation. We hope to blossom and grow as a much more significant part of the NationStates world.

All regional issues should be addressed to [nation]Againstia[/nation].
