&amp;quot;Despite the fact that many of us hold different ideals, and different opinions, we all share the deeply held values of happiness, life, and Marijuana. We Are All 9. And we of the 9 must not forget that.&amp;quot; - Chaircat Muffins

The United Confederation of 9 (UC9) is a region of near like-minded governmental entities bonded together by capitalism, heavy drug usage, and a de facto alliance. The nations of the UC9 take their membership in great pride. We hope to blossom and grow as a much more significant part of the NationStates world. We endorse the view that nine is forever the strongest number. [i]All hail 9![/i]
