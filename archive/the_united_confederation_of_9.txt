The United Confederation of 9 (UC9) is a region of near like-minded governmental entities bonded together by capitalism, heavy drug usage, and a de facto alliance. The members of the UC9 have agreed in a recent referendum to let go of their traditional isolationist traditions, and open the doors for diplomats from all corners of the globe. The nations of the UC9 take their membership in great pride. The UC9 hopes to blossom and grow as a much more significant part of the NationStates world. We endorse the view that nine is forever the strongest number. [i]All hail 9![/i]
