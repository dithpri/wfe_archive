Welcome to Einherjar. The Einherjar are the warriors carried to Valhalla by the Valkyries, chosen by Odin himself to fight in preparation for Ragnarok. Our goals here are to stand our ground and fight. We choose to fight for the glory of our people and the gods to the last man, never abandoning hope or strength.

As you open the gates in our hall, admire Glasir, our tree with golden leaves. See our rafters made of spear shafts, our rood made of golden shields, and coats of metal over our benches. On our west gate stands a wolf, with an eagle circling above him, guarding.

Our government is still being formed, so stand by.
