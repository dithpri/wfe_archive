The United Coalition of Democracy is a group
of nations who believe in deep unalienable rights of all citizens. These require deep but coordinated bond between all joking nations. We must not allow propaganda to destroy the individual right of citizens.  All nations with this bond will fight for every right. Unity will define us but hatred we will surely join to demolish. Join a Region of pure democratic mobility.
