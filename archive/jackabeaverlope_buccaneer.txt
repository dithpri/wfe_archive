The Jackabeaverlopes are a beautiful creature. They would frolick all day, just living happily. never bothering anyone. No other creature could compare. Unfortunately, our lands have become unusable due to a four way power struggle. The unrest has led me to flee, not for myself, but for these beautiful creatures I call my friends.  I am sorry that I need to resort to violence, but the poor Jackabeaverlopes need our help, and we need your land.
