The Blue Star Union is a democratic union of nations very alike to the EU. Unlike the EU the BSU is a constitutional monarchy since the founder can&#39;t be removed from power. Every country in the Blue Star Union has free border passage and no tariffs on trades. All countries are required to send their military to aid the countries in the union in the event of an attack. The military is regulated.
