Tired of tyrannical life in the corrupt state of Labiskiya in East Asia, partisans started a harsh civil war that dissolved the country. The Blue Star Union was founded and reclaimed the land of Labiskiya and vowed to put the people first and let them decide peacefully what they want instead of resorting to violence.

[b]The Blue Star Union[/b] is a newly formed region set on creating a coalition of many nations. We urge members to take a look at any laws in place. If you are a member of the World Assembly we ask that you endorse the current WA delegate, that being [nation]Nookville[/nation]. This will help increase our region&#39;s influence over World Assembly Resolutions. 

We prioritize making regional decisions, such as law making, through polls.
