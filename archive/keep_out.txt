The Region of Keep Out is a giant Island in a vast and dangerous Ocean. The coastal areas are extremely rugged and dangerous. The people there are often wary of outsiders. This causes sailors to call this small continent &#39;Keep Out&#39;.

Recently the Region forsook its infighting and captured several islands in the area of varying size.
