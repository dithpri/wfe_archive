The Region of Keep Out is a giant archipelago of large islands in a vast and dangerous Ocean. The coastal areas are extremely rugged and dangerous. The people there are often wary of outsiders. This causes sailors to call this small continent &#39;Keep Out&#39;.

The original inhabitants of the region are the Mongolistanians, Dakotanans and the Barserkians.
