Neo Terra was inhabited in the year 2125 AD after warfare, disease, greed, environmental destruction and poverty had caused the human races&amp;#39; population to dwindle to only about 400,000 individuals and made the planet&amp;#39;s atmosphere uninhabitable. The 400k individuals were shipped on a community craft to settle Neo Terra and start from scratch.

In Neo Terra, the people stand for Peace, Social Justice, Environmentalism and Democracy. We don&amp;#39;t plan to ever go back to our old ways of gluttony and destruction. We are currently in the year 1 AE (After Earth); one year after Neo Terra was discovered.
