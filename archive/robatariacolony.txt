The Clave Delegate&#39;s go back and forth to check up on this region it is under the protection of them soon the border is going to be closed if you would like to join just ask [nation=short]The Torcherers[/nation], and he can set you up with a invite Thanks! Just trying to minimize the chance of raids.
