Welcome to The Calm Land, probably one of the most calm, peaceful and kind regions. It doesn&#39;t matter how big your country is. The main thing is that it should not aggress against other countries and take care of its citizens. Democracy is also respected.

Our region does not have a map.  The decision not to do it was due to greater freedom for the location of countries.  Also, in our region there is no way to declare war on anyone.

To join a region or get more information, send a telegram to the President or MFA. We are always waiting for your applications!
