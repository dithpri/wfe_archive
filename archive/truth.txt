Excerpt:
&quot;For example, if situational context matters, then stealing in one case seems to be the right thing to do, and yet in another case, it turns out to be the wrong thing to do. On Aristotle&#39;s view, stealing, as a class of act, without any further information about the situational context in which that act is committed, cannot be said to be either good or bad by itself (ie, bad absolutely) because the information which determines its goodness and badness would be missing.&quot;[/b]
