&quot;This means that the way I self-identify is critical to morality. I must know precisely who and what I am, and also what I want, and finally what &#147;belongs&#148; to me and what does not (ie, what is an essential part of my identity and what is not). Furthermore, I think that it would be best if I knew these things before I committed to any actions. On my view, it would be these things that determine everything to do with morality.&quot;
