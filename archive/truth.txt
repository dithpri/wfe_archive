&quot;The Function of Happiness&quot;[/u]
Saturday, 16 March 2019. 

Excerpt:
&quot;And so, one might suppose that happiness has a function, then, and it is not the ultimate aim. And thus, it&#39;s very clear that Aristotle may not be entirely correct to suppose that there is nothing else after happiness. Happiness is really just the carrot on the end of a stick which makes a lifetime happen.&quot;[/b]
