The function of the whiteness of a cup[/u]
Thursday, 21 March 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;And so, Kelly isn&#39;t really saying that mere function is inferior to sentimental value. Rather, he&#39;s saying that the features that function to touch our emotions (thereby producing meaning?) is more worthwhile and valuable (to him, and others that share his values, I suppose) than features that function to produce effectiveness and efficiency of realizing a generic purpose. So, ultimately, it&#39;s really a comparison between two types of functions rather than &quot;function vs. sentiment&quot;.&quot;[/b]
