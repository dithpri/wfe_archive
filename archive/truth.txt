Excerpt:
&quot;For instance, we might see that it is a good thing to act on certain sorts of desires and/or inclinations. To be more clear, we would ultimately be motivated by the good of a particular situation (the key word here being &quot;situation&quot;), rather than the desire or inclination itself. Since, in this case, we&#39;d be being motivated by the goodness of the situation of the desire/inclination being satisfied, rather than just being somehow directly motivated by the goodness of the desire or inclination itself.&quot;[/b]
