Assent, action, and agency[/u]
Thursday, 24 January 2019. 

Excerpt:
&quot;And it follows from this that when a person acts without the will&#39;s assent to so act, there is a certain lack of agency in the motions. And in such a case, the motions may even be accompanied with a sense of consciousness or awareness, but without a plan, an intention, these cannot properly be called &quot;acts&quot; &#150; for the motions do not belong to any agent. And actions are distinguished from motions by the fact that actions are performed by an agent, while motions are things that just happen in the world.&quot;[/b]
