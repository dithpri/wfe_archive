&quot;...The less successful peasants always just presume that the more successful peasants are somehow better than them, and so the former defer to the latter in all sorts of ways. But, in reality, they are all of the same &quot;merchant caste.&quot; And as such, their chief excellence is in the buying and selling of products and services; but this doesn&#39;t make them experts at everything else. Yet, this is how peasant mentality works. That species tends to presume that if one among them is successful at getting rich, then that one must be good at everything else as well.&quot;
