Know yourself.

==========================================
Message from Founder:
The three senior-level nation-states here are [nation]The Oceansky[/nation], [nation]Hakeem Alexander[/nation], and [nation]Alethes Sophia[/nation]. All senior-level nation-states possess full powers (except the executive power, which seems to be non-transferable and un-shareable), and you can make any appeals directly to any of them. 

All nation-states here are sovereign. 

Any nation-state that is a member of this region and wishes to participate in political life here will be automatically granted power over polls and a title so that they may exercise their right to speak the truth freely and to find other nation-states who may support and/or share in common views/goals.

Sincerely,
Founder
