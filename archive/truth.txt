[b][u]MOTHER[/u][/b]
Friday, May 11, 2018.

[b]&quot;Whether she behaved &#147;motherly&#148; or not, or whether she was a good mother to me or not, it is a fact that she was my mother after all &#151; at least, biologically. And it is just my personal lot in life to have had a mother like her.

Existence precedes essence.

She defines &#147;mother&#148;. And because of it, it is oftentimes a meaningless word for me. It&#146;s an ambiguous and confusing word to me, and it could mean a hundred other unrelated things.&quot;
