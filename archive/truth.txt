[b][u]The divine gift of anger[/u][/b]
Thursday, May 5, 2018.

[b]In an unpublished paper I had written, I point out that the purpose of the opening lines is this: all of the events to come, no matter how horrific it may seem to us, is happening precisely because it is the will of Zeus. And what is the significance of this fact? It means that the war was inevitable, for it served a greater purpose. More importantly, it means that certain kinds of anger is good and divine because it is a catalyst for justice among mortals.
