Reflection[/u]
Monday, 14 January 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;For, if I judge that the sun is golden in color, or that the sea is beautiful at night, or that animals are sentient, then these things say more about me and my own condition(s) than they do about the person or object in question. So much for giving objective accounts. All I have made certain is that the sun appears golden to me, and that I happen to be in a soft and satisfied mood when I look out at the sea at night, and that I am able to recognize reflections of myself in the behaviors of other animals.&quot;[/b]
