&quot;The observer&quot;

Excerpt:
&quot;But I wonder... If the observation is made from a meta standpoint, then the situation can be possible in 3 ways I think: (1) the mind is making a metaphysical observation about the nature of the material world, in which case the &quot;it&quot; is matter, or (2) the mind is observing its past activity -- in which case the &quot;it&quot; is the phenomenon of its own activity, or (3) the mind is just flatly observing itself, in which case the &quot;it&quot; is the mind.&quot;
