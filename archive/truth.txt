The Platonic Ascent[/u]
Thursday, 14 March 2019. 

Excerpt:
&quot;For, in truth, the Platonic ascent actually begins with the so-called &quot;word made flesh&quot;, though it does not end with it. The &quot;word&quot; is simply a mental categorization for what is already realized in the flesh, and there is no separation between these two things at the beginning of the ascent. And that place of perfect union is precisely where the ascent begins. &quot;[/b]
