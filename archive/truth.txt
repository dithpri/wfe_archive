&quot;The boldness and arrogance of a tautologically good good-will&quot;
[/u]Monday, July 9, 2018.

Excerpt:
&quot;Certainly, a &quot;truly unjust&quot; person probably believes herself to have a &quot;good-will&quot; of some kind. And wouldn&#39;t this &quot;good-will&quot;, in effect, produce boldness and arrogance in the person just as well as the &quot;gifts of fortune&quot; may produce in a person? In fact, wouldn&#39;t it produce the most damning sort of boldness and arrogance --the self-righteous and self-blind sort?
