&quot;For the sake of Duty&quot;[/u]
Monday, August 6, 2018.

Excerpt:
&quot;In order for the action to be considered done &quot;for the sake of duty&quot;, the person must realize that if she does not act, then the &quot;good will&quot; would remain niggardly endowed. Only when this thought compels the person into action can the action be considered one performed &quot;for the sake of duty&quot; rather than being motivated directly for the sake of realizing some particular goodness.&quot;
