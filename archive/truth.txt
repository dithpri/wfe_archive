&quot;Tending to the affairs of that good man, Plato&quot;[/u]
Monday, July 23, 2018

Excerpt:
&quot;...I believe that Plato was a good man. And so, I am compelled by the gods, insofar as they are in me and work through me, to tend to the affairs of that good man, Plato &#151; just as he tended to the affairs of the good man Socrates.&quot;
