Empathy[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;Empathy
I will not fight fire
With fire; I will fight Fire
With my Shining&#151;I will
Fight Humility and Tolerance and I
Will fight your Sympathy with my Love.
I will merge and submerge my skin
Under yours until all traces of your humility fades
Away and there is no longer anything
To tolerate and only
Someone to love.&quot;[/b]
