Excerpt:
&quot;I will say this, however: one interesting thing that Heidegger&#39;s essay made me think of was, and something, I think, which I could understand with my feeble mind, was that just as a jug is an object that stands alone as an object, &quot;man&quot; is also a product of nature, and a thing, and so stands alone as an object of the universe&#39;s creation. And so, man is a &quot;thing&quot; in itself, able to stand on its own, and not merely an object.&quot;[/b]
