&quot;Two kinds of modus ponens&quot;
[/u][/b]Monday, June 25, 2018.

&quot;These two kinds of modus ponens are importantly different. One kind produces tautologies and &quot;safe&quot; (&quot;safe&quot; meaning absolute, guaranteed, certain, etc) conclusions. So let&#39;s call this the &quot;safe&quot; modus ponens.

And the other kind of modus ponens is able to produce a paradox -- ie, a logical configuration which allows a logically false proposition to be ostensively true in the sense that the false proposition is said to &#39;exist&#39;. Let&#39;s call this the &quot;sensitive&quot; modus ponens.&quot;
