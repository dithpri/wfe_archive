&quot;What an agent can do&quot;

Excerpt:
&quot;According to Geach&#39;s &#39;Frege point&#39;, logical propositions, and the relationships between them, certainly do have truth values -- whether the propositions are now being asserted or not. But the kind of &quot;truth&quot; which a proposition can have is not the kind of *truth* that can be expressed by genuine propositions. According to Geach, &quot;asserting&quot; is the act of endorsing the *truth* of a genuine proposition. It is something that only an agent can do, since the proposition cannot assert itself in this way (presumably).&quot;
