Excerpt:
&quot;...supposing that it were in fact true that no such contradiction between natural necessity and freedom exists, but that natural necessity has proof of its existence while freedom does not, then the conclusion would be : That whatever does happen is, in a sense, whatever that was supposed to happen (ie, things are still pre-determined) &#151; even if whatever does happen next could not have been predicted by looking to past experience...&quot;
