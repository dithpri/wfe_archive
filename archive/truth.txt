Two Forms of Justice: Ethics and Morality[/u]
Wednesday, 3 April 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;I want to say that the difference between these two ideas is really the same difference between the two domains of justice which were mentioned in Plato&#39;s Euthyphro. In that dialogue, Euthyphro spoke of justice being of two parts: morality (or piety), which is about having the right relationship with gods, and ethics, which is about having the right relationship with fellow humans.&quot;[/b]
