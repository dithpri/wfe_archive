What exactly is wrong with paternalism?[/u]
Thursday, 25 April 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;Paternalism is wrong because it presumes to have a certain kind of knowledge about the subject, which it doesn&#39;t. And the knowledge that&#39;s relevant to what is wrong with paternalism has to do with knowledge about what sorts of things are considered good for the subject in question. The problem is that what is good for a person largely depends on what that person&#39;s specific projects, or ends, are. And without knowing what these are, then actually nobody can justly presume paternalistic attitudes in regards to a person. (Possibly, not even her own self.)&quot;[/b]
