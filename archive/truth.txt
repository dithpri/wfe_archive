[b]&quot;If Socrates is correct, and presuming that we also wish to be just, then we ought to engage in acts and activities that contain intrinsic pleasures no matter what the world or society or says about those acts and activities. Even if the world condemns us according to its conventional standards, we must care more for justice than we do care about any possible benefits we may receive (and its derivative pleasures) and we must refrain from acquiescing to the demands of the mob.&quot;
