&quot;Learning without a teacher&quot;[/u]
Tuesday, October 2, 2018.


Excerpt:
&quot;And so, just because the Stoics lay claim to the figure of Socrates for themselves, it&#39;s not necessarily the case that Socrates would condone the message of the Stoics. It&#39;s possible to learn from Nature, without it necessarily being the case that Nature intended to teach.&quot;[/b]
