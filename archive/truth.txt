Excerpt:
&quot;I suppose there&#39;s a third option... that Kant is having a joke with himself. That is, he gets to some logical conclusion based on the Stoics and the Aristotelians, and concludes that there is no true &quot;morality&quot; (at least, not in the traditional Christian/Catholic sense of that word) &#150;and that basically, humanity has been taken for a ride by the philosophers. The joke (to himself) is that, as a philosopher, he can himself see the flaws of the philosophical arguments, but that nobody else seems to. And so, he unpacks it for anyone who cares to follow his analysis.&quot;
