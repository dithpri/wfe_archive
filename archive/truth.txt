Wisdom: the skill of deliberating well[/u]
Sunday, 13 January 2019. 

Excerpt:
&quot;But Plato supposes that people always intend good, and that the only thing which sets people apart are their ability to execute their good wills. For Plato, it is this that makes a person &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;, rather than whether they have good intentions or not (since everybody has some form of good intentions). And so, for Plato, deliberating and arriving at a good or &quot;correct&quot; conclusion is to execute good thinking, since thinking is considered a skill for Plato.&quot;[/b]
