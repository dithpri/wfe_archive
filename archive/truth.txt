The Good[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;And then, I think that the &quot;good&quot; is defined by what is good to the person. But Stoics suppose that what is &quot;good&quot; is defined by what is good for the person. I think that they suppose this just because they were taught to revere Socrates, and Socrates was the sort of person for whom the things which he found desirable and good to him also just happened to be the very things that were good for him. 
But this latter thing is accidental (a mere association), and it is not properly part of the definition of &quot;good&quot; &#151; for the &quot;good&quot; is, properly speaking, just whatever we love.&quot;[/b]
