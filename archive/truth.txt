Quantity vs. Quality[/u]
Sunday, 14 April 2019

Excerpt:
&quot;But Bentham/Sidgwick&#39;s utilitarianism would seek to increase the quantity of beings whose happiness counts. Those who deliberately abstain from having children, and those who intentionally have much less children than they otherwise could, are punished under these rules. And those who have scores of children, whether by deliberate choice or by careless irresponsibility, are rewarded under these rules. At some point, I think that the whole world will just go to hell, under these rules!&quot;[/b]
