&quot;What is &quot;thinking&quot;?&quot;[/u]
Thursday, October 11, 2018.


Excerpt:
&quot;Thinking involves more than just an ability to perform mathematical calculations or to process data in a logical way. More precisely, thinking is the ability to establish new connections between otherwise disjointed pieces of data; it is to create meaning and order in a random universe. Thinking is genuinely an act of creation. This, then, is the essence of what it is &quot;to think&quot;.&quot;[/b]
