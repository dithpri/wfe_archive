Gods can die an infinite number of deaths, but mortals only die once[/u]
Friday, 26 April 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot; And if Socrates willingly chose to be a human sacrifice to save Athens knowing that he would surely lose his life, then he surely gave up more than Jesus ever could have, because Jesus (as we are told) was not a mortal being -- and so his death is not such a great loss! For, gods can die again and again, infinitely. But mortals can only die (and live) once.&quot;[/b]
