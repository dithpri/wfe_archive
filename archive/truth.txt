Beyond utility[/u]
Monday, 21 January 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;But here, I found myself wondering why value must spring from a source that itself has some value? Isn&#39;t it possible for value to be conferred upon something, but by something which itself has no value itself? Is this not possible? Is the worry (Aristotle&#39;s and Korsgaard&#39;s) that if something has no value, that this is the same as something having the least amount of value? But surely, there can be, and are, things that are beyond value, beyond utility or function in relation to us, beyond &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; &#151; things which can&#39;t be subjected to our judgment.&quot;[/b]
