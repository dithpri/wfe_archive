Excerpt:
I kind of wish that someone had told me what a &#147;philosopher&#148; was, at that time. Being a philosopher, one can build things with concepts, just as much as one builds things with materials. And one can deconstruct and analyze thoughts and propositions in order to understand how it was put together and why, just as much as one can break apart some piece of machinery in order to understand how it was put together and why...

It would have been perfect for me. I could even be a superhero.
