Metaphor in Symposium[/u]
Friday, 22 March 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;The metaphor takes the simile to the next level by asserting that two apparently distinct things are, in essence, the same thing. They are not merely alike in some way, but rather, the two things are literally instances of the same essence. And this thinking is reflected in the way that we use metaphor vs similes. &quot;[/b]
