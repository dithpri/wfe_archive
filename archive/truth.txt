Excerpt:
&quot;I mean, think that a newer inclination could compete with an older inclination. And at times like that, we may feel the need to reconsider, and it&#39;s at least possible that from that reconsideration, we may change our minds about what we want to be doing and why. And if we do change our minds, as I think that we&#39;re certainly allowed to do, then we would be changing what our duty looks like, as well. &quot;[/b]
