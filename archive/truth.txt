The Virtue of Sensitivity[/u]
Wednesday, 23 January 2019. 

Excerpt:
&quot;But Socratic sophrosune is &quot;sensitivity&quot;. And for Socrates, to act in accordance with one&#39;s inclinations isn&#39;t necessarily to &quot;act like an animal&quot;, as Tamar (or even Korsgaard) would have put it. For Socrates, to act in accordance with one&#39;s inclinations is really to &quot;act like an excellent human being&quot;.&quot;[/b]
