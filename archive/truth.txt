Excerpt:
&quot;
And since rationality neither &quot;feels&quot; satisfied, nor does it experience pleasure, if we are to rely on rationality to tell us anything about the rightness and wrongness of actions, it would really end up being a matter of whether the action in question stands as a logical contradiction to some fundamental, common, and inalienable premise, than it would be a question of whether an action is contrary to human happiness. &quot;[/b]
