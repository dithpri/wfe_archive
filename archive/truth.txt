&quot;The separation of mind and body&quot;
[/u][/b]Monday, June 18, 2018.

&quot;I might end up arguing that though the two kinds of knowledge could be separated enough to operate independently from the other in some sense, ultimately, I don&#39;t think that they are quite as independent as one might think they are (nor are they meant to be).

That is, maybe it&#39;s possible for them to be separated to some extent -- and certainly, they are distinct -- but perhaps they are not so completely separate just at the moment, and perhaps it is actually better for us if they do not separate so completely.&quot;
