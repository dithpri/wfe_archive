A class of beings[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;But I think that he doesn&#39;t have the right to have intentions for all individuals, just himself and his own kind perhaps. I would rather renounce my humanity than to give someone like Austin the right to make decisions about me and my future. I would rather that I will simply state that Austin and I are not of the same class of beings, or even the same category of beings. And therefore, he has no right to make any kinds of decisions about me, for he lacks the appropriate intuitions that would prepare him with the insight necessary to make correct judgments about me.&quot;[/b]
