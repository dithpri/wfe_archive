The Rational Tradition[/u]
Friday, 29 March 2019 &amp;#129419;.

Excerpt:
&quot;Aristotle is preferred over Plato because Aristotle is more practical in his ethical advice, and though he retains some of the rationalism incited by Plato et al ... his is more of an &quot;animalistic&quot; rationalism, such that it aims for happiness rather than authenticity (the latter is what Plato&#39;s rationalism aims for). In other words, Aristotle is much more likely to do things like compromise and to conform, than is Plato; there is little danger of radicalism in Aristotle. His ethics aims for the &quot;mean&quot; in all things. &quot;[/b]
