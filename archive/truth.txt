[b][u]&quot;LESSONS FROM SOCRATES&quot;[/u][/b]

&quot;That said, I too agree that loyalty is a quality to be praised (since it benefits others), but being loyal to anything that is at odds with one&#146;s own conscience is necessarily a moral wrong. Does Leaf not believe so? As a Classicist, surely, he&#146;s had the opportunity to learn the lesson from Socrates, even if he hadn&#146;t yet learned the lessons of the Third Reich and Nazism.&quot;
