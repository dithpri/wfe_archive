Excerpt:
&quot;And the word &quot;with&quot; stuck out for me. And I knew that the word for what I was feeling was love. For I realized that what really made me have these feelings about H was just the &quot;being there&quot; within that environment, because it was while I was there that I gained and grew the most, and in the way that I wanted, and so, I felt alive and strong.&quot;[/b]
