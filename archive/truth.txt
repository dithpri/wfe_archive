&quot;Three domains of truth: Chaos, Math, and Mind&quot;
[/u]Tuesday, July 3, 2018.

Excerpt:
&quot;First, there is mathematical truth, which is the truth of &quot;propositions&quot;. . . 
And then there is the chaos of non-cognitive truth, which can&#39;t even really be talked about because the only way that we can know it is by experiencing it -- which means that it goes through an interpretive process before we can even begin to think/talk about it. . . 
Then finally, there&#39;s another kind of truth, which is in the domain of the mind.&quot;
