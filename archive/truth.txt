Excerpt:
&quot;So long as the thinking-thing is logically implied by its activity, it would be logically contradictory to say that the thinking-thing ceases to exist while it is still performing the activity of thinking. Well, for it to be a logical truth for the thinking-thing to disappear the moment it&#39;s not the object of thought, the modus ponens that implies the existence of a subject given a verb must be withdrawn as a true premise. But no philosopher, and no scientist, and no linguist, will ever want to do that.&quot;
