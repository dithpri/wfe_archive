What we each deserve[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;Well, as I have already said, I disagree with Bentham that punishment is something that anyone could ever deserve. It just isn&#39;t something &quot;to be deserved&quot; -- not by anyone, and not for any reason whatsoever. That is to say, my view is that if it is indeed true that everyone aims for the good, then nobody ever could deserve punishment.&nbsp;That would be perverse, I think, for it would be to return bad for good.&quot;[/b]
