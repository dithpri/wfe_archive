Excerpt:
&quot;&quot;...it wouldn&#39;t follow from this that a picture cannot itself be a representation of a propositional content. For on one standard view of what propositions are, they are &quot;functions from possible worlds into truth values&quot; (Stalnaker 1972); and on such an account (whether or not it takes reference to &#39;possible worlds&#39; at face value) pictures, maps, memories or anything else that represents the world as being some way can qualify as propositional representations.&quot; (Moran, p.19)&quot;[/b]
