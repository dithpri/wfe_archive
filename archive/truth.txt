&quot;The presumption of being homo&quot;
[/u][/b]Sunday, June 24, 2018.

&quot;If the moral statement is the conclusion of a logical argument involving a modus ponens structure, then it could be assessed as being either true or false. But, without the whole argument made explicit, the assertion of the conclusion by itself would imply that the &#39;speaker&#39; either knows or presumes correctly what the &#39;listener&#39; truly wants. For, unless you either knew or guessed correctly that I wanted to go to Larissa, you couldn&#39;t tell me that taking this road was the &quot;correct&quot; way for me....
