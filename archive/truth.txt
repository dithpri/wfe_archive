&quot;The duty of being true to one&#39;s self&quot;[/u]
Friday, August 10, 2018.

Excerpt:
&quot;Which means that, for Kant, a certain minimal level of intelligence is required to be someone capable of producing actions with moral worth -- since, a person must be capable of thinking up a universal maxim of some sort under which her being true to herself would be considered a duty. (Perhaps my own maxim that what is worse ought never to rule over what is better.)&quot;
