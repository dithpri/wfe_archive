&quot;For one thing, I suppose it would explain why the masses of people take an interest in certain people who are not their own selves (eg, royalty, celebrities, athletes, their children, racial groups, etc) and in certain things beyond their own selves (eg, nations, clubs, goal/project, company/workplace, religion, etc). I suppose that there is a grandness in an algorithm which allows individuals to take a personal interest in what are in essence impersonal things.&quot;
