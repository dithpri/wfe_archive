Excerpt:
&quot;But the man, and still more the woman, who can be accused either of doing &#145;what nobody does,&#146; or of not doing &#145;what everybody does,&#146; is the subject of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she had committed some grave moral delinquency. Persons require to possess a title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of people of rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they like without detriment to their estimation.&quot; [/b]
