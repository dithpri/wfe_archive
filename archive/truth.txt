&quot;Irrational spring of action conflicting with...knowledge&quot;[/u]
Tuesday, 9 April 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;The only time I can imagine an &quot;irrational spring of action conflicting with...knowledge&quot; is when I determine that it is the right thing to commit suicide, but my animals instinct for survival and its hatred of extreme pain prevents me from doing violence to myself. But even in this case, my choice would still be to kill myself and end my life, even if I cannot bring myself to cause myself pain that is beyond a certain degree. Probably, someone else would have to help me accomplish this. &quot;[/b]
