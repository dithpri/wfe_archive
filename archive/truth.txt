Excerpt:
&quot;In the dream, I was feeling regretful about how I had imagined that she died &#151;disappointed, sad, bitter, alone. But in the dream, she was quite nice (unlike her usual self, which is not very nice) and she patted me on my back and saying to me in a very mature and motherly tone, &quot;No, don&#39;t worry. You did nothing wrong. Really, you did nothing wrong.&quot; And I remember waking up from my dream feeling...&quot;
