&quot;But the &quot;self&quot; is not a bad thing. It is a great and wondrous thing. It is the object of our greatest love. And when we realize that what is true in one instance, is also true in all... that realization is what it is to love humanity, and even beyond it. And I believe that that love is genuine and real.&quot;
