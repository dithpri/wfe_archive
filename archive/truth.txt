Excerpt:
&quot;Since virtue is a &quot;state of mind&quot; for Aristotle (per the Nicomachean Ethics), presumably, you can&#39;t just &quot;give&quot; such a thing to a person. But perhaps by immersing an individual who is already predisposed in certain ways in certain kinds of environments, whether she is so predisposed by nature or by experience, it may be possible to induce the desirable states of mind in those individuals. Sometimes, the same environment may produce different states of mind in different individuals. And sometimes, different environments for different individuals may produce the same state of mind.&quot;[/b]
