Evolution: The Will to Power[/u]
Wednesday, 24 April 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;A will to power isn&#39;t a movement from weakness to power. What it really is, is power wanting to express itself freely, without impediment, and without hindrance, and with maximal fullness. It is the will to be, to exist. It is... movement, change &#151; life!&quot;[/b]
