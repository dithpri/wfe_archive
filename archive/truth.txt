&quot;To be leading correctly, these two things alone -- true belief and episteme -- the man who carries these, guides correctly. The correct things coming to be from chance do not come to be by means of human guidance. But, where there is human guidance to what&#39;s correct, [are] these two things: true belief and episteme.&quot; (Meno 99a, tr. me)
