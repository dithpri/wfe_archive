Excerpt:
&quot;For I would be unable to understand that the world I view through the filter of my &quot;mind&quot; is not the true nature of reality and that instead, what I see with my mind is merely an image, a copy, of the true nature of reality. And so, since I could never get around my own vantage point of the world, I could never stand in the position to see that I do have a mind of my own and that I am a distinct subject. (To do this requires a bit of an imagination.)&quot;[/b]
