&quot;In my experience, &#147;black&#148; people are liars. (If there really are such things as &#147;black&#148; people.) They occasionally produce brilliant moral arguments &#151; but only because it is expedient to their political agendas. They don&#146;t believe in the arguments which they employ. No, they use the arguments that they do simply because they&#146;re effective in some context &#151; but not because they take them to be true.&quot;
