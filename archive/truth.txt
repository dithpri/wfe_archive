Excerpt:
&quot;SOCRATES: Well, Callicles, if human beings didn&#39;t share common experiences, some sharing one, others sharing another, but one of us had some unique experience not shared by others, it wouldn&#39;t be easy for him to communicate what he experienced to the other.&quot; (Gorgias, 481c-d)
