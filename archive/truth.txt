&quot;The incorrigibility of the Mind&quot;[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;...But I don&#39;t think that empirical verification is somehow less constant or less truthful than mathematical verification, so Kant is wrong to think that. After all, Hesiod has told us that Gaia (material) and Erebos (the &quot;non&quot; of &quot;non-contradiction&quot;) are ontologically intertwined, and at the same &quot;level&quot; (Chaos). It is Zeus (mind) who is descended from Gaia&#39;s line. If he took the poets seriously, then he&#39;d have known this.&quot;
