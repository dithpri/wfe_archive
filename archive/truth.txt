&quot;To be loved, to be considered a friend&quot;[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;Of course, I must always return to reflect upon the etymology of a word. The English word &quot;freedom&quot; itself has Anglo-Saxon roots. &quot;Free&quot; means: beloved, friend, love. So, according to the presumed original way of usage, to be &quot;free&quot; is to be &quot;loved&quot;, and to be considered a &quot;friend&quot;.&quot;
