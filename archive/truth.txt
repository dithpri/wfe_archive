A life worth living[/u]
Tuesday, 19 March 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;But this option, ie of having their life examined without having to suffer or die young in order to be so examined, is not always open to the &quot;average person&quot;. Pedigree can make a person interesting, just by having been born. (This just seems to be the prerogative of the ruling class.) And for them, if they want to be an even more &quot;stand up&quot; individual, then they can write books or become actors, or do other things that aren&#39;t so life-threatening; this way is opened for them so that they can find a way to pursue a life worth living without having to throw themselves into a subway trough.&quot;[/b]
