Preserving the beautiful and the sublime[/u]

[April Fool&#39;s Day: Happy New Year!].

Excerpt:
&quot;And I am wondering whether this also applies to people who either committed suicide or are suicidal now. If so, then should we think of the suicide as a way to &quot;save&quot; or to &quot;preserve&quot; the beautiful and the sublime from becoming corrupted somehow? Or should we think that suicide and/or suicidal thoughts are somehow indications of failure to make correct judgment about the beautiful and the sublime?

If it were me, I would think... the former?&quot;[/b]
