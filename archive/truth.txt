&quot;A morality of self-love&quot;[/u]
Sunday, July 22, 2018

Excerpt:
&quot;I will jump right to the conclusion of such a system of morality, and at the risk of sounding quite cheesy or perhaps clich&eacute;, I will say that briefly put, it all amounts to a morality of self-love. And, I would emphasize &quot;love&quot; here. To some Kantians, Eros gets no respect; it&#39;s always either Gaia or Erebos or Zeus. But what about Eros? (And even Tartaros?)&quot;
