&quot;Imagination is more important than Knowledge.&quot;[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;... Recall from the beginning of paragraph 6 that a human being is said to possess a mind that has &quot;independence of reason from merely subjectively determining causes&quot; (underline added). And I think that this capability of the mind is really just very simply, &quot;having an imagination&quot;. It&#39;s not really anything quite more than that. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s obvious, I think, that we all do possess it &#151; even if we each use it in varying degrees.&quot;
