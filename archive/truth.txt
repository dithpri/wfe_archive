[b]But Marx&#39;s strategy in inciting communism is to get the poor and stupid plebs to revolt against the rich and more clever plebs. This is because the peasants make the world worse (in Marx&#39;s view) by inculcating the world with its values. But neither of these two groups -- the rich peasants and the poor peasants -- are aristocrats. But Marx is an aristocrat. He thinks that the world should be led by various kinds of talented people and beautiful people, and not by the values of the greedy peasants who just happened to have struck it rich.[/b]
