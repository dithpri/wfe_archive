&quot;Intuition&quot;
[/u]Thursday, June 28, 2018.

&quot;An intuition is a knack, an innate talent. And it comes from PK.
&#149; All PK are TB. But some TB are not necessarily PK.
&#149; Only TB can become EK, because PK itself cannot be directly J. (Presumably, it&#39;s because PK doesn&#39;t need it.) But the TB that&#39;s ushered in by PK can be J. And the TB+J=EK. So, in order to get EK, one needs the TB to bind with J, because FB bound to J is BS.
&#149; And so, PK matters.&quot;
