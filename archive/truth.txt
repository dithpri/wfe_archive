Excerpt:
&quot;She recommends taking the paternalistic stance towards the treatment of animals. But this is, even on its literal face, problematic, since we&#39;re not the other animals and therefore, we cannot know what really is best for them for their own sake. Even when we think that we know what&#39;s best for them, there&#39;s still the worry that we&#39;re still influenced by a certain bias, resulting in a decision that&#39;s best for them only for our own sake.&quot;[/b]
