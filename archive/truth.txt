Because they are friends[/u]
Sunday, January 6, 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;The important difference here is that two people reciprocate because they are friends, and they are not friends because they reciprocate. Which means that some people may not reciprocate, and still be friends with one another. And finally, some reciprocate and are not &quot;friends&quot;. &quot;[/b]
