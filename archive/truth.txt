Why forgiveness is a mark of genuine friendship[/u]
Monday, January 7, 2019.

Excerpt:
&quot;According to the ancient Greeks, a &quot;friend&quot; is someone to whom you give good things to and not someone from whom you expect to receive good things. And this is why forgiveness is a mark of genuine friendship, since forgiveness just means to give someone something before they have given you anything, and before you have a promise from them to give you a reason to expect reciprocation &#151; &quot;[/b]
