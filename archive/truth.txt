Ethical evaluations are not meant to be universalized[/u]

Excerpt:
&quot;But these extrinsic elements do not remain the same as the moment when the initial ethical ethical judgment was made. And in a new situation with different extrinsic elements, the same action may receive a different ethical judgment from the one we would have made under initial conditions. Which means that if relied on a generalization made about an action so that it applies to the class of actions, then we would probably end up with false judgments!&quot;[/b]
