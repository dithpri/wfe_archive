The &quot;stuff&quot; itself (ie, nameless-material)[/u]
Friday, July 13, 2018 &amp;#128520;

Excerpt:
&quot;...What Plato was thinking of when he spoke of such things was the nameless-matter, that &quot;stoff&quot; (in lieu of Aristotle&#39;s &quot;substance&quot;) all around us which cannot be called anything yet or even given any name yet, since even as a concept it is still insufficiently formed in the mind (by the mind&#39;s filtering process). So, the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; is not the idea itself, but rather the nameless-material-stuff which is itself the &quot;real&quot; whatever-it-is that ends up being the representation/idea in our minds.&quot;
