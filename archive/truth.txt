&quot;A probably *true* belief&quot;
[/u]Wednesday, July 4, 2018

Excerpt:
&quot;Ultimately though, I wonder if it changes anything for me though, because I had also concluded (by the time I had finished Geach&#39;s article), that the content of the result of such judgments needn&#39;t be **true** to be TRUE. The process of logical deduction isn&#39;t meant to provide us with certainty in the **truth** of what is arrived at logically. To believe that would be to be a metaphysician, rather than to be a philosopher. What the process of logical deduction is meant to do is to provide the best guess possible at a probably **true** belief.&quot;
