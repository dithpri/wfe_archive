Why knowledge makes a person better[/u]
Wednesday, 17 April 2019. 

Excerpt:
&quot;But one thing is for certain: Plato/Socrates&#39; culture is a shame culture... That is why knowledge makes a person better. Having a good will is common to all; it is not the distinguishing feature between two men who might otherwise be the same. For Socrates and Plato, it is differences in knowledge which make one person better than another, for everyone means well.&quot;[/b]
