This region consists of many different geographical interests and styles, from tall, snowy mountains to large rolling plains, all the way to the few marshlands. It&#39;s pretty much a mini-Earth with a vast landscape, most of which is untouched.
The few nations that reside within the Roaming Lands live in harmony with the environment causing as little damage as possible and repairing any that is caused within days of the infliction.
