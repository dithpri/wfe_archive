   We hold deez nuts to truth and we HATE cashews.
   Rule #1 Any talk about cashews in positive manner will be suppressed except when doing legal documents.
   Rule #2 When referring to food you must say, &quot;WHERE&#39;S MA&#39; PECAN PIE?!&quot; after the sentence (Rule is not official, it&#39;s just a joke).

Our official recruitment telegram: Please join The United Nuts Of Deez and grow with us! We are a new region looking for people like you to make it great.
