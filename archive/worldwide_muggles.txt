You know what muggles are, right? If you don&#39;t, feel free to Google it. We are all muggles (HP Muggles), so we are all welcome. We are a peaceful region, and we will accept embassies with any other region. We accept nations of all political views.

Racism, spam, sexism &amp; religious debates will not be tolerated. You may always criticize, but never offend. Any racist, sexist, anti-gay, quotes will be punishable by permanent ban from the region.

Important notice: Our strong ally, [region]Indian Sub Continent[/region] is currently at war with [region]true africa[/region]. Altough [region]Worldwide Muggles[/region] is not threatened, I ask of all nations to keep an eye out for suspicious activity. The SROs are on high alert.
