[color=blue]Hello[/color] and [color=red]welcome[/color] to the [region]Jagged Peaks[/region], our current leader is also our Founder; [nation=short]Genera[/nation]

[hr]

So far, we have no forum topic or a [color=blue]World Assembly[/color] presence. However, we hope for that to change as more nations become a part of this Region.

[hr]

If you join and are a part of the [color=blue]World Assembly[/color], we hope that you will endorse our [color=red]Delegate[/color]. Or campaign to become the representative for the [region]Jagged Peaks[/region]. The Delegate has Executive authority over the Region. However, as our Founder, [nation=short+noflag]Genera[/nation] can easily deter Raider groups.

[hr]

We do not as of yet have a Regional [color=green]Government[/color] besides the one provided by NationStates, but we can create one as soon as we have enough members.

Anyway, have fun and help us grow!

[nation]Genera[/nation]
