Silver Isles is a collection of large, mountainous islands and dozens of atolls. Most information regarding its history and people is shrouded by a haze nearly as thick as the fog that frequently shrouds the isles themselves. This fiercely secretive and secular region has established trade and diplomatic relations with a few regions, but unauthorized visits into the waters around Silver Isles virtually always result in ships going missing with all hands. This independent and isolationist region has a significant and formidable fleet of fast, maneuverable warships and is rumored to have a privateer fleet just as large.  

All authorized visits are limited to the beautiful but isolated Isle of Greenwood, which hosts all embassies.
