The region of Central Texas is one of the few remaining habitable regions of the former United States of America. It is geographically part of the greater Texas area, but as of yet, politically independent. 

The Constitutional Monarchy of Catholic Rochelle is the Founder. Other members of the region must also have an official Church that is in full communion with the Holy Father (Bishop of Rome and Apostolic Successor of the Chair of St. Peter) but also must respect the religious views of citizens. Freedom of religion (except for religions advocating violence or the occult) shall be maintained for citizens.
