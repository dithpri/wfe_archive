Time is not a favorable friend to Omega Ultra Awesome Land, seeing as how time itself was ripped from the cold lifeless hands of Zeus to create this amazing place. History is not sure how, or why the land came to be, only one survivor lived to tell the tale...and then he died so no one knows anymore. So clearly we came from a genetically superior breed of super humans. Also, we were able to construct the first and only giga-tron laser which has been passed down from generation to generation. Unfortunately we have come to the realization that all other nations and regions despise us, and wish to see our demise....but we have a big mutha truckin laser beam!!! Booyah!!!
