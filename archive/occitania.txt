Our prestigious region is open to EUROPEAN NATIONS who fit the following criteria:

1.) You MUST BE royal or have a ruling royal family, peaceful, stable, &amp;amp; loyal.
2.) You MUST HAVE a European/European looking flag.
3.) You MUST immediately accept the Occitan Euro as your ONLY currency and reflect it.
4.) And MUST register and join one of the Representative Houses, The Merovingian Order or Koniglich Ostsiedlung, and be a somewhat active member and vote.

Note: We are VERY tolerant and want to build relationships with everyone. Be whatever - all we ask is that you JUST BE EUROPEAN, ROYAL and accept our strict criteria.
