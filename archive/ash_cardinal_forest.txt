Welcome to Ash Cardinal Forest. Every corner of our region is filled with beautiful people, countries, and animals. Experience our region and join today to see our forests, oceans, and cities. We want to give a shout out to all of the national animals in this region, the ash cardinal, Maxwell, doge, the goose, the leopard, the sheep, the dove, and Amare. We plan on adding a discord and many other features once our small region grows.
