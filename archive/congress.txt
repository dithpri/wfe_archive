Suggesting a law: To suggest a law (Congressmen) you post the law in the format shown in &quot;Proposing Regional Legislation&quot; for NON-Congressmen you need to contact your party&#39;s senator/representative (show above) and send them the law in proper format. If you have no party contact a senator/representative of the Republican Party.
