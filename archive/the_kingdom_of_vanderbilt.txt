We are a new region, and I am working on starting it up and working to make it great. Please bare with me, this is my first region that I have founded by myself though I have worked in many regions, am experienced, and have helped to create several new regions. This is a great time to get involved and become an important person in a region.
Thank you
-His Holy Majesty
King Theodore 
of the Houses Vanderbilt and of Grey-Anumia the First of His Name.
