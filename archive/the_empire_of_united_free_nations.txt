We&#39;re back in business guys!!! If you are seeing this that means that the Adylica account has been restored!!! For the time being until we grow we are a protectorate of Lardyland! For our eventual freedom and prosperity we want YOU to send a nation to the UFN.

                        I approve this message

We want people to send puppets over and be at least somewhat active to boost regional activity so we can grow! For now we are a Lardyland protectorate, but this region will become more self-governing as it grows.
