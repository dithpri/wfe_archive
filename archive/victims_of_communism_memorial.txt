[b]Communism&amp;#39;s Crimes Against Humanity[/b]

In October 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution gave birth to the deadliest ideology in human history - Communism. In less than 100 years, Communism has claimed more than 100 million lives. Today, it continues to enslave one-fifth of the world&amp;#39;s people.
