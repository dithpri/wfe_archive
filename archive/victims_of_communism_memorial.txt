[b]Communism&amp;#39;s Crimes Against Humanity[/b]

In October 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution gave birth to the deadliest ideology in human history - Communism. In less than 100 years, Communism has claimed more than 100 million lives. Today, it continues to enslave one-fifth of the world&amp;#39;s people.

*The VICTIMS OF COMMUNISM MEMORIAL is open to all who wish to offer thoughtful commentary or to acknowledge those who&amp;#39;ve lost their lives to failed Communist ideology. [color=660000][b]Communist propaganda and insults will no longer be tolerated. Debate is unwelcome.[/b][/color]
