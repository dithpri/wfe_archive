 Men ARE born with a superpower: the power to change the future. In the Still Standing International Union that is what we aim to do. We shoot for the moon and land on the stars. We rule with compassion and unrelenting force. An eye for an eye, a mind for a mind, and helping hand for a fellow brother. Stand strong and never freeze.
