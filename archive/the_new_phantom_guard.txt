Risen from the ashes caused by the back-stabbing of [nation]The Phantom Delegation[/nation], we have been reborn like a phoenixes!
We welcome anybody (as long as they are not raiders), especially those who have been painfully back-stabbed.

An old Saying from an old region...

[i]Rainbows dont light up the sky unless you let it rain! And shiny apples are sometimes filled with worms, but you cant give up your laughter just because of a little thing. It&#146;s a lesson that an old region never learned, no matter how much I scolded them, but their heart is still what ruled them, sometimes you gotta let it burn....[/i]
