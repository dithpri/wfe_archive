[region]The Great Borderstates[/region] was founded around a natural anomaly that creates pockets of environments within a certain region. The 4 founding nations chose their place to settle and started The Great Borderstates surrounding this anomaly. This led to huge spatial variations and environmental changes within the surrounding areas, from large deserts with winds of abnormal speeds that rip through the local plant life, to freezing plateaus of Ice and snow whereupon great revolutions lie. The space in which these environments meet is a catastrophic contortion of land and nature. As more nations settle within The Great Borderstates, the anomaly inexplicably expands to meet the requirements.
