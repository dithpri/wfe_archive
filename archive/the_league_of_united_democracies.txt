The League of United Democracies (LUD) is a team of nations designed for one thing: Preserving true democracy. There are tons of nations out there that say they are a democratic state, while in reality, they&#39;re all completely fake, or outright lying. We thrive on smaller nations, helping them build, and giving them a chance to say something, just like a true democracy. So, if you are a small nation, or even a bigger one, and want a voice in the WA or simply in the LUD, then we got the place for you!
