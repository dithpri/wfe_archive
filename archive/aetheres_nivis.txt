[color=#4400cc]Aetheres Nivis is a nordic, isolated region.[/color]

[color=#0066cc]We do not require a lot from our nations, which in turn means that the region can not be properly categorized as, for example, anti-communist. Still, in order to gain citizenship, a telegram has to first be sent to [nation]Postalies[/nation] or [nation]Bardum[/nation]. We still accept all embassies as long as they do not bring damage to the region.

The map of Aetheres Nivis is being worked on by our amateur cartographer, Chris Edler. The latest sketches and pictures of the unfinished map can be found in the public Archive of Aetheres Nivis.
