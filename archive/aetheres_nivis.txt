[color=#4400cc]Aetheres Nivis is a nordic, isolated region.[/color]

[color=#0066cc]We do not require a lot from our nations, which in turn means that the region can not be properly categorized as, for example, anti-communist. Still, in order to gain citizenship, a telegram has to first be sent to [nation]Postalies[/nation] or [nation]Bardum[/nation]. We still accept all embassies as long as they do not bring damage to the region.
