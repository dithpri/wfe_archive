[color=#4400cc]Aetheres Nivis is an isolated region located in the north.[/color]

[color=#0066cc]We do not require a lot from our nations, which in turn means that the region can&#39;t be properly categorized as (for example) anti-communist. Still, in order to gain citizenship, a telegram has to first be sent to [nation]Postalies[/nation] or [nation]Bardum[/nation]. This is due to the nations voting for closed borders. We still accept all embassies as long as it does not bring damage to the region.

The map of Aetheres Nivis is being worked on by our amateur cartographer, Chris Edler. The latest sketches and pictures of the unfinished map can be found in the public Archive of Aetheres Nivis. This link leads to the pictures officially uploaded by Chris Edler.
