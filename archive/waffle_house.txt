Waffle House, Inc. is a restaurant chain with 2,100 locations. It is sticky yet homey. It is somewhat dangerous and a sketchy place; however, ignoring all of that it is a rather pleasant place to be! 

Did you know Waffle House servers 145 waffles per minute? Did you know that FEMA uses a &quot;Waffle House Index&quot; to measure the severity of natural disasters? Waffle House will prevail through all. It is strong, dedicated, and it is not to be messed with. Those part of Waffle House are almost proud to be part of it. It serves almost mediocre food, which is an accomplishment. With the help of others, Waffle House will expand and grow as a restaurant chain and nation. 

It has a strong list of [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1477814]rules[/url] that are to be read and worshipped as well.
