[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their friends in [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=valle_de_arena]The Sekhmet Legion[/url], noticed that there was a great debate raging throughout nationstates about whether or not pineapple belonged on pizza.

Now, being the good raiders they are, they were in full support of pineapple on pizza, and decided they must do anything to defend this great food.

They barged into region after region handing out free pineapple on pizza and praising its glory, if you too wish to do this[url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
