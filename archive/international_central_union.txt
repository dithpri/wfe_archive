Most of the regions disappoint you, they sell you what is not, you do not feel comfortable, etc. Therefore, I have decided to create a new one in which, with the help of new members, we will create a different region, a region to say home. (I have enough experience, despite having created a new nation)

Discord (Main communication system): https://discord.gg/FtnGtbT (Link to enter only the first time)

Forum: Those who can teach me how to configure it are welcome.

Government: It will be based on an innovative style of democratic government, when it reaches a considerable number of members. (Initially, those who help create the region or recruit new members, will be the first members of the government)
