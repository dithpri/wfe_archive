[color=crimson][b]Scottsboro[/b][/color], the ancient Europeian port city on Scott&#39;s Bay, plays host to the modern-day operational headquarters of the  [b]Europeian Republican Navy[/b]. While times have changed, this historic settlement on the shores of the Southern Sea hasn&#39;t. Visitors can still climb to the top of the Scottsboro Lighthouse, nearly as old as it is colossal, and look out over the array of ships in the bay and the naval base on the opposite point of the deep natural harbor.
