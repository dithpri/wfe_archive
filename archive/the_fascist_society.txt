[hr][b][color=#0055ff]This fascist region[/color] [color=#1463cc]has been freed by Liberlandia,[/color] [color=#277199]the Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army,[/color] [color=#3b7e66]and an assorted group[/color] [color=#4e8c33]of valiant friends![/color][/b][hr]

The Fascist Society, founded by Vxy with the intention to establish a &quot;haven&quot; against &quot;communism and liberalism&quot; for fascists, was conquered on 13 October 2025 by a group of Liberlandians and mercenaries. Following this initial assault, sailors from The East piled on the region to support its destruction and capture. 

No quarter for fascists. The righteous prevail.

[hr]&quot;When evil-doing comes like falling rain, nobody calls out, &#39;Stop!&#39;
When crimes begin to pile up, they become invisible.
When sufferings become unendurable, the cries are no longer heard.
The cries, too, fall like rain in summer.&quot;

&#151; Bertolt Brecht[hr]
