Official Region for the JHC History class of year 13. This region has been set up as a relatively accurate simulation of New Zealand parliament.

Over the course of the next few weeks, a number of things will take place. Firstly, classmates will be separated into their respective Political Parties. These parties are loosely based on the political parties already in office in NZ.

But there is more to come.
