We are a newly found region that holds interest in only building allies with other regions/nations whether big or small/old or newly founded!!. Members and allies seek only to protect each other/personal interests so they may run their nations and regions how they see fit without any interference. Newly founded regions and nations are welcome with open arms and encourage to join us and together transform Horizion into a hub of knowledge where viewpoints and ideas or conversation can be exchanged in neutral territory.  For entry to our glorious region send a telegram to The Trade Conglomerate who is region overseer of security and communications.
