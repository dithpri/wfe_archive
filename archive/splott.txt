[colour=baby][b][u]Welcome to Splott![/b][/u][/colour]

[colour=cyan][font=Courier][b]We are the home of all regions who love [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZE1WzOwtQQ]boats[/url], Eurovision, and Spotify daylists. We don&#39;t take ourselves too seriously, we were founded on a group of friends who just wanted a single region between us in March 2025. We&#39;re accepting of all non-fascist nations, and we enjoy collecting embassies - feel free to send us requests.[/b][/font]

[font=Courier]Unlike a lot of regions, we&#39;re not going to tell you how to vote on World Assembly resolutions. [i]Members are strongly encouraged to endorse [nation]Anaqua[/nation] for WA Delegate, though![/i][/font]

[font=Courier]You can also join the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=2639458]Splott Currency Area[/url] by changing your currency to &quot;Splott&quot;. An integrated region for an integrated future!
