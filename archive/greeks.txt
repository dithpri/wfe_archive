Greeks are an ethnic group native to Greece, Cyprus, Albania, Anatolia, Southern Italy, and other regions. 
We also form a significant diaspora, with communities established around the world.

Greek colonies have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, 
but our people have always been centered around the Aegean and Ionian seas, where Greek has been spoken since antiquity.
Our cultural centers have included Athens, Thessalonica, Alexandria, Smyrna, and Constantinople at various periods.

Greek people have greatly influenced and contributed to culture, arts, exploration, literature, philosophy, 
politics, architecture, music, mathematics, science and technology, business, cuisine, and sports.
