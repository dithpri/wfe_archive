[color=#0073CF]Greeks are an ethnic group native to Greece, Cyprus, Albania, Anatolia, and Southern Italy. 
We also form a significant diaspora, with communities established around the world.

Greek colonies have been historically established on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, 
but we have always been centered around the Aegean and Ionian seas, where Greek has been spoken since antiquity.

Greek people have greatly influenced and contributed to culture, arts, exploration, literature, philosophy, 
politics, architecture, music, mathematics, science and technology, business, cuisine, and sports.

Greeks dispatch embassy requests to decent and civilized regions.
We also accept most embassy requests. Feel free to send, any time.[/color]
