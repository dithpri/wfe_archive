Party, people! We&amp;#39;re the real deal [b]Greeks[/b]!

This is the old school [b]Greece[/b]! None of that Byzantine-Ottoman freakiness!

Home to Homer, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, George Michael and other epic bad asses.

We honor the gods of legend: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.

Hercules is our hero! Leonidas is our king! Helen is our muse!

Join our new region, become a citizen of freedom and enlightened civilization!
