Home to the [b]Democratic States of Wingarde[/b], this tropical archipelago, with its verdant grasslands, exotic jungles and crystal waters, rests somewhere in the North Pacific.

The &amp;#39;region&amp;#39; itself is only vaguely defined, but includes nations nearby and within Wingarde&amp;#39;s sphere of influence. Trade and diplomatic relations are expectedly high.
