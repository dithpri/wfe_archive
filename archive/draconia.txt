Draconia is a massive continent, hidden from the world since the middle ages. It is the last refuge for dragons and other mythical creatures. Because of the dragons and the charms which kept it hidden, as well as the highest concentration of mages in the world, Draconia is now a major world power. If you are a Draconian (or have a similar nation name) please join this region. WE MUST UNITE DRACONIA!
