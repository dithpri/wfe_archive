The Kingdom of Amersstedt, simply referred to as the Realms, is a political association of 5+4 member states, the vast majority of which are former territories of the Amersstedtian Empire. The chief institutions of the organisation are this region, which focuses on intergovernmental aspects, and the NECO Alliance, which focuses on defence and non-governmental relations amongst member states.

The head of the Realms is currently the Grand Master of Great Birchlea and Auroa; Otter Lutrinus I is the head of state of 7 member states, known as the Sunnhordland Pact, while Syrran and Schiavonia are personal unions.
