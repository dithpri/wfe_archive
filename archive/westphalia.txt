[b][color=blue]Founded 06.18.11 / Liberated 03.22.18[/color][/b][hr][b][color=green]Welcome to Westphalia![/color][/b] [i]Located between the Rhine and Weser, a land where the grass is greener and the honey ever so sweeter! Created years ago, we continue to fight on and against those who intend to do us harm. We cannot be destroyed, because Westphalia lives on, always, through her people! [/i][hr]

We thank all Westphalians who fought to continue our region and carry on her spirit during it&#39;s poorly orchestrated and illegal occupation. We thank the defenders who fought hard for our freedom. Finally, we will never forget and will always remember.
