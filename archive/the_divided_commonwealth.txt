[color=death]&quot;I can&#39;t stand Mushrooms. I- I really- I really can&#39;t stand mushrooms at all; they&#39;re like one of the only foods in the world that I just can&#39;t eat. They look... horrible. They&#39;re grey (grey&#39;s the least appetising colour). They taste like Margaret Thatcher&#39;s soul, and they have the consistency of her feet. They&#39;re unpleasant, let&#39;s put it that way.&quot;[/color] [color=oppression]  - NerdCubed, Internet Gaming Profile, and Professionally Not Margaret Thatcher[/color]
