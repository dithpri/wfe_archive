&amp;quot;And henceforth be it known that the Imperium shall be divided into five fleet zones to be known as the Segmentae Majoris. These shall each have a Segment Fortress, from whence the orders of his glorious magnificence, the Emperor, shall be enacted. Imperialis Command Decoriatum shall reside in each and with just duty be issued over the realms within their boundaries. In this the Emperor is most benevolent and thus shall the Emperor&amp;#39;s charges be authority over such domains and reside with those who have the faith and temperament to dictate to the will of those others and take from them that which is the Emperor&amp;#39;s due.&amp;quot;

The Segmentum Pacificus is the region of Imperial space that lies to the galactic west of Terra.
