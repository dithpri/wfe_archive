Welcome members of Austritaria! 
Medieval Austritaria is what is says in the title, Austritaria in the past. Welcome to a world of war, knights and crowns in the battle torn past of Austritaria. However, there is a slight twist. Instead of being based on lore, or actual history, it is instead based of legends and tales from book, etc. 

So now you&amp;#39;re here, why not create a puppet nation to live here? You can base it on a past version of your current country. Or, if you country is too new (according to lore) like mine, why not make a new one entirely? You want Wizards? Sure! You want Dragons in your nation? OK! You want to keep it realistic? Go for it! Just do whatever you want, and have fun! Indulge in war and murder and monster slaying!
