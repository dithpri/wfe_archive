The Fascist Senate: the region that kept me on this game, the region that gave me hope, experience and community. A memorial to peace, endeavour and a tollerence found so rarely in regions today. 

I am [nation]Greater Vakolicci Haven[/nation], and this was The Fascist Senate: founded in 2010 by Vici Minerva, hounded by anti-fascists who saw nothing but the name without thinking of the community, ripped apart and abused by so many. Now, let this region, the region that made me on NS, be remembered by this memorial.
