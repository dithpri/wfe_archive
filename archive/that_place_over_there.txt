This realm was originally created as a dumping ground for puppets of [b]The Most Glorious Hack[/b], specifically, his &quot;Most Gloriously Modified&quot; puppets which are used as temporary Founders in regions that have been griefed. However, things have changed a bit, and this is a region that any nation may join. There is [i]no[/i] password, and everyone&#39;s welcome to come in and relax, or simply stash a few puppets of their own here. 

While the vast majority of nations here are puppets of the Hack, not all of them are. As long as they don&#39;t trying to pass themselves off as me, they&#39;re fine. [i]If you do[/i] try to impersonate me, you&#39;ll be subject to the usual punishment, namely deletion.
