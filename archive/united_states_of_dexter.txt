[region]Dexter[/region]&amp;#39;s Res Publican colonies broke with the mother region in 2012 and were recognized as the new region of Dexter following the Treaty of Rationality. Prior to this break, the two most traumatic experiences in the region&amp;#39;s history were the Civil War (2009-), in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of southern slave states, and the Great Depression of Liberalism, an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in 2010, Dexter remains the world&amp;#39;s most powerful nation state. Since the end of faux-Utiopian Liberal rule, the economy has achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology.
