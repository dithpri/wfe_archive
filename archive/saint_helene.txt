[b][color=#009EDB]Welcome to the Saint Helene Roleplay Region![/color]
[hr][color=red][u][i]We are a group founded on the basis of near complete freedom of choice for roleplayers in matters of roleplay topics, roleplay aesthetics, and style.[/i][/u]

With over 30 skilled, active RPers and rising plus others, we offer one of the best experiences on NS, in terms of quality, diversity and writer liberties. From a 20th-century imperial realm to a near-future society with all forms of anomalies, magic, or unexplained phenomena, anything goes - within reason.[/color]
[hr][color=#009EDB]Please be respectful to other members and the community! If you are interested in applying for our roleplay setting, please check out the factbooks below. Additionally, joining the Discord is highly recommended!
