[b][color=#009EDB]Welcome to the Saint Helene Roleplay Region![/color]
[hr][color=red][u][i]We are a group founded on the basis of near complete freedom of choice for roleplayers in matters of roleplay topics, roleplay aesthetics, and style.[/i][/u]

With over 30 skilled, active RPers and rising plus others, we offer one of the best experiences on NS, in terms of quality, diversity and writer liberties. From a 20th-century imperial realm to a near-future society with anomalies, magic, or unexplained phenomena, anything goes - within reason.[/color]
