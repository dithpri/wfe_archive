This region was set up by a neo-Nazi generally known as Aryan Shield Command. [region]The Red Fleet[/region] confiscated it; after the TRF founder puppet ceased to exist, the region was protected by some of the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region]&amp;#39;s finest and cuddliest operatives. But ASC retook it in a false flag operation that took advantage of one of stuffed animals&amp;#39; few weaknesses: unassuming trust. FJA has now returned to seize the region for the final time.

[b]Aryan Resistance Movement[/b] will now be occupied by adorable [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascist[/b] cuddle toys.

Love conquers all.
