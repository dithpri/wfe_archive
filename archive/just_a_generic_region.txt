[b]Want to practice tag raiding or detagging?[/b] Feel free to use J.A.G.R. (or JAEGER) as a training ground for all of your R/D desires.

[color=red][b]Once I figure out how to simulate raids or liberations, this region will be open to more forms of R/D training. For now, this is just a tag/detag region only.[/b][/color]
[hr][b]Contact[/b] [nation]New Westmore[/nation] if you wish to use JAEGER for training or if you have any concerns.

[b]Please do not ban any nations from this region, unless you have my explicit permission to do so.[/b]
