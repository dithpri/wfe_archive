[b]Welcome to the Democratic Union of Independent Nations[/b]
[hr] 
The [region]Democratic Union of Independent Nations[/region], or [b]DUIN[/b], is a region that provides a place for member nations to socialize with other nations and take part in a regional government, without giving up the right to rule their nation independently, or to just sit back, mind their own business, and lie dormant. 

The [b]DUIN[/b] welcomes all nations with open arms. We hope you consider making our region your home!
