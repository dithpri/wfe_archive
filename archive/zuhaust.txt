[RP Region]
Zuhaust, a region once known as Europe. That is, until the empire Souveran took over. After the empire Souveran took over Europe, it began allowing the nations within to continue as independents under the control of Souveran. Zuhaust is controlled by Souveran but houses many other nations. Currently, some nations plan rebellion on Souveran, others plan to convince Souveran to take over Asia, while the rest simply carry out their normal ways. Question is, how long will Zuhaust remain in what was once Europe?
