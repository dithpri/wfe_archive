We are what&amp;#39;s left of the USA. In 2024 a revolution began, and soon after, civil war broke out. This war ended in 2029. During those five years, our beautiful nation was torn apart. After the war, the survivors formed factions. Now, seven years later, the year is 2036. Technology is advancing as before, and life is much like before the war. Our governments strive to make alliances, a new UN or NATO if you will. Please join us, and help us bring peace to the region.
