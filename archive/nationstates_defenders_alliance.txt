[color=blue]We are attempting to establish an interregional alliance of defenders. The defender regions with the most nations as of [u]May 19th[/u] has been/is being asked to join us. Each region will send one WA nation as a representative. [/color][color=green]The representatives, plus [nation]The Keeper of the Alliance[/nation], will vote on various issues. Additionally, those nations that were not picked as representatives will still be able to vote on all issues, but as part of the entire region, and as a result, their vote will count for less.[/color]
