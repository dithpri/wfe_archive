Ibova was once a large, stunning region of nations until the  countries all mysteriously disappeared. Any nation of any government or belief is free to join and I hope you&#39;ll all help me grow this once great region.

Ibova is a region located to the south-west of a large, primitive, magical continent. Although virtually none of the magic is found in this region, its technology significantly more advanced. Some of that continent&#39;s bestial and elven races can even be found here.
