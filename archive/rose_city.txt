Portlandia
She kneels down
and from the quietness
of copper
reaches out.
We take that stillness
Into ourselves,
And somewhere
deep in the earth
our breath
becomes her city.
If she could speak
this is what
she would say:
Follow that breath
Home is the journey we make.
That is how the world
knows where we are
