[color=black] Bendicion&amp;#39;s finest has arrived from the depths of its lands. This region is homegrounds,territory and stronghold of the [/color][color=red]Legionnary Horsemen[/color]. [color=black]The Legionnaries are Bendicion&amp;#39;s primary bet when it comes to raiding. Recruited by [nation]Bob Moran[/nation] with an even hand, they have thus been let loose with ferocity with the Black Riders. They are not always that present,but when they are,they would always get the chance to drink blood of their enemies.
