Though this is a budding Region, all nations have a say within it!

You need not be a WA assembly member to be a citizen, but a Region citizen member to be so.

In order to become a Ceplines Independent Region Citizen, you must register within the region and declare that you have moved into the region.

There will never be a vote held for office during a 2 1/2 month period starting on the first of November and ending in the middle of January due to the holiday season.

Our elections happen every 3 months IRL time, or every 4 years Region time.

In order to register as a citizen within the region, you must sign up on our [url=http://ceplines-independent.boards.net/]Our Registry Boards[/url]
