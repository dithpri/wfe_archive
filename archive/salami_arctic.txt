This northern area is a subzero, isolated place where the ground is covered with white snow. It&amp;#39;s difficult to reach, and is only accessible by boat. The northwest gets hit by many hurricanes, but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to mind the penguins that are common there. Pigs live in the southern part, and they are used widely for food.
