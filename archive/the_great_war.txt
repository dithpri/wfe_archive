Welcome to [region]The Great War[/region], a region based upon pre-WWII Europe (Geographically, anyway). Member states are expected to come to the military aid of their fellows, and to comply with region-wide treaties embargoes. Other than that, nations are effectively sovereign.

In all democratic matters, each member state shall have no more than one vote. If the votes are tied, then [nation]Pechenekistan[/nation] shall have the final say.

Just send a TG to a member state for information about joining. We&amp;#39;ll get back to you as quickly as possible.
