A matter has come to my personal attention in the most ridiculous manner: a simple rejection of an embassy request based on a blatant violation of Ravanian embassy policies got my main account banned from [region]Golden Eco Friendly[/region]? 

While I wouldn&#39;t care in the slightest (it&#39;s your influence, buddy) under normal circumstances, the fact of the matter is that this tactic has been utilized to spam notifications at the nations who rejected the requests. This is simply unacceptable, and [b]INDEPENDENT[/b] (this was [b]NOT[/b] a Ravanian armed forces assault) [nation]Northern Mount Celestia[/nation] Armed Forces military action has been taken to secure a so-called [i]&#39;special ally&#39;[/i].
