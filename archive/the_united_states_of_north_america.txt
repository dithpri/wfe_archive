The United States of North America, still known as &quot;The United States of America,&quot; is now the US merged with Canada and Mexico. 

The people are strong-willed, hardy, and face brutal conditions from the freezing winter weather and blinding snowstorms of the Wild North, to the crippling heat and dust storms of the South and Southwest. Mining, fishing, hunting, logging, and other forms of blue-collar work are the backbone of the country, as well as farming and railroad work. There are a number of veterans, and patriotism is at an all-time high. Individual liberty and traditional values.
