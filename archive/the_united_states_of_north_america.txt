Welcome to the United States. We are a collective of states from the United States. The only regulation for joining this region is that you are an accurate depiction of one of the many US States. Only 50 people can be in the region, and only one of each state is permitted to exist.

US Territories and Protectorates are also allowed (Guam, Puerto Rico...)
