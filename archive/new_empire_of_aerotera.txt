Founded in 2017, the New Empire of Aerotera is a revival of the fallen Holy Empire of Aerotera, which was ruled by King Victor Aerotera and Queen Gabriella Stent. Founded by Nicolas Aerotera, the last surviving member of his father&#39;s bloodline, this new region seeks to promote comraderie, good relations, and military. If you have ideas, dreams, or just want somewhere to hang out, this region is calling your name.
