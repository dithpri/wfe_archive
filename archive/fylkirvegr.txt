[b]Welcome to Fylkirvegr![/b]

[color=goldenrod]Join us as we embark on a trip into Norse Mythology with all our advances in sorcery and magic! Come engulfed yourself in a medieval realm and join the Executive Government in the capital city of Valhalla. People to come first to the region, will automatically become part of the regional government until growth has been sustained and we will then participate in elections, but that is later on! Here, in Fylkirvegr, we are loyal and honorable friends to each other, we are democratic, we love anyone to stop by and feel that Medieval fuzzy feeling! Come on now, join us as we embark to all the regions of Yggdrasil![/color]
