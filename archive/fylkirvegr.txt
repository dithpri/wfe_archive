Due to the catastrophic failures of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation suffering as a whole, I have decided to fully dissolute the Executive Branch of The Regional Government. I will update you more as this is currently taking place, I will do the State of The Union Address tomorrow properly within an NS dispatch soon enough on the whole matter.
