This Region is a virtual space for elaboration and construction of an online RP of society simulation.

The League of Nations project, once developed, will give the player the experience of building and running a nation. With interactive platforms, presenting advanced and complex variables, the player will have the challenge of developing his society through the management of his economy, government and relations with the other nations of the game.

For all this to be possible, we have as an initial objective the recruitment of new members who have affinity with this project and want to help in the development of it.
