A utopian society built upon intelligence, scientific progress, and compassion, the Othana Isles are located to the right of Japan within the Pacific Ocean. Our many islands are home to excellent beaches, exotic wildlife and great people. Our nations tend to get along quite well despite different views.

Most executive decisions will be made through the polls. Please endorse our Founder [nation]Calei[/nation] and our Vice-Delegate [nation]Ikomatye[/nation]. 

Land can be swapped, changed, and created at will due to our immense geotechnology. Appeal - [nation]Calei[/nation] - for all territorial changes and to register an island/flag.
