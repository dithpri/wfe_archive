[b]The Region Map[/b]

The nations of Valdelms and Spennsylvania both sent their finest cartographers on missions to map our region. It is the decision of the powers that be that, barring popular outcry from the region&amp;#39;s members, the region map we intend to keep updated will be that made by Valdelms. They are both below for reference.
