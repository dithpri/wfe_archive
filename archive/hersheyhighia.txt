[b]The region has been reclaimed![/b]

Following an invasion by [region=The Black Riders], the founder nation of [nation=North Hersheyhighia] has been resurrected and has regained control of the region. As a measure of defense against future invasions, the WA delegate has been stripped of administrative power, meaning that, as long as the founder remains present, a full invasion is not possible.

[b]Custodian needed[/b]

It has become clear that a nation with a regular presence here in the region should be given control of the North Hersheyhighia account. This issue should be solved shortly by the nations that currently share access to the account.
