[b]The region has been reclaimed![/b]

Following an invasion by [region=The Black Riders], the nation of [nation=North Hersheyhighia] has been resurrected, and has regained control of the region. As a measure of defense against future invasions, the WA delegate has been stripped of administrative power, meaning that as long as the founder remains present, a full invasion is not possible.

[b]A.R.G.P occupies North Hersheyhighia![/b]

It has become clear that in the wake of the recently repulsed regional invasion, North Hersheyhighia must be constantly maintained at all times by a sole political entity. For this reason, the A.R.G.P has absorbed North Hersheyhighia, and will govern it perpetually.
