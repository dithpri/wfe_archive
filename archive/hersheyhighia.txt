[b]The Region Map[/b]

The nations of [nation]Valdelms[/nation] and [nation]Spennsylvania[/nation] both sent their finest cartographers on missions to map our region. It is the decision of the powers that be that, barring popular outcry from the region&amp;#39;s members, the region map we intend to keep updated will be that made by Valdelms. They are both below for reference.
