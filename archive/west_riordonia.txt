The Reunited Kingdom of Fondor was founded some 93 years ago at the decree of High King Faramir I who had seceded from the New Britannian Empire in 1509 HY. In 1521 HY the High King was sentenced to death and his son High King Marcus I was murdered shortly after.  Years of anarchy consumed Fondor until at last Lord Pierce liberated the region and restored the royal bloodline. High King Excellion IV reigns alongside his fianc&eacute;e Queen Tamara Noelle of Rhanawyn. West Riordonia is a longtime colony of the Kingdom and is currently led by Duke Jaume I of Celtic Iberia.
