The German Empire was founded on January 18, 1871, after the North German Confederation and the south German states joined together. The new constitution established Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, as the German Emperor. The German Empire was a constitutional monarchy made up of 26 states, including four kingdoms, six grand duchies, five duchies, seven principalities, three free Hanseatic cities, and one imperial territory. Germany also had a colonial empire that was established in 1884.
