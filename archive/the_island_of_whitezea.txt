Whitesea is a beautiful island surrounded by deep blue waters. It&amp;#39;s coastline depends on the area; for example, the Queendom of Whiteshores is well known for it&amp;#39;s vast, shimmering sandy beaches, while the Dictatorship of Ozea is surrownded in huge, rocky cliffs which hang over the water.
