The Antarctic Colonies was the result of Earth&amp;#39;s first terraforming technologies. Most of the continent has been deemed habitable due to the average surface temperature of 16 degrees Celsius. Antarctica has become almost unrecognizable, dotted with lush forests and various human settlements. Along with all the changes, several large oil wells have also been discovered, ridding the world of fuel dependency.  Many of the nations have colonized other planets and have made HUGE scientific advances.
