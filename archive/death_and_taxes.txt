The Great Founding Father Benjamin Franklin once said: &#147;in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.&#148; I, the Prime Minister, would like to add that &#147;in this world nothing can be certain, except uncertainty, and the fear of invasion.&#148;

Therefore we have formed our Defensive Pact, using taxpayer money to finance the institution most intrinsic to our cause: the Military-Industrial Complex. Our integrated war economy and advanced information sharing will neutralize any threat at any given moment.

We are omnipotent, ready to strike at the first hint of hostility. We are nowhere; we are everywhere. We follow the Central Dogma which will lead us to prevail: that the best defense is offense.
