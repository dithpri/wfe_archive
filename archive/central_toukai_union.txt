[b][url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_east_pacific]The Eastern Pacific Armada[/url] decided to visit your region as part of R/D for pride!

The EPSA visits all sorts of ports, from large to small, to seek new destinations to spread peace and love.
 
We decided to make some thematic changes to spice your WFE up this month, and it&#39;s much better now!

If you would like to enlist with the EPSA to see the world, come join us!
