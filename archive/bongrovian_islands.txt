This is the region in which Bongrovia resides. The Bongrovian Islands was founded in 1988 when the former third part of Bongrovia, Nesworpil, separated from the Mainland and Catalina (which is currently what Bongrovia is made of). Nesworpil are now allied with Bongrovia, and the region has recently been open for other nations to become a part of the region and become allies with Bongrovia and Nesworpil.
