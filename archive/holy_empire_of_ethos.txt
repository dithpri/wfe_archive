In the year 5603 AD, Earth had experienced a great extinction event that caused the exile and refugee population of billions to spread out into the galaxy. Thousands of years later, humans settled across multiple planets in a far region of Sagittarius A. All under control of the Holy Empire of Ethos. Emperor Ethos founded the Holy Empire during the great migration to ensure order and law amongst the human refugees. The Holy Empire helped fund the development of civilizations across planets and created the houses of each planet as independent nations ruled under the empire. The Holy Empire&#146;s currency is Solari&#146;s, a gold and titanium coin that is produced and distributed to the masses.
