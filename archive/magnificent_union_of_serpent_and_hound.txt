The union of the two mighty nations of the Gadsden Enclave and the Polar Empire of Nuktuk. The union formed a strong bond between each other early on upon discovering each other by covering each others weaknesses. Gadsden improved the Nuktuk war capabilities and provided more firepower while the Nuktuk provided a great deal of hunting skills and ice.

Later on during the Union, both the Polar Empire and the Nuclear Confederacy encountered an enemy that would pose a threat to both of them, the Mole People. They soon found an agreement after a few short battles with the moles and gradually accepted them into the Union but didnt add them to the name because there is no cool word for &amp;#39;mole&amp;#39;.
