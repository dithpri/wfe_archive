We believe that founderless regions should be protected from invaders. However, to prevent raids, an invasion is sometimes more prudent than waiting to liberate. The target of such an invasion would be targeted to prevent an invasion. Our region welcomes nations of any kind of government. We are open to suggestions about the liberation of occuppied regions. Our goal is to protect regions, so they might help us protect others.
