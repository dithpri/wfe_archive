[color=#FFBF40][b]The Confederate States of North America[/b][/color]
[i]&amp;quot;Under God, our Vindicator&amp;quot;[/i]


Southern men the thunders mutter!
Northern flags in South winds flutter!
To arms! To arms! To arms, in Dixie!
Send them back your fierce defiance!
Stamp upon the cursed alliance!
To arms! To arms! To arms, in Dixie!
Advance the flag of Dixie! Hurrah! Hurrah!
In Dixie&amp;#39;s land we take our stand, and live or die for Dixie!
To arms! To arms! And conquer peace for Dixie!
