Minoru is a very cold part of the world; temperatures tend to run from 30-50 degrees Fahrenheit in Spring, 50-60 degrees in Summer, and in the fall and winter they&amp;#39;ll be in the negatives.  The nations of Minoru were almost destroyed by the Soviet Union, but have since made a modest recovery.  Most of the citizens of Minoru are pescetarians, and those that do eat meat eat it sparingly.
