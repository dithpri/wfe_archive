In a world threatened by tyrants, those with more moderate political alignments must stay strong. The weak will be crushed by the strong unless they become strong themselves; this is what we must do. By putting together the strength of great, freedom-loving nations, we can become strong ourselves, and present a rather strong force against our adversaries. We will engage in military activities against dictatorial regions, and bring them down.

Ad victorium.
