In the depths of the world, lies a horrific location, filled with deep chasms and hellish, flesh like wounds stitched onto the land. This place is called Catoklysma, founded by the fanatic dictator of Apocolis, a place where traitors rot in prison and all the citizens live in constant fear. Join us, and we shall grow. We will grow over the weak and grow over the rich. Join us and be rewarded. Deny us, and you shall rot in the fiery pits of the underworld. Choose correctly. Make the right decision by choosing Catoklysma.
