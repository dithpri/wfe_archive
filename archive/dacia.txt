Dacia is a land of optimism and freedom. Dacia is open for anyone and will allow you to do as your country pleases. There is no rule book that continues forever but only a few rules. You may run your own country by your own rules and not to be like those regions who&amp;#39;s founder makes you their puppet. If issues appear between two or more nations Crisana and those nations can hopefully find a peaceful resolution. If you don&amp;#39;t want to join I completely understand and wish you the best.
