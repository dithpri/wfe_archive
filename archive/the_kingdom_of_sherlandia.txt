&amp;#127925;Pacifism is the way&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;Everyone is welcome doesn&#146;t matter if your gay&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;We want peace and don&#39;t want war&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;We care for everyone even if your poor&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;A region built by the people&#146;s hand&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;We are the kingdom of Sherland-ia&amp;#127925;&copy;

&amp;#127925;It&#39;s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;There&#39;s nothing that our countrymen are forced ever do&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;I bless the Budgies down in Sherlandia&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;Gonna take some time to feed them all the seeds we have&amp;#127925;
