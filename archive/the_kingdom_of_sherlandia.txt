&amp;#127925;Pacifism isn&#39;t the way&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;Everyone is welcome doesn&#146;t matter if your gay&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;We want peace and don&#39;t want war&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;We care for everyone even if your poor&amp;#127925;
&amp;#127925;A region built by the people&#146;s hand&amp;#127925;
