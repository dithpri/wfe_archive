The Union of Telerasia was founded on 04/05/2016 as a safe haven for debate and freedom to the nations within it. Nations do not require any sort of specific background or political ideology to join ad the Union is created to encourage cross-partisan debate and political manoeuvring amongst it&#39;s member states.

The Union of Telerasia is an RP based region with elected positions every two weeks. The WA Delegate position is fluid and may change anytime depending on endorsements. All laws and rules are subject to change depending on Regional Legislation. Once a constitution has been agreed upon and finalised a link will be submitted so all may view it.
