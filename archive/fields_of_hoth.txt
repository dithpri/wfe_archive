Hoth is the sixth planet in the remote system of the same name, and is the site of the Rebel Alliance&#39;s Echo Base. It is a desolate, uninhabitable world of snow and ice, surrounded by numerous moons, and home to creatures like the wampa and TaunTaun. Its absence on both imperial and commercial hyperdrive routes made it perfect for the Rebellion to recover unnoticed. Shield Generators and Ion Cannons make up most of the defensive fortifications against possible imperial assaults, with turrets, snowspeeder strafing runs and hoth infantry units as secondary defense and troop transports for evacuation.
