[b][color=black]Bienvenidos to Guatemala City.[/color][/b][hr][b][color=darkred]&amp;quot;What did you do when the poor suffered, 
when tenderness and life
burned out of them?&amp;quot;

Apolitical intellectuals
of my sweet country,
you will not be able to answer.

A vulture of silence
will eat your gut.

Your own misery
will pick at your soul.

And you will be mute in your shame.[/color]
