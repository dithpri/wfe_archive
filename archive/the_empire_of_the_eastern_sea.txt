Founded in 1533, we battled our independence from France and Spain. In 1776 we gained notice that the British were in America and were coming to the Empire of the Eastern Sea. We were kicked out of our home (Now Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea) and we were forced to settle in The Great Phillopenos (Philippines) and Taiwan. We broke apart from the Pacific in 2022.
