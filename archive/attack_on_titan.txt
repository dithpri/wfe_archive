These are people who like and enjoy attack on Titan, you can make your own fictional country from AOT or be one that already exists. This region is supposed to be a chill, relaxing region where you can Roleplay, discuss AOT, or talk about literally anything. This region is aimed at people who are new and somewhat experienced. Any country is welcome whether it be an AOT country, a real-life country, or one from your imagination. 

(A map will be added soon, people in the region who are top 20 for at least a month will be added to the map.)

I hope you join! :D
