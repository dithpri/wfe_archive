It&#146;s a rat race out there, and the rats are winning. Corporate, soulless rats!

Today, more than 80% of workers are said to be dissatisfied with their job or company.

With a private industry workforce of over 107 million, something is seriously wrong in Corporate America when 85 million workers are unhappy to the point of jumping ship.

The Corporate Rat Race is run in the end to lose everything for all participants. Look at the world. It is going to HELL. The sponsors of this charade are evil personified.

If nothing else, they&#39;ll take your self respect and remaining time. Which in the final analysis are the most valuable things you have. Why do you worship these soulless rats, America?
