Welcome to The Old North!

We are a loose alliance of strong, fledgling nations, the union of which is entirely contingent on the desires of individual nations. The region is home to those who seek to know what it is to dwell beneath noble banners. Many nearby fly the flag of the White Dragon in a show of solidarity and allegiance to his grace, King Bede I of Nova Northumbria.

Join us and wes thu hal!
