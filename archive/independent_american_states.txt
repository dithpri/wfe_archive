A region for independent American states. 
This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean states of &quot;The United States&quot; and is meant to refer to nations existing on both the North and South American continents. 

If you stumble on this region and want to start a rp, we&#39;d be happy with that. Just send good ol&#39; [nation]Niagara-Erie[/nation] a message/telegram and they&#39;ll add you to the flag map. 
If your nation is completely fictional, we can create fictional islands if you like. 

RP is hosted on the regional message board. Fictional islands aside, we strive for a realism based experience.
