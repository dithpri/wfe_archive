The frozen tundra of Buffalonia measures a narrow expanse between two mighty rivers, the Svethelm to the West, and the Mullersfjord to the East. To the North, it is bordered by the notorious Elkhott Commune and, to the South, by the tribal territories of Frattgard. In recent years, Buffalonia has undergone an influx of young, ambitious peasants pursuing time-honored quests of education and self-betterment.
