Hello, The S.O.L. system of Imperialist Nations is a region that consists of a variety of different nations. you may be wondering, &amp;quot;why is it called an imperialist region when it is open to nations of any governing style?&amp;quot; well this is because it used to be an imperialist only region. but to comply with world assembly regulations, we must make this region open to nations of any governing style. you might be asking yourself, &amp;quot;does this mean that the imperialist nations in this region receive special treatment?&amp;quot; no actually, all nations in this region will be treated the same. so I personally thank you for moving your nation to The S.O.L. system of Imperialist Nations.
