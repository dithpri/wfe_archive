This Coffee Shop is a place where anyone can enjoy NationStates as a peaceful area to talk, eat, drink, and be merry. We have no tolerance for smoking, dine-and-dashes, and bar fights. Please take ALL fights [region]outside[/region]. Please no loitering or littering. Let&#39;s keep Chicago clean. Thanks!
