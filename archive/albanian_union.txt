[i]The Albanian Union (AU)[/i] is a small, democratic and mostly peaceful region. It consists of nations, which have a significant Albanian population. It does not have a regional government but the official duties are carried out by the Founder and the WA Delegate.
We are open for all developed and peaceful nations that are friends of our states. Together we can make this region bigger. Also countries that have Albanians as a minority population are invited to join.

If the region is locked, TG the founder or the delegate for the password.

[b]We are proud to be part of the [region]Confederation of Roleplaying Nations[/region] (CORN)[/b]
