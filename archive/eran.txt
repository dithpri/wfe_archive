[spoiler=History of Eran]
[b]E[/b]ran was once an ally of Zorbae, a steadfast friend. When Goozballoon, its founder, went inactive, Eran died, and was seized by Red Armor, a now defunct raider region. The Zorbaean Empire then struck a deal with Red Armor, allowing Zorbae to jointly own Eran, and plant Zorbaean Eran within the Region. Once Red Armor&#146;s puppet, Home of the Pope, also went inactive, Eran was seized by the Zorbaean Empire through Zorbaean Eran, and preserved as a measure of goodwill between the Empire, and United Iran, the new region of Eran&#146;s former owners.
