This region is made of autonomous nations with a set of guiding principles:
- Nations must live in peace and respect their neighbors.
- All nations must respect the basic rights of their citizens as outlined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Charter.
- All Nations in this region aspire to reach the highest ideal society as defined by &amp;quot;the veil of ignorance&amp;quot;, Kant, Rawls, and Locke. Nations are free to be capitalistic or socialist, but cannot create a system in which some of its citizens are stripped of their basic human rights.
