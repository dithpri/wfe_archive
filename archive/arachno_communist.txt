Arise ye pris&amp;#8217;ners of starvation
Arise ye wretched of the earth
For justice thunders condemnation
A better world&amp;#8217;s in birth!
No more tradition&amp;#8217;s chains shall bind us
Arise, ye slaves, no more in thrall;
The earth shall rise on new foundations
We have been naught we shall be all.
