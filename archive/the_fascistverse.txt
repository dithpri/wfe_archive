Ciao! Welcome to the Fascistverse. This might seem like an identical copy of the universe, but come to Earth and you will be quite shocked. Because in this universe and timeline, World War 2 was won by Italy and its Axis partners. After Italy won the war, it changed its name to [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=pane_e_circhi]Pane e Circhi[/url]. It then annexed Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia and parts of Czechoslovakia, becoming a world superpower. Meanwhile the losing side, America, Britain and France, are now nothing more than ordinary powers.
