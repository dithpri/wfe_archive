[b][u] Message To All Of Valensa [/u][/b]


[color=red] Apologies from Segmenta. In the midst of dealing with a black out, we have been involuntarily neglecting the region of Valensa. The invaders have been run out of our region; however, we are sure there are more adversaries hiding in the shadows. Report suspected nations immediately. The safety of our beloved lands depends on it!

We once again apologize for our lack of action. We thank those who notified us of these dangers. We will now work on recovering from the invasion. As for now, we are locking our borders down. If a trusted ally of yours wishes to move within our borders, you will have to contact Foreign Affairs via telegrams. 

Thank you, 
Segmenta Regional Affairs[/color]
