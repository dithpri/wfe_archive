TRRR, the unofficial role-playing region for TRR! Dubbed &quot;the containment zone&quot;, we aim to help the role-players of TRR improve their skills and just have a good time.

This is mainly so roleplays don&#39;t clog up the RMB of TRR. And its also mainly based around Sace, RRDI, all of that stuff, but you can create your own new scenario here!

Some ground rules for TRRR:
1. No harassment, including for not role-playing your way.
2. Focus the main topic of the RMB on role-playing.
3. Keep up the quality of your RP.
