Among Us (coloquially termed &quot;amogus&quot;) teaches us to punish the minority and hate those who are different and unique as &quot;impostors.&quot; Instead, I like the breath of fresh air this problem provides as a new perspective on deduction that is not &quot;red is sus, red vented, etc.&quot; that has been dominating the jokes of my peers and the view of my feed. Yet, by trying to force this problem to conform to &quot;amogus,&quot; you yourself are trying to crush originality and uniqueness. Among Us is a game ultimately convincing us to conform to menial labor as &quot;tasks&quot; and accept the deal of being just like the rest of the crewmates.
