The Changed New World role play, is a RP where earth&#146;s land masses and oceans aren&#146;t how we remember (mostly). Humanity Has been almost entirely wiped out due to meteor impacts and treacherous seas, and after thousands of years the climate has settled and we are back to technology from the 1930s, but only if you let yourself be confined. Pick your nation or talk to me and we&#146;ll see about founding a new land, send your request to [nation]CNW Northuldrey[/nation] or [nation]RaR Canada[/nation]. Thank you to [nation]RaR Paris[/nation] and [region]Rise and Ruin[/region] for getting me into RP&#146;s.
