A continent located in the South East Pacific, made up exclusively of 5673 islands of varying sizes, biomes and levels of human development. Within this continent are multiple nation states who share a complex and intertwined history.

The continent&amp;#39;s modern day human population is a large mix made up of aboriginal peoples (many still living in the tribes that existed before the concept of the nation state arrived), the descendants of French &amp;amp; Portuguese colonialists and the Newzine people - descendants of ancient European emigrants who have since developed their own ethnicity and culture.
