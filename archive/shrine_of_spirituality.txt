The Shrine of Spirituality rests on a floating dais in the Ethereal Void. As the sole method by which one arrives or departs is via moongate, the Shrine is adorned by a perennial exit gate leading back to the terrestrial realm.

Meditating at the shrine, the traveler has to chant the mantra, om, to find enlightenment in the ways of Spirituality.
