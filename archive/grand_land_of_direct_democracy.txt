We are a free land with true democracy who aims to not be the many regions who claim to be democratic but aren&#39;t when you think about it. We are anti-WA and believe endorsements are corrupt and that the W.A. itself is a tyranny by majority, and therefore have an endorsement cap of 1. We don&#39;t have complex citizenship gaining systems, all you need to do is send the founder or an officer a telegram stating your leader&#39;s name, your political party, and if you want your plans. And you get to make polls with citizenship! We support direct democracy and it&#39;s because it is fair and free. Unlike other regions, which lie about what they do. All embassy requests will be accepted
