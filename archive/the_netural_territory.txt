Essentials to any nation of this region:
A.No Raiders (sorry, but as a policy we keep ourselves peaceful globally, however, there could be RP&#39;d war situations regionally)
B. Password will be given by TG if there is proof that the person is not a raider.

C.MT Tech is preferred, but  PMT is also acceptable

D. Keep your RP numbers realistic (7 billion army and 300 billion population is discouraged here)

E. elections will be held as soon as there is a reasonable core number of nations, meanwhile, I&#39;m the temporary dictator here
