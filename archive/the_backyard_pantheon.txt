The Backyard Pantheon is a place of tranquility and relaxation. We choose to isolate ourselves from the rest of the world in hopes of setting up the great garden lost in the ignorance of the many. We wish to keep this peace in here and here alone, to keep it from being tainted by the savage world that lies outside the Pantheon.
