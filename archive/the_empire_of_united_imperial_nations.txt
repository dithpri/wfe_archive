The Empire of United Nations is a growing empire with the goal of uniting many nations with the common goal of expansion. While not a raiding region, we attempt to recruit as many other nations into our ranks. While primarily a Imperialistic Oligarchy, individual nations are permitted to employ whichever form of government they choose and have the permission to create their own laws as long as they are within the E.U.N. guidelines. The E.U.N. is also a technology based region with industrialized cities and nations.
