Welcome to Omicros, an ancient and storied region. From its sun-baked southern coasts, refulgent with marine life, to its icy northern fastnesses, eerie in their near-total isolation, this is a land of immeasurable diversity. Intrepid explorers and casual tourists alike can find a vocation here, free from the ceaseless bustle of everyday life. Plurality is sacred, and a wealth of creeds coexist in a state of relative placidity. Conflicts, while rare, are fought with a depth of passion and a ferocity seldom seen in quarters of the globe less prone to heavy emotional investment. 

All nations are welcome here.
