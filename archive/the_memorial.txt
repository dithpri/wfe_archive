Welcome to the Memorial, a place where we pay homage to the memories of the old members of Grosland Ebenen. Grosland Ebenen endured a period of great turmoil when it was relentlessly raided by raiders, causing remaining members to flee. The very essence of this Memorial embodies the resilience of the people who called Grosland Ebenen home.
