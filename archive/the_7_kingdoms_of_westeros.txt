Westeros is a island located in the far north-west of the unknown world. It is separated from the continent of Samuel Landia by a strip of paper known as the Dead, Processed Tree. 
Almost the entire island, barring only the lands in the furthest north beyond the fence, is ruled by a single political entity known as the Sammy&#39;s Kingdom, which holds fealty to the King of the KFC and the Watermenlone, who sits on the Frozen grape Kool-AId Throne in the city of Sam&#39;s Landing. The terms &quot;Sammy&#39;s Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Sexy Beast&quot; are normally used interchangeably.
