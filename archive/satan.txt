[b][color=bluye]I&amp;#39;m here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began. 
I&amp;#39;ve nurtured every sensation man&amp;#39;s been inspired to have. 
I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him. 
Why? 
Because I never rejected him. 
In spite of all his imperfections, I&amp;#39;m a fan of man! 
I&amp;#39;m a humanist. 
Maybe the last humanist.[/color][/b]

[b][color=orange]Please allow me to introduce myself
I&amp;#39;m a man of wealth and taste
I&amp;#39;ve been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man&amp;#39;s soul to waste

Pleased to meet you, I hope you know my name...[/color][/b]
