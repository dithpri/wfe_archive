[b][color=bluye]Please allow me to introduce myself
I&amp;#39;m a man of wealth and taste
I&amp;#39;ve been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man&amp;#39;s soul to waste

Pleased to meet you, I hope you know my name.

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
&amp;#39;Cause I&amp;#39;m in need of some restraint.[/color][/b]
