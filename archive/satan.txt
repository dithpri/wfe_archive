[b][color=brown]I&amp;#39;m here on the ground with my nose in it since the whole thing began. 
I&amp;#39;ve nurtured every sensation man&amp;#39;s been inspired to have. 
I cared about what he wanted and I never judged him.

In spite of all his imperfections, I&amp;#39;m a fan of man! 
I&amp;#39;m a humanist. 
Maybe the last humanist.[/color][/b]
