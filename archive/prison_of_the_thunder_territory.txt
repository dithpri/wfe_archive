Welcome to our Prison! If you are here, you have been sentenced by the Supreme Court or The Lower Courts. However many months or years your sentence is... We plan to make your stay here the worst you&#39;ve ever had. If you are to leave this region whilst in sentence, you will be forever banjected from the Thunder Territory. THANK YOU!

The prison runs in a sort of corrupted way. The more influence you have, determines how much you run the prison. For example, the most influential person will practically run the prison. But no one is above the Warden. Maximum security prisoners will send the prison into complete lock down.
