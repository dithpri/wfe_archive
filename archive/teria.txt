[url=https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc]Hello there[/url], Teria is a close-knit community of talented idiots.

We&#39;ve met under varying circumstances over the years; together we form this monstrosity, an open and pretty chill community that prides itself on creativity, storytelling and worldbuilding. We&#39;re simply not a competitive bunch, our goal is to just make an interesting world and tell its stories. 

So to sum it up; Teria is drama-free, tight-knit, paced and quality

Our chief domain is realistic modern tech worldbuilding and some writing/roleplay, but we have some side fantasy and scifi RP as well.
