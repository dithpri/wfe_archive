Roses are red
Violets are blue
Omae wa mo
Shindeiru 

We&#39;re just a random group of people who have met under varying circumstances over the years; together we form Teria, an open and pretty chill community that prides itself on creativity, storytelling and worldbuilding. We&#39;re simply not a competitive bunch, our goal is to just make an interesting world and tell its stories. 

So to sum it up; Teria is drama-free, tight-knit, paced and quality

So join us! Maybe?
