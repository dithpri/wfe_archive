First founded in 2003, and re-founded since, the ancient region of Sparrow continues to be held by forces disloyal to the founder, Dux Bradford John of New Bradfordsburg. Ancient Sparrow houses the Sparrowivan Republican Government In Exile.

We, the people of Sparrow, are led by the true founder and president of Sparrow, who was deposed in brutal fashion by a coup d&#39;&eacute;tat in December 2003, assisted by international influences.

For over 16 years, we have waged war against our rivals. The nations of Tygaland, Yotimmoto and Celtayoshi are our enemies. But, until they are defeated, we claim Ancient Sparrow as the true Sparrowivan homeland, and the true guardians of the ancient legacy of Sparrow.
