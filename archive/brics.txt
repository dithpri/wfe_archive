BRICS is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Goldman Sachs economist Jim O&#39;Neill coined the term BRIC (without South Africa) in 2001, claiming that by 2050 the four BRIC economies would come to dominate the global economy by 2050. South Africa was added to the list in 2010.
