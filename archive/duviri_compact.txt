The Duviri Compact was forged in the aftermath of growing geopolitical instability, economic fluctuations, and the ever-present threat of unchecked imperial expansion. A coalition of sovereign states, led by Hollvania, recognized the need for a unified front to ensure mutual prosperity, collective security, and political cooperation. The Compact was signed in the grand halls of Valkenheim, Hollvania&#146;s capital, in a historic summit attended by leaders from across the region.
