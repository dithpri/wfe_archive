Formally known as Lateran City (Civitatis Lateranense), Laterano is a Terran country which borders Iberia, Rim Billiton, Siracusa, and Victoria. It is a small, theocratic city-state and the homeland of the Sankta race with a decent population of Liberi who are descendants of Iberian immigrants. The nation is ruled by the Pope, the leader of the Lateran Church, with a constitution that guarantees thirteen rights to its citizens.
