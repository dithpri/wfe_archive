The Union of The Synylax Dynasty is a region where any nation is welcome. 
It was created to remember the great ruler Synylax the First. 
The region relies on democracy and economy. 
Each member is required to adopt the Imperial Sinissian Dollar as their currency (Exceptions for this rule are allowed in some cases). 
The currency change is the only obligation* in the region.
