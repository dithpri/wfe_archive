We shall advocate the sciences, rationalism, culture development, philsosophy and free- thinking. All members shall be treated with the same respect, and with no religious biases. Democracy will of course be encouraged between nations, but there is no sanctions for having a non-democratic government. All will be able to vote and suspension/ejection will be a power used only when absolutely necessary,  and there are no other courses of action. Please, enjoy your time here and feel free to debate life&amp;#39;s questions with each other.
