In this region you can roleplay as a WW1 era fantasy race including elves, orcs, humans, eldarians, and stone elves. In this region you can use WW1 technology including early tanks, gas, machine guns, submarines, telegrams, and biplanes. But you may also use things such as magic as this is a fantasy setting, our only rules are keeping real life arguments out of the chat, no modern technology, and keep wars realistic to the technology you have. This means you may not have any policies to do with robots, the internet, or any other modern technologies.
