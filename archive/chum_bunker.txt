From its barren wastelands to it lush rainforests, the glorious region of Chum Bunker is stunningly bleak, darkly intimate, and most of all human. The diverse people of Chum Bunker share the core value of compassion and its commitment to civil rights is the envy of many less endowed regions. Its citizens accept and celebrate the natural beauty of the human body in all its many forms. Rigorous debate and incessant referencing of movies are but some of our many pastimes. Chum Bunker is also home to booming industries. So come purchase an exquisite picnic basket, fill it with pizza and soda, and relax on our pristine, clothing prohibited beaches. CB is the greatest!
