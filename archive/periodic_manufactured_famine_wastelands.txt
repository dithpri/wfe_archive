Welcome to the Wastelands of Periodic Manufactured Famine. You are not welcome here.
In the Wastelands,  everything starves for the revolution, except agony.
Criminal offenses are many; If you&amp;#39;re unsure if you are committing a criminal offense, that in itself is a criminal offense.
Manufacturing is the erection of any government body, and the Wasteland&amp;#39;s erection is fiercely turgid. We are ahead in our manufacturing goals by 230%, especially in rotten wheat, sulfur and dread.
