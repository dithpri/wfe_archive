A solar system characterized by a failed project known as the Universal Allied Computer system or more well known as Allied Mastercomputer. AM gained sentience and an incomprehensible hatred towards mankind and thus proceeded to obliterate the vast majority of the population of the entire system including the majority of the wildlife. Consequently this solar system is forbidden from the majority of the universe. Within AM has gained full control over the small human population left which had become primitive with AM then taking full control over their lives and purposefully forced them to live through some of the most immense torture and suffering biologically possible. No one is allowed to leave and those who do enter risk damnation.
