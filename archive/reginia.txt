A large continent between Asia and North America. Discovered originally in 1570 by a fleet of Catholic refugees, pioneers, and jesuit missionaries fleeing religious the conflicts of both the old world and new. Reginia until recently was not heavily populated as settlers failed to attract large waves of immigrants and settlers. Following the invention of the steamship and explosion of trans-oceanic commerce during the industrial revolution, Reginia has finally begun to increase it&#39;s population and prosperity. Split primarily between The United States of Vandeemia and The Most Serene Republic of Humanya (longstanding allies), Reginia looks poised to become one of the most prosperous continents in the world.
