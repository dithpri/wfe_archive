The Galactic Community is a gathering of many interstellar empires, coalitions, federations, and hegemonies. Even a few Awakened Empires have joined it, if only to impose their ideologies on the younger members. Though it welcomes all, not everyone in the Galactic Community gets along, with friction between internal factions, and even outright schisms. However, it manages to maintain relative peace throughout the galaxy while the Galactic Council passes resolutions, imposes sanctions, and sets the Galactic Focus.

The current Galactic Custodian is The Alarian Ascendancy, a young but incredibly advanced Psionically Ascended empire.
