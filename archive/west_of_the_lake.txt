[color=#424242]Here&#39;s a little bit about us. We are a small, new region who consider ourselves a private military contractor. We only deal with small nations, because of our lack of size (Which will change in the coming time). We do not have any fancy established forum as of yet, so if you&#39;d like to communicate with us send a telegram to [nation=short+noflag]Mercs of Old[/nation] or [nation=short+noflag]Potere di Lucius[/nation].[/color] [b][i]Gemeinsam, erobern wir.[/b][/i][hr][color=#B40404]News:[/color] -Massive update for the region, new World Factbook Entry, changing the flag soon as well.
-Recruit! Ask if anyone you know plays Nationstates or wants to try it, and tell them to join us here.[hr][b]If you are not yet, join the World Assembly and endorse our WA Delegate [nation=short]Potere di Lucius[/nation][/b]
