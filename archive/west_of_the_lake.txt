[b][color=green]Welcome to West of the lake! [/color][/b][color=blue][b][i][u]  #FreePepe2k16[/b][/u][/i][/color][hr] 
[u][b]NOTE[/b][/u]:We are still in the early stages and are slowly developing, until we are near finished with the construction of our region, please just have a good relaxing time, here, enjoy 10 hours of some complimentary [b][i]Smooth Jazz[/i][/b], and if you are feeling thirsty, then we recommend you take a look at our drink menu. (Figured people would like a drink menu to look at, we&#39;re kind of boring here)
