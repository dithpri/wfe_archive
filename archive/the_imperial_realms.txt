This region is still under development, please inquire about its future through the founding nation, [nation]Kasja[/nation] (puppet of main nation [nation]Burlington-Sverige[/nation]), or through its co-founder, [nation]Briannia[/nation].

Much work is being done to facilitate the region&amp;#39;s creation, so please bear with the two of us while we work diligently to iron out the details.

Many thanks.
