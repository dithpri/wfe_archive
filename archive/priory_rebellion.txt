[b]We are the Rebels, and we will try to take control of any region that annoys us in anyway. Dont mess with this.[/b]

I am Pleased to inform the nations of the Priory Rebellion that the election has ended and Baggus has become the WA Delegate once again.

Following this Election there will be a new Policy.

Every 4 weeks a new  election will be held; a delegate can be re-elected an infinite amount of times, so long as they are continuously elected.

I hope that this policy will help instill a new state of democracy within the region and help in establishing us as a true Region.

With regards,

The Armed Republic of Baggus
WA Delegate
