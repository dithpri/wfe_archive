[I]What is [url=http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Stargate_Command]Stargate Command[/url] (the SGC)?  It&#39;s a top-secret US Air Force military base tasked with operating the Stargate, a portal that opens a wormhole between two distant points in space.  The SGC is located one thousand meters beneath Cheyenne Mountain. This protects it from most forms of attack, including nuclear attacks.  The primary function of the base is to secure the Stargate, to protect the Earth, and to coordinate exploration and diplomatic missions with distant races and worlds.  One must first enter the SGC and submit to a rigorous physical and psychological evaluation in order to access the [region]Stargate[/region].[/I]
