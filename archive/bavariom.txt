From the cold Kahnor mountains in the north,
the green valleys of Artasia in the east,
the great bay of Viderien in the south and the great island of Drincania in the west,
the Bavariom region has been in conflict since its inception.

Beginning with the Beldar River War where the Suanian tribes defeated and stopped the advance north of the Pomian Empire.
The 130 years war where the kingdom of vrinland tried to unite the crowns of Vrinland and Granzia in one.
The Artasian wars where Granzia tried to dominate the east under his flag.
And the Great Bavariom war.

Since the great Bavariom war peace has prevailed in the region,
but sooner or later the armies will mobilize, the skies will darken and the green valleys of Bavariom will burn once more.
