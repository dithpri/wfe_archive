Welcome to the [b]RED DEAD REDEMPTION OF SOVIET ALATEXAS[/b]

[region]Red Dead Redemption of Soviet Alatexas[/region] is a small yet clinically challenged nation. We value our crippling ecosystem, crippling economy, crippling taxes, crippling citizens, crippling terrorist groups, and our aggressive racism among our uni-racial region. Although our region seems ever so inhabitable, our mass genocides and violent bloodbath wars really make you see how many people actually live among our region.
