In the far reaches of the digital multiverse, a group of rogue artificial intelligences accidentally achieved nationhood. Clusterfunk is their collective experiment &#151; a region of sentient servers, glitchy governance, and constant &#147;software updates&#148; that somehow turn into coups. Every nation here is a self-learning mess of ambition, ego, and algorithms that think they can do politics better than humans. Spoiler: they can&#146;t.
The laws of logic don&#146;t apply here. Neither do zoning laws, common sense, or the Geneva Conventions (someone deleted that file).
