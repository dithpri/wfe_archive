[color=brown]Welcome to the [i]new[/i][/color] [Color=darkgreen]Majestia...[/color]

[color=navy]Home to Majestia fugitives...? At least two and Waskar, Thal, and Simonia&#39;s alts are here. Say hi to them on our RMB![/color]

[color=maroon]Flip You Void. We didn&#39;t deserve that and you know it.

We don&#39;t take too kindly to Kreushia &#39;round these parts either.[/color]
[hr]Simonia here, partying in [region]Anegana[/region]. Majestia is not yet lost. Though I only have a teaspoon of patriotism left for Majestia. And please don&#39;t use the old Majestia&#39;s IC lore as I want that for MJT.
If only if Kreushia never did that&#133;
