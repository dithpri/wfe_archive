All hail! The Kilklan!
Our beautiful Solar System was created a millennia ago, with the Binonians and Diealots following shortly after. After the rise and fall of many planets and civilizations only 12 planets remained. Our duty is to defend and protect the Kilklan and it&amp;#39;s imperative life forms. If the Kilklan falls this region will be held for all civilizations to fall back onto, so that we can survive. Our founder LionFire Lord Of All of MrDieAlot saw the need of protection for the system, and now asks planets from all over the Kilklan to join the forces and help the cause. To join, you must have strict rules and a high defense, or a high law and order. Ask the leaders of MrDieAlot to join.
