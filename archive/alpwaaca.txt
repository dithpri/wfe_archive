Alpwaaca is a home for friends of mine and participants in the WSC. Raiders, leave and never return. Everyone else is welcome here. (For the password, what is the three-word chant Burch always shouts? Enter that, uncapitalized and with no spaces.) (You also can message me and if I find you trustworthy I&#39;ll let you in.)
