The Imperial Provinces disbanded over four years ago when their Empress was voted out in a coup d&#39;etat but since has been re-instated with a new constitution that forms the government around the Imperial Family and only may continue to function with the blessing of the current sovereign. 
The old government&#39;s lack of response and secrecy to COVID-19 caused the people to rise up and demand the return of the Imperial Family. 
This caused a vote of non-confidence in the false government that took power through the coup and restored the monarchy.

In May 2020, the government restored all powers of government to the reigning sovereign.
