London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle comes down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls

London calling, now don&#39;t look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain&#39;t got no swing
&#39;Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming, the sun&#39;s zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running but I have no fear
&#39;Cause London is drowning and I live by the river
