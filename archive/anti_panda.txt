[color=blue][b]Hey! The [region]Blanket Fort Legion[/region] ventured out beyond their fortress, on a mission to raise the moon and lower the sun, wrapping this region in an eternal lullaby.[/b][/color]

[color=purple][i]Now the hour has come at last
The soft and fading light
Has crossed the west horizon
And has bidden us goodnight
And what a lovely night it is
To walk a moonlit field
To see the softer shades
That are by starlight now revealed[/i][/color]

[color=blue][b]After leaving you a yummy cake, we signed our names in the icing![/b][/color]

[b]Lonely Prince [nation]Castle Town by the Dark[/nation] (trigger)
Not One to Throw Stones [nation]GLASS HOUSES[/nation]

With Love, the BFL &amp;lt;3
