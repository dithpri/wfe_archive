An RP group that broke off from the LKE. The nation-states side of things has been more or less abandoned out of a lack of interest and is only being maintained so that Onder can&#39;t pretend like he won, but the RP is alive and well. 

The RP is currently set in the early 20th century and is open to new players. Join the discord if you are interested.
