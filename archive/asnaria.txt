Because it rejects the very worth of the human individual apart from the state and racist ideology, fascism cannot be accepted, for [b][color=#66000E]it is anathema to a culture of life[/color][/b]. Fascism, in all its forms, has no place anywhere.

Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.&#148;[/color][/b][hr]Much thanks to the support from the Army of Freedom ([region]Federation of Conservative Nations[/region]) and the [region]Joint Task Force[/region] ([region]Augustin Alliance[/region]) for their assistance in this operation.
