In The Utopia of Rapture, we are all family. We work together to crush the parasites that the other regions want to join us, or to start a war with us.
In the chains of life, Rapture is the foundation and each country that joins is a link in that chain. So break the chains my brothers and sisters of your previous regions! Say hello to your new life in Rapture!
THE GREAT NEED NOT FEAR THE SMALL!
