I am Andrew Ryan and I am here to ask you a question:
 Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?

 No, says the man in Washington. It belongs to the poor.
 No, says the man in the Vatican. It belongs to God.
 No, says the man in Moscow. It belongs to everyone.

 I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something
 different. I chose the impossible. I chose...
 The Utopia Of Rapture!
