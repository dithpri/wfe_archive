[b] Welcome to The Umbra! [/b]
This region is for anyone to join.
We are a small, but efficient raiding group!
[i] But what is raiding? [/i]
Raiding is when a region gets their nations to move dummy nations (called puppets) to a region. These puppets all endorse a single nation. Once the nation has enough endorsements by the time the game processes issues, the nation becomes the new WA delegate, and the region is ours!
