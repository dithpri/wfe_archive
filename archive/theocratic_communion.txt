Considering a theocratic conversion? Spirituality giving you the shivers? The [i]good[/i] shivers? Confide in the Theocratic Communion (as well as in whatever it is that you worship. That as well.)

All theocratic nations are welcomed to the Theocratic Communion. The religion which rules over your nation-state does not matter as long as there is some sort of religion (or relatively religious body) ruling.
