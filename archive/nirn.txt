[b]Greetings Adventure and welcome to Nirn![/b] We are a loosely lore accurate Elder Scrolls RP region set in the Stormcrown Interregnum. For those who do not know, the Stormcrown Interregnum was a seven-year period that occurred during the early Fourth Era in which the Elder Council fractured, thus leading into years of ruthless fighting, scandalous plots, and betrayal. It all began with the murder of Potentate Ocato, leading many to make claims on the Ruby Throne or break off from the Empire and forge your own path.
