Nirn is referred to by otherworldly beings as the mortal plane and sometimes poetically called &amp;quot;the Mundus&amp;quot; by mortals. The exact reasons and specifics behind Nirn&amp;#39;s creation are largely not known for certain. However, all agree that the deity Lorkhan and the Eight Divines played pivotal roles in the creation of the waterlogged planet. Two moons, Secunda and Masser, orbit Nirn. They are Lorkhan&amp;#39;s sundered corpus. Nirn is the center of Mundus, which itself is the &amp;quot;hub&amp;quot; of The Elder Scrolls universe&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;wheel.&amp;quot; The heavens beyond Nirn are star-filled. These stars are holes or portals through Oblivion to Aetherius, and carry magical significance due to the beings which tore them open, the Magna Ge.
