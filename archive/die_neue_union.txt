We are the new Union of Change, rising from the ashes of the old empire to create a new one. We tell the story of the days of old and will be the last ones to be here while our mother nation, Crevival may cease to exist. We thank Valtofrinna, The Plane, and the Union of Change for making all of this possible, we also would like to thank the Amalgamation Confederation for also splitting the Union up and helping us break free from those cold chains.

Thank You for your time,
Bolano
