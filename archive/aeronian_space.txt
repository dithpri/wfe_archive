Part of the [region]Imperial Galactic Republic of Andarios[/region]! Aeron gave the name to this area of the Oort Cloud that served for centuries as a military frontier between the Solar System and other galaxies. Aeron was the last planet conquered by the andarians and because of their resistance, the andarian government allowed the planet to be known as Aeronian Space, as a homage!
