The Terran Republic (TR) is an empire with a rich history extending 1,112 years. They brought order out of chaos and introduced an era of peace to the world. Since the armistice and the formation of the new government, they were the singular political force on Earth, and they set up an open and transparent government. This helped keep the peace for nearly two hundred years.

The Terran Republic is built around order and the rule of law, with the central tenet that no individual is above the rules. Loyalty and fealty are core to the Terran Republic ethos and from that grows a spirit of total camaraderie and brotherhood amongst its proud and mighty warriors.
