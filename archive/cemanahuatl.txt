Cemanahuatl, meaning World and Universe, is a small but diverse world of tyrannical and democratic nations alike. The fall of the Altecan Empire has brought a new era, one where each nation strives for power and rightful standing among their peers. Cemanahuatl is an open canvas, to tell the tragic and heroic stories of your modern civilization. We are a region that strives to be interesting in our roleplays, accessible and quality. Together, as writers we form a collective world history.
