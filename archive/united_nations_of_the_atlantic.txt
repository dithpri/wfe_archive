Hello and welcome to [color=blue] The United Nations of the Atlantic![/color] Right now, we are facing some difficulties with [nation]The New Global Proletariat[/nation], who has declared himself Interim President of UNOA. Of course, he is not really the president, and [b][i][u]Please keep in mind that this revolution is both illegal and unwise.[/u][/i][/b] Please see our poll to decide what will happen to [nation]The New Global Proletariat[/nation]. In other news, if you see anyone that spreads pro-[region]Mordkan Empire[/region] propaganda or anyone with the [region]Mordkan Empire[/region] flag, please let us know and don&#146;t listen to them. [region]Mordkan Empire[/region] want to take over all of NationStates through violence. That&#146;s all for now, have fun here in [region]United Nations of the Atlantic[/region]!

[b]Long live UNOA![/b]
