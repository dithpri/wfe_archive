Hello and welcome to [color=blue] The United Nations of the Atlantic![/color] 

We are currently in a transition period to establish a new, strong government in our region. We invite all opinions on this matter to be shared in the Regional Message Board or with one of the current officers! Here you are entitled to a strong and equal voice in our decision-making process, and we invite everyone to utilize that right. Remember to have fun and be respectful!
