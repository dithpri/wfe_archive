The United Nations of the Atlantic was made as a region for nations to come and do what they want. Historical lore says that the official religion is Krakenism, or worship of the Kraken; however, all nations have freedom of religion and are able to do whatever they want. The only rule of the UNA is that there is no insulting another nation for any reason; debate is fine, but if personal attacks are used, the comment will be deleted. After three warnings, the offender will be kicked out of the region, and after three more, they will be banned.
