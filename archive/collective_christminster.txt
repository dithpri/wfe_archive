Chicken Tikka Masala

Leftover chicken tikka masala tastes phenomenal the next day because the spices develop more flavor overnight.
Avoid using Greek yogurt if possible for this recipe. If it&#39;s all you can find, buy the Greek yogurt with the highest fat content you can find and mix it with a little whole milk to get the consistency of regular yogurt. This will give the sauce some insurance against separating.
