Hello, Cave Johnson here.

The lab boys say that injecting doses of radiation doesn&amp;#39;t make the test subjects gain extra limbs for the completion of this test course, but instead may give them cancer. Luckily a quick donation to a cancer research fund may save the poor guys back side, cause it doesn&amp;#39;t look too pretty right now.

Cave Johnson out, continue your testing.
