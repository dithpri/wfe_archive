That Other Region has a live and let live policy amongst the countries which inhabit it, a sort of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t tread on me&amp;quot; way of living. That Other Region was made some time ago, but at one point ceased to exist, during which time the name was taken by another region. To deal with this issue, upon reestablishment the region was dubbed The Original That Other Region.
