The Atlantian Getaway is a chain of islands located in the Mid Atlantic, surrounded by sharp rocks as tall as mountains. Just going pass it gives the average person the creeps. It keeps outsiders away like it was designed to do. But once you get a glimpse pass the rocky barrier, the country is simply beautiful. Crystal clear waters, white sanded beaches.It truly is paradise. It has fresh clean air and grows a variety of fruits and vegetables. The only way to access the area is by going under the rocks and coming back up from the other side.The entrance is heavily guarded.The sun is shining most of the time and the weather is just right. Not too hot, and not too cold, just perfect!
