This is a region comprised of nations adhering to New/Universal Humanist principles. 

The basis of this philosophy is nonviolence and nondiscrimination, affirming the equality of all human beings, recognizing personal and cultural diversity, affirming the freedom of ideas and beliefs, and repudiating violence in all its forms.

Thus, Humanists advocate policies for greater social freedom (such as same-sex marriage; legalisation of abortion and marijuana), just economic policies (against both laissez faire capitalism and socialism - both systems of oppression over human beings) in the context of a mixed economy, and democratic institutions.
