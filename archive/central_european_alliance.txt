&amp;gt;Hello, and welcome to Central Europe, where all the business goes on in the world!

&amp;gt;Don&#39;t forget to praise our Lord Augustin and to [u][b]never question Augustin&#39;s rule[/b][/u]

&amp;gt;You can always see many things in this great region, include the great Luxembourg City! The largest city in all of Europe with 

&amp;gt;27 million people living there!

&amp;gt;We do allow all types of rulers here, so long as they don&#39;t interfere with the flow of our great region!

&amp;gt;[color=red][b][u]Don&#39;t forget to endorse our founder [nation]The Luxembourg Union[/nation][/b][/u][/color]
