The [b][i]Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic[/i][/b] (SADR) is a partially recognised state that claims sovereignty over the entire territory of [region]Western Sahara[/region], a former Spanish colony. SADR was proclaimed by the Polisario Front on February 27, 1976 in Bir Lehlu, [region]Western Sahara[/region]. 

The SADR government currently controls about 20-25% of the territory it claims. It calls the territories under its control the Liberated Territories or the Free Zone. [region]Morocco[/region] controls and administers the rest of the disputed territory and calls these lands its Southern Provinces. The SADR government considers the Moroccan-held territory occupied territory, while [region]Morocco[/region] considers the much smaller SADR held territory to be a buffer
