The Feather Friends are a prestigious group of commies, druggies, freedom lovers, freedom haters, and chupacapras. You will find that our citizens are violent, our enemies are numerous, and our ladybugs are very well-placed.

*NEWS UPDATE*: Most member states of the Feather Friends haven&amp;#39;t been active in over 10 days. We face certain demise if the puny nations aren&amp;#39;t eliminated and we make an effort to become more powerful. 5 nations controlled by 3 people are the only ones that log on regularly. So for the both of you that read this, it may just be us within weeks.
