The Feather Friends are a prestigious group of commies, druggies, freedom lovers, freedom haters, and chupacapras. You will find that our citizens are violent, our enemies are numerous, and our ladybugs are very well-placed. Our founding father is Trey of T-raytopia. Our current World Assembly delegate is Raymond of Dioxeye. Some founding nations include T-raytopia, Davissia, Lesser Syndicated Democracies, Olsenon, Dioxeye, and Foreverson. We have experienced many external conflicts such as the Great Featherless Enemies War, as well as internal conflicts like the tense Cold War of the Davissian Colonies. We stay strong and continue to include new, productive nations who wish to join.
