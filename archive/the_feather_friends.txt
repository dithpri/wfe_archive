The [region]Feather Friends[/region] are a proud group of commies, druggies, freedom-lovers, freedom-haters, and chupacabras. It was founded on December 8, 2013 by the Rogue Nation of [nation]T-raytopia[/nation]. The long-standing delegate is [nation]Davissia[/nation].We welcome all well-meaning and active nations to join. Please contact the delegate if you would like to apply to join. You will find that our comment section is always exciting, our members always odd, and ladybugs are very well-placed.
