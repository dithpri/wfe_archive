One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don&#39;t drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don&#39;t disrespect your seed
It&#39;s a party tonight and ooh, she&#39;s so excited
