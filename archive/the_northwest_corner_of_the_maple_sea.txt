A group of countries that reside on the beautiful timber-filled shoreline of the Northwest Corner of the Maple Sea - a golden sea teeming with natural wonders. 

According to legend, the sea turns into actual maple syrup once in a blue moon. 

This new-founded region has lots of room for peaceful countries looking to improve their economy with this resource-rich land!

Syrup lovers and non-syrup lovers alike are encouraged to join and enjoy the view!

(The sunsets are spectacular)
