[color=blue][i]You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I&#39;ll rise.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I&#39;ll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I&#146;ll rise.

Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that&#146;s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave me,
I am the dream and the hope of the invaded.
I rise
I rise
I rise.
