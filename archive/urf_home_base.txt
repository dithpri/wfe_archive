The home of the United Right Front, or URF. This is where the Council meets, Generals make decisions, and formal allies embassies are built.

The URF was founded on December 28, 2017 by [nation]Cossack Khanate[/nation] to maintain the integrity and coordination of the Right.&nbsp;

Ambassadors are no longer required to move in since the construction of our Discord.
