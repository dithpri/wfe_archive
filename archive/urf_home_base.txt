[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Captured: 10.08.18[/I]

[color=red]Formerly the home of the Fascist United Right Front collation consisting of [region]Royal Order[/region], [region]The Iron Order[/region], [region]Altmora[/region], [region]Union of the Fascist States[/region], [region]Order Of The Black Eagle[/region], [region]The Union of the Axis Powers[/region], [region]The Coalition of Fascist Nations[/region] and [region]Angvar[/region].

This region has been captured by the mighty Anti-Nazi/Fascist Warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.

Its invasion serves as a reminder that hate mongering will not be tolerated by the truly free people of this world. We cannot allow hate to spread to the young and impressionable of society, because it will only hurt/slow the progression of humanity in the long run.[/color]
