Alura, a mysterious and magical world. Numerous islands and continents float on an ocean of air, suspended in the sky. Some islands are covered in forests, some have lakes, others are deserts, or arctic wastes. Inhabitants of Alura are as varied as the climates of the islands they inhabit. Elves, dwarves, goblins, dragons, and many more exotic races live here. Magic permeates the land, existing both in the wild and practiced by beings.

Alura is the Fantasy Tech RP Group for [region]The Western Isles[/region]. If you&amp;#39;re not a member of TWI, you may still apply, and perhaps be accepted.
