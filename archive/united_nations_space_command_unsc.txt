The United Nations Space Command, more commonly known as the UNSC, is the military, exploratory, and scientific agency of the Unified Earth Government.

UN clashes with dissident political movements, the most important of which were the &quot;Koslovics&quot; and the &quot;Frieden,&quot; began the crisis that led to the formation of the UNSC. The Frieden movement was a fascist organization based on the Jovian Moons, a group that received backing from some corporations operating in the Federal Republic of Germany on Earth. Their ideological opponents, the Koslovics, formed a Marxist&#150;Leninist group centered around the leadership of Vladimir Koslov around the same time.
