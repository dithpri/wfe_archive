A region inspired by &amp;quot;When It Changed&amp;quot; by Joanna Russ.

[u][i]Whileaway[/u][/i] is an human colony on another planet. 30 generations earlier, a plague killed off all the men and the population now consists only of women who have figured out how to combine eggs to produce offspring. It is a largely agricultural society, and the whole range of human behaviors exhibited by men and women on Earth are here in evidence within the all-female society. For example, usually on average an adult woman has fought several duels, and girls love to hunt and have adventures.

No [u][B]embassies[/B][/u] with regions with aggressive behavior (including [i][u][B]misogyny[/B][/u][/i] and [i][u][B]misandry[/B][/u][/i]). 
ALL others are OK.
