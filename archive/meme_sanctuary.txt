Do you like memes? Have you ever wondered why people are so strict? and why you can&#39;t joke or mess around. If you like memes, joking around or having fun in general this is the place for you. I have multiple nations on the nation-states. I was on my joke/meme nation called The-Actual-Worst-Nation-Ever. I posted a meme song called Thanos beatbox and you wanna know what they did? They looked down a pawn me and shamed me for making a joke. But we don&#39;t do that here. We are a free, open region for everyone. From Psychotic Dictator to capitalist paradise.
