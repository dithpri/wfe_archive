[color=blue]Utapau was a remote planet in the Outer Rim Territories&#39; Utapau system that was filled with enormous sinkholes. Its native inhabitants were the Pau&#39;ans and the Utai, while tribes of Amani also immigrated to the world. It was the location of the Battle of Utapau during the Clone Wars. 

During the final days of the Clone Wars, a number of key Separatist leaders were stationed on the planet, but were moved to a fortified bunker on [region]Mustafar[/region] prior to the battle on the orders of Darth Sidious. 

General Grievous remained on Utapau to oversee the battle, but met his end at the hands of Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi[/color]
