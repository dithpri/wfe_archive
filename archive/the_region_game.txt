[color=cornflowerBlue][b]Welcome to the Region Game! A region where anyone can be a RO![/b][/color]
Here, you can do many things! Mess with the WFE, eject nations, send embassies to your heart&#39;s delight, and so much more!
...or you can just chill in our RMB.

TRG and TRGII are universal puppet dumps! Feel free to dump puppets here! (If you&#39;re lucky, you could even be appointed a Regional Officer!)
