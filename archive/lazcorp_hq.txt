[color=sapphireblue]The [b]Love Live Star Idol Forces[/b] have arrived again!! Once under the control of [region=Lazarus], this region has been reclaimed in the name of [region=Love Live]! Turns out, a revival was made, but then entered bankruptcy! Fret not, Natsumi Onitsuka was here to purchase it and now gave the building a redesign![/color]

[colour=marigold]Welcome inside, where music festivals and planetariums await you! Our new food court has good options, such as Dunkin&#39;, TGI Friday&#39;s, and Culver&#39;s to name a few! We even have a hotel area, a theatre, an arcade, bowling, and so much more! Enjoy your visit![/colour]
