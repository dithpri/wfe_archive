Welcome to the Alliance of Righteous Nations! Please, enjoy your stay!

RULES:
1. Please take this seriously. I really do not care if your nation is a bit...wacky, but as long as you play serious, it&#39;s fine.
2. You cannot be in here if you treat your citizens like trash. We are for the righteous only.
3. If you do not have common sense, you cannot join.

ABOUT:
