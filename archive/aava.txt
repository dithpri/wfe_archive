We are the Region of Aava. We aim to cater to both sides of the NationStates Community: Roleplay and External Relations.

The Region has an internal Roleplay environment, in which you can run your country as you see fit, participating in politics, wars, trading, and everything else, to your heart&#39;s desire.

We also feature our own Assembly. As a member of this assembly, you can decide on the next course of action for the Region as a whole inside of the NationStates Community, and sway the Regional Delegate to vote in favor of your opinion, or not in-favor of the other guy. If you want more information, feel free to post a message in our Regional RMB.
