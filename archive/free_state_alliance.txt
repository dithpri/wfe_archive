On December 8th, 2014, Syrillian forces re-took the Free State Alliance, wresting control of the region from the Bordurian Empire. The FSA has been liberated, and will never fall again.

The Treaty of Volnoth is reinstated, and on yet another battlefront Syrillian forces have proven superior to the crumbling Bordurian Empire. The FSA is now again under the control of its original founder, and liberty has won the day.

May the Bordurian Empire never triumph again.

The Free State Alliance is now the Syrillian Liberation Command Headquarters, which is tasked solely with liberating as much of the Bordurian Empire as possible.
