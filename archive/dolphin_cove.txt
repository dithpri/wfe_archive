[b][color=darkblue]A Sassoon Appreciation Region![/color][/b]

[color=blue]Dedicated to one of the most loyal and active Pacificans, as demonstrated in the following description:

Founded 1 year and 313 days ago, Sassoon made a name for dolphinkind, surpassing all dolphins that came before on NS. Leading projects, working hard for the region, and wielding the Bantrident, Sassoon deserves his own appreciation region wholly.

Congratulations, and thanks for all of your hard work, Sassoon.[/color]
