The Alliance of Stone is an Alliance between many different nations. Our region can be described in two words: organized chaos. Anything can happen here, so stop on by. 

While existing in our region, you can expect countless debates and arguments. If you ever so wish, you may join our [url=https://discord.gg/rWjb4MJ]Discord![/url]

If you wanna roleplay, go ahead and try. We don&#39;t judge here, just don&#39;t be too weird. 

We are very active and love political discussions. Remember, STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE.
