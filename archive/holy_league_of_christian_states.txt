[b]Hello There![/b]
We are the [region]Holy League of Christian States[/region]!

[i][color=blue]What is this region?[/color][/i]
The Holy League of Christian States was established in 1509, during the Treaty of Salamanca. This was the first international call for an alliance based on Christendom. Of course, not all Christian nations are inside it. But it&#39;s main function works as to protect the interest of the Church and the Christians in general.

[i][color=red]How can I apply?[/color][/i]
The only way to join is by contacting [nation]Espainia[/nation] requesting to join in. A formula of questions will be given, and after being answered in a proper way (The King has perfectionist issues, so keep it the cleanest, please!).
