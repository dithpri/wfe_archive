The Armed Alliance of Aeternum was founded by The Empire of Valenian, in coalition with The Holy Empire of Potestas Aeterna, The Empire of Moterra and The Nomadic Peoples of Felastria. The Armed Alliance of Aeternum denounces the World Assembly along with its feeble laws and legislation. The Armed Alliance of Aeternum promotes its own independence, without the need of such liberal and anti-evolutionary beliefs. The Armed Alliance of Aeternum praises its own sovereignty, as it needs not to depend on a false and unrightful governing body to make decisions for them.
