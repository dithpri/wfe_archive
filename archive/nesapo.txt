[color=red][b]Want to get bloody effing drunk? Then get the hell out! You can&#39;t RP while inebriated! Well, you can, but then you end up writing about paying cookies as war reparations and starting a Byzantine Republic.[/b][/color]

Originally founded on 2 April 2013, Nesapo is a cozy little place built on community and roleplay. Three years later and we&#39;re finally rebuilding, so feel free to hop in for the ride. Regional map coming soon, along with some RP and such.
