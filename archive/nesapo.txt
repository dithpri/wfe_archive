[b]Hi, welcome to Nesapo.[/b]

Founded in early April, 2013, by [nation]Bodobol[/nation], with the assistance of his friend Mojave (now known as Ikania), Nesapo grew to become a thriving region with over 30 active players by the end of the year. It eventually merged into [region]Khora[/region], creating a 100-nation megastate, which collapsed after a month.

Nesapo since then has been a husk, a shell of its former self. Recently, the region and its over three years of history ceased to exist. Founder Bodobol and first Delegate Ikania have returned to make Nesapo great again.
