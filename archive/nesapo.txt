[b][color=#659D32]Welcome to Nesapo![/color][/b]

Like a phoenix, we are returning from the ashes. Nesapo lived from April 2nd, 2013 to December 2nd of the same year, when we migrated to the failed experiment known as Khora. Now, however, we rise again!

That is, if we can be bothered to get some damned recruitment going.
