[color=red][b]Welcome to Nesapo![/b][/color]

Originally founded in 2013, this region merged with Swine, Miranda and Winterfell Islands to become [region]Khora[/region], which sadly collapsed in January 2014. Since then, Nesapo has been largely inactive but the old residents are trying to bring it back.
