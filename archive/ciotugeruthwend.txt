This sprawling castle, built of translucent glass and set in the middle of a lake, belongs to a minor queen.  It contains a penniless adventurer and appears to be crowded. It is approached by a narrow dirt road. Nearby is a bustling gnomish settlement in which there is a resident madman.  The holding is rich in dangerous wildlife.
