[region]The Rejected Onionists[/region] is a socialist region which is like [region]The Rejected Realms[/region], but for onionists, people from [region]The Union of Great Onionist Nations[/region].
[region]The Rejected Onionists[/region] also has a password, meaning you can&#39;t raid it, it is better to not even try, or we will take the region back and put you in [region]TROs GULAG[/region], where enemies of the state and people are obligated to work to repay their debts.
The rules are that you can&#39;t be mean to your comrades and you have to respect the rules of Nationstates, as it is the site where this region is.         
Also, please join the WA and endorse [nation]Republic Of Ludwigsburg[/nation], our WA Delegate.
