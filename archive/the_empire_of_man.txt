The Empire, sometimes referred to by more arachaic terminology as the Empire of Man, is an electoral monarchy composed of semiautonomous feudal states known as &quot;Electoral Provinces&quot; that is the largest and most important of the Human nations in the Old World. It was forged by the warrior-king and ascended deity Sigmar from the primitive tribes of Human barbarians who inhabited what became the lands of the Empire more than 2500 years ago. Although not as skilled in craftsmanship or engineering as the Dwarfs or in magic as the High Elves, the people of the Empire are not beholden by the limits of tradition to the same extent as the Elder Races and continue to progress culturally, technologically and magically.
