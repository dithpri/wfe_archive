The Regional Authority of Imperial Command is the region in-which any nation may join but understands that their nation&amp;#39;s political ideologies must fit in with that of the region. And that their national &amp;quot;way of life&amp;quot; is under the scrutiny of Imperial Command. However, this is a region of co-operation and as such all regional members will work together to bring the glory of our like minds to the world stage.
