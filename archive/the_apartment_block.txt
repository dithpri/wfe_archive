[color=#FF0000][b]4 Step Zombie Destruction Strategy Protocol[/color]

Nations with large militaries (determined by Defense budget as percentage of Government Spending), or or with populations in the single digit millions, should choose Option 1, exterminate. Switch to research. after zombies are gone. 

Nations with negligible military forces, or with large populations (at least several hundred millions), should choose Option 2, research. Large populations will be able to hold out longer against the spread of the virus, and so they can begin researching a cure right away. 

Do NOT choose Option 3.[/b]
