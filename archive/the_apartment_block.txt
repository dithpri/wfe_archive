The Apartment Block is dedicated to role play. We are a P2TM-based gathering spot. We have an active Founder and WA Regional Delegate, an off-site forum loaded with RP stuff and an IRC, and friendly members. You must be a member of our Region to partake in the off-site forum. Our Region does accept *ACTIVE* puppet nations for that purpose.
