This region is for true communist republics, as the name says.
We do not want: dictators/monarchs, capitalists, Stalinists/other false communists.

Those states who are in a transitional period of socialism moving towards communism are also allowed.

Unfortunately, there are many regions out there who claim to be socialist or communist, yet, when you look at it, the states there are merely dictatorships with centrally planned economies. Or capitalist &amp;#39;democracies&amp;#39; who provide tiny concessions to the people, but, by nature, can never be a people&amp;#39;s republic.
