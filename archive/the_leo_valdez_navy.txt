Once used by the nation of [nation]Team Leo[/nation], and then fallen into the hands of despair by [nation]Bhang Bhang Duc[/nation]. Disputes over ownership of it&#39;s former region, [region]The Leo Valdez Army[/region] has caused the downfall of my former region Old Zealand.

[nation]Bhang Bhang Duc[/nation] gave the region back though. This region has been refounded a zillion times by me, just forgetten to hold it. This region can have a rest, owned by it&#39;s rightful owner [nation]Team Leo[/nation].
