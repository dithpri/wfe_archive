[b][color=blue]Welcome to the Peanut Gallery![/color][/b]
The Peanut Gallery is a place for a bunch of mates to get together and engage in the noble traditions of international bickering. It is a haven for states who despise the authoritarian [region]The Insane States of Insanity[/region], and who prefer a region with liberty as its core tenet.

It is highly encouraged that all nations in the Peanut Gallery obtain WA membership.
