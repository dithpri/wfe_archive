The [region]East Asia Strategic Treaty Organization[/region], also known as [color=yellow]EAST[/color] or [color=yellow]EASTO[/color], is an intergovernmental military alliance established shortly after the establishment of the [nation=long]Privali States[/nation] in southeast Asia. Much like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, EASTO serves as a collective security measure, wherein if one member nation is attacked, others are obligated to respond.

[i]As per the Privali Constitution, all members of the Confederacy are sovereign nations in themselves. Therefore, not all Confederate states are required to join EASTO. Currently, the only Privali states to join EASTO are [nation]the Privali Philippines[/nation] and [nation]United Annam[/nation].[/i]
