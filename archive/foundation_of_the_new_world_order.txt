Dictatorships and democracies shape this land as it undergoes an imperialistic quest for more territories to benefit from. Bound together from the quest to become the very best (like no one ever was) they will be put to the test, they will seek to fulfill their holy cause. The two founding nations shall prosper together and achieve their destinies of a united world where all nations either belong to the cruel dictator or beloved president.
