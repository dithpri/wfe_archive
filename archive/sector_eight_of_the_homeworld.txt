A summary of the Homeworld, a land of wackiness and memes. The Homeworld is a place that encompasses the nations from the Surviving Canadian Resistance to British Gre Bland Mys. This is the origin point for Senscaria, the SCR, Grievation, British Gre Bland Mys, and the Most Esteemed Followers of Laffey. It is a place where the anomalous and paranormal are real, from Hell to Heaven, and other dimensions.
