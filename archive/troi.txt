Welcome to your new &quot;Home&quot; &quot;The Region Of Ionmana&quot; Here we offer multiple types of things, we offer: A Welcome community and people, help for new players, and we allow any form of government to join. Although, if you reject or disrespect our ways, you WILL be punished. We don&#39;t have a discord like most, as we know that can be frustrating, especially if you don&#39;t like discord. We DO however use multiple sites to talk about different things, depending on WHAT it is, our members can chose a site for them and others to use. We welcome you with open &quot;arms&quot;. Get it, &quot;arms&quot; as in weapons.
