Come lovers of freedom! In the immortal words of Thomas Jefferson &quot;the tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants&quot;. The government must not infringe on our rights and if they do we must rise. This region is for the nations that have risen and seized their rights from a bloated tyrannical government. The nations that have watered their tree of liberty. Our motto is simple, &quot;liberty for all&quot;, and it is a motto all must carry in their hearts
