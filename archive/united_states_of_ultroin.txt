Today we have officially joined in war world 5 when terrorists decided to attack or beloved capital. So in response we decided to drop a bomb on the terrorists main base in terroristlia. Then when that done and over with we decided to drop off a team of 1 sniper and 5 heavy duty machine gunners for protection for the sniper at every enemy base to take out the leader and second in command of that base. And as a safety percussion we had a helicopter 3 miles away from the bases for a quick and safe evacuation/ retreat so their would be minimal casualties.
