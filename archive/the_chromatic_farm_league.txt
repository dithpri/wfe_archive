We&#39;re just a quiet little community of colorful farmers. Simple, hard-working folks tilling the soil and harvesting our crops to send to the big cities. Nothing to see here, unless you&#39;re just a fan of primitive but shiny and colorful flags, in which case have a look before moving along to a more interesting region.
