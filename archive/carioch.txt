It&#39;s just this place, you know?

The original Carioch region was one of the oldest founderless regions in NS (founded in pre-2004 &quot;Antiquity&quot;) as of early 2025. Unfortunately, the one remaining original member (Toroia) briefly CTEd and the other long-term visiting nation left as well, causing the region to also CTE. Its history is sadly lost, but this refounded region carries on in its memory.
