The coalition included a cat, a goose, a dog, two foxes, a spark pigeon, and a few humans. This coalition decided to hit up the town, knocking over garbage cans, barking at random civilians, and whatever else animals do when humans aren&#146;t looking. If you too want to be a part of this coalition [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]Join Us[/url]
