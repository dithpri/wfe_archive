For those who seek tranquility in a storm, peace during war, and passiveness in aggression. We only fight when we must for civil obedience and to keep unity in that land, for there is nothing more beautiful then that of silence after thunder. All nations in The Nahlot order must follow these tenets

I) NO WAR PROCLAIMED WITHOUT REASON
II) NO WAR SHALL BE PROCLAIMED FOR THE ENTIRE ORDER
III) NATIONS THAT ARE NOT ADVANCED IN MILITARY SHALL BE PROTECTED BY THE STRONGEST

Breaking of any of the tenets is punishable by banishment, and will need all the Cuvars approval
