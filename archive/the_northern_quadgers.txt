Welcome to The Northern Quadgers!

The original founders of this area were Germania Germany and San Tyleria.
As a Region we want to be able to work efficiently and ensure that morals and ethics are maintained. No matter what religion, all is accepted in the Northern Quadgers. We will maintain civil rights, the economy, and political freedom as much as possible. 

Thank you, and we hope to see you in our region soon!
The Northern Quadgers leaders and government.
