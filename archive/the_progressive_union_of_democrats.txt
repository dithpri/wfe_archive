Welcome! We are union of democratic nations. We do not accept any kind of dictatorships. Are they either facist, communist or capitalist. We do accept all democracies, are they either socialist, centrist or social liberal.

We believe in freedom, equality and solidarity. Everything nations do must be done for the good of people by the will of people. Everyone must have same chances. We do not close our eyes in front of real issues, like poverty or economical inequality.

Welfare of all people and nature is ultimate goal!
