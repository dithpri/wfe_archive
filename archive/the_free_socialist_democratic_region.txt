[hr][b]It is time to stand up!

Socialism will lead us to the core of industry, and guide our basic beliefs.

One day equals twenty years, we shall sprint to Socialism.

Eastern winds blow, battle druns sound, now in this new world exactly who&#39;s afraid of who? It&#39;s not the People that&#39;s afraid of Capitalism, rather it&#39;s Capitalism that&#39;s afraid of us!

Capitalism turns Humans into Monsters, Socialism turns Monsters into Humans.[/b][hr]
