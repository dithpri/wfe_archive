When I first saw the name, I was like, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re kidding, right? This is a joke, right?&amp;quot; Because what two ideologies could be more contradictory than libertarianism and fascism?

But no! The founder of the previous region by this name was indeed trying to find syncretism between the two ideologies, and, oh yeah, had filled the WFE with all sorts of neo-Nazi/white-supremacist/anti-Semitic garbage.
(It sort of leaned a lot more towards the &amp;quot;fascist&amp;quot; rather than the &amp;quot;libertarian&amp;quot; side, but, whatever man.)

Anyway...
