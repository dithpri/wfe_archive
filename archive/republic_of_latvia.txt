This region was originally founded by a member of the GGR in an attempt to make up for the loss of [region]The Republic of Latvia[/region], but they made a mistake by making the founder non-executive. This was not officially declared a region of [region]The Greater German Reich[/region], so will instead be called a victory against ignorant and genocidal nazism, not the GGR specifically.

Originally occupied by [region]The Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region], but the raiders left before the region was secure. It has been secured by [color=green]The[/color] [region]Alliance Against Nazis[/region], and is jointly ruled by the two regions.

[color=red]This is a restricted military zone.[/color]
