Since the Hyphersian civil war split the great empire, the people of Cappadocia were displaced by the violent intervention of outside powers. Unable to rebuild their largely agrarian society in a scorched wasteland, the entirety of the Cappadocian people decided to migrate from Granhif as their ancestors had done before arriving at their present homeland. Years of harsh travel took a heavy toll on the Cappadocian people, who were reduced to a population of only 20,000, from their original 200,000 before the war. Nevertheless, the people of Cappadocia settled in a faraway land which they knew nothing of and called it Nova Hyphersia.
