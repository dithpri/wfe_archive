[b][region]The Communist Bloc[/region] granted mercy to [region]The Communist Nations of the World[/region] for their ceaseless spam and immature harassment. However, as a vanguard of leftist ideals, the Bloc would not tolerate the small region&#39;s homophobia, transphobia, or sectarianism. And so, [region]The Communist Nations of the World[/region] incurred the wrath of a squadron of PRAF Bomber Pilots. The brave pilots were aided by their powerful allies, the merciless assassins of [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region].

[i]Raided by the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=red_front]People&#39;s Revolutionary Air Force[/url] and [region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region]. Endorse all regional officers or face the banhammer.[/i]

(P.S: get rekt lol - [nation]New Astri[/nation])[/b]
