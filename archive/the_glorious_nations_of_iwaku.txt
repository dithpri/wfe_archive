Region under construction! I&#39;ll work on this more most likely by April 15. I have a full time job and a garden to work on and stuff too..

I am original founder of [region]Glorious Nations of Iwaku[/region] But lost my founder nation.. So My evil plan is to rebuild Iwaku here to preserve it&#39;s unique culture! the inevitable end is coming for the old region but it does not have to be the end.

WARNING! World wide recruitment telegram imminent!
