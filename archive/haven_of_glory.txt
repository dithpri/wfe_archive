Welcome to Haven of Glory. We are small and not very diverse as of now. We have dealt with Pewtopia in the past and because of them we have fled here to start a region where anyone may govern their country as they choose. There is no roleplaying hosted here but you may keep your roleplaying ties if you move here from a region where it is allowed. As of now most of our members are inactive but we still have a heartbeat as a region. We will keep on kicking until we drop. You may vote for a delegate as you choose. Votes may be open and spoken freely. Any elected officials must go through the founder first. After that the founder will work alongside the WA Delegate.
