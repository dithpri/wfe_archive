Founded by Wake Haven the region is very open and free to others. Having fair laws and free speech the region seems to welcome all who wish to enter. As Wake Haven has decided to leave the region of Pewtopia on account of their awful leader the nation wanted a place free from tyranny and oppression. Determined to keep order in this region the nations may elect their own delegate and this nation will work side by side with Wake Haven to serve the other nations. Wake Haven will keep executive authority simply to protect the region from any invasions. All nations welcome and please play nicely.
