[color=blue]Once the sprawling home of several small nations Haven of Glory was suddenly rocked by a spontaneous terrorist attack that left the region in shambles. All the nations that once resided in Haven of Glory have since moved away or ceased to exist. Now, just two years after the attack, the terrorist groups have splintered off and moved on to other regions leaving Haven of Glory to repair itself and return from the aftermath.[/color]
