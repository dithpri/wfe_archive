[b][color=blue]Where we came from.[/color][color=green]The core is probably composed mostly of iron (or nickel/iron) &amp; some lighter elements may be present. Temperatures at the center of the core may be as high as 7500 K, hotter than the surface of the Sun. The lower mantle is mostly silicon, magnesium and oxygen with some iron, calcium and aluminum. The upper mantle is mostly olivene and pyroxene (iron/magnesium silicates), calcium and aluminum. We know most of this only from seismic techniques; samples from the upper mantle arrive at the surface as lava from volcanoes but the majority of the Earth is inaccessible. The crust is primarily quartz (silicon dioxide) and other silicates like feldspar.[/color][/b]
