The CNPR is a collaborative effort originally staffed by Oak Ridge and USAEC scientists, founded on January 1, 1974 to improve on the designs of nuclear power plants through generation IV+ designs. Research is done in both types of nuclear reactor, fission and fusion.
The goals of the CNPR are to develop the safest and most efficient reactor designs available with the technology, hopefully accomplished with fluid-fueled fission reactors, to have member states reach 50% nuclear power in the next three decades, and to better the world&#39;s economy through cheap and abunant energy.
