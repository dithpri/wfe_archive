R.Z.D. (Redmurk Zone of Diplomacy and Democracy)

After fighting for independence in the Redmurk War of Secession the R.Z.D was established with the signing of the Contract of Human that sealed the government of the Redmurk Alliance. The eighth article laid out a contract held between countries in the area of the Alliance that would set up a permanent democratic association with an election for WA delegates.
