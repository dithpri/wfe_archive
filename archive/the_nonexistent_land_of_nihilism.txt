   Welcome to The Nonexistent Land of Nihilism. It&#39;s mainly for nihilists, though most idealogies are allowed. We are beginning to outlaw some nation classifications, so be warned. As long as you don&#39;t venture into illegal classifications, though, rule you country how you want.
   If you want to know the illegal classifications, talk to United Nihilist Nations.
  
   The Vice Nihilist Delegate is democratically elected each month ( Next: April 1)
   Associate Nihilists are selected by the founder, United Nihilist Nations, and the Delegate. As the Delegate is currently vacant, the founder has appointed one.
