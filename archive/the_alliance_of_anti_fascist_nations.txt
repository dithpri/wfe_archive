A Protektorate of [region]KAISERREICH[/region].


By becoming so rabidly and un-intelligently Antifa, many regions jump at the sight of the word fascist.

Jumping to conclusions made by others, malicious labels get bandied about like a shuttlecock. 

ANTIFA itself is to blame, and let this region fill with degeneracy, and then cut it loose. 

Kaiserreich is here to provide intellectual clarity. Heil Kaiser! Heil [region]Kaiserreich[/region]!
