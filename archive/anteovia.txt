Anteovia is a region that has a history of sharing its space with multiple nations in an attempt to provide security and equality. Unfortunately, the nations inevitably always resorted to war and violence in order to assert dominance in the region. The founding nation, Anteopia, required the nations to halt all aggressive actions or face eviction. When the surrounding nations disregarded the instructions, Anteopia disbanded the regional borders and became a secluded nation with no fathering region.
