[b]In honour of their feathered friends, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] opted out of a Thanksgiving turkey. Instead, the Hawks flew around and collected some ingredients for their Thanksgiving feast.  Every Hawk (and Zizou) found the stuff needed for their favourite food. If you want to celebrate with the Hawks, come check out our [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/index.php]nest[/url].
