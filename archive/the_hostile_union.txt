We&#146;re recruiting, feel welcome to join us.

I, the president of Williwallistan, and my colleague of Willeria are trying to remain active and engaged with this region as we hope that someday, this region can grow a bit bigger and be more fun for its residents, as bigger regions seem to lack a fun part.
Feel free to message either the Williwallistan nation or Willeria if you ever have original ideas for the region.
