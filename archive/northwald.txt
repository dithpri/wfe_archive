[i]A group of club members were seated around the Circle, seemingly preparing the protocol as per usual. A dishevelled, wounded Avalon &#39;Dissenter&#39; Feldstadt took the center seat, slumped and her gaze fixed on her own desk. Her closest colleagues, Windy and Jimmy, don&#39;t seem to notice it. Not even the other members of the club.

No one in the Circle knew her circumstances, not even questioning her conditions. The Gardening Club was her safe haven. Duties were thrust upon her when she took her first steps.[/i]
