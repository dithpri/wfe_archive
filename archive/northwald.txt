[i]Guidelines[/i]

[b]What do we do here?[/b]
We exist! ...but we do not conduct raids.

[b]How do I get in?[/b]
Currently, only the puppets are allowed in. May there be one time I will open the borders.

[b]Can I set up an embassy here?[/b]
Do as you wish for the moment.

[b]Help, I think I am lost in this region![/b]
What? How did you get in here?! WHO ARE YOU?

Who controls these puppets anyway? They do not use their largest nation for their main nation.
