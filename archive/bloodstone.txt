In the beginning, there was darkness. An empty void of infinite nothingness. Then, the void did split, and reality was created from nothingness. Matter and energy in swirling patterns combined to form galaxies, and stars, and worlds.

On one world life grew from the chaos, and founded the races which will one day rule all. We are many races, many species, we will rise above all others and claim our rightful place as the ruler of all.
