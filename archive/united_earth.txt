--==Description==--
Since man first came to sentience, we have striven for one thing. The World. Now, in the Year 2230 we have achieved that goal. United under the World Government, the Senate of the Consociatio Mundi Nationum has turned to the stars to expand into our near neighbors. The Constitution, though undefined, is already revealing it will be very decenterallized. The question now is, will we suffer another Nuclear War?
