Welcome to the SAMOHI Union!

Election time is coming up soon, so be sure to vote. The candidates for delegate are Zachary Arnold, Adam Byrnes, Adam Chamas, Alexander Del Greco, and Cooper Johnston, following the disqualification of David Banfi for spamming and refusing to take the debate seriously. All of the listed officers are temporary, and new officers will be picked by the WA delegate. All of the information will be listed on our region&#39;s website.
