Welcome to the SAMOHI Union!

Election time is now, so be sure to vote. The candidates for delegate are Zachary Arnold and Adam Byrnes, following the disqualification of David Banfi for failing to attend the debate, the elimination of Adam Chamas and Alexander Del Greco in the general election, and the traitorous departure of Cooper Johnston. All of the listed officers are temporary, and new officers will be picked by the WA delegate. All of the information will be listed the election website.
