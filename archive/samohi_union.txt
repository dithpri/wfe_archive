Welcome to the SAMOHI Union!

Election time is coming up soon, so be sure to vote. Anyone who wants to run for WA delegate can run, and you can choose to have a vice delegate on your ticket. All of the listed officers are temporary, and new officers will be picked by the WA delegate. All of the information will be listed on our region&#39;s website.
