[u][b]This region is an ongoing experiment conducted by [/b][nation]Fiery Hell Hole[/nation][b] to learn about how answering issues in certain ways affects the stats of the given nation.[b][/u]



- Every nation here (except the governor) each has a specific way their issues are answered, such as always choosing the first option, alternating between the first and last options, picking answers randomly etc., with the goal to learn about how these different strategies affect the resulting stats of nations, and to observe the fluctuation amongst nations using the same methods.

- ALL EMBASSY REQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL BE ACCEPTED[/b]
