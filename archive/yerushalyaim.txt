This costal region is home to two sister countries, Tovarim and Victova. The matriarchal tribe of Victova was discovered in the costal forests early in Tovariam history, and automatically granted independence to grow as it&#39;s own unique country. The small capitalist, ultra religious Adamwillians also chose to defect, venturing off to find their own country within the region.
