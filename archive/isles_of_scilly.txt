The [b]Isles of Scilly[/b] are an archipelago off the southwestern tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain.

The population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203. Scilly forms part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the Council of the Isles of Scilly.

Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with farming and agriculture. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
