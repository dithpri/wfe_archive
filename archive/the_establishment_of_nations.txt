One place where the world&#39;s nations can
gather together, discuss common problems
and find shared solutions.

 

The Establishment of Nations is an international organization founded in 1945. Currently made up of many Member States, the EN and its work are guided by the purposes and principles contained in its founding Charter.

The EN has evolved over the years to keep pace with a rapidly changing world.

But one thing has stayed the same: it remains the one place where all the world&#146;s nations can gather together, discuss common problems, and find shared solutions that benefit all of humanity.
