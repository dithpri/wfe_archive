[b][color=purple]Boria[/color][/b] is an open-world worldbuilding focusing on the Modern Tech setting and roleplaying quite heavily. The open-world setup of Boria allows members of the region to interact with the wider NSverse, a quality that closed-world regions are lacking. Boria is a region located in the far away parts of the NS multiverse. We are a young roleplaying region eagerly looking for new members to join us. Welcome, To Boria!
