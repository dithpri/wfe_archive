As the Ring of Nations was left in shambles after the fall of its founder, the two nations that remained vowed to create a region infinitely superior to its successor. Thus was formed the region of Pussytown, named for the valiant and courageous nature of its founders. Bravery burns brightly in their hearts, and they call upon only the most gallant of Pussies to join them.
