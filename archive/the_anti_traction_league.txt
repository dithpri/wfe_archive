The Anti-Traction League, founded by a Buddhist monk called Lama Batmunkh during the Black Centuries, is an organisation opposed to the prevalence of the Traktionst&auml;dte and the ideology of Municipal Darwinism. The League is the dominant power in East Asia (though it also has territories on every continent and on the Moon), and consists of numerous, politically diverse static nations and city-states. Its seat is at Tienjing, the capital of Da Shan Guo.

The League welcomes any nation willing to abide by anti-tractionist principles and join in the global struggle against Municipial Darwinism.
