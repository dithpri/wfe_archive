The Fujimiya Union is a regional alliance of historically rivalling nations following centuries of civil wars and inter-state conflicts. Initially forged as a economic and political coalition, the union emerged out of necessity following the &quot;cold&#148; invasion which began in the early 20th century and ended with the exposure of foreign elements in the late 22nd century. The post-invasion era ushered in unprecedented cooperation and technological innovation.
