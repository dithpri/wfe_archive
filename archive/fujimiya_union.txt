The Fujimiya Union is a regional alliance of historically fractious nations that banded together following centuries of civil wars and inter-state conflicts that devastated the globe. Initially forged as a fragile economic and political coalition, the Union emerged out of necessity following the &quot;cold invasion&quot;, which began in the early 20th century and ended with the exposure of foreign elements in the late 22nd century. The post-invasion era ushered in unprecedented cooperation and technological innovation.
