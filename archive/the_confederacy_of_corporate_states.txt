The Confederacy of Corporate States is an alliance of conservative, capitalist nations dedicated to the promotion and advancement of Right-Wing thought throughout the world. Although we promote a powerful Free-Market, social and political freedoms guaranteed in a democracy are too detrimental to the national well-being. As such, Member States are required to be classified as a right-wing authoritarian nation. We condemn any type of socialist, liberal, communist, or any left-wing thinking, and are determined to vanquish their ideologies.[/color] (continued on RMB)[hr]
