The Confederacy of Corporate States is an alliance of conservative, capitalist nations dedicated to the promotion and advancement of Right-Wing thought throughout the world.  Although we promote a powerful Free-Market, social and political freedoms guaranteed in a democracy are too detrimental to the national well-being.  As such, Member States are required to be classified as a right-wing authoritarian nation.  We condemn any type of socialist, liberal, communist, or any left-wing thinking, and are determined to vanquish their ideologies.  Our goal is to establish, one day, a global Corporatist Regime that will demonstrate the sheer might of the Right.
