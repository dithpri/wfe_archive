Attention! All rise! This meeting of G.R.O.S.S. is now called to order by the great grandiose Dictator-for-Life, the Ruler Supreme, the Fearless, the Brave, the Held-High-In-esteem, [nation=short]Wattersonia[/nation] the bold! Yes, stand up and hail his humbleness now! May his wisdom prevail!

Three cheers for First Tiger and El Presidente, [nation=short]Numbers Puppet[/nation], the Delight of All Cognoscenti! He&amp;#39;s savvy, he has a prodigious IQ, and lots of panache, as all tigers do! In his fancy chapeau, he&amp;#39;s a leader with taste! May his orders be heeded and his views be embraced!

Really though, this region is just for fans of Calvin and Hobbes.

It&amp;#39;s also now the proud home of Wolfopian Puppets. TG [nation]New Wolfopolis[/nation] if you want in.
