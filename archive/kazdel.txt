[region]Kazdel[/region] is a Terran country once situated in the region that now encompasses the modern-day Bleached Wasteland. Today, it exists as a small city-state on the borders of [nation]Siracusa[/nation], [nation]Ursus Empire[/nation], and [nation]Yan[/nation]. A monarchy at its core, Kazdel is the sole homeland of the Sarkaz, a scattered diasporic race that faces widespread demonization across the world.
The nation is considered the &quot;Promised Land&quot; of the Sarkaz, ruled by the &quot;King of Sarkaz,&quot; a messianic figure believed to have the power to ease the suffering of the &quot;myriad souls&quot; &#151; a collective consciousness of deceased Sarkaz.
