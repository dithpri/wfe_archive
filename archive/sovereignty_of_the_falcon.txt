We, the government of the Allied States of Outer Zwaterskenrhas, believe that every NationState should strive to maintain their own independence.  Therefore, we declare ourselves a sovereign state, and though we are a peaceful people by nature, we will not tolerate any perceived act of aggression.

That being said, we do look forward to amicable relations with those who are willing to recognize the sovereignty of Outer Zwaterskenrhas; the Sovereignty of the Falcon.
