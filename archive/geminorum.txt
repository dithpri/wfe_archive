Though not connected directly with the Star of the same name, the settlers could find no better name for the beautiful jewel that would become their home planet.

Glistening with 78% water, from orbit it looks like a planet sized Archapelego.  It&#39;s chained islands range sizes small and vast.

Jungles teaming with noise, Forests deep and ancient, Deserts of sand n stone, Tundra with life among the frigid expanses, and grassy plains of plenty exist on the planet naturally, and two Icy &quot;polar peak regions&quot;


Though the location of this planet is not held secret, it still remains unseen how many settelers may actually venture from Earth to make a new home.  However it&#39;s first groups have well and truly arrived.  Good luck Geminorum.
