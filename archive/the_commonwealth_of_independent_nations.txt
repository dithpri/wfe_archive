The Commonwealth of Independent Nations is a region established by the eternal wisdom of the Kingdom of Ternaboden for the purpose of preserving the power of independent nations against an increasingly powerful global order. It promotes the sovereignty of each member against the fiat of the World Assembly. To this end the Commonwealth will never seek to become a federal union. The mutual goals of each member will seek to maintain an order within the Commonwealth, for the protection of all.

Ordinis, felicitatem in gratia Dei.
