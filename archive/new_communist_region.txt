[color=red] [b]Welcome to The [region]New Communist Region[/region]

This grand region once served as our home, where we grew.

Where we became what we are today.

Where we became brothers and friends.

Where we became comrades.

To this end, we have decided to make our old home a Museum, to stand the test of time, to show our existence.
