This area of the continent had gone undiscovered for many years, until a ship headed to a different nation accidentally landed on the peninsula. They contacted their ruler and the Union colonized the peninsula. Many years later, the colony rebelled against the Union and won their independence. The peninsula is named after Orion the constellation as the view of that constellation and the galaxy is stunning.
