WHO ARE THE [color=#D28C35] CORPHOSIANS? [/color] [/b]
Corphosians are an exclusive group of people erected by the grace of Corphos himself, perfect by definition, a race of gods among men. Those who were not directly created were handchosen by the true god [color=#D28C35][b]CORPHOS[/b][/color].
[hr][b]HOW CAN I BECOME A [/b][color=#D28C35][b]CORPHOSIAN[/b][/color]?
The process to find a true Corphosian is rigorous by nature, and filters out the unworthy. You may submit yourself to Corphos&#39;s will by joining this [i][url=https://discord.gg/ExTCbhgYRJ][color=#D28C35][b]Holding Discord[/b][/color][/i][/url]. May Corphos favour you.
