[b]Welcome to Corphosia, a Roleplay-Centric Continent founded for the Corphosians[/b]. 
[hr]
Corphosians are an exclusive group of people erected by the grace of Corphos himself, perfect by definition, a race of gods among men. For every 1000 men brought to the walls of Corphosia, seeking it&#39;s sublime guidance, 999 are turned away. It is that 1, that 1 who has truly shown himself worthy of bearing the name of Corphos, enters where simple men shall never. Corphosia, in all of it&#39;s sublime glory, closes it&#39;s doors to the unworthy.
Wish to become a Corphosian? Join this  [i][url=https://discord.gg/ExTCbhgYRJ] [b]DISCORD[/b][/url][/i]. It is not Corphosia, nor is it particularly close. It is a distant immigration checkpoint. Glory may await you, lost Corphosian.
