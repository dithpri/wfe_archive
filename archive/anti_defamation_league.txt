This region is named in honor of the [b][url=http://www.adl.org/]Anti-Defamation League[/url][/b], a real-world organization dedicated to [b]&amp;quot;stopping the defamation of the Jewish people and securing justice and fair treatment to all peoples.&amp;quot;[/b]

It was originally founded in Oct. 2012 by the Greater German Reich in an effort to humiliate the Jewish people and insult all those who revere the above creed, but the forces of hate failed again, as they always do, as they always will, every time.

It was liberated and refounded in Jan. 2013 by a coalition of the [b][region]Jewish Justice League[/region][/b], [region]the Union of Nations Against Fascism[/region] and the [region]CSSR[/region]. And this time, the NS ADL region will stand as a monument to the great work of the real-world organization of the same name.
