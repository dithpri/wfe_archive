[i]Firstly, [u]thank you[/u] for electing me as your delegate. I will try my best to make everyone happy here, and [b]deliver my manifesto promises.[/b][/i]

Now that&amp;#39;s out of the way, I would like to put forward the idea of drafting a constitution. So, I ask you, people of the Alfsphere, in our first step towards a constitution, [b]what do you think are the uncodified (unwritten) rules that have evolved from our political system?[/b] [i]Eg. 30 day terms, no delegate in for more than two terms, ect...[/i]

Moreover, I would hope to establish positions such as a [b]Foreign Secretary[/b], who would [i][u]maintain and control[/u] the recruitment thread, act as an [u]ambassador[/u] to other regions and to suggest suitable regions to offer [u]diplomatic ties[/u] in the form of an embassy.[/i] [b]Any takers?[/b]
