Guys, things in the region are looking [i]dire[/i]. We are a [b]proud, nomadic people[/b] - I think it is therefore time to move on to greener pastures. I will spend a few more days in [region]The Alfsphere[/region], whilst I scope out the best region to move to. If you decide to stay, good luck comrades. [b][u]It has been fun.[/b][/u]
