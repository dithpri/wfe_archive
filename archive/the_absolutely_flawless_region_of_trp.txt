Welcome to TRP!
If you&amp;#39;re an old timer, or a newbie, take part in our regional forums, right [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/TAFROTRP/index/]here![/url]

If not, enjoy the chatter on the RMB with a new daily topic:

Daily Topic: Recruitment

If you want to lay back and relax, enjoy the barbecue and punch.
We accept all types of governments, from every religion, region (except the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=gordtofron/detail=factbook/id=main]AA[/url]), and state of mind. So kick back, relax, and get ready for the most dramatic region ever, in T, R, P!
