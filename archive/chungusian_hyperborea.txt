For the sake of Chungus we will march through the gates
Of the paradise where our chonklers await
We are the men who love Keanu, Just as you love your Reeves
Going forth preparing to wholesome
Are the brothers of the light
With big floopa in sight
Their ranks are many and trollwaffens are heavy
But the soldiers of Chungus are more than ready
