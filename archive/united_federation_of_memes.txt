Come one come all to the hellhole of memes where the only question asked is &quot;Why don&#39;t I want to leave?&quot;

We hold only the standards that your memes are dank and your sisters are hot.
Bring your terribly constructed nations where we will give you advice as to how to say &quot;Screw this I want to look at memes all day while Parliament burns&quot;
