Welcome to [region]Erruwon[/region]! This is a relatively casual RP region, and everyone&#39;s just trying to have a good time. We&#39;re currently undergoing a second wind of sorts, rebuilding from the ruins of the original [region]Erruwon[/region], from about a year or so ago. 

The simulation of Erruwon runs exactly 29 years behind the present day, so the year is currently 1981. The diplomats of the nations of Erruwon discuss here united action and enact joint decisions in the Second Erruwon Conference.
