The Alliance has been reforged from the fire of the recent DEN coup d&amp;#39;&eacute;tat, and it is stronger than ever. The Efficientian Laurel waves proudly above our lands, and [nation]Efficientiam[/nation] has been awarded the Alliance&amp;#39;s highest honors. We shall stand strong for as long as our flags endure, and uphold the glory of the Alliance. We shall not sleep until DEN is brought before the Security Council. 

May Our Flags Long Endure.

The Alliance is a just and valorous region of Democracy and Justice. Any nation that meets the joining requirements may join. In the event of a coup, nations are to endorse Efficientiam if possible. Failure to do so will result in demotion.
