We are a [color=red]targeted region[/color], but all attempts to conquer us have been overcome by dauntless bravery from our states. We work together to succeed scientifically and environmentally while improving our not so developed economy. 

[b]We are rallying our people[/b] to head into the future. Would you rather push the boundaries or be stuck in a time when greater change is happening, change that will be discussed centuries from now? [/i]
