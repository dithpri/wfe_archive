The Free State Alliance (FSA) is a union of states that regard their people&amp;#39;s freedoms as central. The states will be free to endorse whichever nation they choose, or no nation at all. Votes may be called for by anyone, as long as the call to voting is on the Regional Message Board. When a vote is called, nations have one day to telegram their vote to The Chair State. The Chair State and the WA Delagate have veto power over votes regarding diplomacy and raids. Please read the Chair State&amp;#39;s and WA Delegate&amp;#39;s posts.  Join the Alliance today!
