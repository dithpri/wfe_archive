The United Socialist Cascadian Territories is an uneasily united region of progressive and revolutionary governments. Though of widely varying ideological stances, each state in the union of territories stands for the development of a socialist economy and the overthrow of Capitalism.

The Territories include a long mountain range to the East, a fertile temperate coastline, and to the West a chain of tropical islands.
