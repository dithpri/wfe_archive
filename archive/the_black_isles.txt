[b]The Black Isles[/b] is an archipelago of temperate, politically diverse islands that vaguely resembles Europe, if Europe were run by idiots. 

While the nations have existed since &quot;time immerorial&quot; - that is to say, further back than the heavily censored Slavskyan school textbooks acknowledge - the region has only existed as a political entity since the controversial Treaty of Kirkcudbright in 2016. The nations are bound in a loose confederation that promises international co-operation and harmony but which, so far, has only resulted in several diplomatic summits and a minor, but fun, war.
