[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to go mountain climbing! While the trigger layed out the ropes, and the older hawkies shouted out good footholds, the young hawks were able to reach the [i]points![/i] After taking pretty pictures for Hawkstagram, the hawks flew down, slightly confused why they hadn&#146;t just flown to the top in the first place.
