Resting on the razor edged border of barbarism and civilization, the Mid-Rim territories contain a plethora of planets and systems which vary in culture, lawlessness, and prosperity. Many that choose to come out here from the Core Worlds see it as the last taste of civilized life before reaching the wild frontier worlds of the Outer Rim, while many heading inward towards the more prosperous planets see it as the last piece of frontier land before reaching the decadence and sanitation offered by the better off planets within the inner sections of the Galaxy.
