[b] The League of Totalitarian Nations is a region that wishes to unite those who keep authority within the hands of a non-democratically elected government. Given the ineffectiveness of a democracy when the citizen is entrusted with the power of voting, wasting resources of civil rights and political freedoms at the cost of reputation and state integrity, the League of Totalitarian Nations puts the trust in authoritarian governments to place national pride as a number one priority. 

We support Conservatism, Fascism, Authoritarianism, Imperialism, Capitalism, Totalitarianism, and Nationalism

We oppose Democracy, Socialism (Although not National Socialism),Communism, and Liberalism[/b]
