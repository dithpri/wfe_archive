Welcome to [region]The Order of Aqua[/region]!

[color=#00FFFF]Formerly known as the &quot;[url=https://konosuba.fandom.com/wiki/Axis_Order]Axis Order[/url]&quot; The Order of Aqua used to be a religious cult but today it has evolved to become a coalition of Nations who view [url=https://konosuba.fandom.com/wiki/Aqua]Aqua-sama[/url] as either their Goddess, National Figure or their Nations Head of State. However every Nation is welcome as long as its people are willing to spread the Faith of Aqua around the world!

Aqualcanretia formerly known as &quot;[url=https://konosuba.fandom.com/wiki/Alcanretia]Alcanretia[/url]&quot; used to be a city widely known for its beautiful hot springs which were later converted to a source of Holy Water by the Goddess Aqua herself. Today it has grown to be a prosperous Nation with strong ambition to spread the Faith of Aqua around the world and that is how The Order of Aqua has become an international body.
