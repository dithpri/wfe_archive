Colorado (/&amp;#716;k&amp;#594;l&amp;#601;&amp;#712;r&aelig;do&amp;#650;, -&amp;#712;r&amp;#593;&amp;#720;do&amp;#650;/) is an autonomous land in Western North America. It encompasses most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers, and desert lands. Denver is the capital and most populous city in Colorado. Residents are known as Coloradans, although the antiquated &quot;Coloradoan&quot; is occasionally used. Major parts of Colorado&#39;s economy include government and defense, mining, agriculture, tourism, and increasingly other kinds of manufacturing.
