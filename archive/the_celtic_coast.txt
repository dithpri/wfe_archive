[color=#ED4719]This region was previously owned by [nation]Improper Classifications[/nation], who departed the site after being caught doxxing. However, this region did not immediately CTE due to being occupied by a random puppet. This puppet eventually left, and thus the final IMPC region targeted by the state was captured on 3/16/2025.[/color]
