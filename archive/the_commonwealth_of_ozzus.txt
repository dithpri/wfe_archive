The commonwealth of Ozzus is a small region, which was founded by the leaders of Judfordicus in March of 2014 to consolidate their former territories. It has since grown, and all nations are now free to enter the largely democratic region. The region has a frightening military which it is not afraid to use, and all nations who join will have a say in the goings on of Ozzus.
