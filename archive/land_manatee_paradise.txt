People from all over the world can come visit this large, 180,000,000km round island with everything from Tropical jungles to high mountains. The island rests upon a large piece of granite buried under the Earth by aliens some 3 billion years ago. Land manatees and grizzly bears frolic in this wonderful paradise.
