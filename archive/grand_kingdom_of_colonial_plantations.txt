The Grand Kingdom of Colonial Nations is a superpower region located in North America. It was created in 2047 following a bloody war which the ASSEMBLY of NATIONS decided to create two unique super-regions instead of the one (Sjurdland). 

Isabelle Plantations is the creator and maintains sole Executive Authority of the region. A number of other nations, through elections, hold high seats in the assembly. 

Self-ruling autonomous colonies and plantations exist and are part of their own unique regions and assemblies. Colonies and Plantations that are autonomous do send Autonomous Ruling Representatives to the assembly. Though they do not have voting power, they largely act as Delegates and exert influence over trade and foreign policy.
