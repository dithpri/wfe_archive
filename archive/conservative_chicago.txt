[b]Conservative Chicago[/b] is a region version of WATCH_DOGS&#39; rendition of Chicago, established and run on NationStates. It is a religious and political region that mostly consists of a Christian majority. [i]It is both socially and economically right-wing[/i].

Chicago is the largest city in Illinois and the third largest in the United States. It is the main setting of WATCH_DOGS, and is home to the Central Operating System (CTOS) which began citywide use in 2011. It is the county seat of Cook County, Illinois, and is located on the shores of Lake Michigan in the northeastern part of the state.

We permit and allow nearly all religions here. However, we do not permit people who have leftist beliefs, which makes us the polar opposite of most other regions.
