Today, the Most Serene Republic of the Glorious Commonwealth of Ethiopia (GCoE) found a new planet while trying to one-up Slam Dunkz for some reason, so now we have settled on the 3rd planet from the star Meridian, being that it was in the middle of the bloody interstellar cluster we recently found. Unfortunately, GCoE forgot that the people on the colony ships absolutely hated each other, and now are trying to gain all of the recourse&amp;#39;s on Meridian 3...

Not to mention that it&amp;#39;s a nice looking planet...

Time to murd.. I mean carve a existence on this aren.. I mean planet.
