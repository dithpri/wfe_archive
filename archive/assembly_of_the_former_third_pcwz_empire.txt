[color=gold]The Third PCWZ Empire was founded by [nation]Comackia[/nation] with [nation]Elchsohnia[/nation] declared as the heir. With that, the PCWZ left the age of authoritarian regimes and moved towards diplomatic cooperation between all regions from fascists to communists and anything inbetween. It largely found success in its reputation within SCUT and the RTA, serving as the diplomatic leader of the latter.[/color]
