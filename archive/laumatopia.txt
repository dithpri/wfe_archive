Laumatopia is a very friendly region. It respects all kind of Lauma supporters and preaches the Laumakrieger:
Leima is the Queen of Laumatopia.
Main country in this region is Laumanien, however all countries are the Queendom of Laumas. 


Every country needs to have a Lauma as a leader. (If you join, you will automatically receive a Lauma. Lauma will be summoned by Laumanien automatically).


Laumas are very helpful, friendly fairies and you can have great conversations with them. They care a lot about their culture and are willing to sacrifice their lives for their values.
