Laumatopia is a very friendly region. It respects all kind of Lauma supporters and preaches the Laumakrieger:
Leima is the Queen of Laumatopia.
Main country in this region is Laumanien, however all countries are the Queendom of Laumas. 


Every country needs to have a Lauma as a leader. (If you join, you will automatically receive a Lauma. Lauma will be summoned by Laumanien automatically).


Laumas are very helpful, friendly fairies and you can have great conversations with them. They care a lot about their culture and are willing to sacrifice their lives for their values. 
Lauma warriors aka the Laumakrieger are trained in Laumatopia to prepare for war. 

Any kind of disrespect towards the Lauma people is solved with violence. !!
