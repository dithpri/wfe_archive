We&#39;re Knights of the Round Table,
We dance when ere we&#39;re able,
We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impeccable.
We dine well here in Camelot,
We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.
We&#39;re Knights of the Round Table,
Our shows are formidable, But many times, we&#39;re given rhymes
That are quite unsingable.
We&#39;re Opera mad in Camelot,
We sing from the diaphragma looooooot.
In war we&#39;re tough and able,
Quite indefatigable,
Between our quests we sequin vests,
And impersonate Clark Gable.
It&#39;s a busy life in Camelot,
I have to push the pram a lot.
