Welcome, everyone!
Daryagrad Oblast was founded on January 25, 2021.
This is the most beautiful region in all of Russia &amp; the world. Half of the land is covered with forests or water. The remarkably diverse wildlife, with its high tolerance to the often chilly climate, is thriving here like nowhere else.
Daryagrad in Olde Siberia is the region&#146;s capital city. There are many quaint, cozy, &amp; peaceful little towns scattered throughout the region to make anyone feel at home. Enjoy your stay!
We support all religion &amp; respectful free speech here.
When there is good activity &amp; there are enough nations, we will have fun &amp; make this region really great.
