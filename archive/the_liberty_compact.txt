The Liberty Compact (TLC) is an organization of International Republican Union and Federation of Free States (IRU/FFS) successor regions, as well as other regions sharing the ideals of conservatism and libertarianism, or who are promoters of liberty. We ensure our common security and well-being, work to defend against tyrannical Communist and radical invaders, and to further the cause of freedom and self-government in NationStates.
