[b][color=blue]This Former Union truly embodied the spirit of egalitarianism. All those who defend the Global Proleteriat were heroes, and were invited here. However, be warned: we do not support the mass genocide committed by Stalin, nor do we support the ruthless Imperialism of the Capitalists. The only war we fight is the class war! We are built on the ideals of visionaries like Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Fidel Castro. Long live the Revolution! Long live the Proleteriat! Long live Communism![/color]

[color=red]Note: This Region has been taken over by [region]Shrayan Bose[/region], an ally of the Roman Empire. We control This Union now, but we still endorse its message. All hail Emperor Shrayan! All hail Queen Harriet Grewsater, ruler of this region![/color][/b]
