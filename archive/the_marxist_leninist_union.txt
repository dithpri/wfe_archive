[b][color=red]This Union truly embodies the spirit of egalitarianism. All those who defend the Global Proleteriat are heroes and are welcome here. However, be warned: the mass genocide committed by Stalin or the ruthless Imperialism of the Capitalists are not appreciated in this region. The only war we fight is the class war! The Union is built on the ideals of visionaries like Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Fidel Castro, amongst others. We will stop at nothing to save the toiling working class. 

Long live the Proleteriat! Long live the Revolution! Long live Communism![/color][/b]
