Comrades,  we are the true perfect Union you seek. We are true advocates for our global Proleteriat. Capitalism is a system for the profit of a few corrupt individuals. We would like to aid in the struggle for a more egalitarian world. There is no justice when so many have so little. There is no justice when so few have so much. We are built on the principles of Marx and Lenin, but we do not support mass genocide and oppression executed under Stalin&#146;s regime. We are committed to the fight against imperialism and inequality. All those who feel marginalized are welcome here. Long live the Revolution, Comrades!
