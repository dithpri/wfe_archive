[b][color=#CB2727]This Union truly embodies the spirit of egalitarianism. All those who defend the Global Proleteriat are heroes, and are invited here. However, be warned: we do not support the mass genocide committed by Stalin, nor do we support the ruthless Imperialism of the Capitalists. The only war we fight is the class war! We are built on the ideals of visionaries like Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Fidel Castro. Long live the Revolution! Long live the Proleteriat! Long live Communism![/color][/b]

[b]A message for [nation]Plagentine[/nation], Emperor of [region]The Roman Empire[/region]:[/b] You have repeatedly failed to invade this peaceful Union. This was the last straw. We now formally declare war on you Pigs and your warped values.
