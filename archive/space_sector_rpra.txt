HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY TO THE REGION!

The Sector sits in the middle of a unique time-space flux, creating an unusual cross-dimensional crossroads. People, technology, and cultures from dozens of independent realities have come together here, primarily under the flag of the Reploid Productions Revolutionary Army. Mostly, they just hang around. Sometimes people park puppet armies here too.
