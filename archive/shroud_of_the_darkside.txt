[b][u]Welcome to STAR WARS: Shroud of the Darkside![/b][/u]
This is a [i][u]Character RP[/u][/i] region set during the waning months of the Republic, however, this timeline may not continue as it did in canon.
Make sure to read the factbooks on the WFE!
I need some major help with this, so if you would please TG me if you want an officer position, but make sure to provide something along the lines of a resume, or something to give me a reason to accept you. If you do not, you will be ignored.
Also going to need [i]responsible[/i] people to play as NPCs/Important story characters, e.g. Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex.

[u]Timescale[/u]
Current Year: 20 BBY, 1st GD
1 OOC Day = 1 IC GD
GD = Galactic Day (equivalent of a month. 12 GDs every Galactic Year [GY])
