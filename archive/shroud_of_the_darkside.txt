[b][u]Welcome to STAR WARS: Shroud of the Darkside![/b][/u]
This is a [i][u]Character RP[/u][/i] region set during the waning months of the Republic, however, this timeline may not continue as it did in canon.
Make sure to read the factbooks on the WFE! Also, remember that this is a [b]side project[/b] which means this won&#39;t be my life&#39;s work. Patience.
I need some major help with this, so if you would please TG me if you want an officer position, but make sure to provide something along the lines of a resume, or something to give me a reason to accept you. If you do not, you will be ignored.
Also going to need [i]responsible[/i] people to play as NPCs/Important story characters.
[u]Timescale[/u]
Current Year: 20 BBY, 1st GD
1 OOC Day = 1 IC Galactic Day (month)
