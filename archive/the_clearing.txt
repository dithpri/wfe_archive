Hello and welcome to The Clearing. I don&#39;t expect anyone to stumble across this secluded place, but why not write something here, just in case it is found? 

This thing you are reading as you might have noticed, is a World Factbook Entry (WFE). Some factbooks I have seen have been very detailed descriptions of nations and events, but when it comes to WFE style factbooks, the way of writing a good factbook gets altered. Other regions opt for a list of things telling you about the region and why you should join. Yorlargand wouldn&#39;t have separated itself from the rest of NS if it didn&#39;t do things different however, so here goes the Yorlargandish version of a WFE.
