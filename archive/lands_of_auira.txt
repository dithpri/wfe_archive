The lands of Auira are a vast region of mountainous terrains with large areas of isolated biomes in between the mountains. Home to a wide variety of flora and animals, this region has little development of actual civilization. However with the discovery of large stockpiles of various resources in the area and no one besides the Imperium to contest them, the lands remain open for others to enter.
