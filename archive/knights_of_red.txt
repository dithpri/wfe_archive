[color=green][b]Welcome to [region]Knights of Red[/region], sub-region of [region]Red Guardians[/region]![/b][/color]

[color=purple][b]We are a small, thriving region. If you wish to join this region, please contact [nation]Forsaken Palace[/nation], as he controls the passwords for all three Red Defense regions. Due to security concerns, World Assembly nations are not permitted to join at this time.[/b][/color]

[b]Did we mention that we are a sub-region? That means that we aren&#39;t an independent region, so we are HEAVILY RELIANT on our other two regional system members. We are the second largest in the system, behind the main region, mentioned above.[/b]
