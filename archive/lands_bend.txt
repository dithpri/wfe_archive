[b]Welcome to the Wondrous Ranks of Lands Bend![/b]

All are welcome to the wondrous ranks of Lands Bend. We at the council would like to see our flag flying high above all realms of the world. We do not discriminate against any, and would like to welcome the entire community of the world to our great cause.

We wish for our community to grow, and to do that, we request support from foreigners. Please, feel free to request embassies with us. It would be much appreciated. Also, feel free to move into Lands Bend, and we will welcome you here gladfully. We will have polls regularly, so please feel free to participate. Also, positions of power will be given to people who come first.

Signed, the Jakain State of Jake Nation, Founder
