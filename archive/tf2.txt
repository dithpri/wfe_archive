Welcome to the Sentry Nest, my epic gamers! A decade and a half later, TF2 is still the best region. Join to be a class representative!

[spoiler=Available Classes]Soldier, Heavy, Engineer, Pyro, Medic, Scout[/spoiler]

[spoiler=Featured Class]The Soldier is a crazed, jingoistic patriot from Midwest, USA. Tough and well-armed, he is versatile, capable of both offense and defense, and a great starter class to get familiar with the game.
Well-balanced and possessing both survivability and mobility, the Soldier is considered one of the most flexible classes in Team Fortress 2. Despite his low ground movement speed, he is capable of using rocket jumps to reach his destination quickly.
The Soldier was voiced by Rick May.[/spoiler]
