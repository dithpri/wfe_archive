[i]A long time off in a galaxy far, far away...[/i]

[b]Coeli Candentis[/b]

[i]It is a period of... well of what ever the citizens who inhabit the galaxy decide it to be a period of! Most of the planets and systems remain untouched and unknown to sentient beings. Empires, Republics, Fascists, Communists, Pirates and more are all attempting to control as much of the galaxy as possible; spreading their faith, culture and ways of thought to more distant corners in a hope to gain dominance and possibly... Find other galaxies to conquer! So it is up to you, will you be a kind and caring nation who attempts spread peace and equality? Or will you run your world(s) with iron fists breaking up any attempt of free thinking? The decision is yours![/i]
