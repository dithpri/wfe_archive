The World of Virimundus-

A world that is in many ways similar to our own, at least in the sense that it is a &#147;modern&#148; sort of place and all the amenities and technology therein. But there&#146;s one other facet of it- sword and sorcery.

In this modern world you got Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and all other fantasy beings. This region facilitates worldbuilding, storytelling, and all that fun stuff.
