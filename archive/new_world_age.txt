[b]A region dedicated to the creation of an age in which a new world will thrive! [/b]
We pride ourselves on our nontraditional role play via the creation of historical entries in a vast and comprehensive timeline. We also happily correspond with one another and enjoy the company and conversations we share.
Whether you&#39;re interested in playing along or simply interested in friendly interaction, the [region]New World Age[/region] welcomes all with open arms!
Please message our Founder or the Aetherian Isles for access and permissions. Thank you!
