Greetings, comrade, I am sure you have heard of RAGE, but let me fill you in on our history just in case.

RAGE was originally founded by billionaire Tycoon, Viktor Bale, as a joke for April fools. However, when the former dictator of the Incorporated States of Clarish, President Thomas Mason, assumed treason and planned an assassination on Bale, all war broke out. 

After a bloody battle in the capital city of Daya, Bale took power from Mason, claimed the country of Clarish, and promised to remain steadfast as a guide out of the darkness for all suffering nations. Until the day the world was unified, RAGE will fight.

Join us, comrade, and unify this broken world. Together, we will create a new future.
