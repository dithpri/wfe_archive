Hello~!!!

Welcome to our little... tribe?
Idk what to call it, but welcome to our community!

Password required, unfortunately, but that&#39;s only so we can make sure the most chaotic of coyotes get in the borders.

Using alts is recommended, but not necessary for having in our little den!

We accept embassy requests, but we will not accept requests from defender or raider regions.

Have fun here!
