Australiglacies Alpinipraegrandis is a region located in the areas between Australasia-Cygnia, Neupatagonia and the turbulent, windswept Northern-Sea. It contains stunning alpine mountain ranges to the South-East and harsh waters to the North, with the West containing arid terrain, lush forests and low-dipping mountain ranges.
Typically such geography would not co-exist in a single area alone, except Australiglacies Alpinipraegrandis is not a single nation or region, but rather a commune of regions which are united in a common goal and cause. This cause and goal is to have a prosperous, United and strong southern region which provides and adequate living-space for it&amp;#39;s population and to provide protection from Northern aggressors.
