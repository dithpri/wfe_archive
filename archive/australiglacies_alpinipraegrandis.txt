Australiglacies Alpinipraegrandis is a region located in the areas between Australasia, Patagonia and Oceania. It contains stunning alpine mountain ranges to the southeast and tropical waters to the north, with the west containing arid terrain, lush forests and low-dipping mountain ranges.
Typically such geography would not co-exist in a single area alone, except Australiglacies Alpinipraegrandis is not a single nation or region, but rather a confederacy of regions which are united in a common goal and cause. This cause and goal is to have a prosperous, United and strong southern region which can dictate the affairs of the aggressors of the northern nations and to provide an adequate living space for the people of the southern regions.
