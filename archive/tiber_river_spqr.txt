Rome is one of the world&amp;#39;s best civilizations. It has its links in western civilization. Rome was found on the banks of the Tiber River, making it able to trade with other nations. Rome has produced great rulers like Augustus(Octavian) and Julius Caesar. It has also produced bad leaders like Nero. Rome lives on and so at Boston Latin School, we pride ourself in learning Latin. Being the first public school in the US founded in 1635, we love Rome. JK Rowling was also a Latin teacher. SUMUS PRIMI!
