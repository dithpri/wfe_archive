An Assembly that welcomes Fascists, National-Socialists, Anarchists and Leftists of all kinds! We reject the common myth spread by the bourgeoisie Capitalists that Fascists and National-Socialists are Right-Wing in any way, and we accept the truth that we are all united in the International Revolution of the Collective Proletariat! Figures like Mussolini, Lenin, Marx, and so many more liberated in their teachings, and we must continue them! Break the chains!
