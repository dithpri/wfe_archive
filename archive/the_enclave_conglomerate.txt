A political conglomerate under the power of [nation]Allied Sovereignty[/nation], the Conglomerate was founded by The Dominion of Allied Sovereignty. Since then nations have sprouted to form new political factions, or made alliances to join the Conglomerate. As the sovereignty of each nation is valued high amongst officials of [nation]Allied Sovereignty[/nation] each member is free to govern themselves how they see fit. As a region we have a military defense pact (Pan-Enclave Protection Edict 2015), have the semi-bi-annual Pan-Enclave Conglomerate Games, and our leaders often get together to discuss international policy and hold wild parties. Party tonight at Sanwillistan&#39;s BYOB.
 Illuminabatur. Semper Erectus.
