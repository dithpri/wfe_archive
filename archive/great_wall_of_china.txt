The [b]Great Wall of China[/b] is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe. 
Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BCE; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty (1368&#150;1644).

Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the [region]Silk Road[/region]. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
