The United Ansalonian Nations is a group of free, capitalist nations dedicated to the part that Ansalon plays in world politics. It is a multispecies union containing many different races. While many left-wing nations may call our region militaristic, we prefer the term well defended and prepared. We are currently  looking for an new WA delegate, and while not actively for the WA, we are not against it.This region truly is a haven for nations interested in building a paradise free from outside interference.
