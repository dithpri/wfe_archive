The Yellow Steppes is a nickname for the ecoregion made up of rolling hills, bordered by Shortgrass and Mixed-grass prairies.

The politics of the region are diverse. The Western Prairies are mostly inhabited by small, capitalist republics, while the Eastern Hills are inhabited by Feudal-like Monarchies. In the South lies Lusnia, the most influential nation in the whole region. The Northern Mountains are  currently a mess of nations of all different classifications vying for local dominance.
