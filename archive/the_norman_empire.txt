[b]Hail Imperialism![/b]
[hr]
Our Socialist Empire subjugates the whole world&amp;#8232;
Like a gigantic bear from the East.&amp;#8232;
The sheep wander aimlessly, without any cause,&amp;#8232;
Yet the Socialist Shepherds are by their sides

Our Comradeship a good life, 
Our generosity without compare.&amp;#8232;
All those with us are strong,&amp;#8232;
All those against us, beware
It&#39;d be a shame if we had hardships.

To all those against us, you have a short time
Before we turn you to ashes
We thank you profoundly, and bow to you deeply,&amp;#8232;
From the mightiest Empire in all the world
