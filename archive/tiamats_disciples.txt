The Primordial Dragon calls to those who wish to spread Chaos upon the world, as is the way of the universe. 
Order is a primitive concept, when truly looking at it. 

We want to say we welcome all, but not all are ready or truly understand our ways. If you are invited here, consider it the highest of honors. Otherwise, you must prove yourself. 

We will conquer those who do not understand, and make them understand. We will spread Tiamat&#39;s primordial ways through the world, and the bells of chaos shall be heard by all. 

Hail Tiamat!
