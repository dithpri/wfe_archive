The Confederation of Baphomet is an assembly of aligned nations with the goal of aiding one another against common foes while dealing with each other economically. Leading nations are infallible to those below, all must toe the Baphomet Socialist Party&amp;#39;s line or face ban through fair tribunal. 

No democracies or world assembly members are permitted in the Confederation
Only dictatorships are permitted, and as a member of the region you are to treat your 
comrades as allies however civil debate is allowed.
In the event of civil war a fair Tribunal can be suspended and an rp will be carried out
until a nation has won a total victory. 
Tribunal must be three members so there will be no tie, members will be elected if a tribunal is called.
