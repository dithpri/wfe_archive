The Imagience is a new Medieval-Enlightenment era role-playing region. Sycamor is the main country that leads the region, however quarrels inside and outside the region are not unheard of. Humans and Imagients (Humans with psionic powers) are the main people who live in this region. Both magic and technology is allowed, but no technology beyond the Enlightenment, unless you are using steampunk which would be cutting-edge technology in the region.
