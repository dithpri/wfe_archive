Group of militant islands in the Pacific standing against fascism, colonialism and communism. Islands can be democratic or ruled by dictators, who are good dictators though and not tyrannical. These islands are beautiful gifts of mother nature with environments that must be protected and people that must be defended from the numerous foreign threats, like various greedy European Empires in the past or the Imperial Japanese more recently.
