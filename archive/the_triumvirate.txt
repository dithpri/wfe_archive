[b]Hello, we are the Triumvirate, an economic alliance within the Lacian RP![/b]

[b]History[/b]
The Triumvirate was founded in the now destroyed region of [region]Roses Without Thorns[/region], as an economic alliance between neutral nations not aligned with the three world powers at the time - Lythoria, Lethinia and Kelban. In the midst of this 1984 style scenario, the Triumvirate was born.

The Triumvirate currently has 6 members, making it the largest alliance within the Lacian RP.

From Azure Skies
To Sparkling Fields
Do you hear the people&#39;s cries?

From Crimson Valleys
a whispering voice it&#39;s blossom
We shall fight for our right to freedom!

Until the last dawn of the Golden Sun
We fight till the last bread is leaven,
Till all are united under our heaven!
