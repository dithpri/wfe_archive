Nerdania is a federation of independent states founded by groups of nerd enthusiasts from around the world. These states were established by nerds who, frustrated by the epidemic of puritanism and &quot;woke&quot; ideologies, decided to escape from a society that lowers the intelligence quotient and lacks appreciation for nerd culture. Nerdania has become their refuge, a place where nerds can come together, explore their passions, and promote an appreciation for knowledge, intelligence, and creativity, shielded from the unwanted influences of modern society.
