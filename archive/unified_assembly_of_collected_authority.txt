Freed from the rules of world order, the Unified Assembly maintains its isolation and governance through regional authority. All nations collected within remain an assembly of individual authority under a collected but non-interfering region. This region maintains the liberty of self authority while allowing a collected interface for reasonable international relations. Strive for independence, self governance and rely on none. Keep your strength, become rich and guide yourself. These collected authorities maintain their independence under this regional command.
