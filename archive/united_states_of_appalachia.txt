The United States of Appalachia (USA) is a nation founded on the principles of personal freedom, local governance, and a deep connection to nature and spirituality. Established after the Appalachian people played a central role in the American Revolution, the country is a federated republic with decentralized government, where states retain high autonomy. The political system prioritizes state sovereignty over a powerful central government, and the Appalachian values of self-reliance, community, and individual liberties are central.
