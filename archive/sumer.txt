[b][i]SUMER BELONGS TO THE SUMERIANS![/i][/b][hr]

[u][b]THIS REGION HAS BEEN LOCKED TO PREVENT FUTURE BLACK RIDER INCURSIONS.[/b][/u]

However, security is still the top priority. To that end:

[b]No new embassies will be accepted or proposed.

All members are required to endorse the delegate [nation]Gil Gamesh[/nation] and
vice delegate [nation]Enheduana[/nation][/b], who are now alternating the delegacy.[hr]

Thank you very much for your understanding. With your help, and with the help of the Gods
and Goddesses of our Sumerian ancestors, we will get through this period of uncertainty.

King of Uruk
