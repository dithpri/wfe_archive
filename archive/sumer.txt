[b][i]SUMER BELONGS TO THE SUMERIANS![/i][/b][hr]

[b][u]THIS REGION IS A WAR ZONE[/u][/b]

Security is the top priority. To that end:

[b]No new embassies will be accepted or proposed.

No new members will be permitted without invitation.[/b]

Anyone who shows up uninvited gets banjected, no exceptions, [i]this means you![/i]

[b]All existing members are [i][u]STRONGLY[/u] [u]ENCOURAGED[/u][/i] to endorse the delegate, [nation=short]Gil Gamesh[/nation].[/b]

If you cannot endorse the delegate, you are [i][u]STRONGLY[/u] [u]ENCOURAGED[/u][/i] to evacuate the region so as not to leech away the influence the delegate needs to do his job. ([u][region]Sumeria[/region][/u] is opened.)[hr]

Thank you very much for your understanding. With your help, and with the help of the Gods and Goddesses of our Sumerian ancestors, we will get through this period of uncertainty.

King of Uruk
