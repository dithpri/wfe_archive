     We, due to our past grievances, have crumbled from a once perfect union, but today this region is to be reborn as a new. This new region will be built upon the foundation of peace and tranquility. This territory will rise from the ashes as the Phoenix and we will once again part of the greater. We shall be the number one region in the world!!!!! I choose to rule fair in order to be the glue that keeps this region together. If anyone has grievances with this new arrangement then we will deal with it in an organized way. We will settle things over a poll that will last for one day. And if things are not settled over the course of the day, then we will have a tournament.
