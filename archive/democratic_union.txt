Captured since: 10/6/20

[hr]This region was obviously a protectorate of [region]The Red Fleet[/region], (they&#39;re main region [region]The Internationale[/region] has the democratic tag) so I captured it. Now don&#39;t get me wrong I like democracy it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t like communists
