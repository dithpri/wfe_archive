[hr]Captured: 6/15/21

[hr]This region was captured from [region]The Red Fleet[/region], but let me tell you what makes this region so valuable. See this was my property under [region]Camp Jupiter[/region] but I let it CTE. The thing that makes it good is that I&#39;m protecting this Christian region (scroll down the WFE&#39;s) and this was property of [region]The Red Fleet[/region]. Not only that but [region]The Roman Empire[/region] also seized this region. Oh well doesn&#39;t matter, the only thing that does is that this region is [b][u][i]mine[/i][/u][/b] now.
