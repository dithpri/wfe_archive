The Yvian Realm is a small region located in the north comprised of massive landmasses which float in the air above the single grounded landmass, Thaderday. The Yvian Alliance is composed of vastly different nations, whose people share a common love of bad literature, pancakes, and pirating.

The Yvian Realm shares a close bond with its island neighbors, The Isles of Strifelandia.
