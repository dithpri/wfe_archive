The Yvian Realm is a small region located in the north comprised of massive landmasses which float in the air. The Yvian Alliance is composed of vastly different nations, whose people share a common love of bad literature, pancakes, magic, and little else.

Once, the Realms were all on one giant floating continent; a land overflowing with magic. However, the continent was struck by a great meteor which split the land into fragments and dispersed the land&#146;s inherent magic unevenly throughout the Realm. Phla, the center of the original Yvia, kept most of its magic. The other fragments sunk in elevation depending on how much magic the land retained.

The Yvian Realm shares a close bond with its island neighbors, The Isles of Strifelandia.
