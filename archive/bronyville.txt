I used to wonder what friendship could be until you all shared its magic with me; big adventure, tons of fun, a beautiful heart, faithful and strong, sharing kindness it&amp;#39;s an easy feat and magic makes it all complete. You have my little ponies. Don&amp;#39;t you know you&amp;#39;re all my very best friends.
