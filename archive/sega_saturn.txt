Kids, there&#39;s nothing more cool than playing NationStates and participating in regional politics with nations ya like. But if someone tries to fill your region with puppets in an invasion that makes you feel uncomfortable...

That&#39;s NO GOOD!

It&#39;s your region! No one has the right to elect themselves delegate if you don&#39;t want them to! So whaddaya do? First... ya say NO!
Then, ya put a password on your region and get those puppets outta there! Most important, you gotta ban and eject those f*ckers in the future.
