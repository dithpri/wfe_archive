WE are a peaceful, friendly community of beach loving regions who take pleasure in relaxing and drinking cocktails.

Monte Carlo Beach is centered around our InFLatable Beach Bar Pub (FLub) where everyone is welcome. Our national dish is the JafKA Cake (made with Vodka).

When we need a holiday we visit our partners at A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER (who are all lovely people).
