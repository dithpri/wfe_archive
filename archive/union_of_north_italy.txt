This region is set around the Napoleonic Wars in Northern Italy. In this alternate timeline, rather than setting up a kingdom run by himself, Napoleon set up something more akin to the Helvetic Republic, where it is a small collection of states made into one union. Each state can be either a Republic, Commonwealth, duchy, or grand duchy. The currency doesn&#39;t matter, though it should be noted that the Lira was used in most of Napoleonic Italy. This is intended to be a mostly roleplay group. I hope you find some kind of interest in this, otherwise, I sound like an idiot. 

&quot;lunga vita alla patria!&quot;
