Tucked away in the deep Oceanic regions of the world are the massive and bountiful Fenton Isles, marvels of geography due to its deep waters and steep mountains, not to mention its fair, balanced weather in the summer, and thick blankets of snow in the winter. Despite its incredibly varied environments on each island, the natives are hardly separated by their differences in climate, with constant visits between islands that are only four hours away from each other by plane. Most islands are connected via the Trans-Channel rail line, which cuts down travel time to one hour.
