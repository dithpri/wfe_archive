[color=red]Taken by communist revolutionaries![/color]

Once again proving that reams of liberal platitudes and talk of action will never be as effective as actual practical action. We stand at the forefront of revolutionary change; reactionaries, fascists, capitalists, theocrats, right wing extremists of any kind, we are coming for you...

This bastion of right wing extremism has been shut down by [region]North Korea[/region], [region]Das Kommune[/region], [region]Communist China[/region] and [region]The Communist Party of Nationstates[/region]
