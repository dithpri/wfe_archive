On January 18, 2016, Avathar was wiped out by an unknown force. There were no survivors. Though our region is now dead, it lives on in the hearts of those it liberated, and its influence on the world of nationstates is undeniable. It was a good run, and we will never forget the times we spent together. All Hail Avathar!
