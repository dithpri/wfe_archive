Universalis is an alliance for prosperity, where any nation supporting freedom is welcomed. We are a fairly new region, with a closely knitted community ready to help out newcomers. 

[b]&amp;quot;Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.&amp;quot;
[i]Franklin D. Roosevelt[/i]

&amp;quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&amp;quot;
