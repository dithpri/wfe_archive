Despite the brave efforts of the [color=dc241f]Dominion of Neo Zekian[/color], and the assistance of the [color=green]Principality of Jovita[/color], the absence of the founder Lyaya has proven to be too much of a burden. Therefore, there must be a new founder of Neo Zekian for it be a true Neo Zekian.

The direction and ideals behind the Commonwealth will still be the primary responsibility of the [color=dc241f]Dominion of Neo Zekian[/color].

We will grow strong, proud, and soon be a voice in the ongoing fight between the Riders and the innocent nations they disrupt.

Onward into the true Neo Zekian era we will go. For eternal flame shall never dispel.
