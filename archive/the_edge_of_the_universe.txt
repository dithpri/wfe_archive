[b]Welcome to the Edge of the Universe! [/b]

What is that you say? 
There is no such thing as the [i]edge of the Universe[/i] because the manner in which the Universe expands doesn&#39;t allow for that? 

Well, by that logic, [i]everything[/i] is the Edge of the Universe, because the Universe is, in and of it self, the edge. 
So, 

[b]Welcome to the Edge of the Universe! Home of all that was, is, and that is becoming![/b]

[sub]You&#39;re here whether you like it or not, so why not make a mess of things?[/sub]
