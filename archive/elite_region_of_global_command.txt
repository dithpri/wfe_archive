The Elite Region of Global Command, the ERGC, was created as of August 2012 to invite nations with most and highest powers to unite together under one region. Eventually, the ERGC will rise to become the greatest regional influence that Nation States has to offer. The regions creator, King Mitchabe, rules over 8 different nations in Nation States, and has been around for years. Without Nation State&amp;#39;s leading nations to join, the ERGC will fall apart. Join us and together we can... we will rule Nation States together.
