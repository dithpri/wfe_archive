Anyways, to expand upon PandaNation, here&#39;s some information regarding raids. It&#39;s more just a definition, so if you want to know more, read this helpful link: https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=4941645#war
&quot;Raiding or region crashing is when a group of nations invades a region in order to assert their own control over it.&quot; So if you see this change to something not from me or PandaNation, or something like the flag changes, it&#39;s generally a sign we&#39;ve been raided.
So just be wary of who comes in and out of here. Make sure we all know who&#39;s who.

Anyways, don&#39;t forget, ask for roles, make sure we&#39;re all cool and stuff.
Safe travels and Merry Christmas.
