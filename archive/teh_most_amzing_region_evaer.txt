Just be careful for raids lads, if it happens look at the dispatch of how 2 handle raids (pref more wa members endorse me)
Ask me if you want a role and I&#39;ll give it to you. Also, don&#39;t have more than 3 nations that you have created in this region because it gets way too confusing for me to tell whos who.
I&#39;ll be on every now and then to monitor things, do my issues or just to mess around with these settings. 
If you&#39;re new, don&#39;t make a ruckus, be chill, and I won&#39;t have to kick you. 

Can&#39;t wait until Halloween.
