[b]Prince Edward Island[/b]
[list][I]Someone asked if I was from PEI, as I had founded the region named such. I&amp;#39;m not from anywhere, really. I was a military brat, and moved around a great deal, then joined the services and moved around a lot more. Never stopped moving and now I have been almost everywhere, mind you I had only been in some places for a few days and others for as much as a few years. I had moved from [region=Quebec City] to Summerside PEI, then to Moncton before moving to [region=Halifax]. That was a nice summer. [b]On the road again.[/b][/I][/list]
