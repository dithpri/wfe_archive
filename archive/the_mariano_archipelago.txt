[b]Welcome to the Mariano Archieplago![/b]
The Mariano Archipelago is an archipelago on Minerva, a recently colonized multiverse after several portals were discovered in 1992.

This is alt storage, basically. Most of my alts (aside from ones I can&#39;t fit or ones that don&#39;t belong) will be in the final map.
