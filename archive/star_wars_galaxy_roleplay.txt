40 ABY: The Emperor Sidious has arose from his death. His fleet is back to normal and an army is being produced in massive amounts. This time there is nothing to alert the presence of this force. Only a number of Jedi can sense the darkness but cannot pinpoint it to its location. The path to Exogol is lost due to the destruction of the found wayfinders. The only people with a wayfinder is the Emperor himself and the Supreme Admiral.
