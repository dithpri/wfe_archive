[color=red]Principles of the IPF:[/color]

[i]The IPF shall promote national sovereignty and regional sovereignty.

The IPF member regions ally themselves against tyranny and common defense of each other.

Forcing out regions that are not &amp;#39;in line&amp;#39; with Defense Council political beliefs is not allowed.

The IPF holds that regions should be able to choose their policies without foreign interference.

An attack on a member region is to be considered an attack on the IDA. Although, a military response is not required.[/i]
