The realm of awesome sauce was founded and is operated by a group of allied dictatorships who revere post apocalyptic government and total superiority over the wasteland the world will become following nuclear war. The realm is exceptionally large, even though it is near impossible to find without directions, this is mainly due to the strange radioactive, yet somehow preservative cloud hovering over the entire region. None outside it&amp;#39;s creators and those invited have ever seen it, but they say if you send a courier randomly into the divided abyss, he may return with an invitation...or not at all.
