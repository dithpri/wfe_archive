This land was created from the influence of war and destruction among 2 empires. These 2 major powers rose up and had multiple battles over land and rich resources.  The great war ended in a stalemate when both sides decided to sign a peace treaty, creating The Imperial Alliance. The land in this region is heavily industrialized with sky scrapers and spires piercing the sky. Today, both empires prosper with wealth and glory, although old grudges still remain.
