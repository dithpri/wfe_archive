The Isola islands are a fertile series of islands close to the Galapogos islands. First colonized by the Dutch, but after a revolution the single island of Assedam was formed. However, there are other islands unclaimed, and while Assedam slowly clambers too it&amp;#39;s feet, it might be a good idea to grab some of the islands before it&amp;#39;s too late.

It is remarkable for most of the country&amp;#39;s ignoring the World Assembly, instead choosing to focus on the local problems.
