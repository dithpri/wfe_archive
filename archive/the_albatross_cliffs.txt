A peaceful and compassionate region, where birds are of a major importance. 
Incorporating tolerance, but justice, this region is well run, and hopefully attractive to new members.
With the ability to advance in ranks at a good pace, and being quite involved, this nation offers a good start for younger NationStates members, although this isn&#146;t a feeder.
