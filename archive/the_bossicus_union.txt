[b]The History of BOSS Bros and Peter Billing:[/b]
In 2016 a group emerged, taking the name BOSS Bros that based loosely off of a nickname for one of the members. The group soon began to grow upon itself into a cult of sorts. This group originally began as a satire government, religion and meme. 
[u]The original 6 members consisted of the following[/u]:
He who went by Boss
He who was &#147;from space&#148;
He who is black
He who spells his name with a &#147;ph&#148;
He who is a hick
And he who passes gas

They thrived for a solid year before falling apart. 
3 members were exiled from their passions.
But this fall brought new light.
The group has returned, smarter and stronger. 


The BOSS Bros will rise again into their peaceful and fun loving lives they once had.
