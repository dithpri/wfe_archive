Death to the United Country&amp;#39;s of the New World Long live the UNAA.  This is for betraying the UNAA and being so ungrateful. Enjoy the memorial.

Justice has been dealt. Now how powerful are you now?

Victory is ours!

This memorial is dedicated to all
citizens of the UNAA that lost their
lives to military attacks by
The Dark Imperlist State of Confedracy.
Although they may have been
infeceted these people could have
been saved if they had received the cure. 
Now they lay at rest...
but will never to be forgotten.
