One day, a young man was walking in a forest. Then he lost the game. He vowed never to lose the game again, so he took a tiger cub from its mother and drank its blood. Following this, he picked up Assassin&amp;#39;s Creed II from EB Games and completed it, making him a Vatican Assassin. Not yet proud of the work he had done, he chose to steal some DNA from the legendary Adonis, and then went on to bang seven gram rocks. It was at this point that he decided to become a rock star from Mars, and in doing so help his goal of becoming a Warlock.

By the time he had completed these many achievements, he had become a wisened warrior by the name of Charlie Sheen. You can see him bi-winning on a regular basis.
