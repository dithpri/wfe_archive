Regionia is a region with a past-tech roleplay set in the 1940s. In this world, you don&#39;t control any nation - you control your own.

[b]Note: This region takes place during the years of 1933 - 1945. If you are looking for a present-day RP, you&#39;ve come to the wrong spot, partner. Sorry.[/b]
