Before the coming of the Deverrians, the lands that now make up Deverry were populated by the Bondsfolk, which were driven away or became serfs or slaves to the Deverrians when they settled there. The Deverrians first reached Deverry around year 0. Today the main parts of Deverry are the Kingdom of Deverry, Eldidd and Pyrdon. Eldidd and Pyrdon were created separately by splintering factions from the Kingdom of Deverry but were finally brought into the Kingdom of Deverry in 855 at the end of The Time of Troubles.
