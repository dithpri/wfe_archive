We as a nation believe that the best way to govern is to model Fiction. Cool Cool Cool. In order to gain this our great leader made his nation based on the NBC show Community. Though we welcome all whether television or not. We strive for equal ratings freedom of broadcast and high funding for our shows. (Equal rights, freedom of speech and strong economy&#39;s.)
