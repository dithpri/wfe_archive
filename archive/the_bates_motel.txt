[hr][sup][b]It&#39;s sad, when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son. But I couldn&#39;t allow them to believe that I would commit murder. They&#39;ll put him away now, as I should have years ago. He was always bad, and in the end he intended to tell them I killed those girls and that man... as if I could do anything but just sit and stare, like one of his stuffed birds. They know I can&#39;t move a finger, and I won&#39;t. I&#39;ll just sit here and be quiet, just in case they do... suspect me. They&#39;re probably watching me. Well, let them. Let them see what kind of a person I am. I&#39;m not even going to swat that fly. I hope they are watching... they&#39;ll see. They&#39;ll see and they&#39;ll know, and they&#39;ll say, &quot;Why, she wouldn&#39;t even harm a fly...&quot;[/b][/sup][hr]
