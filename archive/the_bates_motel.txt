[color=navy][b]So here&#39;s the story....though yours may vary slightly. [/b][/color]

[color=Teal]It&#39;s a dark rainy night. Your car broke down and you have walked for miles to arrive at this motel out in the boonies. The sign says &quot;vacancy&quot; and you figure what the heck. The young man at the front desk offers you assistance and a room. He&#39;s creepy. [i]Really [/i]creepy. You can&#39;t seem to put your finger on why, but the hairs on the back of your neck stand to attention when he speaks. There is not another motel for miles and you are exhausted.[/color] 

[color=magenta][b]Please...do check in. [/color] [color=navy]The bed is still warm.[/b][/color] &amp;#128521;
