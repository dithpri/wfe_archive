Vandoosa sent the Black Hawks out to shoot the people down
He thought the PF were dead in dear old TDK
But he got a rude awakening with rifle and grenade
When he met the first Batallion of the Terran Brigade
Glory, glory to old Democratika
Glory, glory to this region
Glory to the memory of the men who fought and died
&#147;No surrender&#148; is the war cry of the Terran Brigade
The soldiers came from Auralia equipped with raiders guns
There were men by the thousand, ammunition by the ton
But when they got to PF, they were seriously delayed
By the fighting First Batallion of Terran Brigade
