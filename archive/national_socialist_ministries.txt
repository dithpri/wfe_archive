This region is part of the National Socialist League, it was created to spread the truth of National Socialism and the fundamental principles of Christianity prior to World War 2 that influenced Nationalism in the creation of its political structure. We follow no denomination but feel that each person should find their own spirituality based on their cultural heritage as well as what is in their hearts. Our Nordic brothers and sisters are welcome as well. 
Bless You All, Morrighana
