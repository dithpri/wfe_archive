[b]NATIONAL SOCIALIST MINISTRIES[/b]
We are a region that is dedicated to spreading the true tenets of 
National Socialism - from political to historical truth, and to how our ideology fits into the modern world.

All National Socialists, Fascists and those sympathetic to or simply curious about what National Socialism [i]really[/i] is are welcome.

We are, for the moment, a small region, born from the ashes of the [region]National Socialist League[/region], and are currently growing and rebuilding a secure home under the same principles.

[i]Members are encouraged to join the World Assembly and endorse our regional delegate: [nation]Drittes Deutsches Reich[/nation].[/i]
