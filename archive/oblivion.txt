Welcome to the free land of Oblivion! Our region was once taken by a bunch of thugs, but we are now free. The Oblivion Underground waited in the shadows after the invading force had taken our region until we made our move. The citizens of Oblivion have no reason to fear any such takeovers again. Our new head of military technology has already launched several satellites that will circle our region and will destroy any invading force that ever tries to mess with us again.
