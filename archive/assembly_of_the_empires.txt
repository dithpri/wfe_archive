[color=red][b]The Assembly of The Empires Regional Code[/b][/color]

We believe in no freedoms because the government shall hold all power and citizens must follow these rules forever.

We are dedicated to the involvement and importance of all of our members, so if a new one joins and is worthy to stay, we will add a star to our alliance flag to prove your allegiance and our dedication to our members! Also, we will offer promotions to loyal members for a limited time as there are unfilled roles.
