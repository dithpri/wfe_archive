A recently discovered region, it consists a few growing nations.
Not many people have yet explored these lands but word of mouth that have spread talk about strange events, creatures and sights that have been seen.

Like many regions there are several types of biotopes. In the center of the region there seems to be a large desert with random unexplored ruins. Though it is unknown if these belong to any of the existing nations or if they have been explored in secret.

In the sea surounding the region there exist some islands and peninsula&amp;#39;s of varying sizes. Inwardly there are many mountain ranges and a small amount of rivers and lakes, these rivers and lakes are very large in size though with a few exceptions.
