[b][i]Welcome to Houndsmouth, heroes![/b][/i]

After unifying the Kingdom under their banner, the Rabbit Clan built this marvelous port city at the mouth of the Hounds River in eastern Armello. Since then, it&#39;s become a bustling financial center, thriving on trade with other settlements from across the land. [nation=short]Amber the Far Seeker[/nation] of the Rabbit Clan has come here to sell off precious treasures she&#39;s found in her journeys.

An eager adventurer, Amber explores mysterious places few would dare to tread in search of whatever may lie hidden within. She&#39;s truly brave, as while some dungeons may hold artifacts, others hold dark secrets. Whichever Clan scores the most points here will convince the town to sponsor an adventure with her and claim this region!
