The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), at 28,000 square miles, is one of the largest intact temperate-zone ecosystems on Earth today, encompassing Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.  It is one of the world&#39;s foremost natural laboratories in landscape ecology and geology and is a world-renowned recreational site. 

Greater Yellowstone&#146;s natural diversity is essentially intact, retaining or restoring its full historic complement of wildlife species&#151;unique in the wildlands of the contiguous 48 states.  Habitats range from high alpine areas to sagebrush, hydrothermal, forests, meadows, and other habitat types. All of these are connected, including linkages provided by streams and rivers that course through changing elevations.
