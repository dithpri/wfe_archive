A mountain wildland, home to grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk, the [region]Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem[/region] is one of the last, nearly intact, natural ecosystems in the Earth&#146;s temperate zone.  Also known as &amp;quot;Wonderland,&amp;quot; Old Faithful and the majority of the world&amp;#39;s geysers are preserved here. They are the main reason Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 as America&amp;#39;s first national park&#151;an idea that spread worldwide.
