[/color][color=DarkOliveGreen]REGION &amp;amp; ALLIANCE
0000 (Four Zeroes) has been in the past the home region of [nation=short]Royal House of Windsor[/nation] and their many puppets. 
[nation=short]Zymurgygenesis[/nation] has been the region&amp;#39;s previous founder from 2003 until August 1, 2012.
The Alliance&amp;#39;s Home region was moved to [region=Rio de Janeiro], until the game reset, when it was moved to [region=Galapagos], then it became [region=Ionia], and now [region=Ancient Lands].
I have had this region too long to actually part with it.
