West Fairlandia is a proud region, born from the fires of a Revolutionary War with Fairlandia. It is a place of order and anarchy, peace and war. All are welcome, so long as they follow one basic rule: West Fairlandia first, after everything else.

Home of Fairfield JSA.

Welcome, all! It is great to see you in West Fairlandia.

I will be using the message board to post JSA information regularly, such as upcoming debates, deadlines, and ideas. Anybody who has an idea or question for/about JSA may also post it here, keeping it appropriate of course. 

This region is open for all, and if any non-JSA students would like to join anyways, they are always welcome.
