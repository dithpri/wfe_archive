Home of Fairfield JSA.

Welcome, all! It is great to see you in West Fairlandia.

*Power shall be returned to Congress at 4:00 P.M on Tuesday. The Constitution is nullified, and a new one shall be drafted. The Constitution will then be ratified by a majority vote in Congress, as well as a 3/4 majority vote of the Nations, held Saturday. Due to the now vacant seat in the Congress, the Executive shall fill that position until Saturday, at which time a new election will take place. The WA Delegate shall be returned his powers, but barred from suppressing posts without the Executive&amp;#39;s approval or the approval of the Congress, which itself may be vetoed in a non-overrideable fashion.
