[b]Having achieved so much success only a day earlier with the Tactical Bear Drop&#153; the [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to break it out again. This time, however, the Fendas were prepared and the Hawks came up against stiff opposition. With Fendas nipping at their heels the Hawks were still able to hit more regions than they missed and even managed to end on a victory! If you&#39;re concerned about the possibility of being crushed by a bear, please join [region]The Black Hawks[/region] [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]discord[/url] server, because the only only way to protect yourself is to [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]join us[/url]!
