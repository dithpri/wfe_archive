These Nations who join us are out for Many different things, Power, Fame, Glory, Profit, all of it is Acceptable. There are few Problems that will Surface among with how people run their Nations. As long as it is not founded upon Religion or Murder of Innocent People, you will be just fine.

Nations who refuse to abide by these rules will have their Membership of this Region Terminated. It is not acceptable.

We will assist Nations in our Region if possible, we would not want them to suffer the Downfall of many others. Different Nations can contribute but in the end The Nations have a Choice.
