[b][color=red]On a dark and stormy night many months ago, a hawkish assassin[/color] [color=orange]was sitting in his private study when a very mysterious call comes in.[/color][color=green]When he picked up the phone, a very dark voice told him the following: &quot;You see the transphobic region [region]United Christian Countries[/region]? You need to secure the governorship of the region&quot;.[/color][color=blue] Then the caller hung up without another word and disappeared.[/color][color=purple] Many months later, the previous governor goes on a break from this region and asks if he[/color][color=pink] would take care of the region and so the hawkish assassin activated his secret plan and claimed this region.[/color] Remember, Trans rights are human rights!
