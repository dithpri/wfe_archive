Pinkies United of New Earth was founded in 2012 when a group of eighth graders decided to roleplay a new world with new countries. PUNE has now been brought to the Internet, for anyone to join. PUNE stresses sovereignty within the organization, and works on peacekeeping within the organization. PUNE passes legislation that internal nations are required to follow. PUNE is entirely Democratic, with countries allowed to suggest legislation and vote on legislation. Countries also have their say in peacekeeping affairs. Security is provided with the PUNE Security Department, which manages the PUNE military and other affairs.
