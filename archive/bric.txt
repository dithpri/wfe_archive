[i][b]Dreaming with BRICs: The Path to 2050[/b][/i]

The BRIC thesis recognizes that Brazil, [region]Russia[/region], [region]India[/region] and [region]China[/region] have changed their political systems to embrace global capitalism. Goldman Sachs predicts that [region]China[/region] and [region]India[/region], respectively, will become the dominant global suppliers of manufactured goods and services, while Brazil and [region]Russia[/region] will become similarly dominant as suppliers of raw materials. Of the four countries, Brazil remains the only polity that has the capacity to continue all elements, meaning manufacturing, services, and resource supplying simultaneously. Cooperation is thus hypothesized to be a logical next step among the BRICs because Brazil and [region]Russia[/region] together form the logical commodity suppliers.
