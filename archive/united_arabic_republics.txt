The UAR is a league of Arabic nations. We pass resolutions within our borders dictating what is illegal and isn&#39;t, these are discussed in the NationStates subforum (IC). You must send me a telegram of [url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/it1biydrvd9sewy/zSXZGBZbnG-latest.txt?dl=0]this application[/url] to join the UAR.

Once you have sent an application and have been accepted, get to work immediately discussing topics regarding the UAR in the NationStates subforum.
