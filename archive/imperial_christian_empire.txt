Only Christians are allowed in this region. A region can not operate with more than one common religion, what i am trying to say is that there can only be one dominant religion and here it is Christianity. So with out being said if you do not believe in Jesus Christ than do not bother joining. However if you would like to join and learn about Jesus then you are more than welcome to join.
