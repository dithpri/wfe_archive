Regional Motto: &amp;quot;From These Many Countries We Are One Democracy&amp;quot;

Our region once again faces the threat of invasion... From the same source. I have locked the region, but citizens of the UNE are able to see the password. No new nations will be tolerated. If using puppets, to bring them in you must clarify... Please notify if any nation approaches you. The password is up so we can continue our current roleplay.
Thank you!
