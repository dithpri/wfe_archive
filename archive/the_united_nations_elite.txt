The new Council will serve with the same power and authority of the previous positions of government. The Government that I had set up for the region is hereby suspended, and every document related to it is now rendered void. The nations that you see before you including the Founder and The Scottish Monarchy, and excluding Shanwolverines, are all preparing to move on. . . Even myself. This is our farewell government.
