Regional Motto: &amp;quot;From These Many Countries We Are One Democracy&amp;quot;

In light of my move to reform the Regional government I have been granted Executive Powers once more until we can put together the new government. I assure you all that once the new government is in I WILL step down from the position of WA Delegate, and all of the Executive Powers that I now hold will be removed once again in accordance to the regional decision to remove them in order to protect the region. This is not a power play this is a revolution on a grand scale. Thank you all for your time, ideas, patience, and understanding. 

Your WA Delegate,
The Zealots of Mercy
