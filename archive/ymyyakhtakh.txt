[color=darkgreen][b]Welcome[/b][/color] [color=red][b]to[/b][/color] [color=black][b]Ymyyakhtakh![/b][/color]

Named after an ancient Paleo-Siberian culture, Ymyyakhtakh is a small region dedicated to the cause of Uralic nationalism. We promote unity among the great Finnic, Ugric, Samoyedic, and Yukaghir peoples. History has not been kind to us, but we will not forget who we are.

We oppose the genocidal and murderous ideologies of communism and fascism, and consider ourselves at war with all regions who promote or tolerate these ideologies.
