This is a new region. Its founding resident is the Country of Anadelphia. The nation nestled between the Pontixal Alpines and the Renigev mountains, principally settled in the Mendovian Lowlands. For a full geographic breakdown of the Anadelphian geography, go to the appropriate page on the Anadephian page.

All other nations in the region are outside of these borders.

The region is eclectic in its governmental compositions, and has a history of both long wars and times of peace. The first Conqueror of Oxidentalia, and consequently the leader of Anadelphia, maintains authority over the region, and favors a regime based on merit and fealty.
