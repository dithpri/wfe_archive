Who is more free, the hermit who lives in solitude or he who lives still in society? I say, it is the hermit who lives by his conscious and subsists by his own labor and trials who is truly free, not those who live by the consensus of others&#39; consciousness and subsists by the collective and leisure. This is a region of freedom from the oppression of any other region and any other state.
