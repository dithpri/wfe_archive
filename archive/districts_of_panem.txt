Only 13 nations are allowed here (including me), so get here quickly to take your spot. First nation to join is District 1, second to join is District 2, until we have twelve districts. I am the Capitol of course ([nation]Panemme[/nation]). 

[color=yellow]To Join[/color]: You need to have read &amp;quot;[color=purple]The Hunger Games[/color]&amp;quot; or seen the movie to enter this region (to make sure you understand what Panem actually is!). You also cannot be a WA member.

[color=orange]Note[/color]: This has a password, so if you want to join, telegram me saying you fit the requirements above (don&amp;#39;t lie), and I&amp;#39;ll give you the password. 

[color=pink]Note[/color]:[nation]District XIV[/nation] does not count as one of the 13 nations permitted, as he is my Vice President.
 
[color=lime]Allies[/color]: [region]Panem[/region], [region]The Hunger Games[/region]

[color=red]Enemies[/color]: [region]The Panem Rebellion[/region]
