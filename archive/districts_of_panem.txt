Only 13 nations are allowed here (including me), so get here quickly to take your spot. First one here is District 1, second one here is District 2, all the way until we get twelve districts. I am the Capitol of course. 

Requirements: You must have read &amp;quot;[color=purple]The Hunger Games[/color]&amp;quot; or seen the movie to enter this region.

Note: This is password locked, so if you want to join, telegram me saying you fit 
the requirements above, and I&amp;#39;ll give you the password. 

[nation]District XIV[/nation] does not count as one of the 13 nations permitted, as he is just the WA Delegate.

If multiple nations endorse another single nation and he becomes the WA Delegate, I will eject either those nations or the nation they elected.
