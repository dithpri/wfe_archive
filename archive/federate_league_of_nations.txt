The [b]Federate League of Nations[/b], or [b]FLN[/b], is a developing region looking to help the various nations of NationStates achieve their goals and prosper. If you&#39;re looking for a region to help you get power, influence or become better at what your nation does, or just to relax and enjoy the game, that&#39;s us!

It doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re a dictatorship, a democracy, left-wing, right-wing, centrist, communist, capitalist or whatever, as long as you&#39;re nice to others and follow the rules, you&#39;re in.
