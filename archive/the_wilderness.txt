The Wilderness are exactly that, a vast freezing at day and freezing at night mass of land, not to mention the lovely craters that were made by our finest bombs, and the oceans of Hydrochloric Acids are just wonderful in the summers. Fond of birds? well then you&amp;#39;ll be pleased to know that the Raven flourishes in the wilderness&amp;#39; many lush forests.
The Wilderness spreads for many kilometers and are filled with run down cities and metropolises just waiting for YOU to move in and call it your own.
So, to join the Wilderness, just send us a telegram and we&amp;#39;ll let you move in a jiffy.
