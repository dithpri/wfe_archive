The Wilderness is a sanctuary for the ambitious nations, those who desire power for the better of all, but don&amp;#39;t have the means to grasp it.

We&amp;#39;re open to all, but we have strict regulations.

Hostility must be tucked away, all nations within our borders must work together to achieved our goal.
Only the best and brightest may join us in our journey to achieved the common goal.
Once inside, all contact to the outside will be abolished, as secrecy is the key to achieving our the common goal.

To top that, there is one main law that must be remembered by ALL. Recite it, write it on your walls, burn it into your skin, whatever helps you to remember this...

We never directly intervene, only suggest... we guide the world with an invisible hand...
