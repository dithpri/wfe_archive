Leading body: The Rosalinian regional parliament
Region capital: Leopold, Kalina

This region is wholly made for democratic decisions. There will be voting, but whatever the majority votes will be law. Elections will be held for the WA delegate so there will be no backseat endorsements. All of these matters will be voted on in the region parliament link. I hope you find the democraritc atmosphere of Rosalinia to be quite comfortable.
