Welcome, nations that hold the proud name of &amp;quot;Falconia&amp;quot;, despite our nations differences in name, national leaders and even the nation style (Confederacy, United Colonial Powers, etc....). But we do share mainly three things in the common ground: Democracy, History and Methods in Liberty. We respect and support each other in issues, integrity and nationality. So, as comrades, as workers, as brothers in nations, arise as one! As British Falconia&amp;#39;s motto perfectly states, &amp;quot;One Union Under God.&amp;quot;
