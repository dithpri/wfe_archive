Falconians, today, I will address you all as one, I bear bad tidings as nations have suffered a massive disaster. Thus I am stating that this nation will now and forever be decommissioned. After many trials of its great service, this nation will be evacuated and its neighbouring nation. I understand the nation&amp;#39;s great concern. Fear not! Someday, we will revive this once great nation and become a just and democratic society.

Thank you, and Farewell to the Union,

Chief Viceroy Sir Jarton Talon
