Here, military might is not what earns you top seat, but duels do. You&#39;re welcome to RP with them, but thats about the largest extent they&#39;ll use. Beyond that, We are founded to create a great atmosphere, devoid of opression to new players via military. When you have the throne, you can change all laws within reason and/or if the founder allows it. Duels are random chance and are available to use once a week for a ranking system, (the throne duels being allowed only by those that have won that week. (region is a WIP)
