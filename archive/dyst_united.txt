A coalition of free nations, Dyst United was founded as a safe haven where independent countries can meet to discuss issues without fear of discrimination. 

Dyst&amp;#39;s government is composed of a triumverate. One executive delegate who represents us at the World Assembly, a public relations delegate who manages internal affairs, and a war office delegate who protects our grand union.

The WA Delegate is decided by endorsements, and the two other delegates are by popular opinion. The two auxiliary delegates reign for as long as the majority supports them.

All nations welcome, have a nice day.
