[b]A couple of Hawks decided to spread their wings and soar to several different regions - including this one! - this fine night. They flew and flew over many different realms: first the forest, next the bay, then the desert, before returning home. However, the regions underneath seemed not to notice that they were being conquered. Perhaps the inhabitants were asleep. Perhaps they could not see in their old age, their eyes atrophied. Whatever it was, the inhabitants would surely soon find their regions plundered, and the hawks had escaped clutching a bag full of their prized possessions in each talon.
