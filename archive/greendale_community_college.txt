Located in Greendale, Colorado, Greendale Community College (GCC) is an affordable open-admissions college. Formed in 1974, Greendale has over 80 different fields of study. The current mascot is the Greendale Human Being, as designed by Pierce and the dean.

We are a young, up and coming region, looking to grow through the power of fandom. We expect to grow into having frequent roleplay, establishing our own WA representative, and in general, promoting the show Community and reveling in our own geekiness.

[b]Rules: If you join this region, your country must be run by a Community character, or have some kind of theme related to the show. This means name, motto, currency, and animal must be Community relevant. [/b]
