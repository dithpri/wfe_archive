Welcome to the World of Nirn, an Elder Scrolls Roleplay region! Roleplay as a small order sworn to defend against the vile Daedra, or as a country that will unite all of Tamerial or Akavir. Please read the rules before starting your nation, and of course if you have any questions or suggestions, please ask [nation]Rorukheim II[/nation] or any of the moderators.
