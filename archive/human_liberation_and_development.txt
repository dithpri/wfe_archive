Founded on the principles of communist Maoism, Human Liberation and Development (HLD) emerged as a global force for radical change. Established to combat oppression and inequality on a global scale, HLD advocates for the rapid development and liberation of humanity. With a firm commitment to international solidarity, HLD aims to empower marginalized communities and foster socio-economic equality.

Looking ahead, Human Liberation and Development aims to expand its global influence, deepen its impact on socio-economic inequalities, and inspire a new wave of revolutionary change worldwide.
