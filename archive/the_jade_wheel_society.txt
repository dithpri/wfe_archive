For those that follow in the footsteps of the fallen, there is the Society.

The fallen are not a person, a being, or a group, but an idea.

Those we have lost, for any reason, are our fallen, and by following their footsteps, we honor them.

Perhaps...  Perhaps we rise from our own ashes.  Time shall tell.  For now...  Watch us closely, we may come back with a vengeance.
