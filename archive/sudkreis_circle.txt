Carved from the remnants of Imperial Paloni, a vassal state of the Waldenburg Empire, the Sudkreis Circle was freed from Imperial Control and split into many smaller states. These states gained nominal independence or were subject to overlords and empires. A Confederation of Independent States was formed under Wissenholm und Himmel to create the Sudkreis Konfederation, with the Duke of Wissenholm elevated to the status of Vizkaiser of the Confederation, in an attempt to establish self-determination under a regional power for the people of the Sudkreis Circle.
