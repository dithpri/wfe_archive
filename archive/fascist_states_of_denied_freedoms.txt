The [b]Fascist States of Denied Freedoms[/b] (FSoDF) was founded in 1978 following the ending of a multinational conflict.

Each major power was to return annexed land back to the locals and return to their respective borders.
Each nation has ways of keeping their citizens in check via means not fit for a democracy.

Any breach of borders with NPCs are in direct violation of the peace treaty and will be void.
A void treaty would causs an escalation to hostilities once again.

Trade routes between major powers are still under negotiation as of 2014.

Game will be played on the FSoDF forums.
