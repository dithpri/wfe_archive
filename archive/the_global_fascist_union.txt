The Global Fascist Union (the GFU) is a coalition of all states right, conservative and ultranationalist. 

Recently the rise of the left has put shame to fascists everywhere, people who simply believe in the rights to their own country and deem themselves proud of their own heritage. 

Our aim is to produce a collective, a center for which the oppressed oppressors of the world may stand to be the equal height of the left. 

Industry is largely central to our expansionist ideals, but also the environment (the true fatherland), the education and the unity that alliance fortifies in our dominion.
