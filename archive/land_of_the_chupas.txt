     We are the land of the Chupas, founded by the all mighty nation of Chupa-land. We house the most number of chupas and chupacabras in the entire universe!!! If you love chupas and/or chupacabras, then the land of chupas is for you. Our national parks are home to not just chupas, but also to Chimeras, Hippogryphs, Gryphons, Dragons, Unicorns, Pegasuses, Rocs, Kracken, and even Giants. Originally built as an island meant to stash away food, drinks, ammo, and other supplies for the troops during the war of 1765. The peoples later left due to the fact that the island held so many mythological creatures. So welcome all to the land of the Chupas!!!
