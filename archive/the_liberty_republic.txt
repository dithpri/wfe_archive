&amp;#9775;&amp;#9775;&amp;#9775; [region]The Liberty Republic[/region] is a leftist, libertarian utopia, a place for kindness and decency, and where there are no rules on a kind of nation that you have to be.&amp;#9775;&amp;#9775;&amp;#9775;
[b]If you are left-wing, then this is the place for you.
If you are centrist, then you will like this region, 
and if you are right-wing, then, you might like it? I don&#39;t know.[/b]

If you don&#39;t like it, then it&#39;s on you. But there is one rule. Absolutely no Fascism. Why? Because after Fascism comes oppression and death, and that is outlawed here. I hope you enjoy your time here!
