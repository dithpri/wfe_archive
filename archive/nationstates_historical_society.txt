The NationStates Historical Society is a place for people to discuss, debate, and learn history. Any and all subjects are welcome, and anyone who has a love for history is encouraged to get involved in discussion, ask questions, or simply share an interesting fact. Weather you&#39;re an expert on the battlefields of World War II, knowledgeable in the whole of the Romantic period, or looking to learn a thing or two, here you&#39;ll find a like-minded and welcoming group of history enthusiasts. 

Thesis: As historians it is our duty to preserve and tell the truth for those who are no longer able.
