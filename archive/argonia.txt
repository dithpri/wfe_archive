[B]Argonia stands at the pinnacle of roleplay and economic gameplay alike.  New nations should visit the Tower of Loyalty and register as citizens on our [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Realms]Community Forum[/url].  

As a member of our great Kingdom, we shall demonstrate our power and unity by joining the World Assembly and endorsing one another.

Currently we are developing our realm constitution in the [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Realms/forum/5039407/]Habitus[/url] section of the forum. Also, we need to develop an economic system for the entire Kingdom to enjoy.  Discuss this at [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Realms/topic/10095488/]The Balmoral Bank[/url].[/b]
