Argonia resulted from a growing bond between the Fire Holders of Bogia and Amphibiatitas. This resulted in alliance and then the acquisition of territory. This new region is geared towards economy and military, following operation &#39;Desert Storm&#39; before Argonia was created. Desert Storm was caused by a small nation stealing Bogia&#39;s tourists and forcing them into diamond mining labor. This nation was soon wiped off the map and their territory became the beginnings of Argonia. Argonia is situated between a jungle, swamp, and the ocean. The leaders of Argonia are situated in The Argonian Counsil.
