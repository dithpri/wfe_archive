[B]Argonia stands at the pinnacle of roleplay and economic gameplay alike.  New nations should visit the Tower of Loyalty and register as citizens on our [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Realms]Community Forum[/url].  

We are trying to create a Royal Senate. All noble citizens of Argonia may vote. The Chancellor elected to office with the advice and consent of the Monarch shall head the Cabinet appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. Join now!!
