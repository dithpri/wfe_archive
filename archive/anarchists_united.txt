[color=#ED4719]The state just happened to be in the neighborhood during a fine update on 1/12/25, and found this fascist holding with the door unlocked. It was subsequently seized and destroyed. It was previously owned by [region]International Blackshirts[/region], successor state of [region]Rhodesia 2[/region]. I haven&#146;t really been participating in the turkey shoot of these regions, but I figured that since I was online during the update this one CTEd on, I may as well take one for myself![/color]
