[B][color=red]Hamas is regularly described as &#39;Iranian-backed Hamas, which is dedicated to the destruction of Israel.&#39; One will be hard put to find something like &#39;democratically elected Hamas, which has long been calling for a two-state settlement in accord with the international consensus&#39;&#151;blocked for over 30 years by the US and Israel. All true, but not a useful contribution to the Party Line, hence dispensable.[/color]
