   Founded by Garrington, the massive, scientific marvel of Waffenmacht, translating to &amp;#39;Might of Weapons&amp;#39; is a floating near-Utopian city that travels around the would by sea. It can detach itself from the ocean&amp;#39;s surface, and relocate. With low crime rates, hard working citizens, and reasonable taxes, this region-sized, mobile city would be a PERFECT home for your nation!
