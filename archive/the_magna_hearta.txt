By the grace of the King of Balder, the Emperor of the New Pacific Order, and the Royal Platypus of the West Pacific, to their Ministers, Senators, Guardians, servants, and to all their officials and loyal citizens, welcome to the Magna Hearta! 

The Magna Hearta is a week-long, on-site event hosted by the Pacific, the West Pacific, and Balder to express our undying love for one another! Cheesy, I know. Why not dump a puppet in and join the fun on the RMB! Just make sure to answer those issues.

It&#146;s also encouraged that you join our regional discords!
