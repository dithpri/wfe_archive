- Foundation: September 4, 2018

- The Indian Ocean is the third largest oceanic division in the world
- The volume of the ocean is estimated at 292,131,000 km&sup3; (70,086,000 mi&sup3;).
- The Indian Ocean is much calmer, and therefore more suitable for trade than the Atlantic 
 and Pacific oceans. The strong monsoons made the ships easy to sail westward in the 
 favorable season, and after a few months made their way back
