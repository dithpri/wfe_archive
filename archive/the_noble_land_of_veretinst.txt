
I am Death,
I am Pain,
I am the one who will ruin your reign.
I am Death,
I am War,
I am the sum of all fears and more.
I am Death,
You are weak,
I hide pleasure where you&amp;#39;ll not seek.
I am Death,
I am not contained,
I am the one that no man can tame.
I am Death,
I am Gloom,
I am the shadow lurking in your room.
I am Death,
I am War,
I am the disease knocking at your door.
I am Death,
Your time has come,
For this final battle I&amp;#39;ve already won.
