Under a disarray of weather patterns, the region known as &amp;quot;Pacem Archipelago&amp;quot; is a small string of islands; each island is identified as a nation. Nations may work with one another to be at their best or engage in diplomatic disagreements, but war between nations in the region is strictly forbidden because of the more pressing matters that nations may need to worry about, such as the region&amp;#39;s unpredictable weather. All nations within the region are encouraged to lead their people as they please, however, they are also encouraged to demonstrate a greater value for their environment as opposed to the possible profits from that which could be gained from abusing local resources. Create alliances and make friends in Pacem Archipelago!
