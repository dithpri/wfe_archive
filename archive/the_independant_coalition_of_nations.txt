Founded by Riiser-Larsen, ICN is a unified alliance of separate and growing states. We offer military protection for nations which have outgrown the feeders, but are not yet large enough to defend themselves against the raiding alliances that form at higher ranks. There are no policy requirements for entering; debate is encouraged.
