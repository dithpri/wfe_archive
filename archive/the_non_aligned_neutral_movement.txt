For those nations that see the light and endorse neutrality in any conflict and do not see the usefulness or supporting a particular alliance in times of international tension. The Movement does not support any particular kind of domestic policy. All that we require is a passive and non-militarist approach in foreign policy. While we certainly don&amp;#39;t prohibit the creation of an army, we must urge nations to refrain from using it.
