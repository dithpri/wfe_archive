The [color=blue]Region of Virilus[/color] is a region founded by the Republic of Quardevon. The Region of Virilus is commited to world peace, and we like counseling more than prison for the solutions to social problems polices usually has (but no matter what, if the problem is just to much, the troublemaker would go to prison.) We are also fair, and we do not usually take sides. In fact, we support all both sides in the World Assembly. If any region is in trouble or is facing a problem, contact The Region of Virilus as we are here to help. We also have a resolution that we will be one of the top regions in the World Census reports. So, if you feel like what we have mention above, than feel free to join us! Let&amp;#39;s make the world a better place.
