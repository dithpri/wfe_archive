[b]The Interstellar Concordat[/b] is a loose association of civilizations spanning multiple star systems, bound together by a mutual desire to engage in commerce, communicate between one another and share scientific, technological and cultural knowledge between themselves. 

Membership in the Concordat is voluntary, and although the organisation has branches for the disciplined study of humanity&#39;s cultural heritage throughout the galaxy, it does not force any particular social or moral position upon its member civilizations. [b]Earth[/b], the birthplace of humanity, is the ceremonial centre of the organisation.

The Concordat uses the [b]metric system[/b] and [b]Earth-length day[/b], and its official languages are [b]Latin, Classical Arabic, Mandarin, Sanskrit and English[/b].
