    Welcome to Nilfgaard. This region is made by Medicare players to new people, but also for experienced players. 
    This region takes place in the world of the Witcher. But in the modern era. To explain:
The empire of nilfgaard is a southern superpower of the continent. Its made out of small, or bigger provinces. Its devided from the northern Kingdoms by the Jaruga river.
