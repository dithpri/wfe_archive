Ghetto World is an immense planet in the Typhon Expanse on the very edge of the known Galaxy.  The planet is home to numerous nations, tribes, and clans whose combined populations number in the billions.  Yet, due to the size of the planet, just 16% of it&#39;s surface is inhabited.

Ghetto World has three moons:  Sembla, Sita, and Nogira.  None have as yet been settled.  The planet&#39;s sun is approximately 113 million miles away, making the planet predominantly cold, ice caps covering the huge mountain ranges 10 months out of their solar year.  

Many of the nations are at a virtual state of war with other nations.  National borders shift constantly while citizens suffer hunger and disease.
