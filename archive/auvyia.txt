[spoiler=About Auvyia]
Auvyia, the largest moon of [region]Declansburg[/region], dominates the night sky from the home planet. While Declansburg grew, the D&aacute;xlamic Church was hard at work terraforming Auvyia in preparation of an inevitable day that has come to pass. Auvyia is open for business.

This region should house puppets only. Nations MUST be residing in Declansburg to achieve placement on Auvyia&#39;s map.[/spoiler]
