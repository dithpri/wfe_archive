The Arctic Scientific and Defense Alliance (ASDA for short.) is an alliance of Nations with the aim to further
humanity into its future by oppressing its peoples, crushing its opponents, seizing the means of production and generally being an asshole towards all things democratic. Want to found a company? There&#39;s the door, buddy. Care for civil liberties? Guards, take this one to the mines. You get the idea. 

So, interested in ASDA and its totally friendly and democratic values? Join today!
