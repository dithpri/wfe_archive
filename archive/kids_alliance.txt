We are an alliance standing up for youth culture rights, the rights of under 18s and promotion of the modern world globally and countering the influence of traditionalism around the world. Our alliance will promote modernist values and take on those who believe that kids (under 18s) must conform to the ideas of the past, that social media should be restricted, those who believe that freedom of expression is a casual privilege, rather than the human right it is. We will also stand up for adults, ensuring that they have a high number of weeks of vacation a year, to spend time with family. We will conduct operations and defend the world against the biggest threat to freedom and individualism we have ever faced- traditionalism and Goveism.
