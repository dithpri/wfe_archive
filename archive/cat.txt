[nation]Farlord[/nation] is a ninny. But a good one, with a good flag too. 1 tuna for her. And a box - only the [i]finest[/i] cardboard. Hope you like the regional flag ;)

[nation]Psuedopolis[/nation]&#39;s sleepy head couldn&#39;t make it so he&#39;s a dork. No tunas!

[nation]Drexlore[/nation] did me a solid, but not a snake. Oh well. 1 tuna.

[nation]Rigels Light[/nation] did her best. 2 tuna for her!

[nation]Serboro[/nation] and [nation]Lady Dominator[/nation] helped me gather the catnip. Thanks! You&#39;ve earned a pile of salmon each.

This is [nation]Ever-Wandering Souls[/nation]. This place needed more than a boring old tag. So I got some friends and made it happen. =^u^=
