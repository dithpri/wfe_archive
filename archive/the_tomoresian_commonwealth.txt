Welcome to [region]The Tomoresian Commonwealth[/region].  Our main focus in this Commonwealth is freedom, but not without law and order, hence our motto &quot;Liberum est ex multis&quot;.

This region is governed by a body of elected officials, which you may see below.

A Constitution is currently being composed as well.
