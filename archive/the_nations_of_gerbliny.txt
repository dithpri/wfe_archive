the newest region in town, The nations of Gerbliny, is right for any new players who want some support and anyone who wants to talk and interact a bit about our fictitious countries. i know i do because it can help keep me happy talking about things i wish could happen in an alternate universe during this depressing year. i hope to see you here soon!
