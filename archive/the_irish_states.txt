

Ireland


Ireland, Ireland
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We&#39;ll answer Ireland&#39;s call!

Come the day and come the hour
Some will live in song and story
We were born to follow our guiding star
And to beat our destiny with glory

Ireland, Ireland
Together standing tall
Shoulder to shoulder
We&#39;ll answer Ireland&#39;s call!
