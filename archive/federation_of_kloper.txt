The Federation of Kloper is a region founded to provide an enriching experience and a break from the usual regions that are not very newbie-friendly. The region is in the process of expansion, and numerous offices are vacant. Further, in an attempt to change the way things are managed, we have set up a Parliament to discuss matters freely, and will mull a move to discord soon. Nations are also assigned liaison offices by which they may represent the Federation in telegrams.
