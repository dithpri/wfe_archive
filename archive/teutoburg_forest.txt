
ATTENTION TEUTOBURGIANS: We as a region are in danger.
Tomorrow the Zombie Horde will descend upon us. We must be ready to deal with this onslaught.
When this begins we have a choice of three options for what to do.
Exterminate( the Zombies )

Develop a cure( can potentially increase our regions population and cure Zombies)

and lastly JOIN THE ZOMBIES (THIS IS TO NEVER BE CHOSEN) for the safety of the region I will ban any and all who choose this option.

For the Research:Capitalist Nation of Money, Ducky McDuck Duck, The Enlightened, Vorparian, Claudiatopia, Hrafnhalla, Poo Planet
