The Segregated States of Karawatha are the collected nations that are in the Karawatha region. As the title says, these states are segregated and find it hard to come to a decision on issues because they are in near-constant warfare. Sadly, this region is exclusive for the nations that reside in the Karawatha region, which include the Holy Empire of Hunablu Tribe, the Combined Case Empire, the People&#39;s Republic of Iowhiera and the United Socialist States of Quanteloupe.
