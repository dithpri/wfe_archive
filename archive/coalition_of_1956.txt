Formed originally as an alliance between the two nations of Mazhakurrapu and Vezhuvamkulan, the Coalition of 1956 is founded off of principles of self-justification, peace, and equality for all. True, nations may have disagreements off of ideological reasons, but the Coalition mandates peace - Mazhakurrapu and Vezhuvamkulan are very opposite nations yet they founded the coalition.
