Voidpocket is a personal region. Every nation in it is under the same user. This region is only a vessel for a user&#39;s creative exercise, and doesn&#39;t hold any interests in typical interaction between regions. The region represents a continuity for the nations within, excepting the founder nation [nation]Moving Minds[/nation], which is its own continuity and should be considered &quot;non-canon&quot; relative to the other nations in the region.
