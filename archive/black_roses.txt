[color=fire]Welcome to Black Roses, a frontier managed by The Raiders Commune. This region was formerly successor to [region]Roses[/region] [/color][color=darkred]Without Thorns[/color][color=fire], a region that harbored fascists. It has been seized by The Raiders Commune in our fight against fascism. Please endorse the WA delegate [nation]the wilted rose[/nation].

Thank you to the following regions for helping us take over this oppressive regime:
[region]SAT words[/region], [region]New Chiken[/region], [region]Chicken Army[/region], [region]land of Clos[/region]

&amp;#9773;GLORY TO THE COMMUNE&amp;#9773;[/b][/color]
