[color=FF4000]Welcome to Black Roses, an autonomous oblast of The Raiders Commune. This region was formerly successor to [region]Roses[/region] [/color][color=darkred]Without Thorns[/color][color=BF0000], a region that harbored fascists. It has been seized by The Raiders Commune in our fight against fascism.

[b]Black Roses is currently undergoing a transitional government while The Wilted Rose becomes governor.[/b].

Thank you to the following regions for helping us take over this oppressive regime:
[region]SAT words[/region], [region]New Chiken[/region], [region]Chicken Army[/region], [region]land of Clos[/region] (now [region]Shiny[/region]), [b][region]The Raiders Commune[/region]

&amp;#9773;GLORY TO THE COMMUNE&amp;#9773;[/b][/color]
