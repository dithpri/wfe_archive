[color=fire]Welcome to Black Roses, an autonomous oblast of The Raiders Commune. This region was formerly successor to [region]Roses[/region] [/color][color=darkred]Without Thorns[/color][color=fire], a region that harbored fascists. It has been seized by The Raiders Commune in our fight against fascism.

&amp;#128263;NO MESSAGES ARE PERMITTED ON THE RMB, AS IT TAKES MORE INFLUENCE TO APPOINT A GOVERNOR THE MORE NATIONS ARE IN THE REGION. REGIONAL OFFICERS ARE PERMITTED TO EJECT ANY NATION THAT IS NOT EITHER A REGIONAL OFFICER OR ENDORSING THE WILTED ROSE.&amp;#128277;

Thank you to the following regions for helping us take over this oppressive regime:
[region]SAT words[/region], [region]New Chiken[/region], [region]Chicken Army[/region], [region]land of Clos[/region], [b][region]The Raiders Commune[/region][/b]

&amp;#9773;GLORY TO THE COMMUNE&amp;#9773;[/b][/color]
