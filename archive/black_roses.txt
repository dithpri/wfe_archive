[b][color=black]There is strong evidence of this region being connected to the government-in-exile of RWOT. A &amp;#9762;&amp;#65039;   Quarantine Zone &amp;#9762;&amp;#65039; is being set up for investigation.[/color][/b]
[color=fire][b]This region was successor to [region]Roses[/region] [/color][color=darkred]Without Thorns[/color][color=fire], a region that harbored fascists. It has been seized by The Raiders Commune in our fight against fascism. Please endorse the WA delegate [nation]NotKwen[/nation].

Thank you to the following regions for helping us take over this oppressive regime:
[region]SAT words[/region], [region]New Chiken[/region], [region]Chicken Army[/region], [region]land of Clos[/region]

Do not attempt to defend this tyranny of authoritarianism.

&amp;#9773;GLORY TO THE COMMUNE&amp;#9773;[/b][/color]
