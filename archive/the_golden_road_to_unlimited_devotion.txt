Throughout the civilised world the teachings of Marx evoke the utmost hostility and hatred of all bourgeois science (both official and liberal), which regards Marxism as a kind of &#147;pernicious sect&#148;. And no other attitude is to be expected, for there can be no &#147;impartial&#148; social science in a society based on class struggle. In one way or another, all official and liberal science defends wage-slavery, whereas Marxism has declared relentless war on that slavery. To expect science to be impartial in a wage-slave society is as foolishly na&iuml;ve as to expect impartiality from manufacturers on the question of whether workers&#146; wages ought not to be increased by decreasing the profits of capital.
