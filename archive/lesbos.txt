According to Classical Greek mythology, Lesbos was the patron god of the island. Macar was reputedly the first king whose many daughters bequeathed their names to some of the present larger towns.

Homer refers to the island as &quot;Macaros edos&quot;, the seat of Macar.

The word [i]lesbian[/i] is derived from the name of [b]Lesbos[/b], a Greek island in the northeastern Aegean Sea. It was home to the lyric poet Sappho. She wrote about women&#39;s daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on feminine beauty and proclaimed her love for girls.
