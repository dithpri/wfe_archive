We believe that joining the World Assembly is the only way to get any influence in this game. This is bad as people don&amp;#39;t want to follow the rules of the World Assembly but have not choice if they want to succeed. We want the World Assembly to only be a guideline. We also want other International organisations that create laws as well implemented.
I know the [nation=short]Federation of Sparta [/nation] and [nation=short]Jeff INC[/nation] are trying to employ you but please, if you want influence and power, stay here, and endorse me: [nation=short]Illtopilosia[/nation]
