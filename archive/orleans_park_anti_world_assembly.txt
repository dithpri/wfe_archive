We believe that joining the World Assembly is the only way to get any influence in this game. This is bad as people don&amp;#39;t want to follow the rules of the World Assembly but have not choice if they want to succeed. We want the World Assembly to only be a guideline. We also want other International organisations that create laws as well implemented.
