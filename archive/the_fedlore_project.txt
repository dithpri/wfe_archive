So everyone in the [region]Free Market Federation[/region] has their own lore for their nation. To those people, please consider the possibility of an alternate universe where the nations of all contributing FMF nations have their own lore woven into a shared universe: we each have our Prime Universe, but also this shared universe - The FedLore. 

Every week, a poll will be posted on this region that will slowly lay out the building blocks of this shared setting. How big is the explored universe and how big is the FMF? Has alien life been found? What happened to Earth? We will answer these and any other basic questions before moving on to the complex topics that require less a multiple-choice and more of a true debate. 

Let&#39;s build this setting together!
