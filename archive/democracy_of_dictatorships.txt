Here is the tale of the [region]Democracy of Dictatorships[/region]

There once was a nation called [nation]DuB NuB[/nation].
Who found he could create a region.
He threatened the great Carson,
and left to form this region.

The boy realised it was a failure,
and came crawling back.
But Carson was not so forgiving.
So he was sent to [region]The Land Of Disappointments[/region]

Now this place is a lesson,
to all who threaten Carson.

[b]Hail Carson the Great and [nation]Carstantinopipal[/nation]![/b]
