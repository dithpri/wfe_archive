Hello, welcome to Barbequed chickens where I couldn&#39;t decide on a region name so I chose Barbequed chickens. I&#39;m not sure if I can trust you to not raid my region (founder has executive authority).

Note I know you see the WA delegate as powerless but this is to stop raiding in its steps, if the WA delegate is trustworthy I can make a custom role for them with the proper powers

I really don&#39;t know what to place in here... uhh please endorse [nation]Australia-New Zealand[/nation]. Thanks!

Stats:
Founded: January 15, 2023
First WA delegate: never had one
Aussie-Canuck power balance: Canadian domination (100% canadians here)
