Hello, welcome to Barbequed chickens where I couldn&#39;t decide on a region name so I chose Barbequed chickens. I&#39;m not sure if I can trust you to not raid my region (founder has executive authority).

I really don&#39;t know what to place in here... uhh please endorse [nation]Australia-New Zealand[/nation]. Thanks!
