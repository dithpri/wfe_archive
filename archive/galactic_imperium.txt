Welcome to The Galactic Imperium! An interstellar empire founded on two basic principles, [b]Might Makes Right[/b] and [b]Only The Strong Survive[/b].  Within The Galactic Imperium fanatical religious sects convert worlds by force of arms and powerful lords vie with each other and the clergy for control of the imperial senate, and ultimately the Imperium. Do you have what it takes to make it here?
