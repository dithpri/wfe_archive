Salvete!
We aren&#39;t too peaceful, we aren&#39;t too democratic. What we are is stabilizing, a &#39;little&#39; controlling, socialists with a desire to stomp any wrongdoers yet keep regional peace with educated minds and stifling laws. While most of our emper... um, leaders are borderline autocrats, they still look to the people for the ideas that help keep our countries running as smooth and clean as possible.
Seriously, it&#39;s not all bad.
We live by the big three laws(idioms)
1 - Speak softly and carry a Big Stick
2 - An eye for an eye
3 - Trust No One
But stay green, stay clean, stay strong, and stay here.
