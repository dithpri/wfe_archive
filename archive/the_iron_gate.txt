Former WFE:

&quot;Our forefathers purified the soil with their blood when they fought the savage forces that held this land in bondage. These forces of darkness were never defeated and now they are attacking the gate of our civilisation. But it is a great gate, a gate forged with the strength of iron and the blood of our fathers. When you think of this Iron Gate, think with your blood! Blood and Soil! Blut und Boden!&quot; - Hans Beckmann, Blood and Soil: My Struggle for the Afrikaner Nation
