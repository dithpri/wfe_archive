[color=crimson]There&#39;s an apple in the p*ssy mouth
Now I am the dinner whore
There&#39;s a tumor in the TV mouth
Burn it out before it grows

Someone better get the dog to kick
Jaws wired shut to save the d*ck
Out of the bottomless pit
Comes the little horn

Little horn is born
Little horn is born
Little horn is born
Little horn is born

The world spreads its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar
