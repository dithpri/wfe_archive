[color=crimson]A loved one laid his head on her lap
red roses fell to the floor
and the world, stood still

My mouth was a crib and it was growing lies
I didn&#39;t know what love was on that day
my heart&#39;s a tiny bloodclot
I picked at it
it never heals it never goes away

I burned all the good things in The Eden Eye
we were too dumb to run too dead to die

This was never my world
you took the angel away
I&#39;d kill myself to make everybody pay
This was never my world
you took the angel away
I&#39;d kill myself to make everybody pay
