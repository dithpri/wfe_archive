This is a region for those displaced by or irritated by the raid by the Black Hawks. This is a Tolkien themed region, so feel free to discuss LOTR or whatever pops into your head on the RMB.
Vedui&#39; il&#39;er, saesa omentien lle.&quot; Translated from elvish this means &quot;greetings everyone, pleasure meeting you.&quot; So feel free to chill here till the raid ends.
