Long ago, the nations lives together in harmony.  Then, everything changed when Nymareg attacked.

Only the Mier, master of the last few regions could stop him.  But when the world needed him most, he vanished.

Years past, and we discovered the new founder, an Asian named Worm.  And although his lamp skills are great, he&#39;s got a lot to learn before he&#39;s ready to found anything.

But I believe, Worm can save the world.[/i][/color]
