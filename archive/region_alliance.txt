The Region Alliance is a federal government for other regions. [color=red][b]Join the alliance today![/b][/color]  Simply submit an embassy request!  
Embassy requests are only accepted from regions who desire to participate in this alliance.

[color=orange]Once the embassy is established your region will become a state within our alliance, and we use the message boards to run government.  This way we can all participate in a higher level government without having to leave our home region.[/color]
