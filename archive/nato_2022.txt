Hello darkness, my old friend
I&#39;ve come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence&#133;

You can blame [nation]Sultanate of Turkey[/nation]&#133;

And [region]The Rhineland[/region].
