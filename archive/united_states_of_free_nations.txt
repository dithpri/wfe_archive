This region is a new region in which Democratic process, rule of law, and certain economic freedoms must be adhered to.

We welcome all new nations to this point and are looking to build a community where WA elections are held regularly, where Democratic process and respect exist, and where the region may live beyond one ruler or nation.

All are welcome to participate the forming of a new regional government through vigorous debate and participation.

Join us in true fun and discourse instead of being locked out of larger regions.
