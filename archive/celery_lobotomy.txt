If you are reading this, then there is a very good chance you have been visited by the erascible Sandkickers. Make sure to move out of your regions to safer ones, for we wouldn&#39;t want to hand you the disgrace of being banjected to [region=The Rejected Realms]. Thank you for hosting our group, and have fun in either the new region you moved to or The Rejected Realms. Of course, no Nazi or Fascist region is safe from us.

And savor the honor of being lobotomized by [region=Ruining Nazi Sandcastles]!
