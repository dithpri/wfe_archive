[b]Welcome to The Union of Allied States[/b]

We are a region of compassionate people. We are respectful and welcoming. 

At the moment no government is in place due to the lack of nations, however the first three nations here including myself will join The Allied Council that will lead the region through it&amp;#39;s early stages so a constitution can be set up and the foundation for a real regional government can laid out.

So come join and help our region grow.
