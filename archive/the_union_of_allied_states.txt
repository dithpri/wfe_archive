[b]Welcome to The Union of Allied States[/b]

We are a region of compassionate people. We are respectful and welcoming. 

Currently our region is run by a three person council called The Allied Council, which is located on the forums. The council has helped lay the foundation for the region down, it has decided some new laws that will be put forward to the new government as well as how the region will be run. On 12th October the council will be disbanded ready to make way for the new regional government that take power a few days later.

So come join and help our region grow.
