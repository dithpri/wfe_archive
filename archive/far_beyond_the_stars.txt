[b]Quote of the Day[/b]:
&quot;[i]All right. It&#39;s instinctive. But the instinct can be fought. We&#39;re human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands, but we can stop it. We can admit that we&#39;re killers, but we&#39;re not going to kill today. That&#39;s all it takes. Knowing that we won&#39;t kill today. Peace or utter destruction, it is up to you.[/i]&quot;
