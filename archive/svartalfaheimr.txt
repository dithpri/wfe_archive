In Norse cosmology, svart&aacute;lfar, also called myrk&aacute;lfar, are beings who dwell in Svartalfheim or Svart&aacute;lfaheimr (home of the black-elves). Both the svart&aacute;lfar and Svart&aacute;lfaheimr are primarily attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholars have noted that the svart&aacute;lfar appear to be synonymous with the dwarfs and potentially also the d&ouml;kk&aacute;lfar (dark elves). As dwarfs, the home of the svart&aacute;lfar could possibly be another description for Ni&eth;avellir (dark fields).
