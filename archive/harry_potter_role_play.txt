Come one, come all! We accept all people! Create your own character! An auror, a teacher, a criminal, or a student! We will have adventures to quest upon. But first we need people &amp; to have elections. Telegram me if you want to play. I need name, age, job, area of expertise. Thank You!

First polls will be government.

WA has my power &amp; can control Oliver Thoth, the Game Master who is knowledgeable about arithmancy, &amp; therefore will hand out quests/problems. 
Minister of Magic keeps things civil in region 
Head master fact checks &amp; offers knowledge
Map maker makes map (option position)

After, we will vote for what kind of role play we&#39;ll do. Taking requests now.
