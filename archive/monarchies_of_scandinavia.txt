We are a coalition of monarchies inhabiting the harsh and cold northern reaches of the world. We are hardy, fierce and proud. We are loyal to our monarchs, some of whom are elected, and some of whom have inherited their power. Many have constitutionally limited powers, and others have sweeping powers. In any case, we defend our countries and their traditions, and desire to defend our rights and yours in the World Assembly.
