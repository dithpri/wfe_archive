This region is only open to respectable, polite, peaceful, and above all, MAGICAL nations. If you have nothing nice to say, hold back your tongue and stop being so immature. Even if you do not agree with other&amp;#39;s policies, we respect others, and everyone is entitled to an opinion as long as they do not attempt to force it onto you. We of the UMN would be honoured to have your nation join us. I thank you for taking the time to consider joining us and reading this, and I hope you join us in the UMN. We may seem strict, but after a time, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll come  to see that we all enjoy a good  Disco Pogo~! Caz du: Thank you: Merci
