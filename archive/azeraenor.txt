Path of Pride 
Anthem of Azeraenor

Soldiers are we,
Whose lives are pledged to Azeraenor.

All exclaim in unison,
Enough of this slavery!

The hoarfrost of morning which tounted those years,
Thy sun rising high, shall command!

Now the arrow flew
Over our devoted heads;
Or the yoke we knew,
Which a free-born nation dreads.

Let us join in a cohort,
We are ready to die.

On our sepulcher of ages
Breaks the resurrection morn,
From the slough of direst slavery
Azeraenor anew is born.

Home to great daughters and sons.

Up above the young river
Lies Azeraenor, resting
On mountain heights.
