[u][b]The Free Utopia[/b][/u]
[color=gold][i]&#147;Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!&#148;
- New Colossus, Emma Lazarus[/i][/color]

Come to our valleys, our mountains, our plains and rolling hills. Run in the fields of gold, swim in the streams of hope, come one, come all, to our family here. We worship the sun, for it gives light, and with that light, we give love. Come to the Free Utopia, and you shall be free.
