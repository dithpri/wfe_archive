Since 2011 the band has been on hiatus, with each of the members having pursued other things in the meantime. Miracle Musical was a spin-off of Tally Hall by [color=red]Joe,[/color] [color=gray]Ross,[/color] and [color=ff8000]Bora.[/color] On December 12, 2012 they released their only album, Hawaii: Part II, which plays like a musical. We are a region dedicated to Tally Hall, Miracle Musical, and the members of both.
