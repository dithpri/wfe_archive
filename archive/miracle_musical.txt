Tally Hall was a band formed in late 2002. Made up of five people distinguished by the color of their ties, the band members are [color=red]Joe Hawley[/color], [color=yellow]Rob Cantor[/color], [color=green]Andrew Horowitz[/color], [color=blue]Zubin Sedghi[/color], [color=gray]Ross Federman[/color], and the &quot;honorary member&quot; [color=orange]Bora Karaca[/color]. Since 2011 the band has been on an indefinite hiatus. Miracle Musical was a spin-off of Tally Hall by Joe, Ross, and Bora, with only one album titled &quot;Hawaii: Part II&quot;(released 2012) which plays like a musical. We are a region dedicated to Tally Hall, Miracle Musical, and its members.
