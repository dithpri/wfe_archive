[b][color=red]Welcome to Zerg![/color][/b] 

[b]Daily Reminder that our loving leader is [u] [nation=Terran_Flux].[/b] [/u] Anyone who has different ideals has to go to mandatory re-education camp over in the [region=The Rejected Realms]!

This region was formed from the ashes of the [b] [u] Protoss [/u] [/b] We have risen again with a new empire to build and to conquer the heathens and defend the worthy.

Feel free to come in and stay a while and chat in the RMB.

[color=red] Raiders [/color] and [color=blue] Defenders [/color] are welcome. After all it&#39;s all just about endorsements, so basically the same thing. (That doesn&#39;t mean raiding us as it is pointless because [nation=short]Terran_Flux[/nation] is the founder)

Embassy requests are accepted for like-minded regions.
