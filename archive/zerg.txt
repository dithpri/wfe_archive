[b][color=red]Welcome to Zerg![/color][/b] 

[b]Daily Reminder that our loving leader is [u] [nation=Terran_Flux].[/b] [/u] Anyone who has different ideals has to go to mandatory re-education camp over in the [region=The Rejected Realms]!


[color=red] Raiders [/color] and [color=blue] Defenders [/color] are welcome.

We don&#39;t often do raids because that requires effort. If you would like to plan one with us however. Feel free to telegram our raiding officer [nation=short]stonton[/nation]
