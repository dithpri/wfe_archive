[b][color=red]Welcome to Zerg![/color][/b] 

[b]Daily Reminder that our loving leader is [u] [nation=Terran_Flux].[/b] [/u] Anyone who has different ideals has to go to mandatory re-education camp over in the [region=The Rejected Realms]!

This region was formed from the ashes of the [b] [u] Protoss [/u] [/b] We have risen again with a new empire to build and to conquer the heathens and defend the worthy.
Anyone still there is blind to their own mistakes and are a false Protoss. The accounts are in fact puppets that [nation=short]Terran_Flux[/nation] gave away.

[hr] 

[color=red] Raiders [/color] and [color=blue] Defenders [/color] are welcome.
