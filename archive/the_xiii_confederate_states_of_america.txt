[b] [u] Deo Vindice! Arise, our Thirteen States to glory [/u] [/b]

December 1860, South Carolina secedes from the oppressive Union and births our glorious Confederacy; South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Missouri and Kentucky. The valorous states that saw past the Union&#146;s corruption! 

Now are we united with the pious men of the Ku Klux Klan to govern true America as it should have been governed. Free from Unionist corruption, integrationalist weakness, a vitiated gene pool, religious freedom and ubiquitous secularism. 

Deo Vindice!
