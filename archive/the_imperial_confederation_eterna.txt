[b]Welcome to the Imperial Confederation Eterna[/b].

[u]This Region is Empire/ Kingdom themed, and preserves the good aspects of such doctrines and serves as a League of Empires[/u].

[b]This Region is the current Seat of Power and Headquarters for the Asmorian Empire (formerly the Asmor Federation). Long Live the Emperor![/b]

The Asmor Federation was a collection of Remnants from broken states and fallen kingdoms that were unified into a Federal Kingdom, under the leadership of our Founder (A former warlord). Eventually the Federation was unable to hold together due to internal power struggles and attempted coupes, the A.F. has since been reorganized into the Asmorian Empire.
