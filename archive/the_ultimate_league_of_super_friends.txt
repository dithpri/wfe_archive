[region]The Ultimate League of Super Friends[/region] is a small regional island on a lake inside a ring shaped island off the coast of the worlds second favorite continent. This region is well known for a variety of rare island animals such as the Eurasian Clippy, the South American Clippy, and of course the untamed and ferocious Newark Clippy. Visitors to The Ultimate League of Super Friends often complain about the polluted waters and untamed wilds, but many wild animals have adapted to the region and cannot survive without the pollutants.
