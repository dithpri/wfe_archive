Phil&#146;s from the &#39;Sco , Jack&#146;s from the P.I
Horatio or Horat so big-eyed!
Tito Dick, &#147;Dickman&#148;, baby!
He raised Phil and loves the ladies
Jack&#146;s cool, he&#39;s lazy, he&#146;s still learnin&#146;
Otherwise Cherry Pie, he&#39;s still a virgin
Chita, meet the freak of the week-ah!
Phil&#146;s homegirl, got Jack wanna keep her
But it&#146;s not happenin&#146;, neither!
Shakin&#146; like a seizure
Hold up, let me spark this, take a breather
Breathe that reefer in my lungs
I got grapes, what you watchin&#146;, son?
