[color=lime][b]Welcome to Atlantis 42![/b][/color]

Atlantis 42 is not a region with specific beliefs! We are mainly concerned with the [color=green]$$$ ECONOMY $$$[/color] and discourage too many Political Freedoms or Civil Rights (though that&#39;s not the same thing as actually discouraging those rights). We are accepting of people of any [color=brown]ra[/color]ce, [color=pink]gen[/color][color=blue]der[/color], [color=red]se[/color][color=orange]x[/color][color=yellow]ua[/color][color=lime]l[/color][color=blue]i[/color][color=violet]ty[/color], etc. We don&#39;t believe that only [color=blue]Democrats[/color] should be welcome, nor do we believe that only [color=red]Republicans[/color] should be welcome. This is a region without bias; the [color=gold]perfect[/color] kind of region.
