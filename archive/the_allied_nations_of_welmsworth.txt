Here in Welmsworth, every nation has a right to a say in how the region is run, and no nation is left without any power! How do we accomplish this, you may ask? It&#39;s simple! Our region has an official [color=#0040FF][i]Parliament[/i][/color] and [i][color=#0040FF]Supreme Court![/color][/i] Every nation except for the Founder and WA Delegate has a position in Parliament, and every officer nation has a position in the Supreme Court!

So if you are just looking at the region, we highly recommend joining us! If not, then enjoy your day!
