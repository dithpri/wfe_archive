In Norse religion, Asgard is one of the Nine Worlds and home to the &AElig;sir tribe of gods. It is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a Hrimthurs riding the stallion Sva&eth;ilfari, according to Gylfaginning.
One of Asgard&#39;s well known locations is Valh&ouml;ll (Valhalla), in which Odin rules.
