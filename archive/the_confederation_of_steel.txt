We are a primarily a defensive pact. Our collective armies on standby to act in the event of any unprovoked aggression, external or from within. However, we are also cognizant of economic and political matters that affect our region and respective societies and are only too happy to see continued stability. We are committed to bolstering our alliance and supporting the world community at large.
