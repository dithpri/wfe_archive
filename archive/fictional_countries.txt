We are a community of nations that are based off of fictional universes such as 1984 or Denvio and or nations that are fan-fictions of different fandoms around the multiverse, for example the founder of this region, Stickminia, based their country off of Henry Stickmin.

We don&#39;t give a frick about what side of the compass you are on, as long as your nation is fictitious, you can join.

We don&#39;t have a discord and we probably won&#39;t ever.

We want this community to be friendly and welcoming to newer nations.
