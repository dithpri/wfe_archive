Our glorious planet is rich, profitably profiting off of wasteful trash dumping exchanges which take place on our region. The region wasn&#39;t much to begin with, but now we have beautiful toxic gas clouds, mountains of broken toilets, and seas of unidentifiable, but probably highly toxic, radioactive sludge. What&#39;s a little smog?
The official faction of Trashplanet is Einstein&#39;s Monsters.
