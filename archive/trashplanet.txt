Our glorious planet is rich, profitably profiting off of wasteful trash dumping exchanges which take place on our region. The region wasn&#39;t much to begin with, but now we have beautiful toxic gas clouds, mountains of broken toilets, and seas of unidentifiable, but probably highly toxic radioactive sludge. What&#39;s a little smog?
We have one place that doesn&#39;t collapse into a sea of oil at the slightest pressure, &quot;The Pinacle&quot; a great mountain, home to Zane Winchester Scott and the Grand Hivelet, Queen of all hivelets, small double headed eagles that can be black (Dark-Feathered) or white (Bright-Feathered) and the Grand Hivelet is a perfect gray, exactly half black and white.
