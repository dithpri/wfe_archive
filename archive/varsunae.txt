Inspiration for future proyects:

Varsunae is a similar society to Earth&#39;s, on the brink of ecological collapse. In a not so far future, the changes in atmosphere and mass extintions trigger the biological terraforming by a superior alien life form whose ethical conduct only allowed them to begin colonization after twinmanity destroyed its own home. This world&#39;s society sets the stage for the post-apocalypse.
