This barren and volatile landscape is dominated by vast chasms leading into oblivion and floating islands. It is highly dangerous to venture outside city walls, but cities do not guarantee safety. The landscape is constantly in flux, sometimes defying laws of physics and moving around. Pure energy crackles through the wilderness, leaving charred remains. Any life found is vast, terrible, and hungry. Even the flora has a taste for blood. Basically, it sucks.
