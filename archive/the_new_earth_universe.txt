The modern world has come to an end, following a series of increasingly cataclysmic conflicts. The earth as we knew it has now been taken over by a new era of politics, effectively sending us back to the age of Imperialism. This region starts in year 2045, with a 1:15 timescale (1 day in real life is 15 days in this region). All territory claims are on a first-come-first-serve basis. The pinned dispatches include information about the global &quot;Collapse&quot;, Second American Civil War, and the maps of the new earth.
