The Folkanders is a mainly Polish-speaking region that is a home for three coexisting nations. Its area includes the main island of Folkand and the archipelagos of small islands on the Folkandish Ocean called The Atlammes. The Atlammes are inhabited by rich immigrant families from Europe (mainly France, Germany and Russia). The Atlammes were divided into French, German and Russian Atlammes and belong to the Folkandish countries borders.
