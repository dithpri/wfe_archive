The Nation of Drthind collapsed after major protests and split into East and West. The East and West constantly fight over land. The war started to simmer down a bit, but battles still occur. Today it is split against the Drthind River in the middle of Drthind. All Drthindians hope one day Drthind will be united under one nation.
