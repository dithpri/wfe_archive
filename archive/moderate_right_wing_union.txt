This is a moderate conservative region based on political patriarchy , anti communism , anti nazism , anti feminism. 
This region likes to add nations who are anti left but not ultra right wing.

The interested nations should have these policies ( though they are not mandatory or hard and fast )

1. Abortion should be legal upto AGE OF VIABILITY. 
2. Sex education should be in educational curriculum.
3.There is no racial and religious bias of the state. 
4. Capitalism along with tech innovations must be inspired.
