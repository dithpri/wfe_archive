Terranima is in a state of emergency. Today, during a meeting of our Congress, A rebel group called the Red Serpents broke in. They were armed with Mini Uzis and AK-47&#39;s, and sent us an E-mail from the building. This message stated that if they don&#39;t get 30 million dollars by the end of the day, every member of congress will be shot. Plus, they said that a helicopter would be ready to pick them up as soon as they fired. The hostages are currently being held on the top floor at gunpoint. Our troops are on the way, but it will be a while until they arrive. I am asking any nations for help during this crisis.
