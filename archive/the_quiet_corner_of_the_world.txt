Welcome to [color=gold][b]The Quiet Corner of the World[/b][/color], where we all keep to ourselves and everyone is happy (theoretically)! :D You can be as antisocial as you want&#151;there&#39;s no pressure to participate in anything! :D This little place gives you all the aesthetic benefits of an ordinary region, but without the hassle of a community! :D

&#149; Do be polite if you actually decide to say something
&#149; Don&#39;t expect anyone to care
&#149; Do realize that this is the Internet and no one cares anyway
&#149; Don&#39;t feed the bears

Now hush, it&#39;s time for my nap. &#151;[nation]Introverted Ninja[/nation]
