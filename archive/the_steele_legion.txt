The Steele Legion is a region based on the principles of Order, Prosperity, and working for the Good of your Fellow Man. We operate according to an authoritarian system similar to the late Weimar Republic. We adhere to the ideology of Prussian Socialism, though other ideologies are tolerated if they do not interfere with the loyalty to the state.
