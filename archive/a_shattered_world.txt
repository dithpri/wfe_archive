In 2089 AD something happened. It has many names, the end result however was the same. The world was undone, and no institution survived it unscathed. It is now the year 2380 AD, civilization is on the up and up, slowly crawling from its near extinction centuries ago. It is a world of hardship, a world of chaos and disorder born in the shadow of the mushroom clouds of the Rain of Fire. A shattered, brave new world.
