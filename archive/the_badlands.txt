Welcome to The Badlands!

A brand new region for brand new players!

A relaxed, fun, and all around laid back atmosphere. No fuss with an offsite forum and no trials to go through to become a citizen (just show up). Nations here consist of funny nations created purely as a joke along with some more legitimate nations such as Right-Wing, Capitalist, Empires, and Dictatorships.

Open to legitimate political debate. Yes, we CAN be serious... Not often, but you know, sometimes. 

Welcome, and have fun.

Predomin&eacute; (President): Witahigo. For now...
WA ambassador: Could be you!.
