Welcome to the new and improved Badlands! You may remember The Badlands as the &quot;Casualty Capital of the West&quot;. The place that only a moron would live in. A place that is nothing but useless gravel fought over by two angry world-controlling twin brothers for over a hundred and twenty years. Well guess what, none of that dung is relevant here today! Mann Co. have obtained the entirety of this desert, and has many colorful plans ahead for it! We&#39;re going to turn all the sand and rocks here into a thriving, rich, beautiful place! So sit back, relax, and enjoy this pretty piece of land.
