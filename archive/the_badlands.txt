The Badlands is a brand new raiding region ([color=red]founded on 23 November 2012[/color]). The purpose is for member nations (non-WA nations) to receive instructions when a raid is initiated. When raids are ordered, members will move their WA nations into the nominated region and endorse the nation designated in the instructions.

No WA nations in this region. [b]Any WA nation joining here will be ejected and banned.[/b]

[color=red][b]All new nations joining are required to announce their arrival and identify their WA nation to be used in raids, in a telegram to [nation]Raidland[/nation].[/b][/color]
