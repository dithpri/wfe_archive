The Lonely Mountain, or [region]Erebor[/region], was a mountain in the north-east of Rhovanion. It was the source of the river Running and a major Dwarven stronghold, the Kingdom under the Mountain, at the end of the Third Age and well into the Fourth. 

With the awakening of [nation]Durins Bane[/nation] in the capital of [region]Khazad Dum[/region], [nation]Thrain I[/nation] led a group of Dwarves to [region]Erebor[/region]. Once there, the dwarves dug caves and halls to form an underground city, thus establishing the Kingdom under the Mountain in T.A. 1999. During Thr&aacute;in&#39;s rule many riches were mined from the depths of the mountain, including the [nation]Arkenstone[/nation]. The increased prosperity of the region led to the founding of the town of Dale, built by Men between its slopes.
