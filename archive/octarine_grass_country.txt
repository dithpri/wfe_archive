Famed for its sussurations of strangely-hued thaumic grasses, this region of Discworld is so called as a result of heavy magical background radiation in the area. The principal industry is agriculture. In particular, the region produces most the Disc&#39;s reannual  crops, which grow backwards in time - being harvested this year yet planted next year.
