The King Iohannes Ioseph of Ierosolyma has thus declared these to be the basic tenants of governance within the United Catholic Kingdoms:

 All monarchies, with the exception of &amp;quot;Queendoms&amp;quot;, are accepted within this region- any other forms of governments can be rejected at the whim of him who is in power.
Only male Catholic monarchs can be elected to the various offices of power within the United Catholic Kingdoms.
Catholic Theocracies are gladly welcomed, but cannot hold political offices of power, though their advising of monarchs will be considered and welcomed.
