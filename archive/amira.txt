The duty of the Communist Party is at once to begin
preparatory work for the coming class struggles, to prepare
the working class and the exploited masses for new
revolutionary struggles.... But in order to carry out this task,
it is necessary at once, without the loss of a single moment,
for time does not wait, to set about cleaning the Communist
Parties of the Right and conciliationist elements, who
objectively represent the agency of social-democracy within
the ranks of the Communist Party. And we must set about
this matter not at the usual pace, but at an accelerated pace,
for, I repeat, time does not wait and we must not allow events
to catch us unawares.
We mostly socialists
