The NEA is a new region, but nonetheless powerful. Intelligence is highly valued here, as is democracy and freedom. Nonetheless, anyone is invited to join. This is the land of no discrimination, where all ideas and opinion are valid. We are looking for a Map Maker and a Policy Adviser (people who are readily available to inform people of the right choices). WA Delegate must create his campaign in the forums. If you have suggestions or any questions, just send a telegram to [nation]Cesarean Isles[/nation]
