Exiled hated un loved its seems the battle is not worth it most days. To know you are fighting on the right side and yet you are criminalized by those who once stood beside you. the ones who you tried in vain to protect and in the end... What alone and Exiled. No longer am I scared of TBR I laugh to know that one person can scare them enough that they will force him out. the need for Vengeance makes one see and hear differently.
We are going to destroy TBR no matter the cost.
There is no more we it has come to only me
To my friends I am sorry
