[color=D90902][b]This region was initially founded on December 14 2016 as a union between [region]Axolotlum[/region] and [region]The Second Ridge of Badgers[/region]. It prospered for months until it was torn apart by treachery on March 6 2017 and handed off by the traitor-delegate [nation]The Sineth[/nation] to the thuggish anarcho-fascist reactionary terrorists of [region]Red Panda Land[/region]. It was recovered in a daring raid by the [region]Second Ridge of Bagders[/region] on March 9-10 2017.[/color][/b]
