Moo!
Hello, fellow nations, welcome to Cows And Fun, a region known for its required high civil rights and political freedom for entry. This is designed for neutral nations and free nations to seek a place of sanctuary.[region=United Sacadonia] was the main source of nations for a long time, before shifting to a better source, new nations, due to the insufficient civil rights and political freedom most nations had there.
Travellers Welcome!
