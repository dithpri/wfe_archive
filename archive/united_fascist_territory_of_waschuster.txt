[color=purple][b]Swish, Swish![/b] Never heard of the sounds of a blade cut through the air before? Now you have for some Assassins from [b][region]The Brotherhood of Malice[/region][/b] have come into your region swinging and snatching. It took some time and quite some effort, of course. The catgirl assassin leading it may have been stubbornly catfighting with her cat assistant among other opponents, but fortunately for you it looks like your gut caught a souvenir from our break in. That blade? You can keep it! We will just take our leave with this nice region of yours.

Want to give others some blades and stubbornly fight with cats? Then head out to [b][url=https://discord.gg/brotherhoodofmalice]our hideout[/url][/b].[/color]
