[color=gold][i][b]Welcome to the Kingdom of Germany![/color]

[color=navyblue]For a time we were a part of [region]The United Kingdom of the Netherlands[/region] from around 2013 to 2016. Later we were a part of the [region]Kingdom of Scotland[/region], off and on from 2020 to 2022. The inconsistency of this was due to the loss of access to the historical records of UKN. Since June 2024 we are once again a part of [region]the United Kingdom of the Netherlands[/region]. The Kingdom of Germany does not support any idealogy of hate.[/b][/i][/color]
