[b]The [region]Hellenic Empire[/region] saw this distant regions and found they looked better with some good art, so we decided to repaint your walls with something better. Something classic.

And there is nothing more classic than Hellenic people, so we thought that we should just splatter our classiness all over your grounds! No need to thank us, we do this for free!
