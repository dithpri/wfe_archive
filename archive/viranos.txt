[i]And the world comes tumbling down 
Cold kings clutch crumbling crowns 

Fires fade 
The dimming of the embers 
Wake from your sleep again 
Fires fade 
Wills of steel to temper 
Come reignite this hopeful flame[/i]

[b]Home and home again. Viranos was the last hurrah of the Talos Gang, the end of an era.

We moved on to start [url=https://discord.gg/eMRTry7]a new region[/url], but it was fun while it lasted. Maybe we&#39;ll be back some day - to sail the Mazarine, to indulge the fae,  to fight the Corruption, to reignite the flame.

Until then - see you, magic cowboys.[/b]
