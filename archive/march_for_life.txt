The March for Life is an annual event, but pro-life education and advocacy is important all year long.
Get Involved Today!
Since Roe v. Wade, over 62 million lives have been lost to legalized abortion. Join us on January 20, 2023 in Washington DC for the March for Life.
We promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion&#151;uniting, educating, and mobilizing pro-life people in the public square.
