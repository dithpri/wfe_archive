[b][color=cca002][region]Osiris[/region] and their buddies, [url=nationstates.net/region=the north pacific]the NPA[/url], came bursting through your door without permission!
That&#39;s right, we didn&#39;t even ask! We just broke in SWAT team style. Full force, like 16 people.[/color] [color=b81406]KABOOM![/color]

[color=3378e8]And now this region is ours! Cause that&#39;s what the SWAT does, they take houses! I think? Anyway we&#39;ll be taking care of this place from now on, so move along. Grab a [strike]mind control[/strike] cookie on the way out, and make sure to wake up Bob so he doesn&#39;t miss major again! Bye bye![/color]

[color=purple]Thanks to the NPA and Legion troops for helping get rid of yucky fascists![/color][/b]
