We&#39;re a group of nations that move from region to region together. We camp there for a while, meet the residents, and then move on. If we&#39;re nomadic, what is this place then? It&#39;s a gathering point, and a place where we can keep a history of the places we&#39;ve visited in our endless travels. If you want to join us in those travels, just tag along and we&#39;ll consider you a fellow wanderer :)
