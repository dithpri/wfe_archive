[b]You thought it was a normal factboook entry, but it was us, [region]The Black Hawks[/region]! 

The weather has been getting colder recently in the northern hemisphere, so we decided to conduct an inspection to ensure that no regions are using dangerous materials such as [color=red]lava[/color] for heating! We found no safety hazards in this region and moved on. Let&#39;s stay warm together!
