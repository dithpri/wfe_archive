A defensive pact formed between nations all centralized by and around Driskellia, some members are prioritized more than other however. You are only garunteed protection under the condition that you are a core member, meaning that you become an official part of the United Socialist States of Driskellia (Which requires changes in policies and the changing of either the name to include &#39;Driskellian&#39; or &#39;of Driskellia&#39;; or you can add the flag in the top right corner of your flag). Those who do not become a member of the United Socialist States will only be given the potential to be protected and can even be fought by other members without a consequence.
