[b][color=red]The ideology of Progressivism is based on a radical idea. A radical idea that our children are taught in pre-school. A radical idea that is littered within religion. [u]The radical idea of sharing[/u]. Friends, today we reside in a world that has never been richer, which can afford to fund multinational corporations in their conquests and a world that can afford massive wars in several nations. Yet much of the time, when Progressives establish that society&#146;s most vulnerable have a right to live a life of dignity as do our wealthy world citizens, we find opposition espousing that we have no money to fund these endeavours. Friends, it&#146;s time we sculpt a moral society. Join the Progressive Alliance.[/color][/b]
