Welcome to the Holy Bohemian Empire

Built on the pillars of faith, honor, and tradition, the Holy Bohemian Empire is a sacred alliance of duchies, bishoprics, and free cities united under the imperial crown. The capital Pravograde is home to the Imperial College, where nobles and clergy gather to elect the Emperor&#151;Defender of the Faith and Guardian of the Seven Crowns.

Guided by Bohemian Fideism, the empire maintains its order through ancient laws and an army made up of sworn knights and troops from vassal domains. With firm and conservative diplomacy, the Empire extends its hand to allied crowns and closes the gates to the enemies of the traditional order.

Pledge allegiance to the golden eagle and join the eternal glory of Bohemia!
