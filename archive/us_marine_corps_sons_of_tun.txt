From the Halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli;
We fight our country&#146;s battles
On the land as on the sea;
First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean;
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marine.

Our flag&#146;s unfurled to every breeze
From dawn to setting sun;
We have fought in ev&#146;ry clime and place
Where we could take a gun;
In the snow of far-off Northern lands
And in sunny tropic scenes;
You will find us always on the job
The United States Marines

Here&#146;s health to you and to our Corps
Which we are proud to serve;
In many a strife we&#146;ve fought for life
And never lost our nerve;
If the Army and the Navy&nbsp;
Ever look on Heaven&#146;s scenes;
They will find the streets are guarded
By United States Marines.&#148;
