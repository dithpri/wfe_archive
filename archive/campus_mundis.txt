There is a shared spirit between the camps, the fields, the forests of the world. A spirit in the trees, in the stones, in the campires and tents, and above all in the people and stories that gather there. From all over the world, though seemingly seperated by vast distance, those who feel this spirit are called to come together in unison, and through the narratives and stories crafted may change the world.
