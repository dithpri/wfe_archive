The Doctor Who universe, sometimes abbreviated &quot;Whoniverse&quot; or &quot;DWU&quot;, is a term used by fans and, increasingly, the mainstream press to describe the shared fictional universe in which Doctor Who and its related spin-offs and other related series, takes place.

The term notably does not limit itself to &quot;the Doctor&#39;s universe&quot; in terms of the in-universe definition of those terms, instead including the full breadth of the reality in which the Doctor exists, including the multiverse they inhabit; Pete&#39;s World is well-established to be a part of &quot;the DWU&quot; despite being separate from the Doctor&#39;s universe.
