This is a modern tech region with a few interesting twists involved. 

Every 6 months in real life counts as one year here. 

I&amp;#39;m open to heard some ideas on what people want the twists to be. We could be a modern tech region where (magic-less or low magic) elves live instead of humans. 

It&amp;#39;s all about what we want!
