Adodia is an ancient and proud mountainous region found in the lower southern hemisphere, just 12 klicks off of South America. Its blistering cold in the high mountains, and unlivably hot in the swampiest lowlands. The local wild life of the region includes the very promiscuous fox of the plains, the docile ducklings in the swamps (which are soon eaten by the local crocodile population) and the long sought after ostracorn.
