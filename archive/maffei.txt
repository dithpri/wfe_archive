The habitable planet known as Maffei in the middle of the Anteus system, has been uninhibited for many years. But a few nations sent their space settlers to Arion, and many more nations arrived with them. Then, a large war caused every habitable colony to disappear. But finally, the survivors, (your nation) have risen from the rubble and established new nations. 

Phew, now that the lore is over, I can talk about how awesome this place is. 
Hi! I am the leader of the Dust Bowl Republic, and this region (planet) is sort of a sci-fi/new world roleplay, so if you like the r/d kind of thing, this may not be the best for you. :(
Maffei is a place where you can imagine, chat, map, and just have fun with fellow astronauts. ;) So join our planet today!
