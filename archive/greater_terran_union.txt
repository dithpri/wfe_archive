The Greater Terran Union (GTU), is the interstellar nation created in 2153 in the Sol system after The Great Defensive War. Originally, the GTU was a provisional government to help the recovery of Earth on the aftermath of Tyrum Consciousness&#39; invasion of the Planet, but after a planet-wide referendum, the state was legitimized as the sole government of Earth.

The GTU is a highly militarized nation with a poor outlook on other races, both of which formed after the Great Defensive War that birthed the nation. The xenophobic policies were partially relaxed after the GTU became a major galactic power when it triumphed in the Final Compact War.
