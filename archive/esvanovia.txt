[b]Welcome to [color=#BFBF00]Esvanovia[/color]![/b] 

A Post-Modern Tech region founded on the premise that everyone has an equal hand in telling the story of the region; no petty gatekeeping or having to prove yourself. We strive to be a professional, mature, and fun-loving community centered around role playing. Every member is a peer and an equal deserving of their part in the creation of the story, while trouble-makers are dealt with by majority decision.
