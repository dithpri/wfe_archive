[color=006400]In process of converting this region from an oracle region to a matrix region.

Definitions:[list]
[b]Oracle Regions[/b] have two embassies, the one before and the one after, thus creating a line of regions. See [region=Double Funky 7] for more details.
[b]Matrix Regions[/b] do not play the Oracle Embassy Game. They are free to exchange embassies with any region. Currently I will have my regions named after real life nations, and certain other regions, become Matrix Regions. Called Matrix Regions because they all have embassies with each other and anyone that wants to exchange embassies with them.[/list][hr]
