The [b]Union of Nation States[/b] (UNS) was founded on 13th February 2016. We are a region that is welcoming of everyone and nations of all ideologies. Whilst we may have a republican form of government we welcome all forms of government in the UNS. Here in the UNS we offer an offsite forum, the hub of our region&#39;s activities, where our government is centered and where most regional discussions will take place.
