New Radicaster is the official name for the various Radicastrian territories that do not belong to the Radicastrian homeland. These consist of the planets of Bacchus, Pontus, Boreas, and Lethe.

The region is protected by the Neoradicastrian Legion, which makes up all military forces stationed on these planets.

All are welcome (except fashies, you&#39;re too nasty for our taste)
