Welcome to [color=magenta]Autropolis[/color]!

Autropolis was founded on March 11th, 2003. It is a multiple star system orbiting a massive black hole with a plethora of habitable planets. Its eight founding nations are still active today. Between 2007 and 2010, Autropolis was at its peak and a prominent region in NationStates. We&#39;re working to restore Autropolis to that former reputation and beyond.
