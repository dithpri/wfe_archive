midwestern Assyria is a left-leaning, liberal regional political entity. 

it is inclusive of all people and religions. it is in support of homosexuality and is pro-choice. it believes that marijuana should definitely be legalized. it is in favor of free public healthcare for all and high taxes for the rich. it is anti-capitalist but realizes other systems don&#39;t work in practice. (sorry mr. marx) it is very supportive of the paris agreement and tries to be environmentally-friendly

trump supporters aren&#39;t banned but tend to be frowned upon. constitua classifies themselves as a trump supporter so please ignore them and only interact with the wa delegate.
