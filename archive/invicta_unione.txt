[hr][b][color=#ED4719]This region has been occupied by the [region]Appalachian Empire[/region]![/b][hr]

This region was a member of the laughable [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=708751]Anti-AFA Alliance[/url], which included such detestable individuals such as Empress Jadny and Chessmistress - a user who used the mundane word of &quot;man&quot; as a slur so vigorously that moderation forum banned her. This region was permanently destroyed in 2020 for its affiliation with this bigotry.[/color]
