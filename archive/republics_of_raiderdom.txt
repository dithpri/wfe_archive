This is a class region for Ms. Arnold&#146;s Civics &amp;amp; Economics class at Robious Middle School. You will be expected to write weekly journal entries reflecting on one legislation issues in your country and connecting it an actual current event from around the world.  You are held to the same rules for the school and the county. No profane language. No bullying. No racist/sexist/or otherwise horrible things are to be said for the sake of attention. You are better than that. Now, let&amp;#39;s get to ruling our country the way we want!!!

Good Luck!
