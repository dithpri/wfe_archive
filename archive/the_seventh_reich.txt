After the destruction of Germany after WWIII, survivors of the Reich headed to Antarctica...

The Seventh Reich is a semi-democratic/fascist region based on German ideals. We are NOT a Nazi region.

Rules:
1) Be respectful to the officers.
2) Everyone is welcome.
3) Please, no offensive jokes. It can give other regions the wrong idea about us.
4) Endorse the delegate.
5) Please refrain from campaigning in the RMB. If you want to be an officer, telegram me and I&#39;ll put up a voting poll.
