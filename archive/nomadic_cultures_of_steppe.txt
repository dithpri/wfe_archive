We are the steppe, the proud, mighty culture of the Steppe. Come, join us for a pleasant talk by fireside or chat on our friendly forum! There are, naturally, some rules:
*No fascists
*No racist slurs or comments
*Any highly segregationist content is prohibited. 
Anyhoo, I hope everyone can obey the rules yet have one of the most exciting adventures of their lives!

Sincerely, Nur Garzhvog, regional founder
