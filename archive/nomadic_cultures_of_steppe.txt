Oh, how the cold season approaches. The nights stretch longer, wrapping the land in a deep, chilling silence. All creatures retreat, slipping into the quiet depths of a wint&#146;ry sleep. Even [i]all [/i]of [region]The Black Hawks[/region] appear sound asleep, snoring through minor and major updates alike. All? No!

A wild unpredictable duck and a suddenly improvising eristic waddle through the fields and frozen ponds, prowling for delicious regions to raid&#133; And, well, you can figure it out I reckon, we found [i]yours[/i]! 
As they say, &quot;[color=purple]when the [hawks] are in town, the mice stay down.[/color]&quot; So we left you this!

If you too like vagabonding under the stars, [url=https://discord.gg/YudSM5B8]pack your bags and go![/url]
