Founded in the early days of NS, Atheist Empire (&AElig;) is the premier region for atheists and agnostics. We don&amp;#39;t care about your politics, race, sexuality, or gender. Whether you&amp;#39;re a jaded intellectual or a hot catholic schoolgirl, you&amp;#39;ll feel right at home in &AElig;.

As marked as &amp;#39;Casual&amp;#39;, we don&amp;#39;t engage in roleplaying.
