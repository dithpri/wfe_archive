This land was built by a high-tech civilisation, then abandoned. A war blew up the lands into many islands. They now hold a cluster of nations. [nation]Kori[/nation] was the first nation to call The Burning Utopia its home. Many more nations are following it into this new and diverse region. Everyone and anyone is welcome!
