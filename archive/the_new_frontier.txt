Setting Info:
A new land has been discovered and the nations of the world are vying for dominance on this emerging stage. Perhaps your nation is a colony, bringing customs and technology to this new frontier. Or maybe your settlers are fleeing their old nation, hoping to create something fresh here. You might even be among the native nations, looking upon these &quot;discoverers&quot; with skepticism. No matter your background, now is a time of opportunity and change for so many nations. How will your people fare?
