[region]The Black Hawks[/region] love deer. Why?

[color=aqua]Deers are great. They have detachable antlers which can store emergency foodstuffs like bananas, or can be turned into weapons of mass destruction[/color]

The legend has been told that one day, the deer will descend amongst us, and the people will rejoice. Naturally, the deer will also provide us Hawks with weapons of mass destruction. And bananas.
