[b]Blackreach[/b] was [region]Whitereach[/region]&amp;#39;s sister region and puppet storage region. However, after [region]The Black Riders[/region] captured Whitereach, Blackreach became the sister region and puppet storage region of [region]Candy Land[/region]. This region once housed Candy Land&amp;#39;s lesser-known puppets, while Candy Land itself housed the more well-known and honorable mention puppets. As of now, Candy Land contains every puppet nation and Blackreach has become a barren wasteland.

Our homeland is [region]Candy Land[/region] and our empire is [region]The Whitereach Empire[/region]. We are also allies with [region]RussiaReach[/region], [region]Ponyreach[/region], [region]Dubreach[/region], [region]Bogglereach[/region], [region]DMXreach[/region], [region]HaloReach[/region], and [region]Asianreach[/region], which are independent colonies of Candy Land.
