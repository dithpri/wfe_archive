Yippe Kay Yay! Babes, beers,  and irradiated burgers. The land of Hollywood, Elvis Presley, and Cowboys! Oh, and the remnants of the US. If that piece of nuclear ravaged land doesn&amp;#39;t strike your fancy, you can either head north and try to meet Santa Claus (assuming you can survive the odd weather patterns up there) or head down
south and get some sun burn on the nice burning beaches! Careful for mutated fish men though. This vast and wonderful part of a ravaged Earth was first tamed by a bunch of Elvis imposters. Not a great start.
