[b]Knock knock![/b]
[color=darkred]The[/color] [b][color=tan]Osiran Sekhmet Legion[/color][/b] [color=darkred]has arrived. We&#39;re here to fix the sink. Take this time to hide in fear as Legionnaires do a little redecorating. Here, have some totally not mind control cookies. It&#39;ll be fine. 

If absolutely not due to mind control cookies you now feel an urge to conquer with the Legion, go ahead and join the [url=http://s11.zetaboards.com/OFO/index/]forum[/url] and we&#39;ll get you a uniform and some definitely not mind control tacos for your trouble.[/color]
