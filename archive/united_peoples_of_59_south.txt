Founded in the year of our Lord 2013 by [nation]Povertysia[/nation], we are a new, uncorrupted region determined to make your experience in NationStates better. &amp;quot;59 South&amp;quot; refers to a freeway in Houston, Texas; one of our founder&amp;#39;s goals is to broaden the NationStates community in his hometown. Our region has several checks against invasion, most importantly the founder&amp;#39;s access to regional control. We hope to contribute to the game in a positive way and make the world a better place
