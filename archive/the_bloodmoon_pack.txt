Formed after a century of fighting, an agreement was made between the factions of Yurpen. The treaty was signed in the capital of Nivaran between the Queen of Nivaran and the chief of the Sanguine Hordes after the Battle of Viska. The night was the Bloodmoon hence the name the Bloodmoon Pack. Later other neighboring countries joined because of desire for peace, cooperation, and prosperity.
