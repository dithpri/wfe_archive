Entertainment autocrats unite! [b]The corporate confederation of the mouse[/b] is for nation states who realize the inevitable blending of entertainment and government, with a mission to have the populace be in a constant state of spectacle under corporate excess. 

We welcome all capitalist nation-states that emphasizes the power of pop-culture as mediating and consoling factor for our citizens. We seek to use our cuddly characters to initiate social change, ease diplomatic tensions abroad and to become the face of all industrial, political and religious institutions that we provide. 

Thank you.
