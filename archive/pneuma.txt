[b][color=#191970]Pneuma (&amp;#960;&amp;#957;&amp;#949;&amp;#8166;&amp;#956;&amp;#945;) is an ancient Greek word for &quot;breath&quot;, and in a religious context for &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;soul&quot;. In ancient Greek medicine, pneuma is the form of circulating air necessary for the systemic functioning of vital organs. It is the material that sustains consciousness in a body. According to Diocles and Praxagoras, the psychic pneuma mediates between the heart, regarded as the seat of Mind in some physiological theories of ancient medicine, and the brain.[/color][/b]
