&amp;quot;Hello, my people, I am the president of the great country of Emraaic. I am here to present to you the new region of Estea. Now, we may not be a especially strong region, we may not be a strong nation, for that matter. However, we believe that we are strong. We believe that we can become bigger, stronger, better! And believing is all that matters! We believed we could fly and a few years later, we invented the airplane! We believed that we could make fire, and we did! We believed that we could stand up against the Nazis and we did! Now, everyone! In the name of Democracy, let us all unite!&amp;quot;
- Gordon W. Backman, President of Emraaic
