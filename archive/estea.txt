Welcome, my Friends, to the Beautiful Estea![/color]

[color=cyan]Now, you may be wondering what the main goal for Nations of Estea might be, and with that, I can give you Three Words:[/color] [color=Gold]Peace[/color] [color=cyan] and [/color] [color=Green] Beauty. [/color] [Color=cyan] We do not wish to cause any wars with any Nations with different ideologies or values, instead, we leave them be and in return, we ask that they leave us be. Aside from Peace, we also pride ourselves in making sure we maintain the most Environmentally stunning and beautiful Nation that there is.[/color]

[color=cyan]If you wish to join the Region, feel free to send a Telegram to [nation]Gran Toreno[/nation] and, after a quick look over of your Nation, we will choose if you would be a good fit to our Region![/color]
