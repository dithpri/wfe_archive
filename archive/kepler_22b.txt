Kepler-22b is an extrasolar planet orbiting within the habitable zone of the Sun-like star Kepler-22. It is located about 587 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. Kepler-22b&#39;s size is roughly twice that of Earth. In the real world, it was discovered by NASA&#39;s Kepler Space Telescope in December 2011 and was the first known transiting planet to orbit within the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, where liquid water could exist on the planet&#39;s surface.
