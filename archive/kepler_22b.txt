Kepler-22b is an extrasolar planet orbiting within the habitable zone of the Sun-like star Kepler-22. It is located about 587 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. Kepler-22b&#39;s size is roughly twice that of Earth. 

Its mass and surface composition appears to be primarily sand and rock with some trees and vegetation. There are large pits in the ground, the origin of which are unknown, that contain radioactive material and are alarmingly deep. The pits appear to also serve as tunnels in some areas. The land is also covered with serpent-like skeletons of an unknown origin and nature.
