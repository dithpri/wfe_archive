The United Nether Nations is a great region, with a small amount of nations, that leaves room for newer members to really have a voice.  We have a very fair and unique system of doing things in the United Nether Nations, and a strong army provided mostly by The Borderlands of Netherden, with 50% of governmnet funds spent on private military!
