The year was 2100, and the decline of the United States of America had become a drop. They had not remembered the Romans. So a plan by John Jacob Floyd, Grand Cancellarius of Culturii, was set in motion. He planted the flag of Culturii deep into the ground beneath his feet and claimed his property as Culturiian. Soon his neighbors had joined him, and then the city, and then the state, until finally the whole of the Southeastern United States was Culturiian land. As others followed suit and declared soverignity it was no longer the United States, it was the New World.
