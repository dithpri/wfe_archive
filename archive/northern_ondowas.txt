Northern Ondowas is a realm of stark beauty and enlightened rule, stretching from jagged granite peaks and deep, ancient caverns to the fruitful rolling hills and secret, serene beaches known only to the wise. It is governed not by a single king, but by a High Council of elected and appointed wardens who oversee a tapestry of sovereign nations; while these enclaves rule their own lands with autonomy, the Council retains the authority to intercede should necessity arise, ensuring justice prevails across the borders. This unique union fosters a land of merriment and rich harvest, where ambassadors and leaders congregate regularly in the spirit of diplomacy, filling the halls with laughter and debate rather than the clamor of war.
