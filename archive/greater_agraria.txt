Greater Agraria is a forested region in the center of a great continent. It is largely inhabited by foxgirls, most of whom reside in the Commonwealth of Agraria-Vulpinia, though many reside in other nations in the region, and there are a smattering of non-foxgirl species living in the borderlands of the area.
