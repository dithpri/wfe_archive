The United Confederacy of Humanity is a region encompassing the Sol star system and all planets and celestial bodies therein. Founded on Earth in the early 2030&#39;s by the Federal Republic of Mudriano, it was soon joined by many other nations seeking to take advantage of this new Space Age and also provide a common law and defense for humanity as a whole, on planet and in space alike. The United Confederacy of Human Nations has recently developed FTL Travel, and is releasing the technology to the Confederacy. A new era of colonization is about to begin as the United Confederacy of Humanity plans its journey into Interstellar Space.
