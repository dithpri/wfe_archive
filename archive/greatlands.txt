The Milky Way Galaxy, aka the &amp;#39;Greatlands&amp;#39; as designated by the American Orion Republic, is where the Republic dwells. It includes AOR territory including its core systems and capital world as well as territory belonging to its close ally, Shape Cod.  

Unexplored territories, or territories not claimed by either Shape Cod or the AOR, are designated &amp;#39;Expansion Regions&amp;#39;. They are vast places of wonder and mystery, sometimes with terrible dangers lurking within them.
