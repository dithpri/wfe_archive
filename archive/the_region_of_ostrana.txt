           From the stars we came, to the stars we rise. Through struggle we persevered, and in ancestral
            footsteps we tread, to make a great region and nations that will thrive for generations to com.
                                                                  Fatum Vocat Fortis
                                                           (Fate calls the Strong Ones)
