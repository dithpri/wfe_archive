Through the ages, there have been many who have chosen to be more than what they were born to be, a special breed, a caste above all others, those who defy fate itself. We are the ones who have the Dragon&amp;#39;s spirit etched deep within us, with minds and bodies honed through battle and glory, through trials and travels, we place ourselves above everyday people. 

Willpower, Discipline, Awareness, these three principles are what we value the most in our Agents, these are the things we instill within ourselves. We are more than a group, we are a family, camaraderie and brotherhood, relying on our fellow Agents, we fight together, triumph together, and if need be, die together.
