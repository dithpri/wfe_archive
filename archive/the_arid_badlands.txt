The Arid Badlands is a small, proud region comprised mostly of video game nerd nation leaders. It is located on a small, remote island in the heart of the beautiful and mysterious Bermuda Triangle. But don&#146;t let the beauty of our region fool you - The Arid Badlands is a savage place. The wide array of dangerous and exotic wildlife, combined with wild native tribes and extreme climate makes this a region not for the faint of heart. Savage as it may be, The Arid Badlands is the perfect place for fledgling nations to thrive in a welcoming region where nations are forced to band together in camaraderie or flail.
