I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that&amp;#39;s inside

Pokemon, its you and me
I know it&#146;s my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you&amp;#39;re my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I&amp;#39;ll teach you
Pokemon, gotta catch &amp;#39;em all

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There&amp;#39;s no better team
Arm in arm we&amp;#39;ll win the fight
It&amp;#39;s always been our dream
