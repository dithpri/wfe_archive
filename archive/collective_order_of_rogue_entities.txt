The Collective Order of Rogue Entities or C.O.R.E was founded by The Progenitor Rogue state of Praetoa, The region welcomes peaceful relations and interested nations though rogue nations seeking asylum are welcomed with ease.  Though each state is free to do as it pleases, within limitation of certain disagreance between others,  a mutual understanding should be achieved, Respect your nation, other nations and their decision, Compromise when needed,  Strength is respected and earned but even the weak may yet topple the strong, The Collective Order of Rogue Entities will honor the Strong but don&#39;t disrespect the choice of fallen nation&#39;s.
