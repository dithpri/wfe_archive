Capitalism has plagued this world for to long, and the communists believe they have the solution when they don&#146;t. But we at the fascist council decide the fate of the country&#146;s in dire need of saving may it be from war, a depression, or a revolution. Rules are as follows:

1. You must need help to, y&#146;now, get it.
2. To join the council you MUST BE FASCIST.
3. We accept all economy types here.
4. Be nice, please for the love of everything holy, be nice.

And always remember: &#147;fascism&#146;s regni imminente&#148;
