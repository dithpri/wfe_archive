If all else fails: Have a backup!
[color=blue]The EFU is pro-everything. There is no discrimination, and no hatred towards ANYONE, and if this rule is broken you will be removed.[/color]
[color=green]The EFU strives to be a place of safe sanctuary, and a place of activity forever. We ask our members to do one thing: stay positive! [/color]
[color=red]This is a major Role-Playing region and everything done should not be taken personally. Role-playing as your nation is highly encouraged, but always feel free to express yourself.[/color]
[color=purple]Also, before we forget, please join the[/color] [color=Teal]World Assembly[/color] [color=purple]if you haven&#39;t already and endorse our delegate in order to boost our regional security and stability.[/color]
[color=orange]We thank you for joining the EFU group, and may your beliefs shine bright![/color]
