[b]Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their friends in  [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=valle_de_arena]The Sekhmet Legion[/url] and  [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=red_front]The PRAF[/url] decided to take a trip to the land of kanada. Where they ended up finding a bunch of confused americans, leading to the discovery that non-Americans do not exist. Also, it is unconfirmed if the earth is a sphere or not, though time zones may provide some evidence that it is.
