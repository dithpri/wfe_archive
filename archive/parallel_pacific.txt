Parallel Pacific is a huge ocean. The origin of its name is not well known, but came from the people who discovered it; maybe it seemed to resemble the &#147;Pacific Ocean&#148;.

Parallel Pacific is comprised of many astonishing, improbable and beautiful islands, atolls and archipelagos. There is huge variety in size, geography, environment, flora and fauna.

Parallel Pacific doesn&#39;t recruit nations, but any peaceful nation is free to settle in one of the many uninhabited archipelago, or to move somewhere in the ocean.

Parallel pacific is a democratic region. All UN members can vote for the UN resolutions, and the total determines how the regional vote is casted by the delegate.
