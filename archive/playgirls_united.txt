Within our Association, we wil make degrees, as we have mentioned previously. These will be thirty-three symbolizing the age of the impostor Jesus. We will give a name to each degree and we will create other similar symbols. All these things were my deas and those of brothers Moab and Hiram. The meaning of these ironic symbols must not be perceived; it must remain among the nine of us. For the other brothers or affiliates it is enough to make them see the utilities and instruments so they may believe that the Association was founded in the times of Solomon or earlier than this.
