Intended as a political union for the secular states of the Levant, calls for religious freedom and the endemic tension between the peoples of the Confederation have led to a progressive dissolution of unity in the nation until its constituent states effectively gained independence from the main architect of the Confederation, the People&#39;s Republic of Cirania, who in preserving its master project reformed the Confederation of Levantine States, or the Levantine Union, into an alliance of nations rather than one state wherein all members seek a peaceful and secular Levant, safe for all to visit and intending to establish a lasting solution to the issue of Jerusalem, keeping it free for all who practice to make pilgrimages to.
