[b]SUBSIDIARY OF THE [region]TRADE FEDERATION[/region][/b][hr]

Old WFE:
[i]This historically distinct region offers a unique platform for Salfordians to come together as one in a concerted effort to promote greater indecency, injustice and poverty. The basic offensive needs of a Greater Salford require irredentist claims on a proper silly scale. Its revolutionary appeal lies in its continual infighting to create a more formidable polity against external betrayers.[/i]
