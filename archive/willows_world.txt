All hail our nerdy queen! If you&#146;re a fan of Dark Willow on FB, you&#146;re more than welcome in this region!

This region operates under [url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy]direct democracy[/url]. All actions taken by the Founder and Delegate will be put to a vote of all nations in the region. (NB: this does not mean all nations must vote the same way on WA proposals. The regional vote will only determine which way the Delegate votes.)
