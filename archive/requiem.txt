[b]We are Forerunners, guardians of all that exists. 
The roots of the galaxy have grown deep under our careful tending. 
Where there is life, the wisdom of our countless generations has saturated the soil. 
Our strength is a luminous sun towards which all intelligence blossoms. 
And the impervious shelter beneath which it has prospered.[/b]
