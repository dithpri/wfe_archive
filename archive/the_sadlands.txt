&amp;quot;Oceans? What oceans? Son, those are the tears of the millions of men before you, those who died crafting these lands so that you might have a place to sit. Do not be afraid to cry my child, these are lands of sadness and despair, you ought remember that . Even the sun glows red in shame for the lives it&amp;#39;s oppressive heat claimed.&amp;quot; - Unknown Sadman
