IAC (Imperial America Council) is an American council including all the major powers in America. After the USA split into 4 regions/countries (Impirea, Midwocten, New Morktown, and Texland) they came together to create the IAC. With Impirea being the leader, the future looks bright for the IAC. We invite you to come join us at the IAC. -The Leader of Impirea.
