Belated as it is, in the spirit of Christmas [region]Lone Wolves United[/region] has come to deliver one last present to the residents of this region: the title of [b]honorary wolf[/b] for all! This is the second highest one could ever hope to achieve on NationStates. Everyone including the defenders are invited to join the [url=https://discord.gg/QJ3NVAc]chat[/url] to celebrate this generous gift. If you wish to attain an even higher status, feel free to sign up on our [url=https://lone-wolves-united.boards.net/]forum[/url] as well! Special thanks has to be given to [region=Osiris] for their support in this noble effort.[hr]
