Novaterria was founded by the 5 main bodies consisting of survivors from the Millenia War. Following the great cataclysm that split the world asunder, forging this continent from the remnants of lost civilizations, their wisdom buried beneath its towering mountains and endless plains. As centuries passed, wanderers, exiles, and dreamers from distant lands braved the perilous seas, drawn by the promise of a new beginning. They brought with them their own beliefs, customs, and ambitions, shaping Novaterria into a mosaic of cultures, each nation a reflection of its people&#146;s deepest values. Though divided in ideals, the land binds them together, a living testament to the resilience and complexity of those who dared to call it home.
