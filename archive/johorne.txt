[color=#1B5AD1][u]The Simple Rules: [/u][/color]

[color=#1B94D1]Citizens of the region may vote in polls. [/color][color=#1BD1BE] Other residents may not. A citizen, in this case, is a non-puppet nation. 
If you are new to the region, please designate your non-puppet status to our delegates. 
Non-Citizens that vote risk ejection and even banning. [/color]
