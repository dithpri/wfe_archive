This is a region dedicated to the Onondaga Central School district students who chose to play this game.  It was founded by Jacob Barclay on 9/18/2015 at 7:16 PM EST.  This is a private region for all OCS students to join and work together, almost like a social media region.  If you are not from OCS, please contact me @ jacob4083@gmail.com to join.  If I aprove, you can join.  If not, sorry.  The acceptance of you will be a democracy wise choice where we vote on who can join.
