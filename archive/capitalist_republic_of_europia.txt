[b][color=blue]History[/b][/color]
Established in the area formerly known as Europe after the financial catastrophe in 2024. Shortly thereafter the waves of communist armies and corrupt dictators moved to the area in an attempt to put a stranglehold on the depressed continent. The [b]CRE[/b] ([region]Capitalist Republic of Europia[/region]) formed after the fall of the European Union as a beacon to the region of greater Europia that the &amp;quot;[i]Capitalist way[/i]&amp;quot; can and will overcome the invasive communists. We are comprised of individual yet united fair republics and we will combat all communism in all ways possible, via: business, trade, sanctions, and if neccesary, war. Join the [b]CRE[/b] in the fight against the red tide.
