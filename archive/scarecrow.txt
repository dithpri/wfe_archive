Most of the scarecrows were originally built to perform basic farming tasks. The cobblesmiths could only spare a few tools, bones, or scraps of wood to create the things, which caused the scarecrows to move in an unsettling, herky-jerky way.

And then, in the 1900&amp;#39;s, the scarecrows took over.

This is a steampunk region where strange and scary constructs rule the humans.
