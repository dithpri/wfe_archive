Hello! Emily Tikhanovskaya here. I&#39;m the president of Best Belarus, and I welcome you to join our region!

European Friendship Union is a wonderful region where we make friends, trade cards, discuss our interests, and have a great time. Anyone can join or leave at any time. If you have more than one nation (like me), you can move as many as you like here. You don&#39;t have to be a European-based country to join, either! 

Have a great day! :)
