We seek to liberate the world from its menial existence.

Here, in the Yuslovakan Liberation Front, we take what these countries were and make them into something more. To become Yuslovakan is the highest honor with which one can be bestowed. We fiercely defend all who claim allegiance to our cause: &quot;service and steadfastness&quot;. We serve our people and our leader, who in turn serves us. We stand fast in the face of evil, whatever form it may take.

It is easy to become a Liberator. Simply claim obeisance to our leader and our cause, and give military might. With this might we will liberate all who are slaves to the imperial machine. Join today, and become free.
