Changes enacting to become a new area with everything needed, for we are Europeans, we have been here for many moons, and for many moons we will stay. 

AWAY WITH THE RAIDERS!

After being raided by The Brotherhood of Malice, Europe Union has begun anew, though almost everybody had left, we have stayed, and forever we will prosper, in hopes of new protection and peace. 

AWAY WITH THE RAIDERS!

Many lost, many to lose, many to come. We will stand strong against our enemies and keep peace internally until we find our Heaven of Earth.

AWAY WITH THE RAIDERS!
