This region was an outpost of [region]The Germanic Reich[/region] before being abandoned. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b].[hr]U.A. High School&#39;s [nation=short]Class 1-A[/nation], with backup from Class 1-B, has defeated a gang of Japanese neofascist villains. As the pro heroes arrive and take over, our [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Hero_Academia]young heroes-in-training[/url] celebrate by holding a dance contest. No one is sure who wins, but Midoriya ends up hospitalized, Aoyama&#39;s ego is bruised, Mineto is beaten up, and Bakugo explodes. So, just another ordinary day.
