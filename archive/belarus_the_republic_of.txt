Belarus, officially the Republic of Belarus is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by Russia to the East and Northwest, Ukraine to the South, Poland to the West and Latvia to the Northwest.
This is an inclusive region where anyone can join (except raiders, but they aren&#146;t really people are they?)
We accept all embassy offers (aside from raiders, their regions aren&#146;t real are they?)
