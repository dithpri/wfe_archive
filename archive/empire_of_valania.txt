Defiance is not to be tolerated. We strictly believe in absolute power of the government. You WILL obey our laws. You WILL bring me cookies every Wednesday. You WILL NOT question any decisions that seem inhumane. However, past the crazy rules we have, your freedom as a person is not revoked. Simple, really.
