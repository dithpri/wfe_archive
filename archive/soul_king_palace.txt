The Soul King Palace is an organization that serves as the judiciary authority of the Soul King Palace. Operating under a mandate from the Soul King, the influence of the Central 46 goes well beyond the boundaries of a judiciary authority and into those of legislative and operative authorities. 
The Soul King Palace is comprised of forty wise men, gathered from all over the Soul King Palace , and six judges. These men are in charge of trying all HUMAN crimes, whether they were committed in The Soul King Palace or elsewhere. Once a decision has been made, it is rarely overturned.
