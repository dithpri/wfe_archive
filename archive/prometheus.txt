[region]Prometheus[/region] is an alt-canon region based on [region]Atlas[/region]. Though both regions use the same map and share the same prehistory, the regional canons are 100% independent of one another. This region is invite-only.

The Prometheus regional page is a work in progress. Region signup is a two-stage process, currently in Round 2.

As of partway through Round 2, the current map can be found [url=http://i.imgur.com/VhVbQzm.png]here[/url].
