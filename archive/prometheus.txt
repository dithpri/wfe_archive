[region]Prometheus[/region] is an alt-canon region based on [region]Atlas[/region]. Though both regions use the same map and share the same prehistory, the regional canons are 100% independent of one another. This region is invite-only.

The Prometheus regional page is a work in progress. Region signup is a two-stage process, currently between stages one and two.

As of the end of Round 1.5, the current map can be found [url=http://i.imgur.com/p6dxWeX.png]here[/url].
