[color=brown]PROMETHEUS[/color] a region mantled with a crestfallen mist emanating from the astringent western ocean of Tierou and a veil of ashen plumes disemboguing from the eastern composite volcanoes. The region is situated in an illimitable and boundless ocean which cradles Prometheus in its center. Brazen fields lie across the region and serrated mountains protrude from the ground in accumulations across the land. Dense haunting forests lie scattered across Prometheus screaming and crying the calls of the earth.
