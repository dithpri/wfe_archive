This mailbox is mine
And this triagonal sign
That blue balloon
The month of June
They&#39;re mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

Ziggy&#39;s sweets are mine
That birdie&#39;s tweets are mine
The city streets
Both your feet
They&#39;re all emphatically mine

It all belongs to me
Everything that I see
North, south, east and west
I caress it, &#39;cause I possess it
I&#39;m Stingy and it&#39;s mine

And this instrumental lick is also mine

The floor and ceiling are mine
All your feelings are mine
You always knew it
That&#39;s all there is to it
It&#39;s mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

That&#39;s what I said
It&#39;s mine
