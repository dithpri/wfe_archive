[b]Welcome to the Empire of the [region]Royal Order[/region][/b]

This region is a memorial to the citizens and troopers of the former [region]Royal Syndicate of Iron Fist Nations[/region], and the troops of the former autonomous region [region]Royal Order[/region]. 

We are now one with [region]Farkasfalka[/region], formed out of [region]The VUN[/region] and [region]The Iron Order[/region]. We merged to concentrate our strength in defeating our enemies. 

[nation]Vungar[/nation]: [i]&#148;It is better to give up our sovereignty than to lose to our enemies&#148;[/i]
