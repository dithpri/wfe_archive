The [b]Blue Ridge Mountains[/b] are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania.

The Blue Ridge Mountains are noted for their bluish color when seen from a distance. Trees put the &quot;blue&quot; in Blue Ridge, from the isoprene released into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to the characteristic haze on the mountains and their distinctive color. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
