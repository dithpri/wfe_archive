[color=red][b][*]All nations are asked to [u]research a cure[/u] as soon as possible. Researching a cure slowly reduces the whole region&amp;#39;s infection rate.
[*]Once you have developed cure missiles, fire them on nations which are infected to cure their people! [u]Don&amp;#39;t fire missiles at nations who are also firing missiles, this locks their ability to fire for a few minutes[/u].
[*]The extermination response is not recommended. If you use extermination, don&amp;#39;t use your extermination squads on other nations unless they ask you to do so, because it kills their people.
[*]We will be locking down the region. This is to stop heavily zombie infested nations moving in and ruining our efforts.
[*][u]Nations who embrace the zombie virus will be temporarily removed from the region[/u].[/b][/color]
