[b][color=#B40404]Welcome to the Realm of Albion![/color][/b]

[b][color=#086A87]Home of gallant warriors, skilful storytellers, brave adventurers, [nation=short]St George Clooney[/nation], [i]and an incredibly boring world factbook entry...[/i][/color][/b]

[b][color=#B40404]We&#39;re holding a [i]CONTEST[/i]. A challenging and superfluously dramatic contest, with the noble goal of creating a significantly less boring factbook entry! More details about this upcoming trial of chivalry will be unveiled at an unspecified and wildly unpredictable point of time which will hopefully be in the very near future.[/b]
