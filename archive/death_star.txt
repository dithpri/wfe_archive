[b]The Death Star (DS-1 Orbital Battle Station) was a gargantuan moon-sized, deep-space mobile battle station armed with a planet-destroying superlaser powered by massive kyber crystals. 

A pet project of Emperor Palpatine, Director Orson Callan Krennic, and its eventual commander Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin to expound the military philosophy of the aptly named Tarkin Doctrine.

It was originally designed by the Geonosians before the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire took over the project.[/b]
