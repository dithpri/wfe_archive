      Albanians value political freedom and civil rights above all else. Our nations also have good Law and order structure. This helps develop a fair but firm government. All people have a say in what we do. Our founder Astaisa and WA Delegate Auxan are always willing to help new members if they need help. If you do end up joining our region, remember, we put our people first.
