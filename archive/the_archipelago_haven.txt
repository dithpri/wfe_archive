This group of archipelagos is west of Europe and has a coinciding history with many European empires such as The Roman Empire, The British Empire, and The 3rd German Reich. Many of the nations here want to support the entire chain of islands and are archipelagos of small islands. Despite the vastly different ideologies and histories, we come together and form The Archipelago Haven.
