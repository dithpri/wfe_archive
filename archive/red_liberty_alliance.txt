A region that stood in tribute to the deceased socialist defender alliance of regions, and does not claim to in represent the former RLA. My old, good friend [nation]Leilas[/nation] was one of many who graced the battlefield with this most aggressive of defender organizations. They were shunned by the hypocrites of the day, however their method of battle has been poorly copied by all defender organizations that fancy they created raiding for defending. RIP most interesting of old friends. [nation]Drunken Conquerors[/nation]
