The current incarnation of the RLA [b]does not[/b] claim to represent the original RLA, an inactive morally bankrupt morass of an organisation which, like the FRA and TITO do today, claimed to be a defender alliance despite being little more than dishonest invaders with a fancier title. This region, the new RLA not being an alliance of regions but one of nations, is an organisation committed to overthrowing the true enemy of the people of NationStates: the inactive bourgeois resident in founderless regions which let them decline. The apparatus of the bourgeoisie are none other than defender organisations such as the FRA which work to maintain their regional control rather than embracing development by imperialists or excitement from raiders.
