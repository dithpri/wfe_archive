Ave Khan! And welcome to the Boron Heights!

An open, and hopefully soon, prosperous region with a Diesel/steam-punkish tech-level, where all are welcome to take up residence.
It&#39;s currently still a bit empty, though i hope this might change in the future, as this region strives to facilitate diplomatic bonds with others.
In any case, be sure to endorse the current Governor and enjoy your stay!
