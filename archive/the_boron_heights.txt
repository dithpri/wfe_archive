Ave Khaan and greetings to you, delegates, diplomats, weary travelers or aspiring citizens, welcome to the Boron Heights!

An expansive region of empty, wast plots of land, waiting to be settled by nations, countries and polities of all shapes and sizes.
This region is a fairly new and small one, housing only a couple nations, though you might change that! It was originally designed to be for puppet-storage (those puppets being the two Rugiia&#39;s and Morov)
but now it&#39;s developed into an open, and hopefully soon, prosperous region, where all are welcome to take up residence.
In any case, be sure to endorse the current Governor and enjoy your stay!
