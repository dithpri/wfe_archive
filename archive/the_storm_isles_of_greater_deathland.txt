The most well-known feature of the Storm Isles of Greater Deathland is the water between the land. It&#39;s treacherous and beyond dangerous, there are storms that have been raging without stop for centuries. If you sight any sea creatures or, worse yet, air creatures, flee as fast as you can for any life that can withstand such conditions is monstrous and not to be meddled with.

On the other hand, the Isles themselves have calm weather. A regular cycle of nineteen seasons passes predictably through each year and fields are bountiful even when left unattended. 

Each Isle operates independently from the others - mostly because travelling to and from one Isle to another is borderline suicide.
