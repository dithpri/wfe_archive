The Armed Authoritarian World Order was founded on the 10th of April, 2013. This was in response to a realisation that  few regions acknowledged the possibility of an authoritarian nation using military strength as a viable force, not only for security, but also order. The region stands as a safe haven for authoritarian nations, away from the criticism of regions in which authoritarian rule or heavy armament is taboo.
