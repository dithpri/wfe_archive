The Armed Authoritarian world order was founded on the 10th of April, 2013. This was in response to a realisation that  few regions acknowledged the possibility of an authoritarian nation using military strength as a viable force, not only for security, but also order. It was intended to provide a safe haven for Authoritarian nations, away from the criticism of regions in which authoritarian rule or heavy armament is taboo.
