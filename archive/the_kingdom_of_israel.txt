The reunion of the Israeli and Judean kingdoms within the region or Canaan.
Thousands of years ago Abraham signed a covenent with god,
Who promised to give the land of Israel to his descendants.
The Jews have been seperated and exiled from their land by foreign powers,
Both our temples were destroyed, millions of Jews were killed.
After 2000 years in exile we fulfill our right of return.
With Jerusalem at the Center, And the mighty wall sorrounding it.
A member or any religion and ethnicity is welcome,
but you MUST be a supporter of Israel.
