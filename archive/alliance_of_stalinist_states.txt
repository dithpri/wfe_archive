Every fact of science was once
damned. Every invention was considered
impossible. Every discovery was a nervous
shock to some orthodoxy. Every artistic
innovation was denounced as fraud and folly.
The entire web of culture and &#145;progress,&#146;
everything on earth that is man-made and not
given to us by nature, is the concrete
manifestation of some man&#146;s refusal to bow to
Authority. We would own no more, know no
more, and be no more than the first apelike
hominids if it were not for the rebellious, the
recalcitrant, and the intransigent. As Oscar
Wilde truly said, [i]&#145;Disobedience was man&#146;s
Original Virtue.[/i]
