Ever dreamed of starting a country like Sealand? We continue the free-spirit nation-founding of Old Sealand! Continue the dream!

PLEASE recruit as many people as possible! We can only get things started once we have like 20 nations! If you recruit a nation, and that nation verifies that you recruited them, you gain a seat on the Sealandic Council! We start making decisions at 10 seats. Current seat count:

Nuevo Sealandia: 2
Sasnan: 1
Dantharu: 1
Lazurainia: 1
South Lazurania: 1
Cuatro Tierra: 1
