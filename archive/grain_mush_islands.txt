Welcome to the Grain Mush Islands. The best islands ever created. We grow grain mush. Grain mush is cool.

This nation was founded in 1879, in the Grain Mush Grinder&#39;s Revolt. Grain mush grinders from across the Pacific rose up and created a confederacy. This ultimate libertarian region allows any newcomers to join and has over 12 independent political and social entities within. The eco-friendly Powercard, the football loving Jamaica, the industrial Nafedalbi, the central government of Grain mush, the averagely rated Psyleaf, and much, much more!

This area not only grows grain mush but also has a thriving trout fishing industry. Nations are recommend to endorse Super Dragon and take part in polls.
