[i][b][color=red]Workers of the World, Unite![/color][/b][/i]

We are a panleftist region congregated to unite against the evils of fascism, capitalism, and other ideologies of the bourgeoisie. The establishment of left unity will be withheld and shall not be interrupted by counterrevolutionary activity.

I request aspiring comrades to join a more active leftist region, such as [region]Wintercrest[/region], [region]The Leftist Assembly[/region], or [region]The Internationale[/region]
