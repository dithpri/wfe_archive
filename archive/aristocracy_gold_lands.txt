In an age when chaos devoured the nations and the faith of humankind trembled, a light rose once more from the ashes of the Old World.

From the heart of The Holy Empire of Altimae Novae Romae, the Emperor Altima Magnus Augustus, heir to the Eternal Spirit of Altima Primus, proclaimed a new covenant between nations &#151; a union forged not in weakness, but in divine purpose.

Declaring himself Servant of God and Lord of Humanity, Altima Magnus called upon the strongest and most noble realms to join beneath the Golden Hand, to restore what was lost &#151; order, virtue, and divine civilization.

Thus was born the Aristocracy Gold Lands, a shining fellowship of nations bound by sacred duty and imperial destiny.
