I really don&amp;#39;t have an opinion on the Free Syrian Army. I&amp;#39;ve heard both good things and bad.
I just refounded it because I wanted to make sure the region didn&amp;#39;t fall into the wrong hands.

If you want to join the region and/or tell me what you think about the Free Syrian Army, feel free to TG me.
