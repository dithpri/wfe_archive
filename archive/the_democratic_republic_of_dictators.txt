We are a region of corrupt dictators. When you think about it, all nations in this game are corrupt dictatorships, as stated by [nation]ThePlace[/nation]. The people can try to persuade you, but you&#39;re [i]always[/i] in office and always get the final say in every issue.

Other nations died but they were sadly forgotten.

If you want power in the region, send a telegram to [nation]ThePlace[/nation] with your title and power might be given.
