We are a region of corrupt dictators. When you think about it, all nations in this game are corrupt dictatorships, as stated by [nation]ThePlace[/nation]. The people can try to persuade you, but you&#39;re [i]always[/i] in office and always get the final say in every issue.

To all who join this region, post a mini-bio to the regional message board, to explain a little about yourself. It helps us to know who you are and whether or not to trust you.
