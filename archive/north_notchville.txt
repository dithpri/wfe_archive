North Notchville was re-named a few years ago, it used to be called the North Pompi. In 2001 a man named Sam Notch set out to explore North Pompi, which at the time was unknown. If you wish to read more about his trip I will explain more later in a dispatch, anyway when Sam finished is exploration he was amazed and in 2013 he bought the land and called it Notchvillle, North Notchville. In Notchville there are multiple countries all connected my bridges. Sam&#39;s boat that he used to explore Notchville lays in an old showcase box in the city of Noshishoo, located in Lagzeep.
