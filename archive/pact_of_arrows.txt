The Pact of Arrows is an alliance between third-positionist nations. The third-position is a third way, the first and second being capitalism and communism. Third-positionism includes but not limited to National Syndicalism, National Bolshevism, Strasserism, Falangism and many more ideologies. If one is of no ideology, being third-positionist involves left economic views, with authoritarian views. The goal of the Pact of Arrows is to unite as many third-positionist nations as possible under one region.
