Welcome, Scholars to your regional home! This is a region used particularly for the nations of people who attend CFHS. However, we do allow people outside of that, should they want to join. We ask that if you&#39;re a member of the World Assembly (which we fully support) that you endorse our WA Delegate. Thanks for joining us, and we hope you enjoy your stay with us as Eternal Scholars.

[color=red][b]Nations not endorsing the delegate are asked to leave the region.
Natives are welcome in [region=The Eternal Scholars], our new home.[/color][/b]
