Welcome, Scholars to your regional home! This is a region used particularly for the nations of people who attend CFHS. However, we do allow people outside of that, should they want to join. We ask that if you&#39;re a member of the World Assembly (which we fully support) that you endorse our WA Delegate. Of course, I this isn&#39;t mandatory, we just request it. Also, for those of you who know about wars and other fights between regions, we&#39;re going to wait until we get a more firm grasp on our region before we worry about any sort of inter-regional conflicts. Thanks for joining us, and we hope you enjoy your stay with us as Eternal Scholars.
