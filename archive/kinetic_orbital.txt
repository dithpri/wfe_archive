The main nation, Etresehte, has left for an unknown amount of time. He will return... eventually. Until then Nolvari(me) is the stand-in. This region will be unlocked after i do an over-haul and do the things Etresehte is too lazy to do. Also, if an executive-type things need to be done simply telegram Nolvari and Etresehte will so whatever it is you needed.[/B][/u][/color]
