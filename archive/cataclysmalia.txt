This region is home to two states, The Holy Empire of Autocratic Utopia and the Matriarchy of Bullocktopia. Bullocktopia lies to the East, Autocratic Utopia to the West. Both territories almost connect, save for a small sea separating them. The sea acts a buffer zone protecting the religious Autocratic peoples and the atheist Bullocktopian peoples from constant sparring. There is one island, which is windswept and is the only territory that is claimed by both states.  &amp;quot;The Disputed Territories of The Almost-United States of Stateland&amp;quot;, has claimed independence.

The Queendom of Terra Reginam is to the north and is a quiet nation that [i]seems[/i] to keep itself to itself.
