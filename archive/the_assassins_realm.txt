The citizens of Assassins Realm can all trace their ancestry back to the assassins of Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah. All of their ancestors were in a class known as fida&#39;i aka fedayeen. After the crusades the assassins scattered across the world into hiding. The assassins formed a community of their own that was unknown of until 2017. The communities of assassins keep in touch with each other due to their fear of being killed.They use messenger pigeons to remain in contact. Their creed is &quot;Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted. They Work in the Dark to Protect the Light.
