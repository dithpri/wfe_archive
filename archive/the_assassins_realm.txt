The citizens of Assassins11 can all trace their ancestry back to the assassins of Rukn-ud-Din Khurshah. All of their ancestors were in a class known as fida&#39;i aka fedayeen. After the crusades the assassins scattered across the world into hiding. The assassins formed a community of their own that was unknown of until 2017. The communities of assassins keep in touch with each other due to fear being killed. Their creed is &quot;Nothing is True, Everything is Permitted. They Work in the Dark to Protect the Light.
