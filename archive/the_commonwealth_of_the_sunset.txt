Anthem of The sunset

Prepare to accept responsibility
And to help each other!
Let it be blessed and grow.
Serve and bow down to your country.
Love one another!
The sunset, arise: your flag is waving, your crown!
That is the lure of the three nations.
Your name I shan&#39;t search for.
Hear our prayer for thou unseen.
Be steadfastly righteous!
To God Almighty
Ruler of the isles of the sea
Hearken our call
Protect us
Crown us with liberty
May peace and love reign supreme
Throughout the land.
Promote happiness and unity!
For The sunset, ever The sunset, let our voices ring with pride
For The sunset, ever The sunset, her name hail far and wide,
A land of freedom, hope and glory, to endure what ever befall
May God bless The sunset
Forever more!
