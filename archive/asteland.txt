We are not a role-playing region. We&#39;re open to all sorts, and not a politically aligned region, although we&#39;re a bit more conservative than liberal. In WA terms, I, the founder, don&#39;t play that game, so anyone other than I can work that out amongst themselves- even raider delegates, as long as they don&#39;t go all eject/ban happy or something like that.
Don&#39;t worry, you, founder, because I, delegate, will keep this region safe!!!
