We are not a role-playing region. We&amp;#39;re open to all sorts, and not a politically aligned region at all, although we&amp;#39;re a bit more conservative than liberal. In WA terms, I, the founder, don&amp;#39;t play that game, so anyone other than I can work that out amongst themselves- even raider delegates, as long as they don&amp;#39;t go all eject/ban happy or something like that.
