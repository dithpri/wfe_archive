Today&#39;s Quote:
&quot;This Imperium is ours. We fought for it. We built it with blood and sweat and wrath. We forged it with the lands we took. The empire is built upon foundations of our brothers&#39; bones...We didn&#39;t rebel out of petty spite, SpringArcher. We rebelled because our Lord and master played us false. We were useful tools to bring the galaxy to heel, but He would have cleansed us from the Imperium the way He purged the Thunder Legion before us, wiping us all from history like mud from His golden boots.&quot;
