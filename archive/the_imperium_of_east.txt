Greeting members of the Imperium!

Today marked our first meeting of the League Of Nations. And I think it is safe to say that it went well. I expect great things from everyone in the future. 

Also starting now there will be daily quotes...so here ya go:

&quot;You can never have too many enemies. The more you&#39;ve got, the more likely they are to get in each other&#39;s way.&quot;
