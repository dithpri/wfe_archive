Greeting members of the Imperium!

Today we address the issue of who is, and who isn&#39;t in the Imperium. And we may possibly discuss an issue.

Today&#39;s Quote:
&quot;The region was in flames and crowded with pyromaniacs eager to claim possession of the ashes. Bile had no interest in the conflagration, its cause or celebrants. Let the region burn. From its ashes would rise a new future.&quot;
