Greeting members of the Imperium!
Issues are being discussed by individual classes with own issues that they have come up with. However, some have been postponed until the league returns from hiatus. Merry December Holiday!

Today&#39;s Quote:
&quot;The Imperium! How mighty its aspect! How far-reaching its boundaries! As one nation dies ten more are brought into the fold. Fear us, for we count the lives of nations, not men!&quot;
