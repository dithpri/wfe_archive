INTERNATIONAL [color=red]ANTICO[/color]MMUNIST ACTION

[color=red]Antico[/color] is the result and continuing work of the [color=red]Antico[/color]mmunists of NationStates that extends back hours. From past and present, several organisations and individual allies have participated in one cause that unites them. Their determination to smash Communism in NationStates. Their [color=red]Antico[/color]mmunist activism in NationStates will lead to over three hundred anarchist and Communist regions and growing being confiscated and turned into anti-communist and anti-anarchist regions, never again to be used as platforms of hate.

We welcome embassies with all who stand against Communism.

Dedicated to the people who have lost their lives fighting against Communism and to all those who have suffered at the hands of Communism.
