A Texas farmer got an elephant as a bonus prize when he was the winning bidder on a grand piano.

Producer Bob Stewart intended it as a joke (the elephant was to supply extra ivory) and planned on giving the contestant a hefty $4,000 cash equivalent instead.

Turned out the guy wanted the pachyderm anyway, and Stewart was forced to fly one in from Kenya.
