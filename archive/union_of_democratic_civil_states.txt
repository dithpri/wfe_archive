The UDCS is a group of nations from all over the continent that support the voice of the people and the absence of corruption in business and government. A majority of business and services are run by the moral state and serve all regardless of race, gender, or class. The private sector is run by honest businessmen and is separated from the government to prevent corruption. The UDCS also supports environmental protection and usage of hydroelectric power and wind power, therefore limited usage of nuclear and fossil fuels. While a pacifist union, members of the UDCS retain powerful armies and are willing to fight to keep the neighboring countries free from corruption and tyranny.
