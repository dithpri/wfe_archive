A collection of independent nations that relocated in their entirety to nearby islands from their original homelands.

Due to lack of sufficient land, these nations have taken to utilizing large areas under water; building farms, mines, various infrastructure, and even cities on the ocean floor.

Because of this submarine culture, this region has become known as [color=blue][b]Maridia[/b][/color].
