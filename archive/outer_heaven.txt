[i]&amp;quot;We will forsake our countries.  We will leave our motherlands behind us, and become one with this earth.  We have no nation, no philosophy, no ideology.  We go where we&amp;#39;re needed: fighting not for country, not for government, but for ourselves.

We need no reason to fight; we fight, because we are needed.  We will be the deterrent for those with no other recourse.  We are soldiers without borders: our purpose defined by the era we live in.

We will sometimes have to sell ourselves, and services.  If the times demand it, we&amp;#39;ll be revolutionaries; criminals; terrorists.  And yes, we may all be headed straight to hell.  But what better place for us than this?  It is our only home; our heaven, and our hell.
