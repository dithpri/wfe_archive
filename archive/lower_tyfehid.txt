Lower Tyfehid is a temperate-to-frigid region. Rolling grasslands dominate much of the countryside. Typically lazy rivers cross the land, creating homes for many endemic species of fish. Mountains crown the horizon of Lower Tyfehid while dense forests crowd the mountains&amp;#39; bases. The lush forests and mineral-rich mountains offer a plethora of natural resources which have allowed the natives to mature into civilized Industrial powerhouses.
