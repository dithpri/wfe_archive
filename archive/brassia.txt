This is where Brasland&#39;s nations have come to die. To my friends in Western Atlantic, you can keep the genealogies and storylines if you want. I apologize for my abrupt departure, especially to [nation]Excalbia[/nation], who has been a good friend. Things in RL are complicated and I don&#39;t want to explain or complain, so a sudden disappearance seemed like the best option. This decision is final.
