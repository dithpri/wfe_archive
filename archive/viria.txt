Viria is the war-ravaged land governed by one of the many Virian states.
In the beginning, there were 6 Virian states in existence. Now there are only 2 pure Virian states, however the region is also inhabited by other nations.

The Protectorate of Fal Viria recreated the Virian High Council 13 years after civil war tore the nations apart.
