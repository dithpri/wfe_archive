Weastern Uranus is a small island in the middle of a gulf with no name. This island is comprised of many small nations. The most notable being &amp;quot;The Dictatorship of Sylovius&amp;quot;, a sprawling, communist, ruthless nation. All other nations on the island live constantly in fear of being conquered. Especially &amp;quot;The Borderlands of Northern Sylovius&amp;quot;, which is filled with refugees following The Sylovian Civil War. After the &amp;quot;Armed Civil War&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Southern Armed Nation of Arms&amp;quot; split from &amp;quot;The Armed Nation of Arms&amp;quot; due to a massive ethical disagreement in mercenary policies.

The World Assembly delegate is &amp;quot;The Borderlands of Northern Sylovius&amp;quot;.
