[b][color=#303421]What&#39;s that sound, you ask?
It&#39;s the sound of our shovels, sinking into grass.
It is us, the gravediggers, with this lonely task,
Of making the bed where our comrades sleep their last.[/color][/b]

This lonely region houses the nation of gravediggers that manage the graveyard for fallen Crackerish Legionaries, and any legionaries that have been buried there within the last two months. 

Most of the time, this region will be a barren wasteland. Don&#39;t request embassies, no one will be around to accept or reject them.
