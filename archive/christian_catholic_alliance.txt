[b]Welcome to this humble region, created for the purpose of promoting fellowship among Catholic Christians.[/b]

For those who come, we hope, above all, for [b]strict adherence to the Doctrine of the Church, which is One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic, a doctrine by which we must guide our spiritual life and our actions.[/b]

To non-Catholic members, it&#39;s expected [b]respect, good manners and the common sense of not coming to spread their beliefs in this region.[/b]

[u]Lack of respect, blasphemies, slander, propagation of heresies and other ideas that hurt the Christian Faith and the Holy Church will not be tolerated and their authors banned in case of refusal to remove the declarations.[/u]

[b]Ad maiorem Dei gloriam![/b]
