The Creaturae region is home to many nations of varying sizes. At the time of conception, the creature Region is home to five empires: Naga, Futa, Succubus, Amazonia, and Dragonia. These five nations have been isolated even from each other for many years, but, as their borders began to blend, they joined together to form the Creaturae region, in which they will work together for the benefit of every nation in the Creaturae region.
