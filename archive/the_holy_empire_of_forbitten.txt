We are the Holy Empire of Forbitten. We speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.
We give to the people - a white oak seed. And white oak trees are what everyone needs.

Plant a new tree. Treat it with care. Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air. Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.

Then the gods and their saviours might just come all back.

We the tribes of Forbitten plant a white oak tree of peace.
