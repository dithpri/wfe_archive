After the Great War against the Russian and Chinese Commies the United States of America scattered into smaller countries and began to war with each other for lands and power.However The Allied states of Massachussets thought it would be smarter to unite the smaller states surrounding it.And so in the year 2199 the East Coast Treaty was signed by the Republic of the Northern East Coast(Maine,New Hampshire,Vermont),the Commonwealth of Connecticut(Connecticut,Rhode Island) and the Allied States of Massachussets.In the year 2203 New York joined the alliance.
