The Grey Earth Highlands is not a region to be taken lightly, between harsh, hot, dry summers, and freezing cold winters, but the people continue to prosper in their own hearty way. The region has long been under the control of many dictatorships, and is coming out of the last century with scars to show for it. It is currently controlled by the oldest nation of the area, The Republic of Rentalin. 
Although it has radically different ideals than the region of the Grand Red Isles, it does share as oceanic boarder with them, and maintains an Embassy there, and vice versa.
