&quot;Call of People!&quot; We stand proud with out brothers! We will not fall! Let yesterday be our failure, today our learning, and tomorrow our victory!

&quot;Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of the men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory.&#148; ~General Patton
