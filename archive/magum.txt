[b]Welcome to Magum![/b] A great area full of life, Magum has been the centre of attention on Terramens for centuries. It is here that nations become great, and it is here that true power arises.
We aim for Magum to try and be as friendly as possible, to have fun in this game, and to help build great nations! Feel free to look around at our regional map,to discuss your latest political exploits with other nations in the region, and have fun in the role play (which will be uploaded soon).
