[i][color=#003087]They say that nobody bats 1.000, but you look at us and the lineup we have out on the field today, and then you look at other region&#39;s teams and you can clearly see that isn&#39;t always the case. 

Between [nation]Malphe[/nation]&#39;s four-hit pitching performance, [nation]Goatentah[/nation]&#39;s solo home run, and [nation]Palutenia[/nation]&#39;s speedy baserunning, it looks like the only team the [region]Regional Representative Realm[/region] will be representing will be [nation]Bobberino[/nation] and [nation]Francois Isidore[/nation]&#39;s[/color] [b][color=#E4002C]BRONX BOMBERS![/color][/i][/b] [b]... Sorry about your luck, natives. But, with an ERA of 5.00+ on the day what can you really expect? This region has been defeated by the old-time Highlanders, hailing from the North Pacific Army (N.P.A)![/b]
