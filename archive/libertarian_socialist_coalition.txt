The LSC is a group of nations that share the principles [i]of freedom, equality, and fraternity[/i]. It&#39;s a group that, so long as your nation is a socialist system (even if it claims you to be liberal), and has an at least average civil and political rights index, you&#39;re free to join. We&#39;re against fascist nations, and one of the primary goals is to keep fascist nations out of our socialist democracies. To do this, we are also willing to work with authoritarian socialist regions. Since many of them have greater firepower; and of course, we don&#39;t like sectarianism with other socialists. However, let me make this [i]very[/i] clear, [b]we are not interested in invading other nations, or collaborating with other regions to invade other regions[/b].
