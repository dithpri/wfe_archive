&amp;#39;The Island of Clopenstein&amp;#39; is a large, magical island located in a vast, unknown ocean, on a planet in a distant galaxy.

The warm, sunny island contains many gentle rivers, small lakes, lush forests teaming with life, and great plains of light green grass and colorful flowers. The island is inhabited by a variety of species of safe plants and peaceful animals; such as various fruit trees, berry bushes, unicorns, dragons, tigers, bears, dogs, and animal-human hybrids (furries) to name a few.

Due to a mysterious and magical force that engulfs not only the island, but the entire galaxy, every living thing is significantly more lustful, and mating-oriented. As a result, the sight, sound, smell, and feel of erotic sex saturates the entire island.
