The Black Riders have been pushed out in Lord Joj&amp;#39;s name! The loyal Sus shall never falter! 

The tyrants banned Joj worship, yet it has been legalized! Please, return to your homes and enjoy your new lives, bathed in the light of Joj! The yearly pilgrimages to Joshiland are beginning very soon, so prepare your religious garb. Lord Joj of the Sus awaits! Praise Joj!
