HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Okay, enough yelling. Welcome to my region. Have a good stay! Also, if you need me, telegram me, or my alt account, [nation]Naloma[/nation]. I&#39;d be happy to help! There are a few rules here. Rule 1, don&#39;t act like a jerk, or you will be banned. Rule 2, be active a LOT. Nations that are not active for over 3 days will be ejected, but not banned. Finally, Rule 3, ummmmmmmmm, I haven&#39;t made Rule 3 yet.
