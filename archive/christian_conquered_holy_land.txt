This is the Holy Land of Jesus Christ.

The Holy Land was retaken by Pope Miduel Hadoo Gogo on the 13th Crusade of the year 1717. This remains to be the crusade that has had the longest lasting Christian rule over the Holy Land after it was taken over.

The Holy Land has been entirely rid of heathens, infidels, saracens, heretics, etc. Only Christians occupy the Holy Land. And only Christians rule the Holy Land.

God bless, Amen.
