[b][color=purple]Welcome to the Holy Land; controlled by its rightful owners - the Christians![/color]

[color=blue]Finally, at long last, the Christians rule the Holy Land! Bask in the grace of God and praise His everlasting glory! Give thanks to Jesus Christ for His undying love and forgiveness! [/color]

[color=brown] The Holy Land is open to all Christian nations that pledge their loyalty to God. If you wish to gain access all you must do is ask, for the Bible says, &quot;Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.&quot; (Matthew 7: 7-8) [/color]
