We the People of the Batnationist Religion, in Order to form the ultimate cigar-smoking world, establish hazy [from the smoky abyss] Justice, talk about how women suck and rock at the same time, provide for the blind hatred of France, North Korea, and Al-Qaeda, promote the generals of the armed forces to field marshals and the fact that Brian Cooney and Nick Trotter have final say in&#133;everything, and secure the Blessings of Coca-Cola to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Batnationist Religion&#133;with liberty and premium cigars for all.
&#147;If you vote for me&#133;all of your wildest dreams will come true.&#148;
