[b]Summary:[/b] [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball]Magic Eight Ball[/url] is a region controlled pretty much in toto by a [url=http://www.ngenerator.com/?p=nrnd]Random Number Generator[/url]. Indeed, its very existence is the result of a simple binary roll. The [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=random_choices]Founder&amp;#39;s Nation[/url] has been governed in just that fashion since its inception by seeding the RNG with 0 to X number of issue choices daily. As for the region, if the RNG decides it&amp;#39;s a good day for diplomacy, a roll on the total number of [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=list_regions]Regions[/url] will decide which one receives an offer to exchange embassies. Unsolicited embassies or new member requests (both highly unlikely, to be sure) may or may not be subject to the RNG. Nothing personal, you understand...
