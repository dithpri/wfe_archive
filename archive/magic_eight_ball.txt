[b]Magic Eight Ball[/b] is a region controlled in toto by a [url=https://www.random.org/]Random Number Generator[/url]. The Founder Nation is also governed in such a fashion by seeding the RNG with 0 to N number of issue choices daily. As for the region, if the M8B decides it&#39;s a good day for diplomacy, a roll on the Regions will decide which receives an offer to exchange embassies. Most of our RMB content is randomly generated as well and posting is extended to all embassy nations. Feel free to use or abuse it...
