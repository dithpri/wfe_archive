[b]Summary:[/b] [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball]Magic Eight Ball[/url] is a region controlled pretty much [i]in toto[/i] by a [url=http://www.ngenerator.com/?p=nrnd]Random Number Generator[/url]. The [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=random_choices]Founder&amp;#39;s Nation[/url] has been governed in just that fashion since its inception by seeding the RNG with 0 to N number of issue choices daily. As for the region, if the RNG decides it&amp;#39;s a good day for diplomacy, a roll on the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=list_regions/sort=alpha]Regions[/url] will decide which one receives an offer to exchange embassies. Most of our RMB content is randomly generated as well and posting is extended to all embassy nations. Feel free to use or abuse it...
