[hr]&quot;If you knew what was going to happen, if you knew everything that was going to happen next&#151;if you knew in advance the consequences of your own actions&#151;you&#39;d be doomed. You&#39;d be ruined as God. You&#39;d be a stone. You&#39;d never eat or drink or laugh or get out of bed in the morning. You&#39;d never love anyone, ever again. You&#39;d never dare to.&quot; [hr][/color]
