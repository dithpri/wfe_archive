After the small and rising region known as the [region]Heirs of Rome[/region] was invaded and occupied, a small body of former members banded together to refound the region. From these troubled origins, we have, phoenix-like emerged! All newcomers are welcome! The first elections have concluded and the drafting of a new constitution is underway! Welcome to [region]The Heirs of Rome[/region], and please enjoy your stay!
