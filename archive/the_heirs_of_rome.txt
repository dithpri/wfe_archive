After the small and rising region knows as the [region]Heirs of Rome[/region] was invaded and occupied, a small body of former members banded together to refound the region. From these troubled origins, we have emerged. All newcomers are welcome! We hope to establish a democratic republic here, to give each of you a say in how your region operates. The first elections will begin in no time, as we rapidly move to become a region for and by it&#39;s people. Welcome to [region]The Heirs of Rome[/region], and please enjoy your stay!
