This region is the new home for those ejected from the old [region]Heirs of Rome[/region]. All newcomers are welcome! We hope to establish a democratic republic here, to give each of you a say in how your region operates. We are in a difficult situation at the moment, as we grapple with the tumult of refounding, but stick with us, and we&#146;ll all prosper!
