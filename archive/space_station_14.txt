With the Founder, The Dictatorship of Concoshut, having faded from the maps, the dust is finally settling down in the military bases across the region and peace is once again established across the region. After votings were tallied, the Republic of Crescellia now leads the region. However, will his proposals and actions acquire this objective? Or will we seen see this peace collapse and a new Region-wide War begin?

Elected Leadership of the Region:

Leader: Republic of Crescellia

WA Delagate: Hippies of Relpettia

Commander of the Regional Forces: TBD
