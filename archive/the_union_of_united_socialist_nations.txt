[b]Annexed by the crusaders and knights of  [region]Genua[/region][/b]

GENUA RISES!

OUR FLAG FLIES HIGH; WITH RANKS TIGHTLY CLOSED
OUR BATTALIONS MARCH; BOLDLY TOWARDS OUR FOES
COMRADES FELLED BY ANTI-FA AND THE INTERNATIONALE
MARCH WITH US AS WE RALLY!

CLEAR THE STREET; AS WE MAKE OUR STAND!
FOR BLOOD AND SOIL; WE FIGHT FOR OUR LANDS
ALL THOSE THAT FIGHT AGAINST OUR MACE
SHALL MEET THEIR FATE; FACE TO FACE

THE CALL TO BATTLE; WILL NOW SOUND!
ELITE GENUANS ARE UNBOUND
THE TIME IS NOW; TO HONE OUR SKILL
FOR LOVE OF NATION; OUR QUIVERS WE FILL

OUR FLAG FLIES HIGH; WITH RANKS TIGHTLY CLOSED
OUR BATTALIONS MARCH; BOLDLY TOWARDS OUR FOES
COMRADES FELLED BY ANTI-FA; AND THE INTERNATIONALE
MARCH WITH US AS WE RALLY!
