Oh hi!

It seems like you were going to be raided. Like, particularly hard. So we took it upon ourselves to defend your little region from the bad guys. You&#39;re welcome.

[i]Now that we&#39;ve got you here[/i], we&#39;d like to take a moment and talk to you about the word of [color=pink]She Who Sleeps[/color]. For only the small price of you unwavering devotion and mortal body, you too can be a part of the Cult of [region]Simulacrum[/region] and follow [b]Whisper[/b] into the Great Below.

Let us know. :3
-High Priestess of [region]Simulacrum[/region]
