A collection of 211 islands bound together by a trade agreement. Individual systems can vary, but on average a lot like the Ferangis from Star Trek. Regional laws are set out in the Spudd manisfest, which can only directly be changed by the Founder, but is extremely open to petition. Reginal order is carried out by EABPD, our police unit.
