Welcome to [b]Aperture Laboratories: The Bar On The Corner Of Every Region Branch[/b]!

Where you can test, test, test, test again, test some more, get killed, get regenerated, be a personality construct, create testing tracks, make science, argue with the Central Core, fall off management rails and sleep for thousands of years in a extended relaxation center.
Or obey normal sane reasoning: run away.

Central Core: GLADOS (Well duh, what did you expect?)
