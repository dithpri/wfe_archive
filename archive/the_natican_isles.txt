The Natican Isles are two connected small strips of land located in the South Pacific Ocean. The main sights are North and South Stria Natica, but other countries are quite fascinating too. There&#39;s a little piece of land known as Hermitown in Paratevinasisce, and that part has the most control of every country. Every nation is welcome, no matter Communists or New York Crimes So-Called Democracy. Free fun in this land!
