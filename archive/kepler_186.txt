A young but thriving solar system full of planets of varying technology and ideologies. The planets of this system have varied orbits, but are all inhabited. Each planet is a type zero to type 1 civilization, as no type 2 has yet emerged. 

Interactions between planets are expected to be civil and respectful, however, conflict may arise through sheer differences... Time will tell.
