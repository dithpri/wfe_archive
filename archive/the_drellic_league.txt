Grimlorn; In Goblinic tongue, this word is Home; And Grimlorn is home to many; Mythic creatures and peoples fill this land, as well as Humans and Beastfolk; The Drells are a continent primarily run by Beastfolk (furries, if you will) after the uprising against the Imperial Elves drove the Empire off the continent and into the Isles of the Blemmyae; Bovinians and Rattons hold the scene at the top, where Tradition and Industry clash and collide; This is a land with varying themes and technology; where Privateers still loot along the coasts, yet Airships and trains are becoming prevalent; Where the rest of the world seemingly doesn&amp;#39;t matter, the Drells are upon the world stage.
