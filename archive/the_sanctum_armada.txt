Welcome aboard one of the mighty Fleet Carriers of which you and your nation can come in and develop. aboard these massive 500KM long vessels, your nation can be well sustained in four massive cities with enough wildlife and scenery to feel and believe you&#39;re on a planet. for every nation that joins the armada, there will be either an undesignated fleet carrier renamed to fit your nation, or a new one constructed specifically to accommodate such. as of right now, there are currently 20 unclaimed fleet carriers outside of the Sanctum, the largest fleet carrier to exist.
