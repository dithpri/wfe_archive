[b]Plus ultra (English: Further beyond) is a Latin phrase and the national motto of Spain. It is taken from the personal motto of Charles V (24 February 1500 &#150; 21 September 1558), Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain (as Charles I), and is a reversal of the original phrase Non terrae plus ultra (&quot;No land further beyond&quot;). This was said to have been inscribed as a warning on the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, which marked the edge of the known world. Charles adopted the motto following the discovery of the New World by Columbus, and it also has metaphorical suggestions of taking risks and striving for excellence.[/b] -[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_ultra]Wikipedia[/url]
