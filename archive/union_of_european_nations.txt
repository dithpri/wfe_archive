The perfect region for anyone looking to gain power quickly.
The flag is quite meaningful. The cyan background and black border signify that Dus Osts&#39;s leader started the region. The red star signifies all members against the rest of the world and specifically, the world assembly (which all members must join). The three yellow stripes represent the three previous regions our founder has been in. Join the Union of European Nations and make your mark on our flag!
