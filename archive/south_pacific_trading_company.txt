[i]Roleplay your nation&#39;s leaders to trade services - but instead of trading roleplay goods, you&#39;re trading tangible services for the region and each other! It&#39;s a great way to get involved in the South Pacific.[/i]

All official communications must be done by officials of nations in [region]the South Pacific[/region] posting on our Regional Message Board:
- Apply to be a client nation
- Offer a service to trade
- Request a service to trade
- Petition for or against local ordinances in the South Pacific

... and remember, it&#39;s just good business!
