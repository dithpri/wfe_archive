[i]On January 1, 2025, there was an apocalypse. Meteors full of water crashed in all over the place. No one knows where the meteors came from. Billions of people died. Those that remained moved to New Mount Everest (Mount Everest, but it has been turned into an island).

Mount Everest becoming an island made Tianqiu lose its connection to the White Dot Garden, Tianqiu&#146;s divine protectors. The sky is always covered with clouds. The 1000 people on the tiny island managed to survive, but if they don&#146;t reunite the other survivors soon, Tianqiu could be destroyed by a darker force. And that&#146;s where New Mount Everestball comes in.[/i]
