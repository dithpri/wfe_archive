[i][b][color=blue]&amp;#10054; Welcome to the planet of Tianqiu (&amp;#22825;&amp;#29699;)! &amp;#10054;[/color][/b][/i]

[color=jade]&amp;#10053; Here, we revere the sky. Each star in the White Dot Garden is the spirit of a honorable being. The brightest stars are the gods that protect Tianqiu. &amp;#10053;[/color]

[color=sapphire]&amp;#6675; Mountains are gateways between the Garden and the Ground. They let us communicate and even visit our ancestors. Most nations here are based on mountain ranges. &amp;#6675;[/color]

[color=#000070]&amp;#78237; Landlocked seas&#133;are haunted. The Dead Sea is a gateway to&#133;the Other Place. Don&#146;t go there. &amp;#78239;[/color]

[color=gray]&amp;#8962; We love skyscrapers! Burj Khalifa? Introducing&#133;Everestia Trade Center (2828 m)! &amp;#8962;[/color]
