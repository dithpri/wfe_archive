The Place where Weddel was originally founded, the Weddelian Homelands consist of 5 different countries. Of course, they are all very unique and different in their own ways, and have parted because of their odd history.

The 5 countries that have settled down here are Weddel, Weedsle, Whackle, Wentle, and Omle. Weddel is Left-Leaning, Weedsle is efficent and oppressive, Whackle is entirely random, Wentle is the stable and safest, and Omle is the most philosophical. Some of them live happily together, some have rivalries, and others have a lot of power.
