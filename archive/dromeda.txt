[color=green][b]Welcome to the Dromedan Empire!!![/b][/color]
[color=blue][b]Under the protectorate of[/color] [nation=long]the Sunsingers[/nation][/b]

[b]We are a small region ruled by the Empress, protected by the Vanguard and driven by the fire of the stars. Under her rule and the Vanguard&#39;s might, we shall live in peace and prosperity under the starlight, secluded from the warring ways of the outside world. However, if one shall threaten Her Grace&#39;s soverignties, the full force of our power shall smite it. The stars shine favorably upon these lands and may they shine favorably upon your&#39;s.[/b]
