Assulm Umberra - Land of a 1000 shrines

A hilly region with a plethora of swamps, untamed hilly landscapes and a great number of small towns hidden in fertile valleys. Each cross road displays a shrine in the center, and along most paths are positioned smaller shrines and statues. Pilgrims are seen often, as semi-nomadic people move about due to reasons of faith or season.
