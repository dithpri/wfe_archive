Hello And Welcome! I Am Your Host ShadowPlayz. How To Play: You May Pick One Planet Of Your Choice And Color. Once You Have Done That Start Roleplaying. Attacking: You May Attack A Gray Planet, But They As Strong As You And As Smart. They Are Under Control Another Tribe Until They Have Fallen. If You Attack Another Player, You Must Have Good Reason Why. You Can Build Anything As Long As It Isn&#39;t To Powerful, By That I Mean It Can&#39;t Blow Up A Planet In One Shot. Have Fun And Please Enjoy Your Star Here.
