[b]11-02-&amp;#39;14:[/b] A new proposal in the Senate [url=http://z13.invisionfree.com/Altera/index.php?showtopic=221]The World Assembly Act[/url] is looking to reform the way the region deals with WA issues. If passed the Delegate position will be up for grabs by anyone able to raise the right number of endorsements, an on forum debate will be had over WA proposals and the regions stance decided by vote which the delegate will have to follow. Penalties for non-compliance are also included.
