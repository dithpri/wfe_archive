[color=red][b]WELCOME TO THE MULTIVERSAL IMPERIAL FEDERATION[/b][/color]
[hr]
[color=gold]The MIF is a monarchist region, functioning essentially as a loosely held federation like the Commonwealth, in which the Emperor is the head of state of all nations in the MIF, while each has its sovereign governments and sub-monarchs. We invite all monarchies, absolute, constitutional, and anything in between, His Majesty respects nationals sovereignty and will allow diverse monarchies within the Federation. Elections will be held for the Imperial Council regularly[/color]
