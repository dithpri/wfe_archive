To all in the Violation of the Cause,

I have sad tidings. Our beloved founder, Dark Lord Jacob of the Black Flame Dragons, has perished. I, President Axel of the Federation of Axelian, will take it upon myself to run our glorious nation until a fit leader has been chosen, if one can be found. Nothing will change. Our goals remain the same. If anyone would like to apply to become the new leader, send me a telegram and I will conduct an interview.

Thank you, and have a glorious day.

President Axel
