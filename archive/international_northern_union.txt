[b][u][color=orange]Welcome to the INU![/color][/b][/u]

[u]The INU is a sister region of:[/u]
--[region]International Western Union[/region] (the mother region)
--[region]International Eastern Union[/region]
--[region]International Southern Union[/region]
--[region]International Arctic Union[/region]

[u]About the INU:[/u]
&amp;gt;When 10-15 nations are recruited into the INU, we will begin forming a regional government. 
&amp;gt;This region is to be democratic; elections and referenda will be protected.
&amp;gt;When 40 nations are reached, the INU will begin work to establish governmental connections with the IWU, IAU, ISU, and IEU.
&amp;gt;I will begin working on a regional map shortly; your nations can be placed on this map when it is ready.
