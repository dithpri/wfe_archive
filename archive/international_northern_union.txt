Welcome to the International Northern Union.

The INU merged into the International Northwestern Union on August 18-25th, 2014.

During its 365 days of service, the INU was a beacon of determination and a powerful symbol of small-region strength, hosting over 100 WA members at its peak.

On June 7th, 2014, the fledgling INUDO, backed by allied forces, made a fateful attempt to rescue Hogwarts, in the absence of aid from other defenders. An account of the operation remains in Zwotstyg&#39;s The Global Dilemma.

The INU salutes its original sister regions--the IWU, the IAU, and the ISU--its loyal allies, Strategos Prime and Die Nord Reichweite--and most importantly, every proud INUit that ever served under the banner of the International Northern Union.
