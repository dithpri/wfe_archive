[b][u][color=blue]Welcome to [i]the[/i] International Northern Union.[/color][/b][/u]

The INU merged into the [b][region]International Northwestern Union[/region][/b] on August 18-25, 2014.

During its 365 days of service, the INU was a beacon of determination and a powerful symbol of small-region strength, hosting over 100 WA members at its peak.

On June 7th, 2014, the fledgling INUDO, backed by allied forces, made a fateful attempt to rescue [region]Hogwarts[/region], in the absence of aid from other defenders. An account of the operation remains in [nation=short]Zwotstyg[/nation]&amp;#39;s [i][url=http://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=266290]The Hogwarts Dilemma.[/url][/i]

The INU salutes its original sister regions--the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=international_western_union]IWU[/url], the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=international_arctic_union]IAU[/url], and the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/region=international_southern_union]ISU[/url]--its loyal allies, [region]Strategos Prime[/region] and [region]Die Nord Reichweite[/region]--and most importantly, every proud INUit that ever served under the banner of the International Northern Union.
