[b][u][color=blue]Welcome to [i]the[/i] International Northern Union.[/color][/b][/u]

The INU is now being restored! 

Efforts to establish a new government or reinstate the previous system will be taken shortly, once a sufficient number of nations are present to help guide the process. Similar work will be done soon regarding the regional map, forum, website, and more.

A salute to those INUits who will return here to help restore what was once the pride of 150 people.

Proudly an INUit,
