[b][u][color=orange]Welcome to the INU![/color][/b][/u]

The [region]International Northern Union[/region] (INU) is a sister region to the [region]International Western Union[/region]. Once this region becomes developed and organized well enough, governmental connections will be established with the IWU.

When 10-15 nations are recruited into the INU, we can begin to work on forming a regional government. This region is to be democratic one; the authority of the founder will be used no further than to change this factbook, establish embassies, and eject nations that post inappropriate content.
