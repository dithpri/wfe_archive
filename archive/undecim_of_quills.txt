The Undecim of Quills, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Quills&quot;, was founded by the grand council. Of variegated philosophies, the only apparent shared value of the council is open forum discussions and a love of fish.

The Quills is on the small yet diverse Island of NIMH. It is surrounded by a great redd wall. A common declaration by its residents is &quot;We are not all mice and men.&quot;
