The Dirkin Empire is small but growing Region. We are a very Political region that runs a parlement style form of politics but is a bit different. We have two areas The House of Highs and the Maes: The Highs are the one who discuss and create new regional laws while the Maes are the ones who approve of these laws with a vote. If majority says yes to the new law it is passed to me which I accept or decline the law but can do the process one more time expect 75% of the house of Highs and The Maes have to accept on it and it will go into place.
