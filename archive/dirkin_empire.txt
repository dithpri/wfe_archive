[b]The Dirkin Empire is small but growing Region. We are a very Political region that runs a parlement style form of politics but is a bit different. 
We have two areas of parlement [color=blue]The House of Highs[/color] and the [color=red]Maes[/color]: 
[list=1]
[*][color=blue][i]The Highs[/color] are the one who discuss and create new regional laws[/i]
[*][color=red][i]The Maes[/color] are the ones who approve of these laws with a vote.[/i]
[/list]
If majority says yes to the new law it is passed to me which[u][color=purple] I accept or decline the law[/color][/u][color=red] but[/color] can do the process one more time expect 75% of [color=blue]The House of Highs[/color] and[color=red] The Maes[/color] have to accept on it and it will go into place.
