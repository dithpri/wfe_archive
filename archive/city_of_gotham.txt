I pray to that your nations were strong enough to fend of the raiders.  The region is weak and I am sorry for that.  When I gained control of the region its infrastructure was already crumbling.  New leadership is needed as well as new blood.  That is why I took the password off a month ago.  It left us unguarded but it was our only choice.  We can not sit ideally by as the region falls into obscurity as nation after nation turns to anarchy and cassis to exist.  Will no one step up and save the region?
