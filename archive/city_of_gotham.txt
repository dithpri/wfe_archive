[b]The City of Got Ham[/b]

Two friends decided to make the sandwich. One asked the other, &amp;quot;Got ham?&amp;quot;
And, the hallowed lands where this question was asked grew into a city. A city by the name of Got Ham. Although, soon the original question was forgotten and the name contracted to [region]City of Gotham[/region].

The citizens worship ham as their chief source of protein and enjoy it with eggs and cheese.

[i]&amp;quot;Long live ham!&amp;quot;[/i]

The current Regional Delegate [nation]Rewqa[/nation] is a big fan of ham.

[nation]Bishwood[/nation] is currently launching a rebellion against the Delegacy of [nation]Rewqa[/nation]. The citizens hope that whatever the outcome, the administration of [region]City of Gotham[/region] will continue to support ham as the city&amp;#39;s official protein source.
