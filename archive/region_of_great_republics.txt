[b][u]Welcome to the Region of Great Republics![/u][/b]
Hello! I can see that you have stumbled across this small region, the [b]Region of Great Republics[/b].

The Region of Great Republics is a neutral region that is for nations that don&#39;t want the stress of a big region. I should know, because I was once a part of one of the largest regions in the game and they were always bugging you and making you participate in all of these different things, no matter what. Well this is different. This region is a very small one, sure, but we hope to rise to become one of the most respected regions out there. It is also meant to teach new players and become a great nation! And we can do that by you joining. See info below on how to join.
