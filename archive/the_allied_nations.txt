[b]Welcome to the Allied Nations![/b]
The Allied Nations is a international organization created shortly after the Great War. The Allied Nations welcomes any type of country, weather they are Fascist, Communist or Democratic Nations. You can show us your nations history or do role-play here, as well as tell us news and events of your country. The Allied Nations represents that nations can set aside their political differences and work towards a common goal.

Hope you will join us and enjoy this region.
