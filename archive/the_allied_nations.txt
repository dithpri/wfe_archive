[b]Welcome to the Allied Nations![/b]
The Allied Nations is a international organization serving the same purpose like it&#39;s counterpart United Nations. The Allied Nations welcomes any type of country, doesn&#39;t matter their polices, government type and ideologies. You can show us your nation&#39;s stories or do RP here. The Allied Nations represents the idea that all nations can set aside their political differences and work towards a common goal.

Hope you will join us and enjoy this region.
We accept any regional embassy request as long as that region isn&#39;t any kind of invader. 

Talk to [nation]The Crowns of Poland and Lithuania[/nation] for a place in our RP and [nation]Grand Indochina[/nation] about the region map, if you want a claim.
