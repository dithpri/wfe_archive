The Allied Nations is a alternative version of the real-world United Nations. The Allied Nations welcomes any type of country, wherever they are Fascist, Communist or Democratic Nations. You can show us your nations history or do role-play here, as well as tell us news and events of your country. The Allied Nations represents that nations can set aside their political differences and work towards a common goal. The Allies is to stand for unity of NS nations and Regions
