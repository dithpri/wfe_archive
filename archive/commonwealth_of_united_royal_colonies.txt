Welcome to the United Royal Colonies or URC for short. Im Lord Billingsly Cottonworth Weserberkshire, royal duke and official royal emissary of our great Union.
It is my pleasure to greet your Nation and your people in the name of her majesty.

We are a union of Colonies, Dominions and Nations with loyal ties to our great ol&#39; homeland the UK. If you are a fellow colony which still values our great monarchy then feel welcome to the colonial union of the greatest empire of the world. Every colony is welcomed to join our splendid way of living.
