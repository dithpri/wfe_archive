The IDL is a super-hardline Communist terrorist organization formerly existing as the foreign operations arm of the Democratic Republic of Liberated Free Nations. Its goals are the resurrection of the DRLFN as a unitary state and the subsequent imposition of its single-party system all over the world. Ideologically, it regards the existence of multiple communist parties, organizations, and states as being opposed to Marxism. It was founded when several fringe religionist communes were united by Friend No. 1 into what would become the DRLFN.
