The IDL is the international wing of the Democratic Republic of Liberated Free Nations, an ultra-hardline Communist terrorist organization formerly existing as a state. Its goals are the resurrection of the DRLFN as a unitary state and the imposition of its one-party system over the world. Ideologically, it regards the existence of multiple communist parties, organizations, and states as being opposed to &quot;true Marxism&quot;.
