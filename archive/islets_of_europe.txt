  The islets of Europe form an archipelago over what used to be continental Europe. Form after the devastating natural apocalyptic events in the 2050s, the islets of Europe consists of several island clusters in the Northern Hemisphere. The land is relatively fertile and resource rich, a large part of the island chain formed by volcanic activity that had since ceased in mid 2050s. The islands and seas of the islets of Europe form a natural barrier against natural disasters and potential hostile invaders, leading to the residents of the archipelago dubbing it &amp;#39;Festung Europa&amp;#39;, for the protection it provides.
