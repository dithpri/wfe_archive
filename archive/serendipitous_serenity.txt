Born from a small community, we have come together to show the world we exist, and we are strong - capable of impacting the face of this very world.

We aim, simply, to let that impact be great for a cause. Stay true to your cause, and that is fulfilling our own cause of maintaining fidelity to your own cause. We just protect each other while doing so, and we will fight to our last breath. Let us breathe easy.

Simple.
