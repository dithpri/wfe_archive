[/color] [color=blue] We are the ones who offer completely ridiculous concepts with strong convictions that we posses sound evidence as irrefutable backing. [/color] [color=green] We are the ones capable of holding a conversation of the highest intelligence, yet still find crude, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s what She/He Said&amp;quot; jokes to be absolutely hilarious.[/color]  
[color=red][b] Yep, we&amp;#39;re the HCHS nerds.[/color] [/b]
