[i][b]Welcome to the League of Empires
[Hr][color=red]
This is a region, but it does not work like a normal one, but it is structured in a series of empires, which function as supranational entities introduced into a region, and nation states.[/color]
[Hr][color=green]
This region promotes political and cultural diversity, through the experimentation of various forms of Government and State.[/color]
[Hr][color=blue]
There is only one requirement to enter: to have the duty to help the region as much as possible. Even giving the welcome or proposing something.
