Some people think living in a massive crater lined with volcanoes is a bad idea. We beg to differ. We establish here in this world a belief that you can be allies even if your nations are polar opposites. 
Through a brutal system of volcanic ash exporting, and the importation of flammable people, we have risen from nothing to the powerhouse we are today.

Come die by the forest with us, and celebrate each new tomorrow.
