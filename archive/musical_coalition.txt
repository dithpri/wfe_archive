[color=grey]Welcome to the [/color][color=limegreen][b]Musical Coalition[/b][/color][color=grey] region.

[i]We don&#39;t like the WA. We don&#39;t have a WA delegate. The position is hollow, even when filled - delegates will have no power. The people are the power in this region.[/i]

Song of the week: [/color][color=limegreen][b]Polyphia, Champagne[/b][/color]
[color=grey]Artist of the week:[/color][color=limegreen][b]Benny Greb[/b][/color]

[color=grey]Please make sure that you [b]introduce[/b] yourself in the [b]RMB[/b], down below, so that we can get to know you better! Tell us about your favourite music, what instrument you play (if any), and why you&#39;re here, wether for ambassadorial grounds or for simply entertainment purposes.

[i]Because heck, guys, this is a pretty fun region, let&#39;s face it.[/i]
