My daddy was a miner
And I&#39;m a miner&#39;s son
And I&#39;ll stick with the union
Till every battle&#39;s won

They say in Harlan County
There are no neutrals there
You&#39;ll either be a union man
Or a thug for J.H. Blair

Don&#39;t scab for the bosses
Don&#39;t listen to their lies
Us poor folks haven&#39;t got a chance
Unless we organize.
