[b]The Left&#146;s Challenge[/b]
The fundamental principle of our politics is equality, that each person is of equal worth on the basis of common membership in the human family. The fundamental principle our economy is capital, that each person&#146;s value depends on their access to money. 

These two principles are at odds. Either we are social equals and allies, united by our humanity and common needs, or we are social unequals and enemies, divided by our competition over resources&#133;
