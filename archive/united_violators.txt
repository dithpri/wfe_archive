This region is for autocratic countries with totalitarian and/or oppressive government systems that openly practise human rights abuses. 

One of the messages behind the creation of this region is to make political satires/memes about the current state of the authoritarian countries around the world. I feel like by creating countries that reflect authoritarian countries that exist today, it acts as a kind of sarcasm that makes fun of or even criticizes their systems.
