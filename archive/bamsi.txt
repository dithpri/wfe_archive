The proud continent of Bamsi has stood as a sign of freedom, and prosperity for hundreds of years, but 250 years ago, the continent was unified into one supernational entity, called the &quot;Technocratic Republic of Bamsi&quot;, and for 240 years it stood as the pillar of freedom of the world, but as of recent, several fringe groups have broken away from the Republic, creating a large violent war. This is Bamsi, a once united nation, now torn by war.
