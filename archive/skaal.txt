The Hidden Region of Skaal is a place of acceptance to all who are moral in the eyes of the Tacitae. All in Skaal must follow in suit with Tacitae Populus&amp;#39;s decisions in the World Assembly or they must brave the Void. You may only speak to him through Tacitae Populus and must ask for guidance to his Vale.
