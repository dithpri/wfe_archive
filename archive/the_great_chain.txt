Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? &quot;No,&quot; says the man in Washington, &quot;it belongs to the poor.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the man in the Vatican, &quot;it belongs to God.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the man in Moscow, &quot;it belongs to everyone.&quot; I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... The Great Chain. A refion where the artist would not fear the censor; where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality; where the great would not be constrained by the small! And with the sweat of your brow, The Great Chain can become your region as well.
