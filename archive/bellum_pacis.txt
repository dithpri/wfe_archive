&amp;quot;Bellum Pacis&amp;quot;. A phrase from a dead language: Latin. It means peaceful war. As our name suggests, we do not simply fight using weapons. We have evolved so much from cavemen who hit each other with clubs. Can&amp;#39;t we act like it and work out our problems like civilized people instead of sacrificing the lives of innocent people who might not want to participate in as imbecilic of a &amp;quot;solution&amp;quot; as war? To join our region, you must be noble and brave yet still believe in retaining peace. We are not afraid to use our wisdom against our opponents!
