The Asylum of Palestine is a safe place for exiled Palestinians to seek refuge. New Philistia alongside its neighbors in The Asylum will not rest until justice is delivered to the indigenous Palestinian population of the Holy Land.

New Philistia will be the capital state of The Asylum until the Palestinians receive their long deserved liberation.


No justice, no peace. No humanity. From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.
