The Collective Rose Front (CRF) is a new World Region founded by the Small Nation-State Lazkiel following its rise from the ashes of a short and violent civil war. The region was founded under the ideologies of Personal Liberty, Community, and Liberation of the oppressed. With no current history, the CRF sets out to redefine history and spread its values to form a united global front through which justice for the peoples can be reclaimed.
