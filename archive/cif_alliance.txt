In CIF alliance anybody is welcome to do what ever they wish. We have no map, allowing you to be in your own or in other universes! If you so wish to be medieval or establish a space empire we will accept! 

We do have some limitations though: No god modding.

We allow open debates with other members, war, sanctions, nuclear launches, space programs, trade, negotiations, terrorist attacks, and more. 

If you so wish to do any of these things, feel free do join us and become a part of something big!
