The Midwestern Rim is made up of nations who are passionate about realistic roleplay, especially when it comes to making a military and when dealing with affairs of international diplomacy. This is not a specialist region and we welcome all kinds of nations and governments. We&amp;#39;re generally friendly to visitors and open to various diplomatic opportunities. Very friendly to NationStates and Role-play beginners.
