Welcome to [b][i][u]Southern Dorstilla[/u][/i][/b] (pronounced: su-thern-dor-stee-a), a pretty decent continent with the regional preferences of countries with high levels of kind-heartedness, freedom, high life expectancies, large government and a ban or low percentage of Recreational Drug Use. Any nation willing to move to Southern Dorstilla must also be very eco-friendly, naturally beautiful, low pollution and very optimistic and open minded.
