Welcome to Ego.

This is a haven for those who have realized the way the world works, for it spins only around itself, not around another universe. A haven for those who promote greed, selfishness and illegitimacy; a haven for survivalists and opportunists alike; that is Ego. A haven for the flower inside one&amp;#39;s self to bloom.

Ego is based off Max Stirner&amp;#39;s Union of egoists, which was never originally founded until now. Egoists and individualists are very welcome here.
