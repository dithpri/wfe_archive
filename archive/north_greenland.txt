North Greenland is a snowy, barren, windswept place. It is boring. No one has any time to conquer, scheme, or politick. &quot;Each man under his fig tree and grape vine,&quot; as it were - in theory and style, if not actual fauna.

North Greenlanders are friendly neighbors. If you want to lead a quiet, peaceful, happy life, this is the place for you.
