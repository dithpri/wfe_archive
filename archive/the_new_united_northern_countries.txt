Rules are simple; no powergaming, metagaming etc. No controlling NPC&#39;s.

2 gameplay mechanics;
Espionage, you get 5 spies and get to put them anywhere, I&#39;ll tell you stuff about the nation they&#39;re in (Useful or not)

Rebels; If you do bad stuff rebels and activists will come. You&#39;ll have to avert them through peaceful or violent means, with each having consequences.
