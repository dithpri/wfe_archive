This is Gealach. Irish for Moon. We are a relaxed and fun region.

 I, Mikulca Xcaloopolevo, will always be WA delegate. If you are in the WA, you must only endorse me. This is the entire reason for the region is so I can maintain a WA delegate status. If you do not comply, then you will be ejected and banned. 

Besides that, have fun and send suggestions for improvement to myself, Mikulca Xcaloopolevo, or the Co-founder, Noodles and Butter. Also English speaking only. Thank you for joining.
