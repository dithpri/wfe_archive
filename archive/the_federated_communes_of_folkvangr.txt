[b][u][color=red][region]The Federated Communes of Folkvangr[/region][/color][/u][/b] is a decentralized confederation of free communes inspired by the strength, love, and generosity of Freyja. These communes enjoy and defend a frith informed by the values of both [b][u][color=green]Heathenry[/b][/u][/color] and [b][u]Libertarian [color=red]Socialism[/color][/b][/u]. Any nations who share these values are welcome to join this confederation and strive for the peace and prosperity of Freyja.

This region is here for anyone wanting to discuss or ask questions about libertarian socialism or paganism! That is its sole purpose.
