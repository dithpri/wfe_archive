The Regi&oacute;n Nacional de Misiones is nestled in the northeastern corner of Argentina. It shares international borders with Paraguay to the north, across the Paran&aacute; River, and Brazil to the east, marked by the Uruguay River. The region occupies the northern tip of Argentina&#39;s Misiones province and includes territories culturally influenced by Vegeuane, a kingdom that retains strong diplomatic and cultural ties with Argentina.
