Welcome to Pelimarc, land of fantasy and magic infused with recent rapid developments of high-tech and social evolution! The history, geography, cultures, peoples, maps, etc. are a work-in-progress and will be updated as time allows (as for the time of this writing, Pelimarc is still very new and recently discovered). For what can be said so far, the land is mostly uninhabited by &quot;civilized&quot; beings, mainly being dominated by wild animals, magical beasts, monsters, and vividly rich and dangerous environments. The first settlement to be founded so far is that of The Socioeconomic Experimental City, a collective community of all different &quot;civilized&quot; beings living together in a time of peace, cooperation, and transition.
