The Scemtriac Union is a fair communist region. We do have some strict rules but those are more with political freedom, every citizen has there normal human rights and can go about their day like in democracy.. There are also less rules that we have set since we are also an anarchy. 
Citizens don&amp;#39;t get to vote on world leaders, we have a council Of 35 members that decide the leaders.
Every time a citizen turns 18 they will be given a test to tell what they&amp;#39;d like to do in life, and then given five to ten choices that came up in the results.
They will also get a free anarchy t-shirt that says, I turned eighteen and all I got was a lousy tee, and a pocket guide with maps and laws of the region.  
That is all.
