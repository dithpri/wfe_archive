Regional Motto: &quot;Pysch Squad, Lenovo Juice&quot;

Welcome to the Greatest Region!  As delegate I will do my best to ensure that we have a poll going at all times!

Thank you for electing me!  If anyone would like any factbooks posted to the region just give me a yell in the RMB or telegram me directly.  I have appointed a few officers to help with governing the region.  If you the people wish to reelect any of these officers just say so in the RMB and we will do so ASAP.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do for the Greatest Region!

Also bold text will not be tolerated as per request of Ferrumterra.
