The year is 1815. Napoleon has just abdicated his throne for the 2nd time. He has been shipped off to St.Helena, gone for good. The Congress of Vienna has finally finished, and now Europe sits in peace. But the 18th century is barely over. Revolutionary ideas and nationalism still remain. The old order is crumbling. Will you wade your empire through this time of strife and attempt to come out on top of the revolution, building an empire to last, or will you embrace the new century&#39;s ideals?

Current Date: 15th October 1815.
