The Danube is a river in Central and Eastern Europe, the European Union&#39;s longest and the continent&#39;s second longest (after the Volga).

Classified as an international waterway, it originates in the town of Donaueschingen&#151;which is in the Black Forest of Germany&#151;at the confluence of the rivers Brigach and Breg. The Danube then flows southeast for 1,785 miles, passing through four capital cities before emptying into the Black Sea via the Danube Delta in Romania and Ukraine. &#151;Wikipedia
