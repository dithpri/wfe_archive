Welcome to the Piphet Islands! Changing the Factbook entry, flag, or anything else without getting an okay from [nation=short]Machnodecca[/nation] first will result in an ejection and ban.

Other than that, you&amp;#39;re pretty much free to do whatever you want. So long as you use proper grammar.
