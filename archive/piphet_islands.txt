Welcome to the [region]Piphet Islands[/region]! Our regional languages are, of course, Piphet, English, and Gaelic! Currently we are working on going from an Amish to an advanced, technology-based society with a view of the ocean! Our fishing accidents may be severe and happen often, but we neglect to help prevent them. We here believe that if you want something fixed, the people should be able to help themselves. If they can&amp;#39;t, and are open about being lazy, our government will swiftly and painlessly take care of you.
