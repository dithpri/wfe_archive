The Hellfire Club was a small region devoted to anti-religious (particularly anti-Christian) and anti-fascist activities. It has now been refounded, reformed, and protected by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in the name of [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascism[/b] and [b][color=purple]religious liberty[/color][/b]. It will remain anti-fascist, but will now be accepting of religious and non-religious people alike.

A religion is only as good as its followers. Let&#39;s show The Hellfire Club they were wrong.
