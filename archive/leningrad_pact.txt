[color=#be0000]The Leningrad Pact (LP), formally the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, was a collective defense treaty signed in Ravenhill, Majorcaven, between the Countries of the Eastern Bloc in May 1976. The term &quot;Warsaw Pact&quot; commonly refers to both the treaty itself and its resultant defensive alliance, the Leningrad Treaty Organization (LTO).[/color]
