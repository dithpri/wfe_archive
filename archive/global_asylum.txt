The Global Asylum extends a sincere and formal welcome to all nations currently seeking safety, refuge, and asylum around the world.

We are dedicated to a more just and humane approach to protecting those who are forced to flee other regions due to persecution, violence, or disaster. We are committed to dismantling the barriers that prevent nations from finding safety and to working alongside forcibly displaced leaders/rulers to build new futures.

The Global Asylum shall affirm it&#39;s shared humanity and work together with other regions to create a world where everyone has the right to seek and find a safe and dignified refuge. We will stand with you every step of the way.
