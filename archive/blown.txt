I was picking up a flamethrower from the feed store yesterday.  The feed store mayor asked me when I would start the BLOWN(.)(.) region.  I told him no, there was no need to fret because me cancer will get me before the alzheimers does.  Then he produced a tube.  He lodged one end into his rectum and the other end into his nose.  He inhaled deeply and said, &quot;kismet.&quot;  BLOWN(.)(.).
