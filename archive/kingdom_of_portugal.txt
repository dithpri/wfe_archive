The Kingdom of Portugal was a monarchy on the Iberian Peninsula. It was in existence from 1139 until 1910. The name is also often applied to the Portuguese Empire, the realm&#39;s extensive overseas colonies.

The national colours of Portugal until 1910 were blue and white, being replaced by the green and red colours of the republican dictatorship after the 1910 coup. Portugal reached a level of electoral suffrage and democracy during the monarchy that would not see again until 1982. After becoming a republic the country was effectively governed by dictatorships or hybrid military-civilian regimes from 1910 until 1982. Today many are still in favour of the return of the monarchy.
