The Ab Ortu Sincere Axis is a military coalition between several nations, most notably the Federal Republic of Maritionia and the Catholic Christendom. It was founded by the Christendom as a means of enforcing the divine will of God. However, the Christendom realized it could not enforce the will of God on its own, so it payed the Federal Republic of Maritionia to assist it as an ally and delegate. While the alliance is new, it is still a military force to be reckoned with and should not be quarreled with unless one is certain they will win.
