Within the world of NationStates, there exists a number of regions founded and occupied by students of Virgil I. Grissom High School. Together, the main branch of these make up the official Grissom regions, between which there is ever a great deal of interaction and dual membership.
The purpose of this region is to serve as a location where an ambassador from each of the Grissom regions may reside to discuss official interregional matters. Perhaps nothing shall ever come of it. Yet perhaps there shall arise a time when the Grissom politicians are in need of such a place, at which point it shall act as the center of dealings between the honourable members of each region.
