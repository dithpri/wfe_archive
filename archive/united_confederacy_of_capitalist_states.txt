[b]The United Confederacy of Capitalist States[/b] (UCCS) is a coalition of several sovereign states bound by a military pact of defense between all members. The UCCS promotes Lockean ideals, especially those of life, liberty, and property as well as the unadulterated liberty of each state&#39;s citizens. We advocate for non-aggression, non-interventionism, free trade, and civil rights.
