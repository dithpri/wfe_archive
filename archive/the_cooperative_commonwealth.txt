The Co-operative Commonwealth is a fictional history, role-playing Region. We join together in the spirit of co-operation, freedom, and progress, whilst defending the innocent, the environment, and our freedom.

Anyone may join, so long as they are willing to abide by the constitution of the Commonwealth, and a few choice rouge states may be allowed to join as well, just to liven up the game a bit.

When communicating on the forums, please label posts *OOC* if not in character, so as to distinguish from when you are communicating with other nations as your nation&amp;#39;s representative. 

If anyone wishes to enquire about joining, please send a telegram to Raso.
