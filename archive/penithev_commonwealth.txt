Welcome to the [region=Penithev Commonwealth]!

The Commonwealth is a hardcore roleplaying region for people interested in global politics, international relations, and diplomacy. In these first few weeks of our existence, we hope to establish a regional map and decide on a roleplaying scenario; those interested in joining should telegram [nation=Thallein] with a finished application form. 

Embassies and consulates with similar regions are welcome!
