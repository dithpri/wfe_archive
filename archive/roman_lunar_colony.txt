[b]Congratulations![/b]

[B][color=darkred]You have stumbled upon the grandest and most isolated corner of the Illustrious Roman Empire. We have survived for thousands of years, building, colonizing, developing and biding our time, waiting for the proper moment to return. We have been watching Terra closely. We have seen how the world has changed. You may have thought Rome and the Roman state died out Millenium ago, yet here we are, and here you are.[/color][/B]

[color=goldenrod][B]Join us, join our civilization, assimilate into our society, join our patrimony and spill blood in the name of Rome and its citizens.[/B][/color]
