The Western Union of Nations is primarily an alliance of the Democratic States of Toven and the Democratic States of New Vorockace. Here, we try to keep both of our nations in check, united in the common goal of prosperity and unity. We welcome any newcomers to the region, to have a place of peace as their nations grow, and we welcome experienced members, as we are fairly new to Nation States and we welcome any advice. However, if you try to invade, raid, or occupy our region know that New Vorockace will be responding with like force.
