Possibly as many as 69 were created, of which 57 survive today. Virtually all were manufactured under the supervision of Peter Carl Faberg&eacute; between 1885 and 1917. The most famous are his 52 &quot;Imperial&quot; eggs, 46 of which survive, made for the Russian Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II as Easter gifts for their wives and mothers.[/i]&quot;
