General: The Desert of Flylingard is great for having and roleplaying with whatever country/government you decide! Discord: https://discord.gg/g9HNhAcW

Regional Government: The entire region is technically one. This means that each notion has a certain fraction of power inside of Flylingard to control &#147;Interregional Law&#148;. Simply a set of laws that majority voted upon by all members of the region and must be followed. However, this won&#146;t stop nations from inside the region from having &#147;Aggressive acts&#148; against each other. These are allowed as long it is justifiable by other nations besides the attacking nation/s.
