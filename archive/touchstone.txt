The region known as [b]Touchstone[/b] is comprised of very few nations, but those that exist here are populated by a primitive population. [nation]Sharp Teeth[/nation], the founding nation, sits in the frozen center of the region and is currently the only country (and that word is used loosely) to be established thus far. 

[b]Touchstone is a fantasy roleplaying region.[/b] Anyone can join the region though, whether they would like to participate or not.
