Lodidoty - a region where Umas, Chip-chips, and sloths run free.  Though each member state has its differences with the others, they are united under one rallying cry: &amp;quot;Screw the guys upstairs!&amp;quot;

[b] Due to restrictions on the number of posts we are allowed on our regional message board, an off-site forum has been created for discussions and RPs. The off-site regional forum can be found [url=http://w11.zetaboards.com/Lodidoty/index/]here.[/url][/b]

To access the board, you will need to create a login name (preferably one that matches your country name). From there you should be good to go.
