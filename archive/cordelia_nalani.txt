Cordelia Nalani is actually a planet in a different galaxy called Efah (a description of which can me found in a Dark Ellwood factbook) a couple hundred lightyears from the milky way. The name means &quot;heart of heaven&quot;. In Cordelia Nalani, no animal has ever gone extinct; dinosaurs are even common on some continents. There is more plant life here than other planet. Trees are the most common besides marijuana. Space technology is superb; people could visit any other part of the universe in less than a week. There has never been a war on this entire planet. Almost all of this peaceful influence is from the dictator of Dark Ellwood which takes up a large portion of the largest continent.
