TT means Tumblr Trash.  This means anyone who practically lives on Tumblr belongs here!  You don&#39;t need to love Tumblr just be a piece of Fandom Trash. 

This nation was created in the hopes that people will have a good time, but we wont threaten you with a good time (P!ATD refrence), and make new friends.

When you join make sure to post a bit about you on the board so we can all get to know each other.
