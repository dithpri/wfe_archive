Welcome to our region. We emphasize freedom for all nations. There will be no regional mandates or rules that you are required to obey here, beyond the fact that all posts to the message boards must be clean and decency must be shown to all other regional members. The U.N. delegate retains the right to use discretion and eject/ban any nations from this region.

Welcome to a peaceful future!
