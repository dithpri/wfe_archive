[b]The Blood Sea[/b] (Shingoryeoite Korean: &amp;#54792;&amp;#54644;, Hanja: &amp;#34880;&amp;#28023;, romanised: Hyeolhae) is one of the largest oceans in the SAREIMA regions. It spans an area of 116,200,000km2 (44,865,070 sq mi), and is considered to be the coldest of all major seas that separate the SAREIMA regions. Geographically it separates Rushmore to the regions of Anaia and Arrosia, as well as hosting inter-regional portals to other regions including Sonnel. Due to said significance, it is considered to separate the northern, calmer half of &#39;Old World&#39; to the ever-eventful southern half of the &#39;New World&#39;.
