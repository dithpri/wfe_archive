In the year 1592, our great nation was founded and was called the &quot;foolian Empire&quot; with the region once called &quot;Foolia&quot; Which meant &quot;titty sucklers&quot; in the new language, but it was kept. So now we are called &quot;Titty Sucklers&quot; instead of our ancient name, but we prefer both tbh
