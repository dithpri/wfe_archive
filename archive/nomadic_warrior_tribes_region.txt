The Nomadic Warrior Tribes Region is a country of Christian Faith, and is composed of small yet fortified villages scattered throughout the lush and vast forests. There is one city that has been overtaken by our Tribes, known as &quot;Dinswater City&quot;, now called &quot;Hollow&#39;s Echo&quot;, and is our main source of communication.
