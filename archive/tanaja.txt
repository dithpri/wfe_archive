Tanaja is region of ancient nations, people, and magic.  Throughout the history of the region, many nations have risen and fallen and leaders of all sorts have ruled.  Some are remembered and many forgotten by time and the people of the lands they once ruled over.  In the modern world, the fantastic creatures of the past and those non-human races still live alongside the human inhabitants of the world.  Some of them are welcome, some are hunted, and yet others have faded from memory to keep themselves hidden.
