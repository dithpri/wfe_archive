[b]Orthanc[/b] was the impregnable tower of Isengard built by the D&uacute;nedain during the Second Age. 

The tower of Orthanc stood in the centre of the Ring of Isengard, roughly half a mile from the rim. At its peak the tower reached a height of just over five hundred feet. The colour of the rock was a deep, gleaming black. At Orthanc&amp;#39;s pinnacle the four piers which composed the tower opened out to form four pinnacles of sharp rock; between these isles of rock there was a narrow, polished floor on which many strange signs were written.[/color] &#151;[url=http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Orthanc][color=996633]Orthanc[/color][/url][hr]
