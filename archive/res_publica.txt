[b][u][color=4169E1]Welcome to Res Publica![/color][/u][/b]

[color=B8860B]Will the Republic stand? Res Publica is a brand new Republican Rome themed roleplay region, set in the time of the First Triumvirate. The hope is to create a character centric, but faction-backed roleplay where players will forge alliances and adversaries as politicians, generals, or non-Republican Kings and Tribal Chiefs to meet their goals. Together we can build a cooperative and fun roleplay and region![/color]
