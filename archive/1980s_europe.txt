[b][color=red]ComStar[/color] Is a privately owned company that is protecting all of the humankind, by offering the only reliable and fast method of interstellar communication based on the hyperpulse generators, which are solely owned by ComStar and not available commercially. HPG arrays based on multiple systems throughout the inner sphere transmit data to and from all corners of the human empire, ensuring its integrity.

ComStar does not gather private information, nor does it have any off-the-record contacts with any major political persons and/or organizations. These claims are merely hearsay and the product of the imagination of drunken tricksters.[/b]
