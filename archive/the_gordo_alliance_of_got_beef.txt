[b]Welcome[/b]: THE MOST POWERFUL ALLIANCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN! NO QUESTIONS ASKED! WE&#39;VE ALREADY CRUSHED BAJILLIONS OF NATIONS UNDERNEATH OUR SIZE 12 FEET! THE ONLY QUESTION IS...GOT BEEF?

[b]Some facts[/b]: Gordo Alliance prides itself on being a conservative alliance! Nations classified as dictatorships are not to be taken seriously. [b][u]The Gordo Alliance SUPPORTS free speech for all.[/b][/u]

[b]Embassy policy[/b]: Most regions will be allowed to submit embassy requests. Regions with a large number of anarchist, socialist, or dictatorship nations will be examined more heavily. Regions that support WA proposals not supported by the Gordo Alliance may have their embassy removed.
