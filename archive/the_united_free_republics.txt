A Region based on a True Democratic system, where a person&amp;#39;s say means everything. 

A constitution will be established once a decent amount of players join. At least 10 are needed for construction of a Constitution. 

Once a Constitution is established, a democratic political system will follow (President, VP, Congress, etc.)

A Regional Army will be founded and will be used in matters that threaten the very survival or democratic ways of the U.F.R.


Until a political system is established, the entirety of the Region will be monitored by the Caretaker, Futrellia.
