Free IV is a secret society which draws upon many traditions and creeds. It is a fraternity of fraternities and a religion of religions. it holds no political bias and forms no opinion as to the moral obligations of a human being. Its primary goal entirely is survival and has no pretense beyond that simple goal. All who find meaning in the transmissions of 77 are welcome to land as Freezoners within our Yurt and nothing prevents any person from advancing to the Dagon path except want of study.
