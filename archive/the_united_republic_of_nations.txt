As a former refugee who has finally returned, I have decided to create a new region by which all nations of non-fascist orientation are welcome. In this manner, I hope to take a stand against the hated radicals and to prepare for a united alliance of leftist states to oppose the spread of radical, right-wing ideologies. 

It is my goal to create a paradise in which a regional government, with leader nations elected democratically, shall reign supreme and shall create a new utopia of greatness! Welcome, my brothers and sisters, to the United Republic of Nations!
