Welcome to the United Republic of Nations. Over here we are dedicated towards 2 principles: Liberty and Justice. All and any actions that we do are to promote these 2 principles or defend these 2 principles. 

We are quite a new region and therefore encourage anyone, regardless of political views to join.
We would also encourage everyone to gain WA membership. 
Please come and enjoy your stay!


(Note)The WA delegate is the elected leader or of the whole region so make sure you endorse with good reason!
