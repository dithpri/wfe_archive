The United Republic of Nations is a region that seeks to mediate international crises and help maintain international peace. Its member states also swear to provide military aid to any nation that faces any threat, both internally and externally. 

We leftist nations must stand, united in our resistance, to the imperialistic expansion of aggressive right-wing nations and maintain peace and solidarity in the world.
