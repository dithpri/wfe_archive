If you like pina coladas, and corona, and the feeling of the sun warming your face, and the smell of the ocean, and the gentle breeze, and palm trees, and coconuts, and the cool white sand inbetween your toes, and the sway of a hamock, and everything about tropical islands then come here. It&amp;#39;s warm, peaceful, and beautiful.
