Welcome visitor to our fine region. We are a region of mappers, people who animate countries acting like people on a map, sounds weird yes?, Good.
If you want an embassy, yeah sure, we can have that. Maybe.
If you&#39;re a mapper seeking to join the region, ask a fellow mapper, you will probably get fowarded to someone who actually knows the password, or how to get it at least. You can find the wiki page here : http://thefutureofeuropes.wikia.com/wiki/NationStates
Join the chat someone should be there. Probably not.
Oh, and if you&#39;re wondering where our founder went, he is currently raiding, bastard.
