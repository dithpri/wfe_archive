             [b][i][u]Welcome to [region]The New Central Powers[/region]![/u][/i][/b]
The Central Powers were a group of nations fighting against the Allied Powers during World War I.

They included Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria and their territories. They were also supported by Azerbaijan and Finland, as well as Lithuania in 1918 and co-belligerent Jabal Shammar. 
The rules are simple, your nation should be any nation that was part of the central powers. So if you were just Austria or just Hungary then you could join!
Arabic nations are accepted mainly because of Jabal Shammar. and so is Italy, Spain (even though they weren&#39;t part of the central powers), USSR, Sweden, and any nation that was a puppet of the central powers.
