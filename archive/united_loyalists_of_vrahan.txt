[b][i][u]We are the loyalists of [nation=short]Vrahan[/nation], the only survivors of the Last Alliance that destroyed Falen (false heretics allied to FEMDOM) and his infinitely numerous groups in an airstrike against the said nation&#39;s colony. With the death of Vrahan as a nation, we seek to escape to another isolated planet until we established the Last Alliance in honor of [nation=short]Vrahan[/nation]. May he be blest!
