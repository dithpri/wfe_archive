The Confederative Socialist States Union  was founded on the 25th February 2017 after the International Socialist Conference led in Arstotzka .
This Union was founded around the common ideologies of Marxism, Trotskist-Lenninism and modern eco-socialism. 
It is a Union of Democratic Countries recently emancipated from the South Pacific capitalist corporations, warmongering dictatorships and tax havens. Each nation is represented equally during the international soviets and summits.
At each Soviet of the Confederation, the different nations debate and make decisions for both the sovereignty of their states and the Union.
