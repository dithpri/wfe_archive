In 2016 with the continuation of the Greek economic crisis, the islands of Limnos and Stratis seceded in order to try and escape said crisis. Limnos soon fell into civil war when a central government in Limnos tried to form. A ceasefire was called after a few months of war and the nations retreated to their own sides of the island. The four nations that rule the land are the Kyrgios Republic backed by the East, the Akriman Federation backed by the West, Kingdom of Phanassa the backed by the West.
