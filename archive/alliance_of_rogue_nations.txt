Hi fellow nations, I am Arkenbeeren, the Founder of this region.

The Alliance of Rogue Nations is a region for those who can&#39;t find a suitable region that fits their needs and likings, here in ARN you are allowed to roleplay in anyway you want and there is no rule against double-posting, though a post will be suppresed if it&#39;s over 4 posts in a row. Nations or allowed to do whatever the heck they want under permission from Regional Officers.

Now, ofc I&#39;m not forcing anyone to join the ARN but I hope you find this region likeable and decide to join and stay.
