Following the Concord of Lichtenstein in 2080 AD, the nation state as a concept was deemed outmoded and ultimately self-destructive, as non-profit entities such as traditional governments would unavoidably trend towards stagnation and inefficiency. In the wake of this event, the Neo Corporate Union was founded to meet the executive needs of a changing world. Formed from an initiative in which a collection of the planet&#39;s biggest mega-corporations bought up vast tracts of land from the failing old-world government, the Neo Corporate Union is part business enterprise and part national entity, with many millions of civilians under its direct government in sprawling mega-cities and orbital stations.
