Welcome, comrade!

CSR, the Confederation of Socialist Republics is a group of countries which share socialist, democratic and antifascist values. We believe in socialism as a way to organize society in oder to liberate humanity from oppression. The CSR is pluralistic and undogmatic, which means that we don&amp;#39;t pretend to have the perfect recipe for the success of socialism and that we accept all countries aspiring to a society where humans can live free from exploitation and domination. 

Join the Confederation of Socialist Republics today! Let&amp;#39;s fight and win together!

&amp;quot;The Proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.&amp;quot;
