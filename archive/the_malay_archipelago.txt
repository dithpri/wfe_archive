The region of islands between mainland Southeastern Asia and Australia. Countries settled here have a much better experience as it is very hard to come across so none may attack, and the lush jungles offer food and protection. Many animals, migrational or permanent, reside on these islands, offering you great resources for trading, food, and shelter/other commodities. 

You may settle on unexplored islands, like Urkazon is, and some islands even have dinosaurs hidden away in the thick jungle... It is quite the experience, and you get a hefty amount of money for selling live or dead specimens.

If you are a small, traditional empire, [region]The Malay Archipelago[/region] is the place to colonize!
