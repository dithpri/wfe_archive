The Friendly Alliance favors nations that have good civil rights and political freedoms. What we really look for in a nation is at least [color=turquoise]average civil rights[/color] and a minimum of [color=red]below average political freedoms[/color]. Though we do not enforce this strictly, we do hope all nations in the region strive to achieve this easily accomplished goal.

We live by one thing, and that is every human is equal to one another and deserves their rights just as much as the next person.
