[b]Welcome all![/b]

Those who don&#39;t care for any region in particular and would like an alternative, [u]come here[/u].

Ejections and banning will happen [b]only[/b] as a last resort in cases of harassment or targeting. [i]Common sense.[/i]

We [b]reject[/b] the corruption of the [color=blue][b]World Assembly[/b][/color] and [b]support[/b] a [i]fair balance[/i] of powers. 

A member state may volunteer for [color=blue][b]World Assembly Delegate[/b][/color] to ultimately voice our [i]collective[/i] concerns as most of us [i]may[/i] choose to opt-out of the [color=blue][b]WA[/b][/color] [i][u]as it stands currently[/u][/i].

[color=blue][i]Officers[/i] added as [u]needed[/u][/color]
[color=green][i]Embassies[/i] seeking [u]collaboration[/u][/color]

[color=red][i][b]We are Legion. We are Regionless.[/b][/i][/color]
