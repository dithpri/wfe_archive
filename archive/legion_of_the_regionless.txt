Those who don&#39;t care for any region, come here. 
Welcome all and same rules apply as [b][region]The Rejected Realms[/region].[/b]

[i]However[/i], [b]RR[/b] will remain the only ejection-free zone. Ejections will happen [b]only[/b] as a last resort in cases of harassment or targeting. Common sense.

Here, you can [i]choose[/i] to be as [b]regionless[/b] as it gets. [i]Sovereignty matters.[/i] Additionally, 

[i]Live and Let Live.[/i]

We [b]reject[/b] the corruption of the World Assembly and [b]support[/b] a [i]fair balance[/i] of powers. 

A member state may volunteer for World Assembly Delegate to ultimately voice our collective concerns as most of us may choose to opt-out of the WA as it currently stands.

Officers added as needed.
Embassies accepted.
