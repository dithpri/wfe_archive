Papal States, also called Republic of Saint Peter or Church States, Italian Stati Pontifici or Stati della Chiesa, territories of central Italy over which the pope had sovereignty from 756 to 1870. Included were the modern Italian regions of Lazio (Latium), Umbria, and Marche and part of Emilia-Romagna, though the extent of the territory, along with the degree of papal control, varied over the centuries.
