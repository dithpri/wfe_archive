[b]The Middle West describes a collective of nations which share common interests in prosperity, conservation, and strength among the weakness that plagues the Untermensch of the nu-West.[/b]


Welcome to the [i]Middle West[/i], a glorious commonwealth of white nations which, together, march forward united, unto a bright future. The nations of the Middle West share trade agreements, policies on several national issues and other imperative societal factors which form our basis as a united force against the evils of the degenerate west, out of which necessity for our new nations arose.

To join, you must be devoted to conservation of great historical European ideals. [i]Also the bake sale is every month so bring some treats to sell.[/i]
