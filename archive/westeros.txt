All men know me for the trueborn son of Steffon Baratheon, Lord of Storm&amp;#39;s End, by his lady wife Cassana of House Estermont.

I declare upon the honor of my House that my brother Robert, our late king, left no trueborn issue of his body, the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being abominations born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Ser Jaime the Kingslayer.

By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

Let all true men declare their loyalty.

Done in the Light of the Lord, under the sign and seal of Stannis of House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
