Yes, I&#39;m from a new country and this region is new, but I played this game back in 2023 and 2022, and then I quit to focus on school. Since I have more free time, I retried and started playing again! Sorry if I&#39;m not the best, but I&#39;ll try my hardest to manage this region! If you want your country to be added to the map, telegram me or the WA Delegate!

If you want to be an officer, apply on the Discord server! If the discord server is unavailable/being reworked or made, send me or our WA Delegate/Vice Delegate a telegram and we&#39;ll see what we can do! Any country that isn&#39;t located in the Arctic Islands (lore-wise) may be subject to being kicked at any time if an agreement with an officer isn&#39;t made!
