Built upon a large piece of abandoned land of once-existing nations, hence &amp;quot;The Unused Plot&amp;quot;, is now a region of dictatorship and conservatism born through the hands of Kadenverse. 

Entry to The Used Plot is restricted. If interested, contact Earl Jackson Ackerson, Head of the Regional Affairs Division (RAD) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Kadenverse to request membership into the region via RMB or telegram. If accepted, we will provide you a password that changes every nation that joins.

All heil the all glorious King Kaden, who rules with his mighty hand.

Sincerely,
Earl Jackson Ackerson
Head of the RAD
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
