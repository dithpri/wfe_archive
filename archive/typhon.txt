Welcome to the region of Typhon! This is a modern tech role-playing region with it&amp;#39;s own map. Typhon orbits the star Hadi (HAY-dee) and has a large moon called Ladon, and a much smaller moon called Orthos. The regional government is called the Commonwealth of Typhonian States (&#147;CTS&#148;, or &#147;The Commonwealth&#148;). There are three large continents, with smaller islands, sub-continents and a polar continent in the south.
