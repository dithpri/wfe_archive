[b]You&amp;#39;re not your job. You&amp;#39;re not how much money you have in the bank.
You&amp;#39;re not the car you drive. You&amp;#39;re not the contents of your wallet.
You&amp;#39;re not your f*cking khakis. You&amp;#39;re the all-singing, All-dancing crap of the world.[/b]

The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club!
Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells &amp;quot;stop!&amp;quot;, goes limp, taps out, the fight is over.
Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
Sixth rule: No shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first time at Fight Club, you have to fight...
