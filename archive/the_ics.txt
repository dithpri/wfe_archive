The ICS: International Cranching Syndicate, was founded on January 17, 1922, by Cranch and Danny Ballsack. It has since then recruited millions to its ranks. The main goal of the ICS is to liberate the world of bullshit, often through bullying or otherwise unethical means. It has made progress on the fronts of the cyber world and legislation of multiple world governments, but it won&#39;t be satisfied until it&#39;s goal is fully realized.
