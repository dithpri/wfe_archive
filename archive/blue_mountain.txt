[b]Welcome to Blue Mountain.[/b]

[u]What is Blue Mountain?[/u]
Blue Mountain was originally founded to be [nation]Galrythia[/nation]&#39;s final retirement location and a memorial for the late [nation]Galskia[/nation] which was terminated under understandable cirucmstances that were absolutely necessary. However, the region is now open to NationStates nations who are looking for freedom on the site. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re safe from citizenship applications here.

[u]What can I do in Blue Mountain?[/u]
Well, you can do almost anything. Effectively, Blue Mountain is a region of Anarchy, so there aren&#39;t really any regional officers or people in charge. However, the Nationstates Rules still apply here, as they do everywhere. Please follow them and respect one another in this region. :)

Be free! Enjoy life!
