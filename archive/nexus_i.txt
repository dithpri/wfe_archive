Activity in Nexus I, has been low for the past two weeks. 
Should we desire to keep this region open, we need active members. 
I am calling for a Tribunal of the Council Members. This means, members need to start posting upon the message board at the bottom of this page. 

If we can not increase our activity, then I will be forced to close the Nexus, and merge and
or relocate to another region.

&amp;#39;Thank you for your cooperation.
