[b][color=#000061]What is the Nexus?
This is an interesting question. We are a space region. Inside space there are billions of stars.
Each star is a system. The nexus has been an uncharted region of space.
We can continue to be an undefined region of space, and role play anyway we like, going from one sphere to another.
Otherwise - Welcome to Nexus I[/color]
