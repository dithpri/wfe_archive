After the long and dreadful war with the People&amp;#39;s United Democratic Republics of Panem, in which the United Districts of Sothonia was the Victor (har har, snark snark), The unclaimed areas of the continent, known as Murrika, and the surrounding landmasses, all known as Lesser Murrika were reserved for new nations to arise. The UDS wants to spread democracy and capitalism to all, unless you come up with a way to make a perfect communist society where everyone is living without any legitimate complaints and are treaty fairly, which I find extremely unlikely. WELCOME.
