Almost 2000km west of British Columbia, just south of the Gulf of Alaska, the small archipelago know as the Arcadian Islands sit tranquil in the warm waters of the North Pacific.  The islands, mountainous remnants of the Cascade mountain range long separated by the ocean, are temperate destinations covered in thick broad-leaf and boreal forests that emerge from the coastal fogs in picturesque displays of the wonders of nature.

First charted by Captain James Cook, RN, archeological evidence has revealed that the islands once held small communities bearing cultural similarities to both Salish and Inuit peoples.
