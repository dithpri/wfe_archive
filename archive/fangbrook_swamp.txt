[i][b]Welcome to [region]Fangbrook Swamp[/region], heroes![/i][/b]

Though it may not seem like there&#39;s much here to most, the same cannot be said of Barnaby Screwloose, the young genius (though strange) inventor of the Rabbit Clan. He&#39;s come here to collect the swamp&#39;s gases! How odd!

Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points here will collect the most of this apparently useful resource for Barnaby. In his gratitude, he will run around the swamp with their Clan&#39;s flag!
