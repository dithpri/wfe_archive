The [b]NFC[/b] was founded in late July 2015 when the three nations of [nation=short]Caskonia[/nation], [nation=short]Prusso-Bavaria[/nation], and [nation=short]New Floridia Republic[/nation] decided to split away from [region=Nazi Europa] and establish themselves a new region. We accept all right wing nations, from Fascist Dictatorships to Libertarian Republics. We stand on the principle that a man should keep what he earns.
