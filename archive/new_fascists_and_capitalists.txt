The NFC was founded in late July 2015 when the three nations of Caskonia, Prusso-Bavaria, and New Floridia Republic decided to split away from Nazi Europa and establish themselves a new region. We accept all right wing nations, from Fascist Dictatorships to Libertarian Republics. We stand on the principle that a man should keep what he earns.
