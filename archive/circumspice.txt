[b][u][color=blue]Welcome To Circumspice![/b][/u][/color]
[hr]

A new region that currently seeks to build itself in peace in prosperity through civil conduct, and democratic processes. 

We are a fledgling region that still has much to build up, but with your help, I&#39;m sure we can make this region great!

We have an offsite forum in development, as well as a role-play system. 

Our Constitution goes into effect when we have enough nations to hold elections!
