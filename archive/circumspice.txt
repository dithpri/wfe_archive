A monument to the struggles of the people of [region]Westphalia[/region], [region]Perifania[/region] and [region]RHINIA[/region].

The region of Circumspice was founded 302 days ago by a nation named [nation]Tubor[/nation] and another nation names [nation]the roco[/nation]. The first nation to arrive was [nation]Tetros[/nation] I believe and then others from Westphalia  started to pour into Circumspice. It was a prosperous nation. But both of the region&#39;s CTE&#39;d leaving them like the region they left. They all eventually left for [region]RHINIA[/region] leaving this region to rot. Rest in Peace Tubor and The Roco and to all the others that have perished on this amazing trip.
