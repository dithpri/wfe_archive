The Trojan Nations are a combined force of regional peacekeepers. A pact known as the Trojan Edict was signed by Tahunor and Neyria to begin sealing the hostilities between them to create a peaceful region. The surrounding countries of Navus, Union Town and Mycenaen Greece were soon to join the pact as well. However, the Nation of Migressa has proven to be a bit of a landmine and many countries have ceased trade with the rebel nation.
