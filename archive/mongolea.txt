Guided by the desire for freedom and helped by our revolutionary armed forces, [region]Mongolea[/region] has become an independent region. 

After the expulsion of the raxulan troops, the Mongolean Soviet Socialist Republic (Mongolea SSR) now unwaveringly aids the socialist cause to free more oppressed regions from the tyranny of religious imperialism.

The Mongolean people finally torn down the raxulan churches and palaces and are free again to hold their native beliefs, mainly buddhism and atheism. The autocratic raxulan regulations like restrictions on marriage are overthrown too.

Protected by [region]The Revolutionary Watchtower[/region], captured from [region]Raxulan Empire[/region].
