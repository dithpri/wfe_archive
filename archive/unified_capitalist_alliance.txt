[region]Thaecia[/region], [region]The East Pacific[/region], and [region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to become sneak thieves for a day. They walked into your region, painted steaks on the wall, made funny faces into the camera, and snuck into your kitchen to eat all of your food! Don&#39;t worry, it was tasty! In order to celebrate their newfound wealth, Thaecia and friends dabbed as they made their way back to their sneak thief base with their sneak thief goods!
