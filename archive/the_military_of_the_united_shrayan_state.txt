[b][color=purple]This military serves to uphold the common human values held by most of the residents of the world. While we serve the region of [region]Shrayan Bose[/region], our number one priority isn&#146;t to fight to present our fatherland&#146;s muscle, but to reach the end goal of world peace. Militaries exist to save that which we love, not to destroy that which we hate. No army should ever lose sight of that.[/color][/b]
