In our fight against totalitarianism and oppression we shall never give up. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight to liberate other regions, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our region, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.
