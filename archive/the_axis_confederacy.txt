[b][color=navy]Welcome to [region]the Axis Confederacy[/region]![/b][/color][hr][i][color=navy]This region is a continuation of the now-inactive region known as [region]The Axis Alliance of Nations[/region]. The Axis is no longer built on the tenets of fascism and has been reformed into the &quot;Axis Confederacy&quot; to reflect our intention to change our ways and to adopt more democratic forms of rule. Feel free to say hello on our RMB, or ask the founder ([nation]The Verisconian Imperium[/nation]) for a position in our regional government.[/color][/i]
