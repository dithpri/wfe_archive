[b]Territory of [region]Vultune[/region] - it&#146;s the moon![/b]

This is Hephaistos, [region]Vultune[/region]&#39;s moon, with a radius of 88.2 kilometers (548 miles), 28.9 Celsius (84.1 Fahrenheit) (which is rising), and orbits Vultune every 10.6 days at a speed of 25057 kilometers per hour (15569.6 miles per hour). It has two biomes, rocky mountains and helium plains, and it is home to the elusive Heliumite, found almost exclusively on the helium plains. Hephaistos also contains subsurface oceans and a mysterious material that can assist in the future terraformation, but there are still a couple of mysteries about it.
