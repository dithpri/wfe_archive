People like to say &quot;[i]All lives can&#39;t matter until [region]Black Lives Matter[/region][/i]&quot;, and in response to this I say, &quot;[i][b]NO[/b] lives can matter until [b]ALL[/b] lives matter, it&#39;s all or nothing[/i]&quot;. Nobody on this earth is entitled to any form of special or specific treatment solely based on their race, those who say otherwise are racist by definition.
