After multiple bloody conflicts and civil wars, the Empire of Sangaria and the Empire of Ryoshima agreed on uniting under the banner of a new region, known as Sanu. Or better known as The Unified Sanun Empire
(To know more of our history please read the Sangarian factbook: http://www.nationstates.net/nation=sangaria/detail=factbook/id=main)

This Regions main objective is unifying the world by force, in order to make peace. We believe that war can be a useful tool, but should not be allowed to get out of hand. Our Unified Empire will be seen often intervening in external conflicts for the purpose of ending them more quickly and restoring stability
