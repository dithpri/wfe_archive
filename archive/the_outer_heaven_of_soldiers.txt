We will defy the nations, abandon our motherlands...
We will live free from the exploitation of soldiers made by nations...
We will live out of loyalty to ourselves! No motherland, no ideology but ourselves...

The times will decide what we are... We may become heroes of the times demand it... But if the times demand it we may indeed even become anti-heroes, villians even as far as terrorists... But what better place for us than this? This is our only home...

This is Outer Heaven!
