Calcis is a relatively small continent, made up of two subcontinents which are connected in the north by a small isthmus. In the center of these two subcontinents is a large island surrounded by several smaller islands, almost all of them pertaining to the Marcanese. Calcis is currently locked in a civil war between the original Zatyeon empire in the west and the new military government of Calcia led by Luceris in the east, who is almost completely unknown. As a result, several new nations decided to declare their statehood while others have decided to assert their own forms of autonomy without risking the consequences of a declaration of independence.
