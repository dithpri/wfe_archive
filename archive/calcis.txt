The continent of Calcis is currently embroiled in a civil war between the major empires of Calcia and Zatyeon. Overall, there are six nations that call Calcis home. The four other nations aside from the major empires are desperately trying to assert their national identity and sovereignty.

Calcis is made up of two continents connected by a small isthmus and a large ocean between the two. The ocean is almost completely filled by small islands, the largest of which are claimed under the state of Isla de Marcano. The isthmus is the main staging point between Calcia and Zatyeon. The Rogue Nation of Fiets Ravast has been established by an unknown Ravasti warlord on the isthmus.
