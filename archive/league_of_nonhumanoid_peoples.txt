bruh [region]league of nonhumanoid peoples[/region] ceased to exist so here is a remastered sussy baka land where everyone is vegan

(credit to [region]angery ogery topia[/region] for the first part of the WFE)

Original WFE:

Welcome to the League of NonHumanoid Peoples!
Don&#146;t let the name deter you from joining, we also allow human nations to join, too!
We&#146;re a rather new alliance, so we don&#146;t have much here, but we&#146;re going to work on more stuff!

Ideas/goals:
Have poll votes that can change how this alliance is ran.
Get to at least 12 members.
Become a big and prosperous alliance.


Enjoy your visit to our alliance! (Or don&#146;t, we don&#146;t mind!)
