The International Marshite Association is made up of various nations, political parties, and other organizations that are united in their shared religious and cultural heritage. They are pledged to work together on issues relating to culture and religious development among the parties. The I.M.A. is not a military alliance nor does it currently propose any actionable economic or policy goals that would preclude the following of all laws and statutes of the various nation-states that certain members belong to.
