The &quot;Western Ecological Safe-Haven Treaty of Falangist, Oligarchic, Reformed, Key nations&quot; Alliance is a diplomatic treaty with the goal of Common Defense for all who inhabit the region. 

Following a basis heavily influenced by N.A.T.O. and C.S.T.O. beliefs, the W.E.S.T.F.O.R.K. Alliance is a federation with a strong co-existence policy. With the only exception of Civil War, in which case the only direct conflict can occur between the two warring parties, not including volunteers and lend leases from other nations.
