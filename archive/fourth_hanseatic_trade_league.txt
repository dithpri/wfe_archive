[u][b]Welcome to The Fourth Hanseatic Trade League![/b][/u]

[color=blue]We are an alternate timeline past-tech roleplay region that prioritizes trade, diplomacy, and warfare. The current year is [u]1870[/u][/color] 

[color=orange]Check out the regional links and dive into the RP.[/color]

If you want to say anything about the region or about changes in the RP, contact [nation]Slavagorod[/nation] or [nation]Lubeck-Pomerania[/nation]. We want to know what each nation has to say, but we won&#39;t change the region all up, for the needs of one nation.
