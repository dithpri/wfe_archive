This is a region primarily intended for Christian Biblicists (Christians who adhere to the letter of the Bible, the Word of God).

We are Reformed in our soteriology, and Dispensational in our eschatology, hermeutics, and ecclesiology. However, we respect our brothers in the faith who adhere to Covenant Theology, both credobaptists and paedobaptists, and to them we extend the right hand of fellowship.

All Bible-believing Protestant Christians are welcome, but please respect the regional ethos and worldview.
