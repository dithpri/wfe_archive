The Ministry of Regions, a large, vast region undiscovered for nations to claim. Here in the Ministry of Regions, we do not question the views of other nations and allow them to use the way of authoritarianism. 
Note: If you see messages on your TV telling you to look at the moon, get attacked by flashlight eyed-like monsters and murderous GPS&#39;s, you are hallucinating. Everything is fine.

Everything is fine. Join now. Do it now.
