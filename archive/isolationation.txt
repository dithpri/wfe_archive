With 8 billion people in the world,
You&#39;d think it would be
Impossible to feel so isolated.
So tough to explain, 
I&#39;m frustrated, 
This is complicated,
I feel like my soul has been obliterated,
Mutilated, and violated. 
I can&#39;t think straight,
And no, I&#39;m not gay, 
Just a little confused
Feeling battered and abused,
My heart&#39;s been misused
And I have been accused
Of using others, when I&#39;m the one being used.
