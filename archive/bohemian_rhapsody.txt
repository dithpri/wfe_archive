Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he&#39;s dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I&#39;ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn&#39;t mean to make you cry
If I&#39;m not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
