It is time for a new beginning for the Nation of Maginian. Once, the nation was alone before joining the Lazarus Region. The people of these lands have shifted away from their barbaric, tribalistic existence over the generations, leading to petty squabbling and weak citizens. A new reign shines over the nation as Mason Cruvan, High Inquisitor of the Fallendawn, takes the throne following the death of Coltar Magin; last heir to the royal lineage.
