Love as large as brontosaurus
Passion like a bleeding walrus
Our love is real it&amp;#39;s no mirage
Want to lock you in my garage

Climb upon my trusty steed
Later you will taste my seed
This heart of mine is yours to capture
From now until velocirapture


I wield my passion like an axe
It&amp;#39;s warm and gooey just like wax
You cannot tame such juicy lust,
can you withstand my manly musk?

Yogurt is a dish best served chilled
Forgot to get my prescription filled.
Tonight I will have sex with you,
Then we will prepare a stew.

Tears and screams of pain and pleasure
Are gifts we will share forever 
Drenched deep in sweaty brine
is this blood yours or mine?
