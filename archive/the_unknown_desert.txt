[COLOR=696969][B]The Unknown Desert is a large desert with red sands, great canyons and little water. It is almost uninhabitable. The few people native to the desert, like the Arotinitee, are hard warriors, ready for anything anyone can throw at them. They also have a single rule - [i]&amp;quot;If it does not affect me as an individual, I do not give a damn about it&amp;quot;[/i][/COLOR]
