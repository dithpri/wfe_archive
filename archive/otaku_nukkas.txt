On the day of Friday, September 26th, this region was invaded by someone in the Black Riders Organization.

Members were kicked, embassies connections were cancelled, and lives were lost.

This is a day that will live on in infamy.

The Otakku Nukkas WILL NOT BE PUSHED AROUND BY ANYONE!

THIS IS AN ACT OF WAR!
