Somewhere in Space is a quiet, new, free alliance of conservative nations come together in peace and friendship to talk, argue, make jokes, roleplay, pretty much whatever pops into their minds. We don&amp;#39;t have any kind of bustling forum or anything like that, but sometimes the world is better with just the simple things. We may make some form of constitution later in existance, and any nations interested in joining our region are welcome to! Just like a nice little village, you can always count on a kind word and a cup of hot tea when you come.
