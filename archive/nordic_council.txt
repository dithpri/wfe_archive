[b]Welcome to the Nordic Council![/b]

Founded in August 2015 as an active World Assembly region, join us today to build a better tomorrow for all of NationStates! As part of our mission, Nordic Council provides assistance in writing, campaigning for, and passing World Assembly legislation for all members of the region who are also active on our [url=http://s15.zetaboards.com/Nordic_Council/index/]off-site forums[/url]. Please do not register on the forums without prior authorisation.

Membership in this region is not restricted and persons may participate from outside the region by sending a puppet to the Council and providing notice to their identity. The Nordic Council welcomes all.
