[color=darkblue]The Shtetle is the official Judaic colony of the Halcyon Empire, established by a peaceful political coup on November 14, 2012. This region previously served as a vibrant and active republic which became victim to both raiders and the struggles of inactiveness. Following the arrival of the Halcyon Empire, a colonial governorship was established and has since acted as the primary form of governance for the colony. Any acts of aggression towards this colony or any of her nations will be seen as a declaration of war against the Halcyon Empire. [/color]
