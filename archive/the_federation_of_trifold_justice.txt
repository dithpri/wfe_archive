      Welcome to the Federation of TriFold Justice. Within this region we strive to achieve moral justice based on traditional values given to us in God&amp;#39;s Word. You do not have to be Christian to join us, but we are a Christian environment. Our founding nation, Conservati, is the head nation. The two nations below Conservati are Squatpump and Duskanov are second in command. Together, we make a (the) TriFold Council, hence the term TriFold Justice. We are a federation because there are nations ruled under one government (or nation, called Conservati).
