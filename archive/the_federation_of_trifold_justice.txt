      Welcome to the Federation of TriFold Justice. Within this region we strive to achieve moral justice based on traditional values. Our founding nation, Conservati, is the head nation. The two nations below Conservati are Squatpump and Duskanov are second in command. Together, we make a (the) TriFold Council, hence the term TriFold Justice. We are a federation because there are nations ruled under one government (or nation, called Conservati).
