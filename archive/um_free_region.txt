Welcome to the UM Free Region! We are a region dedicated to friendly discussion and roleplay. 

We are a separate region that hopes to have everyone accepted as a member of the community, but most importantly, not united in ideological, or social, or cultural sense, but in defense.

So join us all UM countries that want to get away from all this &amp;quot;we must be a democracy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Manifest UM destiny&amp;quot; stuff. and just want to have a home for your country, where you can have regional wars, and alliances, and dialogue, with no regional leader telling you what to do. Dictators, keep oppressing, and democracy&amp;#39;s, keep voting on everything. VIVA LA FREEDOM! 

Now the only real restriction will be on spam, with a 3 strike rule then a ban/ejection.
