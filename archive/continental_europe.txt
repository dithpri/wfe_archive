The noble area of land which separates the modern west with the barbaric orient. Including glorious nations such as The Third Empire of Deus, Imperial Britannia, The Lands of Italia and The Republic of Helvenia. 

Despite the region having a very bloody history, peace and unity now surrounds the member states, with the last battle being fought between them in 1912, when Britannia was invaded from the Americas. 

Each member state lends soldiers to the Continental Joint Task Force (CJTF) who defend the region for the benefit of all her inhabitants. Each member is also represented in the Continental Chambers.
