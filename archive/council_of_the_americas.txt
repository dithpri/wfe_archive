We are an open and active group of nations stretching across the Americas advocating for peaceful relations and developing our political stance as a world power in creating an ideal society for our citizens to live in.

Created on July 10th, 2023 under the leadership of [nation]Deltanord[/nation].

Would you like an executive position? This is the perfect time to join, as we are in need of new members to fill important roles. If you are interested in taking on a leadership position in the council, join us and send a telegram to [nation]Deltanord[/nation], as well as if you have any questions.

We will be initiating a map soon, so stay tuned, as well as a roleplaying section with lots of fun events if you would like to participate, so don&#39;t miss out.
