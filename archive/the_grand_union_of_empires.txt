Regional History:[/i] We began as a small region modeled after The Roman Empire, we out grew that and moved to a new region where were became strong. We fell upon hard times and then the United Republic of Nations saved us from an early death. That region is GUE-lite, a continuation of the great regions before it. Let this be the next great region in the history of the &amp;quot;GUE Regions&amp;quot;.
