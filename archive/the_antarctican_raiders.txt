I see you are still alive... please step inside before another draft gets in.

Every member that decides to dwell here agrees that [b]revenge is a dish best served cold[/b], and any other dirty deeds [u]colder[/u].

If that is you, then you have come to the right region, and even [i]if it isn&amp;#39;t[/i], you are still welcome to chill here.

Currently this region is new with few members, but in due time I believe we shall become large enough to take down all regions with a WA delegate that we didn&amp;#39;t put there until their number is absolute zero.

If you are reading this please [u]do[/u] consider joining, or at least PM me about any questions you have or why you couldn&amp;#39;t join.
