This is a place where small nations may choose to live in order to maintain peace, prosperity, and freedom. No nation in this region shall engage in any war, and may choose to get involved in peaceful trade if they so wish. Only free nations may live here, and you must send a telegram to The People&amp;#39;s Republic of Lammatrey in order to gain access. You shall state your nation&amp;#39;s intentions and if Lammatrey approves you may join. The only qualifications for joining are being peaceful and free.
