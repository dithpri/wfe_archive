Welcome to our den, we are a new region based on a multicultural continent. We are hoping to have robust international affairs and involved regional politics. This basically means a multi-levelled experience for your nation.

Activities in The Continent range from exploring the continent in role-play to discussing policy for the governance of the region. While nations interact as independent states in role-play, the region is still a sovereign state to the world and to a large degree, internally.
