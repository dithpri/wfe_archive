[b][color=4B0082]Welcome to Club Nightingale. Come, take a seat.[/color]

The rules are simple. We&#39;re here to have [color=4B0082]a good time.[/color] As long as you don&#39;t violate everyone else&#39;s good time, we don&#39;t have a problem.

Make sure to endorse Jack Nightingale to keep us safe, join our Discord server (visitors welcome; link forthcoming), plug into the music, and dance until the Sun stops shining.[/b]
