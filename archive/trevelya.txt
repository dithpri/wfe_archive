The glorious hexagonal region of Trevelya sits far to the north. Often ridiculed by those from Hatfieldia or other such regions, we remain proud of our heritage and reputation as a kind and loving people, despite being a bit weird. Often we come together on the weekends to smash ourselves, and end up all wibbly-wobbly. Stay hexy!
