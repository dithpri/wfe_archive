Your region has been visited by some fast flying falcons from [region]The Black Hawks[/region]. 

They were looking for some food and shelter for the night, and saw that your region looked very cozy!

[color=Orange]As payment for your hospitality, the hawks decided to give you some new decorations, free of charge. Thanks for letting us stay! :P[/color]
