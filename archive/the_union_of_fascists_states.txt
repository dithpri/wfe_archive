[b][color=008822]Troops from these organizations dropped down this fascist chimney:

- Rudolph [region]The Red Fleet[/region] Reindeer
- On [region]The Pacific[/region]!
- On [region]The MT Army[/region]!
- On [region]Peoples Revolutionary Armed Forces[/region]!
- On [region]Korean Peoples Army[/region]!
- On sleigh-riding mercenaries![/color]

[color=blue]On some night in December, we opened our lashes
And saw not a creature could stop us - not even a fascist!
The swastikas hung from the flagpoles [i]sans[/i] care,
Begging [region]ANTIFA[/region] soon to be there.
Every nest of fascism will fall; 
Then dash away, dash away, dash away all![/color][/b]

[color=ff0000][b]A successful quarantine zone removed the diseases of HATE known as Nazism and Fascism[/b][/color]
