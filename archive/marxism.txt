Communism is not a failed social experiment of the 20th century nor a Cold War construct. It is an answer to the political question of what should be private property and what should be held in common. Communists take the radical position that everything should be communal; that does not mean that nobody has anything, it means everybody has everything. The revolution is an organised effort to emancipate humanity from the power of Capital.
