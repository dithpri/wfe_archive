The Vast, as its name implies, is a large area of political intrigue and varied interests, with plenty of room for the imaginative and politically savvy. Located in what has included Mediterranean-like, Germanic, Slavic, Russo and other cultures.

No limits in tech, WA membership, types of play, or anything else reasonable. Anyone&#39;s welcome who wants to hang out and not be a nuisance - using my region as a base to raid from is a nuisance. Don&#39;t do it. Raiders looking to mess the place up are also a nuisance. Kindly feel free to faff about elsewhere and entertain yourselves. 

[color=red][b]We&#39;re in it to have fun. Don&#39;t spam tg boxes or RMB with regional merge offers. It will be reported.[/b][/color]
