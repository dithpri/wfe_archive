Sleep is unusual here...Who was that you walked past? A man? Your sister? The Mayor? Yourself? You look in the mirror and such questions repeat in your own visage...You turn on the radio and man speaks of your neighbors sins. They replaced him with a mannequin but his family seems happier. The police are not seen, but heard as they drag people off...Gunshots fire off in the night, keeping you up. Sleep is unusual here.
