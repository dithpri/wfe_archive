[i]Welcome to Una Vis![/i]

Born out of a Civil War with the nations of the South Pacific, [nation]Summa Deus[/nation], our regional founder and current executive authority, foresaw a new union of powers, a sovereign force to be reckoned with by the largest of regions socially, politically, and economically. This diverse, democratic region is a chance for any nation to have their voice heard and respected on how the region should be run. Though small and young, it is a patriotic region in which all citizens are encouraged to participate in democracy.

[i]If a nation-state wishes to join, they are to be welcomed with open arms, and highly encouraged to endorse [nation]Summa Deus[/nation] for the World Assembly Delegate to retain stability in the regional administration.

[i][b]Glory to Una Vis![/b][/i]
