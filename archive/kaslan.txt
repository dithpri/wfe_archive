Kaslan.
An island that&#39;s surface can only be describes as an earthly mars.
It&#39;s covered in a dusty expanse and suffers from long dust storms every few months.
Kaslan was once an amazing place, now ruled by the dictator Grand Skear and held
down by his massive personal army known as KDF, aka Kaslan Defense Force.
Skear uses KDF to keep his citizens under his control and doing as he says, everything from
banning organized sports to giving his men nearly invincible, multi-million Kredit battlesuits
to deal with the frequent Guerrilla attacks from a group simply called &quot;The Rebellion.&quot;
