[color=#962e2e][i]On-site region for the Organized Group for Soviet Liberation, or [b]O.G.S.L.[/b], and it&#39;s message. [/i][/color]

[b][color=#965b2d]O.G.S.L. opposes the Soviet Democracy regime and works towards the end of the dictatorship established since the overstretched use of emergency powers in the Founder&#39;s Commissariat. [/color]

[color=#965b2d]O.G.S.L. has been formed with the purpose of inhibiting the administration and encouraging it&#39;s end by whichever means are necessary.[/color]

[color=#965b2d]O.G.S.L. will not cease its activities until the leadership, with the exception of the popular WA delegate, have abdicated; nor until the manipulated Soviet Charter has been abrogated; and not until the Founder&#39;s Commissariat of Soviet is formally abolished.[/color][/b]
