The United Nations of Imperialism was originally The International Union of Freedom but after years of reform the founding nations agreed on a new belief.

The UNI believes that all countries should defend each other fighting for freedoms of the upper class countries.While the lower/communist countries get taken down by our union of strong and smart soldiers.25% of all members armies will become part of The UNI People&amp;#39;s Army.Also we do not believe in war however we are strong enough to attack.
