                                                       (Already joined? Skip down from the paragraph) The states of war and peace is a small, democratic land where people of peace can live happily while talking, and people of war can attack in role-playing.

    Regional polls are held often. You can also run for office to help govern. (Mainly peace nation&#39;s) or join the armed forces. (Mainly warring nation&#39;s.) Whatever you do have fun.
