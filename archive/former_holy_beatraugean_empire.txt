
The Holy Betraugean Empire was divided into two nations after a political coup by the Eastern Revolutionary Movement, which after the revolution became known as the &quot;Communist Party of the People&#39;s Republic of East Betrauge.&quot;
The party is currently in command of the East, and the empire is still standing in the West.
The two regions are in constant conflict despite the various agreements between leaders of both nations.
