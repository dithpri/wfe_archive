[b]Welcome,[/b] weary wanderer, to the region of [region]Illuratum[/region], a land forever cloaked in the mists of tradition and smoke of archaic custom. We represent a diverse array of nationality and creeds; we reign from torrid deserts to frigid steppe. Come rest your possessions within our humble domains and join our number, as a member of the illustrious [region]Illuratum[/region] brotherhood. 

We are a new RP region dedicated to good writing, realism and cooperative story-telling. We do not tolerate any form of Out-Of-Character drama or bickering, and devoutly remain faithful to the ideals of good writing and regional unity.
