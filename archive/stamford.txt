[color=blue][b]Welcome to Stamford![/b][/color]
A region on [b]Long Island Sound[/b].

Known as &quot;[b][i]Rippowam[/i][/b]&quot; by the Siwanoy natives to the region, the present name is after the town of [b]Stamford, Lincolnshire[/b]. 
[b]Stamford Museum &amp; Nature Center[/b] has exhibits on natural and cultural history, an educational farm, an otter pond, and an observatory. 
[b]Cove Island Park[/b] is a bird habitat, with beaches, wetlands and trails. 
[b]Cummings Park[/b] has a beach and boardwalk. 
The wooded [b]Mianus River Park[/b] is on the city&#146;s outskirts.
Also, the [color=blue][b]Stamford[/b][/color] [b]Observatory[/b] has a 22-inch (560 mm) telescope. How big is yours?

Thanks, largely, to [b]NBCUniversal[/b] and [b]Mr. McMahon[/b], 
[color=blue][b]Stamford[/b][/color] has the largest financial district in the New York metropolitan region outside of New York City itself.
