Founded in the Antiquity Era, the Guardian Patriot Alliance (GPA) stood as a model for ideal regional government and the championing of freedom and liberty. It stood as a remarkable region built on democracy and good governance. The GPA was a thriving entity providing its citizens with a safe haven to interact with a diverse alliance of nations. 

The GPA is again looking to rebuild, seeks those who have unique backgrounds and skill sets, which can immediately be used to develop this stronghold for active nations. The GPA challenges its citizens, allies, and partners to break from the status quo and build a truly striking region for all to enjoy over years to come.
