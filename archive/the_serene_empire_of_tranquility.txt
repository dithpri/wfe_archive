The Serene Empire of Tranquility is an irrefutably peaceful region governed by the Masters&amp;#39; Council, consisting of every member nation. The council decides whether or not Embassies will be arranged, establishes basic laws for the region and binds the region together in a tightly-woven fabric. A fabric in which no one nation has any more power over another and respect is a mutual human right. 

[b][u]Important Note[/u][/b]: This region holds a zero-tolerance policy. Trouble-makers, raiders and the stubborn or aggressive will be banned with little warning
