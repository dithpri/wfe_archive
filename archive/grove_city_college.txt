Under the strict dictatorship of the benevolent ruler Dr. Jewell, Grove City College is a beacon of Conservative hope in a university system where students get good grades doing absolutely nothing but partying.

Please join if you are in any way affiliated with our institution. We&amp;#39;ll party &amp;#39;Grove City&amp;#39; style: with shoes in the door, feet on the floor, and staying off the grass.

If you can name the permanent things Grovers&amp;#39; are anchored to in a sea of change, you will feel right at home here ;)

Grove City College, &amp;quot;where your best hasn&amp;#39;t been good enough since 1876.&amp;quot;
