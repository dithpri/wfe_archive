[i][color=003366]The southernmost point in the United States, Key West is famous for waterspouts, lively nightlife, beaches and historic sites. Don&#146;t miss Duval Street, one of the most energetic strips of shops, bars and cafes in all the land. Did we mention Sloppy Joe&#146;s bar, a favorite hangout of novelist Ernest Hemingway? And, for the more sober-minded, the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum (look for the celebrated six-toed cats). Indeed, walking tours are the best way to see the island&amp;#39;s intriguing architecture, courtyards and gardens.[/color][/i]
