[color=black][b]Hamburg, or [i]The Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg,[/i] is the second-smallest of Germany&amp;#39;s 16 [i]Bundesl&auml;nder[/i], with a long history. The town takes its name from a castle built under Charlemagne in 808AD.[/color] 

[color=red]It is perhaps most famous as one of the Baltic trading cities of the Hanseatic League, and after the Holy Roman Empire&amp;#39;s demise in 1806, it became one of the states of the German Confederation. From then on it became a city-state and part of modern German states.[/color]

[color=orange]Hamburg was devastated in WWII but has since gone on to become one of Germany&amp;#39;s largest cities, remaining in the BRD throughout the Cold War. It is hoped that Hamburg will soon regain its former status as a key port in the Baltic.[/color][hr][color=black][region]The Union of German Nations[/region] welcomes you to Hamburg![/color][/b]
