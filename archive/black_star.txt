You must have wished on it
Because I saw them riding in on a Blackstar
They&#146;d rather chew than spit
And they&#146;re full of piss and vinegar

There&#146;s no way to persuade them to give up their crusade
They&#146;ve come to grant the wish you should have never made
Sing Hallelujah because you can&#146;t change anything

They&#146;ll let you try
To reverse everything
Don&#146;t waste your time
Sing Hallelujah because you can&#146;t change anything

They move without a sound
And their eyes will paralyze who gaze into
They&#146;ll leave you gagged and bound
To the whip of the wish they&#146;ve granted you

Looks like they&#146;re over it
I saw them riding off on a Blackstar
With nothing left to chew, they split
Because it makes no difference who you are
