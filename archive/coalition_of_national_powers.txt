Greetings and welcome to the Coalition of National Powers, or the C.N.P. for short. Here nations of any type and government, or lack of goverment, are free to speak their minds and have their voices heard. This is a region based on equality, where all its members are treated with preference or favoritism. Currently we are a small nation, one among thousands. However, we will grow, our voices will be heard, and we will stand strong!

If joining the C.N.P. interests, then please... endorse our Regional Leader, the Democratic Republic of Xialmptier.

If you have any questions, feel free to send a telegram to our leader. Thank you!
