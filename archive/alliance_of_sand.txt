This is a Political Region of Socialist States that feel unprotected. All who join the alliance, ruled by the disputed region of Central Israel and The Bulgar State, this region offers military protection and diplomatic ties to areas formerly owned, taken by the dirty systems of today. This region recognizes states fighting for freedom and independence over their foreign oppressors. Only Socialist and Communist States may join.
