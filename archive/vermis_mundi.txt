A barren world partially inhospitable because of its great winds and high sand dunes. The wastes are mostly governed by violent anarchists, but the mountains block the sand creating a lush green paradise full of free thinking intellectuals. RP is REQUIRED, eloquence is not. There will be little discussion will be between those in the dunes and those in the valley, as they have highly opposed ideals. The link to the map is http://imgur.com/J4WJ31Y
