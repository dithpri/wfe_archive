We are the Liberated Peoples of the Sunset Nebula.

Having fought for our freedom from colonial corpocratic domination, we are now surviving - and thriving - as free revolutionary intercommunalist peoples. We seek to engage in communal strength and ensure the power of the people will always stay standing.

Long Live the Revolution!
Inquilab Zindabad!
Intifada - From the River to the Sea!
Patria o Muerte!
Comuna o Nada!
Jin, Jiyan, Azadi!
Hasta La Victoria Siempre!
