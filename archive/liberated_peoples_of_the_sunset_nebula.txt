We are the Liberated Peoples of the Sunset Nebula.

Having fought for our freedom from colonial corpocratic domination, we are now surviving - and thriving - as free revolutionary intercommunalist peoples. We seek to engage in communal strength and ensure the power of the people will always stay standing.

Long live the revolution!
