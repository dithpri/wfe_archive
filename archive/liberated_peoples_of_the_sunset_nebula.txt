Salute, friends! We are the [region]Liberated Peoples of the Sunset Nebula[/region]!

Having fought for our freedom from colonial imperial oppression, we are now surviving - and thriving - as free revolutionary intercommunalist peoples. We seek to engage in collective growth and ensure the power of the people will always stand.
