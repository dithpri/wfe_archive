[b]Hear my call, ye boozers of the world![/b]

Now is the time to join with our fellow drunkards and pave the way for a new future of frothy drinks and incoherent, late-night phone calls!

Come brothers and sisters! Let us revel in our indulgence and cast-away those who would impede on our divine-given buzz!

This day shall mark the founding of our commune as a platform to spread our ideals and most-necessary babble. Welcome friends and strangers alike; join us for a drink (or two) and we shall begin our deliberations.
