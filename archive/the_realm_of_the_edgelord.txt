Do you like edgy s***? Do you like tasteless jokes about tragedies that aren&#39;t always that funny? Do you like saying edgy stuff like &quot;Some of the Star Wars prequels were better than the originals&quot;? Well, then you belong here. Also if you like to say things such as: Lego Bionicle wasn&#39;t that cool, Rob Zombie Halloween movies were the best, R.I.P Bin Laden, The Illuminati is actually a peace organization, or Jeff the Killer is the best villain ever you are welcome here. If you like Lil Pump... f*** off.  He heh yeah boi.
