Fort Wolcott was a fortification on the small Goat Island in Newport Harbor of Narragansett Bay. The attacks on HMS St John and HMS Liberty occurred near the fort. With the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775, the fort was renamed as Fort Liberty. In 1776, American patriots armed Fort Liberty with 25 guns and built various breastworks to defend the City of Newport. &#151;Wikipedia
