[b][color=navy]Welcome to the Coalition Against Socialism![/color][/b]

[i]The Coalition Against Socialism, a Coalition against the proliferation and continuation of Socialism, was created so that regions and their causes may be amalgamated in their political crusades against the ideology so that they may be more effective. As such, we the regions propose that all regions against Socialism put aside their differences and join together in order to construct a lucrative relationship, based on an affinity in interests, to create the Coalition Against Socialism. Regardless of one region&#39;s political orientation, any region with a rejection of Socialism will be embraced and welcomed with open arms into the Coalition.[/i]
