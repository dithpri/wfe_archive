Welcome to [color=purple]Pazzo Haven![/color]

This is a region, full of simply anybody. From silent, yet intense people, to the ones who make zero progress. This is Pazzo Haven, where everybody co-exists. 

We are a democracy, for every two weeks, we will elect a new World Assembly Delegate. 

First of all, there will be weekly meetings, to explain what we will be doing. If you cannot attend, one of us should send a telegram to inform you. 

Secondly, don&#39;t do anything stupid. You get the idea.

Lastly, we have an official discord. Send me a telegram for the link.
