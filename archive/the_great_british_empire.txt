Upon the Sigman Empire&amp;#39;s invasion into the European Continental Empire, and subsequent victory, Irish forces pushed out of their homeland and took control of England, Wales, Scotland, France, Germany and Spain. The battered and exhausted remnants of the E.C.E&amp;#39;s forces were no match for the new Knightmare Frame, the Type 0142 Ballista, a gift to them from the Sigman Empire. The empire is ruled by Richard O&amp;#39;Donovan the 1st, who shares both a name and an ancestor with the Sigman ruler, His Royal Majesty Emperor Richard Zi Sigma.
