The British Empire has been established. We seek to embrace all that embodied the British Empire, a land where gentlemen were gentlemen and ladies were ladies. We seek to help all our colonies and allies, prosper within our Empire. We are proud of the history of the British Empire and wish to continue it on with the help of our friends. The British Empire is something all British people should be proud of and something we wish to remember and do justice to. 

Here we remember great heroes such as Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington and William Pitt etc. 

The British Empire may have gone but we stand firm and will continue the fight for our Empire.
