The F.A.N.U. is a region for people who have a strong desire to do scenarios or operations of any kind. Role play is a large part of the F.A.N.U. however realism is a key element, such as we only have a 25 billion dollar / pound limit for military&amp;#39;s, and one must role play with realism. Scenario&amp;#39;s are for fun and do not have any lasting conciseness, however operations will have a lasting affect one you, such as if you lose a Amphibious assault ship it will remain lost for a period of 10 days. We also do realistic politics and interact with each other on the same level of realism. Geo must stay consistent and must fallow everyone else, Temperate forests jungles, deserts a mediterranean style. Try to make allies and enjoy yourself.
