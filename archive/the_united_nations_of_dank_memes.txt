Welcome friends, to the United Nations of Dank Memes. Here we are all friends, but that doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t allowed to battle each other! Here, if you know what SKPS means, you&#39;re good, but if you don&#39;t, you most likely won&#39;t fit in. And another thing, please don&#39;t spam the public chat box with things THAT DONT HAVE TO DO WITH THE REGION. Im looking at you spammers. If you do, you will simply get suppressed, but other than that you won&#39;t be effected. Another thing in the public chat box is to not use it disrespectfully. Please don&#39;t start any drama, as that can turn problematic. Other than all this, have a good time, and welcome to the UNDM!
