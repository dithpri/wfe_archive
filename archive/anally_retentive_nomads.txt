A region founded by a group of very uptight, but well rounded nomads who have decided that wandering around forever isn&amp;#39;t really that good of an idea. So they&amp;#39;re not really nomads anymore. In fact, they don&amp;#39;t really know what to call themselves now, just that they were nomads and they were tired of carrying water around in their anus&amp;#39;s. 

Anyway, the ARN have decided to escape the hostile forces of the other regions and settle down.
