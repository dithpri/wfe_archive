Solanum is a region isolated from the rest of the NS and revokes around imagination, hard sci fi and a close community. I was tired of the focus on MT RPs that have an extreme focus on realism with no space for creativity/ imagination that is within reason however I also believe that standard FT has far to much handwavium (It flat out violates laws of physics. We&amp;#39;re waving our hands and saying pay no attention to the man behind the curtain). I wanted to create a region that had a strong presence in space however it still have some sensibility and earth based battles.
