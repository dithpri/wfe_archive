The Algorenian Continent is home to the United Federation of Algorenia. The continent was split between a alliance of Ultra Radical Communist states called The Nexonian Alliance to the west and a Federation of Capitalistic and Democratic Nations to the East.

Following a massive and costly war that killed over 130 million people from both sides, the East came out victorious and the Western states decided to join the Federation following their defeat and the dissolution of the Nexonian Alliance.
