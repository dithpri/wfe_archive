Mama, just killed a man[with ebola]
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he&amp;#39;s dead
WHO, life had just begun
But now I&amp;#39;ve gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oe-b-o-l-ao
Didn&amp;#39;t mean to make you cry
If I&amp;#39;m not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters[like the presidential race of 2016]
