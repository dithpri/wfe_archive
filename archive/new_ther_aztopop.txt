We stand for independence. Our founder Matalino will have no power over any nations that join. We are simply a home for anyone willing. We have heard recently that many people are losing region homes because of recent password protection. We have no password in order to offer a home for nations until needed otherwise. We would like to recruit in case of wars and such so we advise you to stay. Thank you, Matalino
