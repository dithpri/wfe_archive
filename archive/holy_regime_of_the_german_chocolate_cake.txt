All Hail the German Chocolate Cake!

The heathen Black Riders once again rode into our Holy Regime, but are no longer a threat! For the Holy Pastry has no patience for such horrid iniquities!!

Screw y&amp;#39;all, Black Riders. I&amp;#39;mma knock y&amp;#39;all out with some Cake.

Update:
Until we have a larger number of endorsements for Exgraecia, I am removing delegate access from the region.
If we can&amp;#39;t support our delegate, we can&amp;#39;t fight against the Riders. And I REALLY don&amp;#39;t like fighting those guys.

I used to BE one.
