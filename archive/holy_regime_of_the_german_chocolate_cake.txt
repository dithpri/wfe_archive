All Hail the German Chocolate Cake!

We have fought off our would-be oppressors and proven that the Holy Pastry is truly the mightiest in all the world!

May coconuts, cocoa and milk never cease to emanate from the throne of the Holy One!

May the maple syrup never cease to flow!

May our enemies tremble at the mere mention of the Holy Regime!
