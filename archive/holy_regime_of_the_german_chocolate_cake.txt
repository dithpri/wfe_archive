All Hail the German Chocolate Cake, whose holy sacrifice hath made our gullets full!

[color=3300ff][b]The Holy Regime of the German Chocolate Cake[/b][/color] has been returned to its former and continued glory.

Praise our savory overlord for his favor hath shined down upon us, his loyal subjects, on this day of victory.

A Word From Our Founder:
In light of recent events, I am formally requesting that all WA Representatives endorse Exgraecia. Should the Dark Riders or another group attempt invasion again, my only options are password protecting the region or removing regional control from our delegate.
