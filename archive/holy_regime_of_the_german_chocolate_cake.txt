All hail the delicious German Chocolate Cake!
His holy sacrifice hath made our gullets full!
For out of the oven didst the perfection of pastry and cocoa emerge, full of valor and deliciousness, to feed the people in our time of hunger!
Yay and verily, he hath bestowed upon us a confection, the likes of which had never been tasted before!
And he cast aside the harlot Pumpkin Spice Latte to become a holy pair with his true love: the life-mother, Milk.
Indeed, our love and praise shall forever be to the German Chocolate Cake! May he forever bless our stomachs with goodness and fulfillment!!
