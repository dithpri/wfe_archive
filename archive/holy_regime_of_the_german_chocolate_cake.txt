All Hail the German Chocolate Cake!

For he hath given himself a holy sacrifice to fill our gullets!!

For as it is written, he turned away the Latte of Pumpkin Spice and chose the life-giver, the satiater, sweet mother milk as his faithful companion. And thus forever forged a holy union with the life-giver to bring piece to our digestive systems.

All hail bread! From whom all desserts began!
All hail sugar! From whence comes the flavor of the dessert!!
All hail cocoa! From whom the German Chocolate Cake descends!!
