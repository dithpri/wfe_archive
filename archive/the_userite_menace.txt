Ever present, ever watching. 

The Userite Menace may not be seen... but it is always near. 

Cast off the shackles of GCR elitism and forge your own paths, dear UCR&#39;s. 

[i]Oh, better far to live and die / Under the brave black flag I fly, / Than play a sanctimonious part, / With a pirate head and a pirate heart. / Away to the cheating world go you, / Where pirates all are well-to-do; / But I&#39;ll be true to the song I sing, / And live and die a Pirate King.[/i]
