[color=blue]Welcome! This is a football/soccer related region, for the most sporty regions out there.[/color]
[color=red]We will hold Delegate votes every month or so, once we hit 6 nations. If you want to join, please contact [nation]Neymarland[/nation] or our incumbent Delegate.[/color]
Tell [nation]Neymarland[/nation] if you want to be added to the fantasy map.
Also, I recomend using [url=https://www.leaguerepublic.com/index.html]LeagueRepublic [/url] for your leagues and [url=https://joshuavandermeer.nl/projects/matchsimulatorv2/selectmatch.php] Football Match Simulator[/url] for simming, or use good ol&#39; PES or FIFA. 
I&#39;d ask if you would join the WA and get ready for our Delegate vote from Feb 1st-Feb 7th.
DISCORD IS HERE (still in progress)

We have had a foiled raid attempt, so if anyone sees someone with the (badge, arms thingy?) of anyone of those nations, report them to [nation]Neymarland[/nation] Immediately.
