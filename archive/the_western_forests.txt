Located in the western hemisphere, and near the coastlines, the Western Forests are home to quiet nations that keep to themselves. 
They value peace, democracy, political and civil freedoms, and negotiation and trade... for the most part anyways. 

Warring is not outright forbidden, except within the region. The States have an excellent relationship with one another and are happy to avoid the day to day rabble and excitement of most places. All states are required to have a ministry of silly walks, however, in order to properly communicate during regional water balloon tournaments, which is a favourite sport in the Western Forests.
