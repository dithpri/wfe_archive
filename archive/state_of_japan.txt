Hello, everyone. This is the founder of the State of Japan. I decided to create this community as a comprehensive and friendly place for people who love Japan and Japanese culture.

In the light of the recent situation in the original [region]Japan[/region] region, we are tolerant of various political and economic ideologies, but I would like to make it clear that hatred does not live here in Japan.
