Join The World Organization of Labor Camps.

Here, we support Authoritarianism above all else. Tyrannies, anarchies, and communist governments are especially welcome. 

We are here, not make peace, but to rule. Our military and economy is put above all else.

Slave Camp IV shall be in charge, no questions about it. Any rebellion will be dealt with briskly and efficiently. 
If the Great Leader&#153; sees fit, he can appoint someone else if he grows tired of being a God-King.

You will all be united with Slave Camp IV in the center.

We will stop any countries seeking civil rights, natural entitlement, and choice.

Join now, or be conquered in the future!
