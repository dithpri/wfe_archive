Welcome to Western Europe! 

We are a proud region with a rich history of nation-based roleplay. You&amp;#39;ve created a nation...answered issues with a vision of what your nation is all about--now have some fun actually BEING that leader! Most of our role play is performed at the off-site forum (link below), where you can pick a map plot and delve into a realm of nation building, economics, diplomacy, and even war. Registration at the forum is easy and completely free, just like NationStates itself. Hope to see you there!
