Hello and welcome one and all to The Union of Slavic Nations. If your nation is slavic, slavic-themed, or just interested in the slavic way of life, this is the region for you. We are dedicated to protection of slavic tradition, heritage, and culture. We are founded on the principals of protecting democracy and free markets, including reduction and/or elimination of tariffs on foreign goods, removal of uneducated regulations on enterprise, free and fair elections, term limits, and income mobility.
