[B][color=orange]Founded just a few days ago by a disgruntled Socialist bored of his old region, Sunalaya, Lilllehammer is a tiny Roleplayer region with an active founder. Although it&amp;#39;s still ridiculously small, we&amp;#39;re quite active.[/color][/B] Any nations, regardless of ideology, political preference, gender, etc. etc. are welcome! We&amp;#39;re currently setting things up, but anybody&amp;#39;s welcome
