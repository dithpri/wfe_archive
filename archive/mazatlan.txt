[b]Mazatl&aacute;n[/b] is a city in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, located on the Pacific coast across from the southernmost tip of the Baja California Peninsula.

The city was founded in 1531 by Spaniards and indigenous settlers. A large group of German immigrants developed Mazatl&aacute;n into a thriving commercial seaport in the mid-19th century. The German settlers influenced the local music, banda, which is an alteration of Bavarian folk music. The settlers established the Pacifico Brewery on March 14, 1900.

Mazatl&aacute;n is the second-largest city in the state. It is also a popular tourist destination, with its beaches lined with resort hotels. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
