Gerkland has a great history! It was once a former British Colony for almost 200 years. British troops left The Region Of Gerk
[At that time being &#145; Great Dutchland &#145;. It was unclaimed for 50 years after the fall of Great Dutchland until Emperor Carter Of Gerkland discovered it and has now claimed it &#145;The Region Of Gerk&#146;. If you join, we hope you have a great time!
