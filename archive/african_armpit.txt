South of Western Africa, west of central/southern Africa. Recently discovered region of the world. Home to casual nations that are just here to have a good time. No obscene, rude, or racist comments or nations will be banned from the region. No fascism is allowed, all nations are allowed to join. (Except nations that do the restricted things above.) Young region, fun, more activities are getting added to region. Apply for offices in the RMB, and have a good time.
