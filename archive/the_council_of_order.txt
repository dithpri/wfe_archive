Welcome everyone! We strive to have sovereignty for all nations. Now come on in and associate yourself with our fellow nations. We hope you feel at home here.

We want all nations to be active members in the council and help within the regional government. Every voice is heard and we accept all opinions and view points.

We enjoy creative conversations and roleplaying here as well. Spark something new and exciting with your thoughts! The mind is an amazing thing and we want you to use it.
