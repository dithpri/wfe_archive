Standing as the most devout realms of the Illuminati Alliance, Ravana is famous for its adherence to our most famous sacred texts: The Ten Global GuideStones and the 72 Seals of truth.  Many of the most holy members opt to join the Guardians Sanctum, where they are given access to the entire Alliance and a modest home.
