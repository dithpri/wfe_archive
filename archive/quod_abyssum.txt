Where nations go to be devoured and consumed. Come, come to [color=red]the Abyss[/color], the bottomless pit where I dwell. All are welcome. Make your own policies, and choose your own leaders. But know that there is no such thing as being &amp;quot;banished&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ejected&amp;quot; from [color=red]the Abyss[/color]...There is infinite room enough for everyone here...It can never truly be invaded, it cannot be defeated, it cannot be destroyed...It simply exists...But it can be claimed, for all can claim it...
