Gallifrey is the home planet of the Doctor, the Master and all the other Time Lords, so this region is dedicated to honesty, bravery and the Time Lord ways!

We have recently been acquired by the Irken Empire, which includes [region=Earth], [region=Vulcan] and [region=Krypton].  That&amp;#39;s okay.  The little green men can do what they want as long as we can fight for justice with a capital &amp;quot;G.&amp;quot;
