It is the 28th century; over five centuries have passed since the loss of its key colony from the mid-21st century with no sign of another potential homeworld. Now that homeworld has been found on a small white star several times hotter, we found a lone-ringed planet with a small familiar moon. We named that planet Suria, after the Hindi sun god, and as the ancient phoenix tale says, we are reborn as one hybrid race, the Lusurians.

Now we are ready to make a comeback and hope we can find absolute peace in this new vast territory, and to inform our old friends that we finally have a home again.
