[b][color=BA0F08][i]The origins of Byzantion, or Byzantium are shrouded in legend...[/color][/b][/i]

Tradition says that Byzas of Megara founded the city when he sailed northeast across the Aegean Sea in 667 BC. The Roman Emperor Constantine I, in AD 330, refounded it as Nova Roma. Ultimately, the city became the beating heart of Romania for nearly a thousand years after the fall of the West.
