The origins of Byzantion, or Byzantium are shrouded in legend.

Tradition says that Byzas of Megara founded the city when he sailed northeast across the Aegean Sea in 667 BC. The Roman Emperor Constantine I, in AD 330, refounded it as Nova Roma.

Today we take our mighty heritage and strive to be a commercial, cultural, and diplomatic centre in Nationstates.
