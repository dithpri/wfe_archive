Our citizens were once oppressed by a harsh and outright damning dictator. They were either forced away from their homes or chose to leave in hopes of a better life; I used to be one of those people. That is, until I  founded The Land of The Unwanted. Together we thrive as one. Together we make better lives for our community. Together we fight!
We are kind people, but if you do not show us the same in return, then kindness is not what you will remember us for.
