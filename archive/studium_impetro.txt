[color=#000000]Studium Impetro is a region for all nation types. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter where you stand politically, or how radical your views are, we&amp;#39;ll accept you in, as long as you don&amp;#39;t have a history of regional takeovers or anything of that sort. We hold regional elections for multiple government positions, such as: Councilman or Councilwoman, Recruiter, and Spokesperson.
(If your nation is space-faring, that&amp;#39;s alright with us. Same thing if it&amp;#39;s not a Human nation.)[/color]

[color=#000000]We will be holding regional elections as soon as we get ten WA Members. Only WA Members may run for regional elections, regular members may only vote. If you have a WA Account and a Non-WA Account in the region, both will be kicked.[/color]
