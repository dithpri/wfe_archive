[Color=hotpink][i]Potato. Potato, lovely and round,
You come out of the ground.
Peel off the rot, and put it in the pot.
Go to a seat, and get ready to eat.
If they are made precise,
They should be nice.[/color]

[Color=darkorange]Potatoes are nice.
Oh they&amp;#39;re lovely, to be precise. 
Tasty to eat.
And good with meat.
Ten out of ten.
Oh everyone should like them.[/color][/I]
