I hear them curse and crave my crop
In bitter waves of woe -
For though I have the means to stop,
The humble taters grow -
And always are they cursed to know,
Without a reason why -
That I could end the feed and flow,
And all the world would die.

I see their empty plates and plight,
And from my tuber-throne -
Upon my seat of starchy spite,
I sow the seed, alone -
And so the paupers grieve and groan,
Until, for what it&#39;s worth -
Potato-goods are all that&#39;s known,
And spuds control the Earth.
