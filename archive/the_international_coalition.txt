Welcome Nations,

The International Coalition seeks to be an active, friendly, role-playing region where all are welcome regardless of experience. We vow to fight tyranny and racism in all forms and are dedicated to creating a fair democratic society where the ideals of equality and tolerance are up-held. For role-playing nations we only ask for realism and a common attitude of respect to exist amongst members.
Thanks for visiting us,
The International Coalition Government
