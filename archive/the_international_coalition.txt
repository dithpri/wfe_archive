[b][color=red]every single time someone raids this dead region, I get about 500 billion notices. Please, if a region has a currently active founder, kindly not raid said region. We see everything you do. Also, TIC never volunteered itself for anything. [i]Have a nice day![/i][/color][/b]
Let this region serve as a monument to all the fun that went on here.
