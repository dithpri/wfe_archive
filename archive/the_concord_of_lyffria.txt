[b][Color=skyblue]Region for world building. What do we (I) do? Well we (barely) do worldbuilding and cartography, I plan on eventually opening this publicly, but for now I&#39;m using it as a puppet storage/worldbuilding region

Now ain&#39;t that pretty cool? 

What about embassies? Well, those are always accepted, almost always...

Now scram! (&amp;#8807;&amp;#21475;&amp;#8806;)&amp;#12494;[/b][/color]
