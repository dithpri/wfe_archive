Just trying to see how this goes, if anyone&amp;#39;s interested feel free to join. Planning on making a constitution and regional government. I&amp;#39;ll maintain control while we build the region then I&amp;#39;ll give power over to the WA Delegate. I plan on keeping it small maybe 30 people at most? We&amp;#39;ll reside later.
