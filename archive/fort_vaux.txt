Fort Vaux is a decommissioned 19-20th century fort which lies near the city of Verdun. It is known for the close-range clash it hosted between French and German troops during the Battle of Verdun in World War One. Despite losing hold of the fort after heroic and stubborn defense, the French later recaptured it and pushed the Germans back from Verdun.
