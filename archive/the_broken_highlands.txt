Welcome to the Broken Highlands, a place anyone can go to practice their ideals and traditions without being overly persecuted however, we encourage that you are either on the left or in the middle. Conservatism is not practised around here. Automatically, we are secular, we do not have a particular religion that we cater to and that&#39;s probably for the best. We are all for the rights of homosexuals, transsexuals, all ethnic groups and equality for the male and female genders but we dislike feminazis and &#39;SJWs&#39;. We have a neutral stance on war and will only join wars if they are justified and not just war for resources *cough*USA-Iraq*cough*.
