By working together and keeping all interactions within The Interdependent States we can thrive. If we produce all products in our own nations, then there will be a good circulation of the economy as well as a steady flow of income and outcome. This new system of self-sufficiency will work as long as the people are happy. 

Hopefully you believe in this REVOLUTIONARY new government that holds a high value for:
- Community
- Nationalism
- Freedom

If you join us, we will protect you as you protect us.
