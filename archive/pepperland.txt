[color=blue]80,000 leagues beneath the sea it lay or lie I&#39;m not too sure. Through the Sea of Time, beyond the Sea of Science, pass the Sea of Monsters, after the Sea of Nothing, on to the Foothills of the Headlands or Sea of Heads, within the Sea of Holes you will find the Sea of Green, and that&#39;s how you get to Pepperland.[/color][/i]

[color=orange]Pepperlanders to Battle! It&#39;s time to unbonk NS, Even a little snatch of a tune might get them up again.
Supplant the doom and the gloom! Turn off what is sour! Turn into a flower and BLOOM! BLOOM! BLOOM![/color]
