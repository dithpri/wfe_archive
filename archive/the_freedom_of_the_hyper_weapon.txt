To escape the tyranny of those who would prey on the weak nations of the world, and enforce their own illegitimate restrictions upon nations within the various regions, we, the freedom-loving people of Hwanggot, hereby declare and decree that [b]The Freedom of the Hyper Weapon[/b] be hereby formed to ensure that there is a refuge for those that seek true, legitimate, region-wide governing.

We are governed by two main premises. Freedom, and the Hyper Weapon. The Freedom is self-explanatory.

[u]Rules of the region:[/u]

1. Don&#39;t break site rules, unless you can get away with it.
2. Do whatever you like with your own nation.
