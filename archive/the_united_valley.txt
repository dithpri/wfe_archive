REMEMBER:

You will have this whole week to complete this activity and on Friday, you will have a written assessment asking you questions about certain aspects of your decision making and the end result of your nation-state. There is no way to win, but you can be ranked at the top of the United Valley region for certain reasons, again, some good and some bad. Your conscience will be your guide in this nation-building civilization. Like always, if you have any questions feel free to ask Mr. Richards! AKA THE GREAT ETERNAL LEADER LEONIDAS RICHIE II!
