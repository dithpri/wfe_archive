[b][u][color=green]Welcome to The Lysandrian Empire![/b][/u][/color]
We are a small humble region with high hopes for our future. Here nations can participate in an Immersive Role-Play Experience, Regional Government, R&amp;D, as well as friendly conversations. Please message [nation=short+noflag]The Plantagenets[/nation] if you have any questions regarding anything. Or drop a message on the RMB, chances are you won&#146;t have to wait long for a friendly reply.
