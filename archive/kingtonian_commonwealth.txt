Welcome to the [b]Commonwealth of Kington Langley[/b]. 

Created through democratic cooperation, this organisation is designed to collectively represent the interests of both former and current dependent territories of Kington Langley. Our aims and ambitions generally follow those of the many post-colonial commonwealth organisations with attempts to restore colonial administration condemned and the creation of closer diplomatic and economic ties commended.

We have a regional currency: The [b]Kingtonian Pound[/b] (1 KLP = 1.93 USD)

[b]Embassies:[/b] We are open to regional embassy requests, please feel free to submit one today.
