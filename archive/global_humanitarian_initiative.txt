[b][color=#0080FF]WELCOME![/color][/b]

[color=#58ACFA]This is a region for [u]secular humanists[/u]. We will keep up high levels of Civil Rights and fight injustice and untruths. This region will have a code of human rights and a constitution to form a democratic government, which will form the daily government of this region.[/color]

Momentarily the region is open for everyone, mainly because I like feedback and need some help setting up the first constitution -and of course we need members establishing the first regional government.

[b]If you have any questions or (especially) if you want to help out set this region up, do feel free to telegram me.[/b]
