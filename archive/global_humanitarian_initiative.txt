This is a region for radical [u]secular humanists[/u]. We will keep up high levels of Civil Rights and fight injustice. This region will have a code of human rights and a constitution to form a democratic government, which will form the daily government of this region.

Momentarily the region is open for everyone, mainly because I like feedback and would appreciate some help with setting up the first constitution. And of course we need members establishing the first regional government.

If you have any questions, or (especially) if you want to help out set this baby up, feel free to telegram me or my WA nation.
