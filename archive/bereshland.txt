Bereshland is a relatively small region, known for its copious use of bright green paint in interior decoration, its absolutely bone-chilling windstorms (which oddly enough last for about an hour each day), and above all, its love of coffee. 

Curiously, the inhabitants of the region have stayed approximately the same age year after year, leading some to believe that Bereshland might actually contain the fabled Fountain of Youth and/or Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone; others believe this phenomenon is caused by an age-slowing cryogenic effect brought on by the freezing windstorms. Neither hypothesis has been verified.
