[b]Ilikrana is a region, dedicated to culture and democracy. We were founded by the Three Factions on April 28th, 1800.

If you are looking for a small region to start your role plays or to launch a career in regional politics, feel free to come over and help us build our region. 

We are currently on the lookout for new members to join, so please check us out and ask to join the government. We have several spots still open.[/b]
