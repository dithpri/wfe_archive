The Union was formed long long ago ushering in the 3rd Age in the history of Telms. A problem arose in the late the 7th Age as the invention of an explosive powder brought upon the prospect of a new type of warfare. The T&#39;ajin King fearing the spread of this threat, usurped the Gonji Throne in 7A485 starting the Great War. After 24 years of brutal war, the Great War ended in a victory for the T&#39;ajin. The T&#39;ajin demanded that the Emperor be put under watch of their own army, handing effective control of the Union to the T&#39;ajin. A strict ban on explosives created a period of T&#39;ajin supremacy.
