The Multiversal Commonwealth is the sprawling governance of Mechanica Rationalis, a world-spanning nation of incredibly advanced technologies. Following the discovery of Keyhole Transit, Mechanica Rationalis has extended cybernetic limbs out into the infinite expanse of the multiverse, establishing dozens of colonies across the probability curve of existence.

Since the collapse of the tech-unlocked offshoot of an Altera long extinct, Mechanica Rationalis has strived to become as robust as possible, forming a nation that will survive eternal, with peace for all citizens across all worlds.
