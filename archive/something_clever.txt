Something Clever is a coalition of independent nations formed to ensure the integrity of their borders. The name was an accident; president Josef Flaxbeard of Flaxtopia handed a sheet of paper to his aide, with the words &amp;quot;name it something clever&amp;quot;. The aide decided to name it just that, &amp;quot;Something Clever&amp;quot;. He was promptly fired.
