[color=#2a26a3]Helianur was once united around [b]Nurudhyn[/b], an elven nation ruled by the [u][b]Sun Throne[/b][/u]. However, 1,000 years ago, the Sun Empire of Nurudhyn collapsed.

The fall of the Empire led to the emergence of several independent nations across the Continent. Even today, some nations still covet the remnants of the Sun Throne, to establish their domination over the rest of Helianur.[/color]
