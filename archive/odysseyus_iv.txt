On the Side of the Universe, there Lies a Galaxy divided. Some follow along with the Blue Coalition, a Faction of Peaceful Explorers, and consist of more then just One  Species. then there is the Red Dominion, A faction dedicated to the Ruthless Conquest of Neutral systems and planets, and even Nations on these planets, And even in some cases, Blue Coalition planets.
both factions hate one another, and both well give anything to have the other gone.
