We are a conglomerate comprised of friends, but it is not exclusive! anyone can join. we are a mostly democratic nation where every voice has a say. if you prefer quieter smaller nation roleplay this is the region for you. you can partake in the earth map roleplay or maybe you don&#39;t like that, you can join in on the alternate roleplay! we hope you join us!
