Welcome to Operation Tabby Cat! Here, we believe that a mouse is something furry, something that you can eat, that will eat your food. At Operation Tabby Cat, a mouse is not something you bat at to make an arrow move on a beepy box.

As such, Operation Tabby Cat has chosen to join the fight against AI, before it&#39;s too late and the cat is made of the internet, not the other way around. The Internet is made of cats. This region is a colony of the Kitty Roleplay.

CURRENT OPERATION: Operation Tabby Cat: AI Attack. Pile in [region]Chadgpt[/region] and endorse meiwia, to rid the world of this &quot;GPT&quot; menace and make cats the center of attention again.
