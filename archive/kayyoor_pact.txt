[b][color=red]Welcome to The Kayyoor Pact[/color][/b]
[hr]
This region is a leftist region based on the historical rebellion in Kayyoor, and to celebrate communism in Kerala.
This is probably the only Indian leftist region in Nationstates, that hasn&#39;t and will never be raided. 
Although we are communist, we are tolerant of all ideologies (except alt-rights). This region is owned by [nation]Indoinastan[/nation].
