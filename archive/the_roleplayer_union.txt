[b]The Roleplayer Union is now to be used as an essential free region for those who wish it, whether it be another [region]Nugut[/region] or an entirely new region in of itself.

No flaming or bashing on the RMB, if you have an issue with someone, TG a government member such as myself.
Respect fellow members.


Further government will be established once the region grows.[/b]
