WA Administrative Power is under temporary closure due to the irresponsible use of power of the Black Riders. The League of Nations constitution bans any unauthorised invasion or coup within the League of Nations, and this temporary closure of administrative power has been authorised by the Supreme Courts of a majority of 5 nations. Actions include the temporary closure of WA administrative power, the change of the regional flag and the closure of the embassy with the Black Riders.
