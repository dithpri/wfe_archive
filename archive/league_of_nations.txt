The League of Nations is based around a republic-like system. There are three high council members, The Founder(Platma, also only permanent member), a democratically elected nation, and another democratically elected nation. All decisions will be made through polls, but the high council can override any Poll&#39;d decision. There will be two more voted in nations, which will be known as the Populares, that when the high council overrides an action, they can hold a poll for the people to override the high council&#39;s decision.
