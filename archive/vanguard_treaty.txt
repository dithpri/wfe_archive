The [b][color=red]Vanguard Treaty[/color][/b] is a mutual cooperation alliance of neutral socialist regions where said regions help and support each other, while they don&#39;t meddle with other&#39;s affairs. The Treaty works in a &quot;multiple regions, one community&quot; platform, in which all regions are expected to cooperate with each other in terms of culture, government and military, defining the Vanguard Treaty as a coalition of regions that shall remain united.
