[b]Welcome to The Brickish Imperial Federation![/b]

We are a region based off an alternate history to that of the real world, in which the proposed Imperial Federation of the British Empire actually came into being.

Our region has a map, roleplay and regional government. All nations of any and all ideologies are welcome to the B.I.F.
