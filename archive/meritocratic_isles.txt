An ancient archipelago founded on the principles of meritocratic governance. 

Originally created in 2002 by Lord Tom of [nation]Thomasia[/nation], the region was one of the first in the world. Meritocratic Isles was abandoned in early 2003 after the U.N. Delegateship was usurped. The survivors, led by King Justin of [nation]Eureka[/nation], fled to [region]New Meritocracy[/region]. Several months later, New Meritocracy was taken in a  coup d&amp;#39;&eacute;tat. A group of loyalists followed Field Marshal Isoeph of [nation]Winnipeg[/nation] to [region]The New Meritocracy[/region], where they are still located.

Today the Meritocratic Isles is home to a small museum whose most notable feature is a large, grimy collection jar.
