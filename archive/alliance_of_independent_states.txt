The Alliance of Independent States, or A.I.S. was formed to serve the interests of the member nations. Allowing for the political and social independence of all members. All political, social and economic persuasions are welcome. However please keep in mind the members of this region are somewhat isolationist and we as an Alliance value that also. 
The Alliance manifesto can be located at www.dancarlin.com 
Regional Motto: &amp;quot;Evado Meus Gramen&amp;quot;
