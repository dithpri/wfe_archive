The Alliance of Independent States stands against the disorganized community. We will not be working solely to enrich our member states, but to advance the quality of life in the states that make up each sector &#151; keeping the transportation safe, maintaining open and accessible communications, assuring that tax revenues are properly levied and allocated to improving the infrastructure.
