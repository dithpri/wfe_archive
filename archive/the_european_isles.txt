[b]THE EUROPEAN ISLES[/b]
[i]Freedom, rights, and honor.[/i]

The European Isles- a region exclusive to European-oriented nations and groups. As of now, the region is small, but constantly recruiting. 

[b]OUR GOAL[/b]

The European Isles&amp;#39; goal is simple- running a realistic and professional nation, and enjoying the game as it was intended. 

[b]OUR ADMINISTRATION[/b]

The Isles is represented by the Monarch, the Head of State. The ability to make and pass legislation lies in our Parliament. The Parliament is composed of a select amount of counsellors, with one counsellor per three nations in the Isles. Counsellors are appointed by the Monarch, and tie-breaking votes in the Parliament are given by the Monarch.
