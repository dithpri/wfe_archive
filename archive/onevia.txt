[b][color=e79d9d]Welcome to Onevia.[/b]
[i]&quot;It&#39;s just a USDM 240 coupe.&quot;[/color][/i]

[color=2998b8]Onevia is a small region all with the same goal in mind: [b]Output. Automobile manufacturing. Wealth.[/b]
Given that, it is still a region full of many political ideologies. We have nations of many political backgrounds and we all co-exist through our interest in vehicles.[/color]

[hr]
[color=2998b8]You will find many interesting things about this region. For instance, our founder isn&#39;t even located on the same planet - literally - it&#39;s on the Moon. Our Diplomacy Officer likes to be diplomatic with nuclear weapons, and for some odd reason we have a state-issued Department of Transportation [b][i]for the whole region.[/i][/b][/color]
