Welcome to Belgium! Prospering and very old region. Still making love, not war. We are supportive of a multilingual, multicultural society. We want to treat every country with dignity and thereby have no bearing on aggressive and militaristic states. Beer, fries, and chocolate, our main export products, play a significant role in our region.

All WA nations must endorse [nation]West-Flanders[/nation] and [nation]Riemstagrad[/nation]!

[b]Important: our new Sleeper Puppet Registry:[/b]
If you place a puppet in our region (wich we encourage!), please send the name of your puppet per telegram from your main nation to [nation=short]riemstagrad[/nation]. Unknown puppets risk ejection sooner or later.
