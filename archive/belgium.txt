Welcome to Belgium! Prospering and 184 years old region. Still making love, not war. We are supportive of a multilingual, multicultural society. We want to treat every country with dignity and thereby have no bearing on aggressive and militaristic states. Beer, fries, and chocolate, our main export products, play a significant role in our region.
