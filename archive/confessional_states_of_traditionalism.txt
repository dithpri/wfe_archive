The Confessional States of Traditionalism espouse traditional Catholicism as their state religion.  They remain loyal to the Holy See in Rome wherever it does not contradict with previous Magisterial or papal teaching of higher authority.

The States are serene, filled with quiet and devout subjects who have come to find safety from the increasing liberalism and godlessness of the global society around them.  The governments and people await the day that Rome abrogates the Novus Ordo Missal and the Second Vatican Council.

The States are consecrated to both the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary.  Their patron is St. Michael.
