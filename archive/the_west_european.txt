The West European is a region consisting of the WU Alliance, an alliance brought together by Zormington, Marshalland, Irishitopia, Zormington and Lostina. Never again shall any country in this region declare war on one another (Quingston-Zormington War 2013). We follow a policy, entitled Live United. This was approved by the council of The West European sometime in 2014 or 2013. The Live United Policy is posted in Quingston&amp;#39;s dispatches.
