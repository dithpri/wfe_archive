The United Nations of all Ethnic Chadarians.

MENTALITY
The Chadarian mind was formed by a history of early labor division in small, egalitarian groups of settlers, nomads and belligerent sackers in vast, diversified landscapes. They never were willing to submit to a central authority for too long.

POLITICS
Chadarians tend to be egalitarian, Minarchist Libertarians or even anti-etatist nowadays, though there are some modern, liberal Nations forming in the West and South at the moment.

LANGUAGE
The Chadarian Language is an ergative-absolutive language with an intricate declension system. Yet the verbal system has many analytic aspects.
