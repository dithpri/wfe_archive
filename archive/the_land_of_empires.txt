[b]It&#39;s 1936[/b] and the Great War is long over. After a Central Powers victory, the world is thrown into a much different state; new states rise and fall while the old powers are put to the test. Will you be a brand new nation on the world stage, trying to survive? Or will you be an old power, trying to stay afloat? I can&#39;t answer that; that would be your place to decide...

This is an RP region inspired by the Kaiserreich mod pack for Hearts of Iron 4. You can either proclaim a new nation or take on the role of a nation that would already exist like Japan, Britain, or the United States.
