The land of Sacred Grove lay dormant for many years under the Great Sunset, which kept it in the thrall of a stasis spell. But at long last, its evil magic is beginning to unravel and the sun has risen again. The newly-awakened Realmers have awoke, and they are coming together in Sanctuary. They rally together as the Realmers and the Sunset Warriors, seeking to overthrow the Sunset&#39;s forces for good and restore Sacred Grove to its former glory.
