[color=blue]Welcome to [region]The United Writers Guild[/region], founded by [nation]Meretica[/nation] on 13 May 2021![/color]

Until the region&#39;s population has reached sustainable levels, the Founder shall hold executive power. Nations are encouraged to join the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=un]World Assembly[/url] and endorse any fellow nation of their choice. A constitutional convention shall be held after the population of the region has reached 15 nations.

This region is primarily for use by writers, roleplayers, and anyone else that puts pen to paper (figuratively or literally). All others are welcome nonetheless.
