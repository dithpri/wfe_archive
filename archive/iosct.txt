IOSCT-the international organisation of Seperatist and contested Territories- is an international association of  nations all sharing one aspect in common: all IOSCT member states are former territories of real life countries, or who&#39;s independence  claims  are contested by neighbouring powers. 
The goal of the IOSCT is to provide as a region for like minded individuals who 
-seek to play the role of a newly independent real life territory  
-wish to take part in a simulation/fantasy yet realistic style region
-prefer a smaller and easily manageable region
If you are interested in joining IOSCT, please send a telegram to the Banks Island Territory.
