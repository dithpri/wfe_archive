Welcome to Astrology Nexus, an astrology and space-themed region where every nation represents its own solar system! 

Each nation aligns with one of four factions&#151;Fire, Earth, Air, or Water&#151;based on the leader&#146;s zodiac sign, shaping their journey through the galaxy. Roleplaying takes place on the Region Message Board and Discord https://discord.gg/wnvqdqWnmH, where you can explore astrological events, interplanetary alliances, or grand cosmic conflicts. Elections every four months will decide key leadership positions, including Ministers of Internal Affairs, External Affairs, Justice, and Culture&#151;offices open to any nation looking to leave their mark.
