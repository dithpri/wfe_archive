[b] Welcome to Irusu [/b]

This is a heavily RP focused region, run by a group of players from Particracy. We will focus on in depth stories and back-stories, and adapt to global situations. However our main narrative will be as follows: 

We intend to start from the year 1900 and work forward from there with each week = 1 in game year. We will simulate real life events from that century including WW1 and react to them. 
We were originally a group of islands however were colonised in the late 1800&#39;s by German, French and Spanish colonisers.
