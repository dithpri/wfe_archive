The region was founded on February 2, 2013.

Nordstaterna, founded on February 2, 2013, is a roleplay community where My Little Pony canon and realistic modern tech can come together as one. With that said, a nation is not required to &amp;quot;be from&amp;quot; MLP or practice MLP canon itself. Human, pony, and mixed population states are equally welcome in Nordstaterna.
