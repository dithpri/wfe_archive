The region was founded on February 2, 2013, by Mosby&amp;#39;s Rangers, of the M&amp;amp;B:W North &amp;amp; South mod.

Nordstaterna is a small community where My Little Pony canon and modern tech roleplay come together. With that said, a nation is not required to &amp;quot;be from&amp;quot; MLP or practice MLP canon itself. Human, pony, and mixed population states are equally welcome in Nordstaterna.
