The New World which Ulysses wanted, but could never have, now is here to bring mete and dole laws unto a savage race. We stand together, not to feed the hunger of greed, but to starve and kill it, for as stated in the poem:  
[b]&amp;quot;[u]I mete and dole
Unequal laws unto a savage race[/u],
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.&amp;quot;[/b]
