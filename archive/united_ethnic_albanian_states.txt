Hello, and welcome to the United Ethnic Albanian States, a region which is under the direct control of the BHSVPA. We are a kind and peaceful region but when it comes to haters, we are not so friendly. So, I will leave you with this quote for the haters and traitors : &quot;don&#39;t mistake my kindness as a weakness. I am kind to everyone but when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you&#39;re going to remember about me.&quot; - Al Capone
