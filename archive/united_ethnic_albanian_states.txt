Tungjatjeta my fellow Shqiptare&#39;s, this region is considered as the United Ethnic Albanian States (U.E.A.S). This region is run by American-Albanians who believe in one Giant Albanian state know as Ethnic Albania (Includes current borders of modern Albania and Kosovo, and parts of Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia, and Greece). We are a kind and peaceful region but when it comes to haters, we are not so friendly. So, I will leave you with this quote for the haters and traitors : &quot;don&#39;t mistake my kindness as a weakness. I am kind to everyone but when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you&#39;re going to remember about me.&quot; - Al Capone
