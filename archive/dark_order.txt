  [color=Grey]The &ETH;ark &Oslash;rder[/color] is a group splintered away from [region]The Grand Sea Assembly[/region].  This group, shadowed with hidden communications within [region]The Grand Sea Assembly[/region], was able to make a &amp;quot;mass-exodus&amp;quot; from their old region.  However, after attempting to form their own region, the [color=Green]World Assembly[/color] refused to accept their formal name, &amp;quot;[I][color=grey]The &ETH;ark &Oslash;rder[/color][/I].&amp;quot;  Understanding that they would need all of the help they could get from the other nations and regions of the world, [color=Grey]The &ETH;ark &Oslash;rder[/color] decided to follow the laws set, and rename themselves &amp;quot;[I][region]Dark Order[/region][/I].&amp;quot;  Now, with their own form of government and politics, the [region]Dark Order[/region] has chosen to allow all members into their society to help in the never-ending war against [region]The Grand Sea Assembly[/region].
