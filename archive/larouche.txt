A home to supporters of perennial presidential candidate and controversial political analyst LYNDON LAROUCHE.  Born in 1922 in New Hampshire, Lyndon was educated at Northeastern University, where he frequently clashed with his mentally lethargic professors.  He quickly became a hot topic for his accusations against The British Empire, Barack Obama, and George Bush; and for his beliefs regarding global warming, drug trafficking, and AIDS.  Lyndon, a World War II veteran who witnessed firsthand the abuses of the Brits, is still going strong and sharp as ever after almost 92 years on this toilet Earth.
