[i]&#147;Who for Selven&#39;s King and Law
Freedom&#39;s guns will strongly draw,
Bunickers, we stand or fall,
Let them follow me!&#148;

By Feminism&#146;s woes and pains,
By Communism&#146;s servile chains,
We will drain our holy veins
So we shall be free.

&#39;Lay the dominatrix low,
Leftists fall in every foe,
Liberties in every blow,
Let us do or die!&#39;[/i]
