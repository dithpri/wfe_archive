The [b][color=red]Marxist Union Treaty Organization (MUTO)[/color][/b] is a brotherhood of left-leaning nations that adhere to one of the many socialist or communist ideologies in existence and share a desire to establish diplomatic ties and friendly contact with like-minded countries and the individuals within them. Debate, discuss, form alliances, roleplay...maybe even learn a thing or two. Within [b]MUTO[/b], the possibilities are what [b][i]you[/i][/b] make them.
