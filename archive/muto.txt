The [b][color=red]Marxist Union Treaty Organization[/color][/b] is a collective of nations that adhere to socialist, communist, and other left-leaning ideologies and desire to be amongst individuals who share their political ideals. MUTO is a place where close friendships and alliances may be formed as members discuss, debate, and form diplomatic relationships with one another. This region is essentially what you make of it; there are infinite possibilities as to what we can accomplish when we come together as one. Long live our fellow revolutionaries across the globe!

MUTO was originally founded by [b]Provinci[/b] of [b][color=orange]Red Alliance[/color][/b] and [b]Tarik Re&amp;#351;it[/b], Premier of the [color=orange][b] Federal Socialist Republics of Kuross Tarky[/b][/color].
