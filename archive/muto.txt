The [b][color=red]Marxist Union Treaty Organization[/color][/b] is a collective of regions that share socialist, communist, or generally left-leaning ideologies and wish to be amongst one another in order to form diplomatic relationships with like-minded nations. Discuss, debate, roleplay...this group is what you make of it, so the possibilities are in fact endless. Whether you want to form a political party and recruit members or run for office and gain a position in MUTO&#39;s government, it&#39;s all up to you.

MUTO was originally founded by [b]Provinci[/b] of [b][color=orange]Red Alliance[/color][/b] and [b]Tarik Re&amp;#351;it[/b], Premier of the [color=orange][b] Federal Socialist Republic of Kuross Tarky[/b][/color]. A copy of the original Official Constitution of MUTO has been preserved and can be found in the dispatches below.
