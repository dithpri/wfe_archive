Deep within the northern latitudes of the Trinity Sea lay a group of islands known as the Moonlit Archipelago. A wealth of history surrounds this mist shrouded region: the earliest recorded human settlement in the Trinity Sea; one of the first regions of Antiquity; once the center of the vast Norse empire; crossroads of trade in the western world; founder of the Alliance Defense Network (and Oceanic Security Accord member). Now the citizens of the Moonlit Archipelago enjoy the quiet, peaceful bliss of a region who voted unanimously on neutrality. Welcome.
