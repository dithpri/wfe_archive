Motto: &#147;United We Stand, Divided We Fall.&#148;

NonBloc is a healthy region for collective growth and shared learning.

NonBloc upholds freedom, active participation, and integrity as its core values.

Nations are free and independent to express their ideology, worldview, and political choices.
Differences are respected and welcomed.

NonBloc provides a safe and open space for dialogue, debate, and the free exchange of perspectives.
It does not seek to justify a single truth.

Instead, it values diversity of thought through respectful, constructive, and meaningful communication.
There is no coercion &#151; only open discussion grounded in integrity.
