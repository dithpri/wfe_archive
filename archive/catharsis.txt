NationStates was one of my first video games, and my first online experience.

I lost my region recently. (You can find the remains at [region]Incorporated Lands of Gran Municipium[/region], though there&#39;s not much point)
A strange sense of catharsis came with that, momentarily distracting me from my frustrations.
