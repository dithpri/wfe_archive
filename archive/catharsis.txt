I grew up in the world of NationStates as a kid. It was one of my first video games, and my first online experience.

I&#39;m still growing up.
I lost my region recently. (You can find the remains at [region]Incorporated Lands of Gran Municipium[/region], though there&#39;s not much point)
A strange sense of catharsis came with that, momentarily distracting me from my frustrations.
