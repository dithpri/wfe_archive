The Legion of Cockroaches was created in the year 1337, on November 8 at 8:30 directly, when the Black Death had started. The people rebelled and created a few nations in a weirdly named region,, called Noob. They created a special government and became isolated from the other people, thus, prospering. It bans all other nation that doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;meet the requirements&amp;quot;. It still lives today, and will have a final place in the world.
Today, the region has many people eating cockroaches, and they just absolutely LOVE the juicy bug and its crunchy exterior! WHY DON&amp;#39;T YOU TRY ONE???
