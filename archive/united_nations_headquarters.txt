The headquarters holds the seats of the principal organs of the UN, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, but excluding the International Court of Justice, which is seated in The Hague. The United Nations has three additional subsidiary regional headquarters, or headquarters districts. These were opened in Geneva (Switzerland) in 1946, Vienna (Austria) in 1980, and Nairobi (Kenya) in 1996.
                      None of the United Nations&#39; 15 specialized agencies (such as UNESCO) are located at the headquarters. However, some &quot;autonomous subsidiary organs&quot;, such as UNICEF, have their headquarters at the UNHQ.
