[color=#9016b3]Hello yes, this is indeed the new Puppet Storage region of whom was once formally [b]The Hyrulean Princessdom[/b] and [b]Tsarstvo Alyaski[/b] and is now [b]The Pinelands[/b] and... Well, [b]Moros&eacute;raiqus[/b]. This obviously means that either &quot;&quot;&quot;you&#39;re&quot;&quot;&quot; here because &quot;&quot;&quot;you&#39;re&quot;&quot;&quot; me, or because you&#39;re just that cool and I&#39;ve let you

Otherwise, this region means nothing to you and thus you can cease your staring... Right now! At this very moment! Whenever you&#39;re ready...[/color]
