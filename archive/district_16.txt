District 16 is comprised of nations which don&amp;#39;t mind taking charge and living by their own standards. Arms Manufacturing, Trout Farming, Furniture Restoration, Black Market Organ Harvesting...we do it all here in District 16. If you want to mine Uranium until your underpaid miners collapse from exhaustion, go ahead! If you want your citizens to have the freedom to eat Cheetos naked in a bean-bag chair, we say let them! Miffed at those pesky Bigtopians who sent an assassin to kill you? Bomb then six ways from Sunday! We support all paths, from anarchy to tyranny. So get out there and stir something up, and if you decide to join District 16, don&amp;#39;t forget to send tribute in the forum of booze and farmer&amp;#39;s daughters.
