Welcome! The United Lands of Turin is a RPG region focused on realism and roleplay. If that isn&#39;t for you we would suggest to move to a chill region like the Greater Hanguardian Islands! 

If you&#39;re staying, great. We want to foster a environment where roleplay is taken seriously, which means long-winded messages are fine and wanted. 

This region can be real fun, as long as all the nations contribute and be active on the platform. A good way to help your region is by endorsing the WA Delegate, [nation]Kilorion[/nation]!

We thank every nation in advance for helping foster a fun roleplay environment in the United Lands of Turin. Happy Playing!
