[b]Here in The Hole To Hide In we have a great RPing community that is active and constantly growing. However, our former region, [region]A Hole To Hide In[/region], was really a gigantic black hole, and it&#39;s really not happy over it&#39;s abandonment. As a result, it has begun expanding and soon our entire RP will be engulfed and all will be destroyed. Talk about taking hiding in a hole to a extreme new level, eh? Join us in our imminent destruction! (And our Role Play :3)[/b]
