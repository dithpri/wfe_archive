The Council of Independent Nations (CoIN) was founded to provide a comfortable community between for a group of young nations to reside within peacefully. We respect each other and may aid each other but it is simply an alliance so that we feel safe to work independently and grow as nations without threat of war amongst us. In short, it&amp;#39;s a gently group environment where you can freely work independently without judgement or repercussions from neighbours.

Please enjoy our little slice of friendship.
