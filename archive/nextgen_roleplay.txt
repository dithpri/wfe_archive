Welcome, the reason we are called NextGen is because this region is targeted towards relatively new role-players like me. We will form the next generation of RP in Nationstates. We welcome all role-players into this region, and hope to get at least one or two experienced RP&#146;ers. If we newbies band together, we&#146;ll revolutionize RP. If this region gets enough people, the we&#146;ll do frequent role-plays in II and P2TM.
