The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times, and throughout its history, the Middle East has been a major center of world affairs.

The Middle East is also the historical origin of major religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

The five top languages, in terms of numbers of speakers, are Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Berber, and Kurdish.

After the old Middle East was taken over by The Black Riders or Raiders (I&amp;#39;m not sure) I made this region. If the delegate elected in this region abuses his/her power they will be ejected. If they continue to display bad behavior they will face a ban and eject. No raiding.
