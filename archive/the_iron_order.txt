The Iron Order is now a property of the [b]Electric Dictator Bedebao[/b] of [b][nation]Bedetopia[/nation][/b].

Hispanyo&#39;s trusted friend Sonoto was merely a disguise to whom he entrusted TIO, who would then backstab him when he needed the region back the most.

This region was like swiss cheese anyway. Anyone could get past the laughable entry questions. Our good friend [b][nation]Malphe[/nation][/b] was able to send his mice to help with the takeover.
