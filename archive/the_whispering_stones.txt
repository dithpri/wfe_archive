[b][i]Welcome to [region]The Whispering Stones[/region], heroes![/i][/b]

This mystical stone circle is a sacred place to the Wolf Clan as they believe the spirits of their ancestors can whisper to them from the monolithic pillars. River has come here to commune with them and hear their wisdom but she&#39;s having some trouble.

Whichever Clan&#39;s heroes score the most points will energize the Stones with their power, letting River hear her ancestors. The region will be theirs and the spirits will cleanse them of any Rot they have!
