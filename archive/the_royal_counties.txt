[b]Great Britain is home to three distinct regions.[/b]

The most powerful remains [b][nation]the Royal Counties[/nation][/b] - who are governed both by the hereditary monarchy of Windsor Castle (currently held by Queen Elizabeth Middleton) and the elected Windsor Guildhall in the capital city of Windsor.

However, the most populous is the fascist corporate state of [b][nation]the Northern Counties[/nation][/b]. Capital punishment, anti-privacy laws, and corporatism are all common in these parts of Great Britain.

The newest addition to Great Britain is indeed [b][nation]the Ulster Counties[/nation][/b]. With their distinct national identity and culture, the people of Ulster remain fiercely progressive and independent. However, even still today, Queen Elizabeth Middleton is known to own numerous properties across Ulster.
