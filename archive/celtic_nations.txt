[b]It was a chilly, windy day, and so I spent most of my time inside, cleaning and tidying up the residence. The Grand Admiral insisted I wore a certain &quot;sailor&#39;s outfit&quot;. I&#39;m not sure how a sailor&#39;s outfit could look so much like a maid costume, but he assured me it was normal and fully in line with the ERN&#39;s &quot;moral support&quot; protocol. [2/9]
