The Harambe Isles are a chain of islands in the North Atlantic. Discovered by Vikings in the early 11th century, the islands were eventually settled in the 14th century by Europeans fleeing the Black Death. However, wars soon broke out between the settlers over control of the different islands that made up the region. These wars continued for several decades until the settlers grouped together to form several different nations. This brought a period of peace to the region that lasted until the British invaded and conquered the region in the 17th century. The region remained under British control, except for a brief period of Finnish occupation during the second world war, until it gained independence in 1969.
