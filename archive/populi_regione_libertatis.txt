We are a region who prizes personal freedom above all else.
While our doctrine may seem outlandish to some we are open to all schools of thought.
There is an opening for everyone in The People&amp;#39;s Region Of Liberty.
We hold no requirements size, or doctrine based.
Feel free to enter our growing discussion.
