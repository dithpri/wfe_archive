The breeze blows from the salty sea where the harbours come alive, the shipping lanes are not deescalating in their prowess of transport. beautiful greens greys and occasionally whites dot the lime stone cliffs and crags of which the waters pound, at times a dense patchwork forest covers the land and clearings and parries jousting themselves out where ever they can. this is the rich place known as The Azure Sea.
