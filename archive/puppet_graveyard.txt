[b][region]The East Pacific[/region] welcomes a new addition to our large family, our lovely kitten [nation]CatBot[/nation]! They&#39;re quite good at sniffing out catnip stashes in regions to visit! 

[color=green]This region has been visited by the Eastern Pacific Sovereign Army! We at [region]The East Pacific[/region] always believe in leaving someplace you visit in a better shape than when you found it, so take it upon ourselves to beautify the neglected, dilapidated regions left behind.[/color][/b]
