We are an aspiring region hoping to bring to bring more importance to the military side of Nations States, without ignoring the other aspects. 

So join, and help us build an advanced roleplay system complete with a map and inter-region war. Political positions could also be subject to some aspects of roleplay. 

Currently in need of people to help run/organize roleplay. We&#39;d like to have a map on which players can battle for territory and maybe resources?.
