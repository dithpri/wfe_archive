[hr][b][ &amp;#9398; ] The Egoist Commonality of Anarchitaria is a self-proclaimed anarchist district formed on the 17th of September, Year 12017 HE. Anarchitaria, a territory roughly the size of an apartment bedroom, saw political reforms on the 26th of October, Year 12017 HE, pursuant to an ongoing campaign in establishing a society proportionate to the philosophy of individualist anarchism. 

Anarchitarians strive to live, to be able to appreciate life individually in all its manifestations. An Anarchitarian is never accountable to anyone but himself for his acts and gestures.
