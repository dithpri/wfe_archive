[hr][b]| &amp;#9398; | The Stirnerist Society of Anarchitaria is a fledging association of individuals that was proclaimed on the 17th of September, Year 2017 CE, under loose circumstances. The association was reformed on the 26th of October in the same year pursuant to a campaign of unremitting endeavors in establishing a society proportionate to the philosophy of individualist anarchism. 

Anarchitarians strive to live, to be able to appreciate life individually in all its manifestations. An Anarchitarian is never accountable to anyone but himself for his acts and gestures.[/b]
