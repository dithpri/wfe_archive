[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] decided to investigate some big, [color=green]green[/color] and round that was sighted in your region. 

It was mainly made out of water, but felt hard. It could be picked up and thrown. If it hit, it was a destructive force. 

We saw that ants loved it, children hated it and salads have it.

The answer was obvious. It was a cabbage! 
We took the cabbage found in your region back to our headquarters for further analysis. 

If you would like your cabbages back, [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
