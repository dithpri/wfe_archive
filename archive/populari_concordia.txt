[b][i] - &#147;Imperium populi, a populo, ad populum&#148; -[/b][/i]

Populari Concordia (Popular Agreement) is a nation dedicated to the preservation and revitalization of western culture. As years go by, we see the west become more and more inferior to their counterparts as far-right and far-left groups corrupt and destroy the culture that defines our people. These threats to our culture, traditions, and values shall not be allowed to bring Hesperia to her knees and we will aid in the return to glory and as an equal to our eastern counteparts. [i]Exire[/i], legionnaires of the west and return our people to the glory of old.
