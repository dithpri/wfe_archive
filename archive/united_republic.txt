We are a region that supports the individual liberties and freedoms of independent nations. We serve as a protector and an alliance in the time of turmoil. Our idea of government is not to control, but to protect and defend when the time comes. If you join this region, you will have the full protection of every other nation within the alliance, be it economically or militarily. We welcome nations of all government types. We do not discriminate. We are protectors of our liberties.
