The United Republic is a country that invites nations to help needs of citizens in trades and more. We do not want to make our citizens to wealthy to pay out bills. Our tax is a little higher so no one can buy our government. We describe our citizens of mid-class. Most, importantly we have army, navy, and air forces to fill. Join our region as one!
