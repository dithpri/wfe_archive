Noblesse oblige defined in three ways...

1) to imply that with wealth, power and prestige come responsibilities; sometimes broadly applied to suggest a general obligation for the more fortunate to help the less fortunate.

2) a moral economy wherein privilege must be balanced by duty towards those who lack such privilege or who cannot perform such duty. 

3) public responsibilities of the rich, famous and powerful, notably to provide good examples of behavior or to exceed minimal standards of decency.
