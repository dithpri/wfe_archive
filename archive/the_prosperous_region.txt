[region]The Prosperous Region[/region] is a region that has separated from the [region]Table of the Lords[/region] due to the tyrannical leader of [nation]Dowjistan[/nation], which refused to give its subjects delegation. As a result, The Prosperous Region was formed. The Prosperous Region used to be a region based around the religion of reformed yonglism, but after a recent poll dominated the region, we have decided to allow all religions into our region, however, Yongle remains extremely prevalent.
