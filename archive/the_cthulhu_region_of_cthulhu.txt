A Governmental figurehead exists, that protects, and helps manage the local governmental powers, mostly un-oppressive, any, and all are accepted by the Government, given a fair chance of protection, and a chance at a democratic vote to improve, or make choices internationally.

Existing W.A members are encouraged to endorse [nation=full]New Draconia[/nation] and [nation=full]Igaliaris[/nation], while generalized members are encouraged to partake, and give their honest opinion on International votes to improve, and spread their own Ideological plan into the Region, and perhaps make it Region-wide.
