The region of The World of Peace and Prosperity was founded by Burntwood Lions Club on the 15th May 2016. The region of The World of Peace and Prosperity is currently hosting a single nation which is Burntwood Lions Club however this region also has a great deal of connections with other regions in the form of embassies as The World of Peace and Prosperity as of 25th May has 21 embassies with other regions which I think is a great thing. 

The World of Peace and Prosperity are very new but very proud members of ORCA.
