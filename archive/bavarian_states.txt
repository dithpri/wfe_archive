The Bavarian States is a region created by Chessapeake. Despite this being the region of Bavaria, English is the language of choice, but German is welcome or Herzlich Willkommen!

In this region, we are always online and are of assistance to anyone who joins. We mostly focus on the Economy of our nations and push for pro-economy ideals.
