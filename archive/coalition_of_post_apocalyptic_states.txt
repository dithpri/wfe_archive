The Coalition of Post Apocalyptic States is a loose Cabinet of Representatives from around the world after a series of world catastrophes put the human race to the brink of extinction. Massive hurricanes and monsoons in Asia, bloody civil war in the former United States, South America racked with earthquakes and drought, Europe falling into disorder and unrest as the rest of the world fell, forcing most governments to fall to their knees or reform to the will of its denizens.
