You find your nation in a stunning and versatile galaxy known as Echidna. Stars spiral around the center, a huge black hole consuming all that floats by in the center. Many nations have not chosen to start here because of it&#39;s advanced and developed ecosystem being too complex and hard to adapt to, but these brave nations have journeyed to afar to find a planet, or moon, just right for them and their people. There are no rules to what kind of nation you have to run; just be invested in the lore of your planet and diplomatic, possibly even military, relations with other nations in the Galaxy of Echidna.
