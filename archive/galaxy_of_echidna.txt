Welcome to the Galaxy of Echidna! We do hope you enjoy your stay here, however brief or long it may be! We are accepting of all types of nations, from Dictatorships to Democracies, and from Liberal to Conservative, we appreciate you even acknowledging we exist. Our planet assignments can be found above, and if you need to hear about the planets just send me a quick telegram! I&#39;ll update if our best astronomers find any new ones to inhabit, via region-wide telegram, and you are allowed to take up as many planet portions as you feel is necessary to fufill your nation&#39;s desires. Have fun!
