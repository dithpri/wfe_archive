The Khaganate welcomes all!

The Khaganate of Turan is a hypothetical federation of Hungarian, Turkic, Mongolic and Yeniseian peoples, under a sacred diarchy, with Tengrism as state religion.

The Khaganate does not promote any pseudoscientific theories about the origin of Hungarians, but acknowledges the spiritual and cultural bond that tied them to Turks until the adoption of Christianity.
