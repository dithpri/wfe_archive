Welcome to the Dystopian Hellsca- I mean wonderful paradise that is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Always remember, no one needs civil rights as long as business is booming! I will forgive you for thinking we are committing the foul act of recycling the plastic, but let me assure you, every microplastic we harvest is a gallon of toxic waste put back in!
