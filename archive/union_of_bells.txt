We are a Coalition of Peace. Est. 2016                      


We have recently shown our power by raiding the hostile region, &quot;Union of SouthBell&quot;


We only raid on last resort if our embassies can&#39;t come to an agreement. We only raid by majority vote through a poll.


DO NOT confuse us with the raider group DEN! We are nothing alike!


If you have any questions about joining the Coalition, Just ask the founder, Westbell, or our head delegate, Locationstein.
