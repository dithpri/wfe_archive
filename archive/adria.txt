[color=#008B8B]Welcome to [b]Adria[/b][/color], a once forgotten continent and home to nations that rise and fall like the tide. Its dark forests are home to a multitude of myths, legends, and folklore while its shores have seen conquerors and explorers come and go. [color=#008B8B]Adria[/color] is almost a world unto itself and home to a mosaic of people and cultures, from civilized metropolises to sparse wastes, kings to communists, and democracies to dictatorships. Where does your nation stand?
