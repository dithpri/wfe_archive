[b]Welcome to Oros[/b]

Oros is a land during the Mesolithic time period of the Stone Age. It was an ancient glacier located in the Carpathian Mountains likely in one of the present day countries of Ukraine, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary, or Serbia. The glacier melted at the end of the last ice age, which then became a very fertile valley. This valley is the home of multiple tribes.
