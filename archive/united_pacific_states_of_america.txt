This communist region has been occupied and annexed by Great [region]Altmora[/region]. The socialist states of California, Oregon, and Washington believed that their squabbling congeries of diverse ethnic tribes could form the basis of a new nation. The mighty Chad Legions corrected their error. Diversity is no match for one people united in strength and purpose under one leader. The UPSA&#39;s leadership has been thrown from our helicopters, Antifa flags hang in the Legate&#39;s office as trophies, and Black Bloc terrorists have been shipped off to the uranium mines where they can work off their disgusting layers of blubber.

Hail Keldros!
