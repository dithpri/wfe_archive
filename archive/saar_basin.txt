The Territory of the Saar Basin was a region of [region=Germany] occupied and governed by the United Kingdom and [region=France] from 1920 to 1935 under a [region=League of Nations] mandate. It had its own flag (adopted on July 28, 1920): a blue, white, and black horizontal tricolour. The blue and white stood for [region=Bavaria], and white and black for [region=Prussia], out of whose lands the [region=Saar Territory] was formed. Initially, the occupation was under the auspices of the Treaty of Versailles. Its population in 1933 was 812,000, and its capital was [region=Saarbrucken]. The territory closely corresponds with the modern [region=German state of Saarland], but was slightly smaller in area. After a plebiscite was held in 1935, it was returned to [region=Germany].
