[b]The Proletariat Coalition[/b] is among NationStates&#39; oldest surviving leftist regions, originally founded by [nation]Haderan[/nation] in March 2003. We were once one of the largest and most active of those regions, with hundreds of members and vibrant off-site forums. In the course of time the vitality of the region, and our sister regions, has waned. Nonetheless, we remain in place and welcome the occasional return of old comrades.
