A small archipelago north of the South Indies, East of the West Indies, West of the East Indies, and directly below the Space Indies, these islands are a lush, dry, freezing cold tropical paradise.  This is always a welcoming place for new nations, a blank slate on which your state can expand, flourish, and thrive.  All are welcome, and umlauts are &euml;nc&ouml;&uuml;r&auml;g&euml;d!
