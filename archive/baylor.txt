Motto: Pro Ecclesia, Pro Texana (For Church, for Texas).

[region]Baylor[/region] was founded by the three founders ([nation]Ballwin[/nation], [nation]Microsuslandia[/nation], and [nation]Jaroadia[/nation]) in order to pursue the right to rule freely.

[nation]Ballwin[/nation], the oldest nation in the region, seceded from the [region]New Warsaw Pact[/region], after nearly one year of membership within the region in order to lead a region of diplomatic freedom of rule along with their two infant founders at the time of the birth of the region.

[region]Baylor[/region] is an open region, and accepts any newcomers and is willing to construct embassies with any region.

We would like to wish prosperity to all nations and regions on [i]NationStates[/i], and good luck!
