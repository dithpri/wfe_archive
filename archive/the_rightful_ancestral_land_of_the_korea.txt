Welcome! Representative of a nation that has arrived on the Korean Peninsula.
This region was created specifically for &#147;Koreans.&#148; However, non-Koreans are also welcome to join.

This region advocates for liberalism and operates without rules. However, once certain conditions are met (e.g., membership of 100 or more nations), rules may be implemented.
