[color=red]Welcome to Turtle Lives Matter. Turtle Lives Matter, kids. Never forget that.[/color]

[color=orange]Everyday, thousands of Turtles are oppressed. They need help.[/color]

[color=green]Turtles don&#39;t eat bees. Scientists are always talking about how we have to save the bees. Also, Turtles have never killed anyone. There was an Ancient Roman story that claimed a seagull dropped a Turtle on his head and he died, but first of all, it wasn&#39;t the Turtle&#39;s fault, and second of all, the guy told the story, so he didn&#39;t die.[/color]

[color=blue]Our plan to save the Turtles comes in 3 parts. We plan to:[/color]
[color=purple]1. Completely abolish the Turtle slave trading industry.[/color]
[color=blue]2. Fully integrate Turtles into our society.[/color]
[color=green]3. Put a Turtle in office as President[/color]
