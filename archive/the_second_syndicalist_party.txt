We Are The Second Syndicalist Party, We Are Second Times Stronger!


 Anarcho-syndicalism is a theory of anarchism that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and with that control influence in broader society. Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self-activity.
Tom Mann, a British syndicalist, declared that &quot;the object of the unions is to wage the Class War&quot;. This war, according to syndicalist doctrine, was aimed not just at gaining concessions such as higher wages or a shorter working day, but at the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism.
