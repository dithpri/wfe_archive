Ships in the making
Bound for a distant shore
World for the taking
Man gone forever more
Boarding and setting sail
Yet victory won&#39;t prevail

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make you mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground

(Taka st&ouml;kk til h&aelig;rri j&ouml;r&eth;)

Call in, surrender
Still I won&#39;t feel like defeat
Man laying down their swords
Each of their own accord

Freeze the arrow in the air
Make you mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
Raise the banner to the sky
Face the fear and hold your head up high
Take the leap like you were bound for higher ground
