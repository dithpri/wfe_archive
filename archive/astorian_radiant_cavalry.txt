Unitium Gloria; United in Glory

Held by Aster in loving memory of the ARC. The dancers may be gone; their stage, tatters. But the dream, the dance- it still lives on.

&quot;June 15th. Saturday.
...
Farewell, Astoria.&quot;

I don&#39;t want anyone to deface this memory. Shall it be forever known that while Astoria may be shattered, its lands desolate and bleak, the Hussars carried its name with pride, until the last.
