You can pretty much do whatever you want. Just follow these rules:
1:No wars with fellow region members
2:If necessary, be willing to lend a small portion, no more than 12%, of your military to help defend not just yourself, but your fellow countries.
3:Swear unwavering allegiance. Any misconduct receives immediate action. Most commonly a fire storm upon 25% of your crops and livestock.
4:Have fun.
