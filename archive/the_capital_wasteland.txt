The Enclave is back, America. And, no, not just on your radio. Right now the Enclave is patrolling the Capital Wasteland.

In the year 2077, a nuclear war has left the world barren. What was once a small scientific community gradually grew into [nation=short]New Rivet City[/nation]. The raiders [nation=short]Talon Mercenary Company[/nation], prey on any and all, stealing, murdering. The so called [nation=short]The East Coast Brotherhood of Steel[/nation]. Don&#146;t be fooled by their pseudo-knightly nonsense. And those [nation=short]The Outcasted Brotherhood of Steel[/nation], are just as dangerous. The cult [nation=short]The Descendants of Atom[/nation] who worship an atomic bomb, and the mischievous children of [nation=short]Lamplight Caverns[/nation].
