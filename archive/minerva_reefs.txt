[color=blue][b]The Minerva Reefs, briefly de-facto independent in 1972 as the Republic of Minerva, are a group of two submerged atolls located in the Pacific Ocean south of Fiji and Tonga. -Wikipedia

Unjustly annexed by the Tongan government, Minerva has now sunk into the sea. This region now serves as a memorial to the brave libertarians who sought out a libertarian paradise and instead were given a statist&amp;#39;s greeting.

Also a [region]Free World[/region] region.
