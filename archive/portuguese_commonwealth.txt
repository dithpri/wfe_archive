Portuguese Commonwealth - Comunidade de Pa&iacute;ses Portugueses

We are a small region, open to everybody who is portuguese or from a portuguese speaking country, or really anyone who likes Portugal. 
From the far-left to the far-right, we are open to everybody, as long as you behave and have good manners. We care for the next and defend each other, for together we are strong.

Viva Portugal!
