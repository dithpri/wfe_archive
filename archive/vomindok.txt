You people annoy me, I mean you just barge into Vomindok after probably days of planning, then wave your toilet paper flag and proceed to eat your own feces because you&#39;re all so proud of yourselves for &quot;C0nk0RIngf N4tI0N$Tate$ LUUUL333&quot; that you think your sh*t tastes like fine aged cheese knowing full well-FULL WELL-that I&#39;ll clear it out in an hour. What will it honestly take for you people to leave Vomindok alone? can I speak to the man in the throne? Or is he too busy writing code to ruin peoples fun?
