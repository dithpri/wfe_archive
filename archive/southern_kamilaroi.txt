A region for hermit kingdoms, hemoraging fiefdoms and tolerant secretarionists.

The Southern Kamilaroi Region is on the Eastern inland side of the Australian continent.
Its political freedom came when it secretly ignored all other powers and its peoples disappearing off the grid. A technological camoflague keeps the region safe from outside intervention, as well as psycic blue tongue lizards that send thoughts of disinterest into any coming close to the area&#39;s border.

The region has two official languages, english and gamilaraay.
