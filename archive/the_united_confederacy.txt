[b]Today, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] and [region]Okiumene[/region] decided to host a mini flying session in your region to let some young hawklings and other birbs learn how to fly! 

We did some twirls, loop de loops, and dodged some big, overgrown trees in your region! 
We did find some cute little berries, which we stole. 

In return, we left you some cookies and this WFE to try and entice you to [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]come join us![/url]
