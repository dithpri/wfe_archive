The AIF (Association of Independent Football) is an umbrella organisation for states, minorities, ethnic groups, stateless peoples and regions/nations unaffiliated with FIFA.

Some members are also members of other organisations like ConIFA or the WUFA, so to avoid schedule congestion tournaments happen the year after the respective ConIFA/WUFA tournaments.
