Hi. Im going to keep this brief. I am new to this game and want to make a powerful region. Many people may be asking you to join their region, so i am going to say why mine is better. I have a very small region which means you Have a large say in the way things are run. Also, i am looking to focus on a strong and sturdy economy with an extremely large and strong military to defend not only ourselves, but other nations. I thank you for reading and ask you to seriously consider joining the United Nations and States Command.
