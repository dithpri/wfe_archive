Verzlichte was a city-state situated on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean, known for its large, busy port. Historic tensions between the capitalist West Verzlichte and the poorer, socialist-leaning East Verzlichte culminated in the assassination of Mayor Joseph Endel in 2012 by the rebel United Army. Endel&amp;#39;s death sparked the Western Civil War, which ended in 2014 with a ceasefire. The conflict resulted in the secession of the United Army-controlled East Verzlichte, which is now known as the Incorporated States of Former Verzlichte (IFV). 
Tensions between the two states are still high, with the threat of war still looming over the heads of citizens.
