Once a land where the beastly, godly heartbeat like drums would thunder through the land. Where songs of creativity, innovation, liberty would be sung across the land in the name of the great godking Alexander Brudos who could tucc like no other.

Now a shadow of it&#39;s former self as the land has fragmented into feuding, warring nations many of whom are disillusioned by the way the current godking&#39;s vision is leading all who follow the way of the tucc while Greater Tuccistan itself still struggles to ascertain dominance over the region behind a regime riddled with paranoia, corruption, tyranny, oppression and hypocrisy.

Who will reunify and return harmony to the region of Tuccotia?
