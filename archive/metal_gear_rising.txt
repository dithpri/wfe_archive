[b]The Hawks took a break from intensively mining [color=#eec322][u]HawkCoin[/u][/color] to do advertise this new discovery to all the users of the internet. We put up posters, sent emails, and even engaged in the word of mouth to raise awareness for this currency, and the value skyrocketed! [color=#eec322][u]HawkCoin[/u][/color]&#39;s value will never go down. That&#39;s what makes it [color=#eec322][u]HawkCoin[/u][/color]. Always soaring.

Unfortunately, Jye stopped talking during the raid. We regret this and it is qekitor&#39;s fault. Fortunately, Jye is back to talking, so if you want to meet them join [region]The Black Hawks[/region], especially our crypto mining centers [url=https://www.forum.the-black-hawks.org/]the forum[/url] and [url=https://discord.gg/XWvERyc]Discord[/url]!
