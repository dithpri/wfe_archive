Society has crumbled after the Great Collapse, the people stirred in anger and rose up. Their leader has led a revolution and overthrew the democratic government as it failed to effieciently fix the crisis. The International Fascist Party told them to be proud of their nation, and that this nation will not effieciently work under the slow pass of legislation. They told them through national unity, they would rise up and prosper, destroy their opponents and create national self sufficiency. Fascists rise!
