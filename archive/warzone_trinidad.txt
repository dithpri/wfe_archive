Warzones are eternally cursed to be a sandbox. Anything you build here will be temporary. Though our turn comes to an end, I have no regrets about choosing to build our sandcastle here. I had bigger plans for this farewell, but things don&#39;t always work out.

The corporation lives on in [region]Palmetto[/region], we&#39;ll see you there. All assets formerly belonging to the Warzone Trinidad Corporation have been sold off to the newly formed Palmetto Associated Corporations. This is not our end but the beginning of a new adventure.

By all means try to take the region. We&#39;ll see how long you manage to keep it. You might even see us again if you become too successful ;)
