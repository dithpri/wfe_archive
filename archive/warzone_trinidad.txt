Well, [region]Troll Army[/region] felt like liberating this region from the other raiders (those being PPC, LWU, Sparkalia, and co). Thankfully, the defenders didn&#39;t get here on time, so we&#39;re here now and we&#39;ll do what we want here now :)

Oh, and don&#39;t worry about embassies and allat raiders, we&#39;ll compromise :)
