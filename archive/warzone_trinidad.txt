[b]THIS REGION HAS BEEN SIEZED BY THE THAEMPERIAL ARMY OF [region]THAECIA[/region][/b]

It has come to our attention that this region has taken the wrong side. Raiding is an evil that must be destroyed, for the most part. However, a treaty with Malice cannot be ignored. 

I have taken the liberty to overthrow this region, and instate it to proper control. 

Thank you all
