What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? We have no fear of your army, by land and by sea we will battle with thee and fornicate with thy mother. 

Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-diddler of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, Podolian thief, catamite of Tartary, hangman of Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our ding dongs. 

Now we&#39;ll conclude, for we don&#39;t know the date and don&#39;t own a calendar; the moon&#39;s in the sky, the year with the Lord, the day&#39;s the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!
