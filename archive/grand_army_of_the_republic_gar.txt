The Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), also known as the Republic Army, the Grand Army, the Galactic Army, or the clone army, was the army branch of the Republic Military throughout the duration of the Clone Wars. At the time of the First Battle of Geonosis, the Galactic Republic activated tens of thousands of clone troopers to fight the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to human clones, all grown from the bounty hunter Jango Fett&#39;s genetic template, the Grand Army consisted of various military vehicles for ground support, including AV-7 Anti-vehicle Artillery Cannons, BARC speeders, and All Terrain Tactical Enforcers.
