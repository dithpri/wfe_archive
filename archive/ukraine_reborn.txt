Based on the ever-important country of Ukraine (especially in the board game &amp;quot;Risk&amp;quot;), this region provides a friendly environment. Members are expected to maintain a strong and omnipotent military in order to defend our borders. All types of peoples and religions are permitted. Members are also expected and encouraged to keep friendly relations with one another and to aid each other in times of strife. Like Drake&amp;#39;s motto &amp;quot;YOLO&amp;quot;, our motto resounds praise of the motherland, &amp;quot;UKRAINE IS NOT WEAK!&amp;quot;

The land of Ukraine is rich in large, untapped oil deposits, wild livestock, uranium and other nuclear resources, flowing streams and rivers, open fields, and Native Americans with no real rights.
