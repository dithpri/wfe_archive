Since 2007, John and Hank Green have built up a community consisting of over a million people throughout the world. We dedicate ourselves to helping others, learning about the world, and embracing our inner nerds. This region is dedicated to serving members of this community on NationStates. Here, we can discuss politics, science, fandoms, and a whole bunch of other cool things. A lot of members are very political, and this is the perfect place to get our discussions on! This is a friendly, OOC region. Open to all who wish to learn more. The only rule: DFTBA! Invite your friends and let&amp;#39;s create something awesome.
