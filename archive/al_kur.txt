Named after the previous nation I tried this with, this region is trying to be the most authoritarian in the world.
Update: holy crap, i should not have legalized slavery. that lowered my authoritarianism and helped my economy :(
Update 2: lots of nations now
Update 3: still working for it

Update 4: im giving up. no more password, this is bullshit

For a better start, join [region]Nationland[/region] or [region]The Incorporated Lands of Grand Municipalum[/region]
