The Land of Egoria. A group of many islands joined by a leading &amp;quot;Mother&amp;quot; Country of Egoria. Every country in The Egorian Empire shall have some Independence being allowed to do what they please. As long as they pledge their allegiance to protect and serve the Empire, by helping and never harming another Country within it.
