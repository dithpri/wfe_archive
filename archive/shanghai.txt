[b]Note:[/b] I&#39;m looking to give this region away. If you&#39;re interested, contact [nation=short]BlackGreenWhite[/nation].[hr]This region was established as a major city in [region]Chinese Taipei[/region]. It has been refounded and reformed by the [region]Freedom and Justice Alliance[/region] in solidarity with all [b][color=red]anti[/color]fascists[/b] and [b]anti[color=red]Stalinists[/color][/b].

Enjoy the age-old beauty and majesty of [b][color=red]Shanghai[/b][/color], China&#39;s biggest city! This NationStates tribute to the city is open to all but fascists.
