The Covenant of Valaenor provides an alliance for any who seek it; regardless of their former status in the world. All nations must apply for membership to the World Assembly. Please endorse [nation]Erimoor[/nation], our WA Delegate. It is mandatory that each nation vote the way our Delegate dictates or risk expulsion from the Covenant of Valaenor. A review of our Delegate&amp;#39;s voting may be requested on the Region page. If it is deemed necessary by the Nations under the Covenant of Valaenor, our WA Delegate may be replaced. This requires a majority vote.
