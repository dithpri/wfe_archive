The Fantabulous League of Dull Nations (or TFLoDN, all one word) was founded in 2012 as a consequence of the infamous &amp;#39;Lethargic Indifference Movement&amp;#39;. The movement temporarily crippled the first world economy through a combination of unenthusiastic labour strikes and inadvertent occupations of any buildings containing comfortable surfaces or doritos.

The League was founded by nations offering an alternative to the members of the movement, ranging from the &amp;#39;mildly peeved&amp;#39; to the &amp;#39;slightly aggravated&#146;, and even the &amp;#39;disillusioned middle-class student&amp;#39; well known for their involvement.

So if you&amp;#39;re feeling &amp;quot;not quite right&amp;quot; where you are, come join the TFLoDN today! Or don&amp;#39;t! We&amp;#39;re not especially bothered either way, and neither are you!
