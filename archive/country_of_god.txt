The Country of God exists only to those that live as naturally as possible while making safety and freedom top priorities! We believe in not ruining nature and keeping it as pristine as possible. Big business is non-existent and people can say and do almost anything they please as long as it does not interfere with God&amp;#39;s Laws.
