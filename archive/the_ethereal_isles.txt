The only island discovered so far here is the Isle of Untaroicht, what can best be described as a rock. For so many years have the island&amp;#39;s ecosystem and environment been so mistreated that little life, animal or plant, remains on the surface. The water is a murky green, the air is a poisonous cloud of smog and debris, and the land is almost completely sterilized of all life. For this reason, the people of The Holy Imperium of Untaroicht have abandoned the surface, and live in vast colonies deep under the bedrock of the island. Most people of Untaroicht will never once in their entire lives witness natural sunlight, breathe unpolluted air, or feel a living tree.
