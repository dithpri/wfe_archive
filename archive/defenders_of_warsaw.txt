The Defenders of Warsaw is an international group of nations that is founded upon traditional, socialist, conservative, religious, scientific, and nationalist values. All are welcome, and will allow nations with different ideals to join. We&#146;re anti war, but we watch carefully with our defenses on guard at all times.
