[i]&quot;If you take a look at Iran from four, five years ago they were dying. They had a password, they were being choked to death and they were dying. They weren&#39;t even going to be much of a region. They didn&#39;t have anything going and now they&#39;re a power. Overnight, we&#39;ve made them a power.&quot; [/i]

...And then Gameplay backed out of the Iran deal.

See, when you don&#39;t bother to stick around and eject the raiders, we can just take the region back any time we feel like it. 

So, hi Iran!
