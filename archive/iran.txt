[color=71a9cc][b]A couple days ago, the NPA military, along with our close allies the Black Hawks and The Europeian Republican Navy successfully executed a flawless precision strike that resulted in us taking the delegacy of Iran. It was a beautiful operation, and one that should be deemed a success. Maybe the most successfull operation in the history of operations. This operation could not have been made possible without the help of the tremendous soldiers that helped us. Perhaps the most talented soldiers on NS. Only in the NPA and our great allies can you find people of this caliber, and of this talent. To the peaceful people of Iran, you can join the NPA [url=https://forum.thenorthpacific.org/topic/9145375/]Here[/url], and you will be trained by the best people, believe me.[/color][/b]
