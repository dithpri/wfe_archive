[i]&quot;Today we do not march into Parthia for the sake of glory or conquest. Today we march for the sake of protecting our people and ending a tyrannical rule of a mad Shah who has piled hordes of hired barbarians at our doorstep. His warmongering ways have threatened the life of both Romans and Hawks for far too long, and today we march as one to burn this evil down.&quot;[/i]
