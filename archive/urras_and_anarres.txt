Formerly, Urras and Anarres was a, let&#39;s say, semi-prosperous region, with a very friendly and unique (in a good way!) community. After being raided and destroyed, it was restored by the former Governor [nation]South Edellimi[/nation]. Now it serves as sort of a memorial or graveyard for what the region once was.
If anyone has access to the old WFE, I would appreciate if you sent it to [nation]Cor Cada[/nation] or [nation]South Edellimi[/nation] to restore it.
