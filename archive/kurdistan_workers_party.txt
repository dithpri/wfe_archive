The Kurdistan Workers&#39; Party or PKK is a Kurdish militant and political organization based in the Kurdish regions of Turkey and Iraq.

The PKK&#39;s ideology was originally a fusion of revolutionary socialism and Kurdish nationalism, seeking the foundation of an independent communist Kurdistan. The initial reasons given by the PKK for this were the oppression of Kurds in Turkey and under capitalism.
