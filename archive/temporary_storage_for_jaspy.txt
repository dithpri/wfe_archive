Over a year ago, a few puppets had nowhere to go, until they found a cramped, rundown shed. They promised themselves that it was only a temporary fixture, and that they would eventually find a better home.
However, they became more and more attached to this shed. They made it comfortable. And, when they gathered enough resources to build a better home of their own, they decided to stick with their current one.
Over time, more and more puppets came and settled. Eventually, they realised that this wasn&#39;t just some shed. This was their home. And they would live in it. 
The temp-storage. The home of the puppets.
