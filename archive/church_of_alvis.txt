Remember the words of Alvis Himself:
[i]&amp;quot;Crap screamer! You have forgotten the true meaning of Alvis Day. Neither is it ham, nor pomp.
Nay, the true meaning of Alvis day is drinking. Drinking and revenge.
[b]&amp;quot;Now drink with me deeply of the bourbon, scotch, and rye until such time as we are fighting drunk.
Then we shall find, and beat the asses of, the nonbelievers.&amp;quot;[/b][/i]

[b]Non-Alvians are not welcome in this region.[/b]
Hey, I&amp;#39;m an Alvian. I may not be the best Alvian in the world. I may not even be the fifth best.
But I&amp;#39;m the boss! And I say, in this region, [b]Alvis is in the hizzy![/b]
