This is a region that is about to be featured in a story. For true Majestia successors, see [region]MJT[/region] and [region]NeoMajestia[/region].[/quote]
Embassy requests are welcome (and before you send an embassy request, not all of them are accepted as I&#146;m so used to the [region]Dog Lake[/region] regions I forgot [region]waypoint[/region] doesn&#146;t accept every request).
