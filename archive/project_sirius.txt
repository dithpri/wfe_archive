[font=Georgia][color=lightblue][b]This region has the purpose to expand upon the region, [region]Christians[/region] and expand their borders. It does this while helping explain any misconceptions about our region. We are a religious region dedicated to God, and accept all people, regardless of their backgrounds. We are the opposite of [region]Project Ganymede[/region] and [region]Project Callisto[/region] who seek the eventual destruction of the region, as it attempts to lead hungry souls away from the region. Unlike [region]Project Ganymede[/region] and [region]Project Callisto[/region], all our posts are done manually.[/b][/color][/font]
