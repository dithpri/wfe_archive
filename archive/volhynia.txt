[b][color=grey]Greetings From Volhynia![/color][/b]

Welcome to Volhynia!  Here we take your ideas and try to incorporate them into the region&amp;#39;s image!  Unlike other regions we focus on our Regional Newspaper (Volhynia Times), and community events.  In these &amp;quot;events&amp;quot; we host, a random event will be chosen which anyone can suggest.  Our Newspaper is the same; anyone can submit articles to the Editors and yours mostly likely will show up, as long as it isn&amp;#39;t spam.  By the way Volhynia isn&amp;#39;t very serious about the whole government appeal any who we hope you stay in Volhynia for a long time!
