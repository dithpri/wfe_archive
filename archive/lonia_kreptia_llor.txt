[color=bronze][b]This region has been [u]designated a wasteland[/u] and is in the process of being dismantled. It is incumbent on all Frontierists and their allies to eliminate wastelands, which siphon spawns from Frontiers and Feeders and fail to provide regional government and community to new nations.[/b][/color]

[color=darkgreen][b]The dismantling of this wasteland is being performed by the combined armies of [region]FOCUS[/region] ([region]Carcassonne[/region], [region]Communitas[/region], [region]The Wellspring[/region], and [region]Vibonia[/region]), the Legio Pacifica ([region]The Pacific[/region]), and [region]Lone Wolves United[/region].[/b][/color]
