Stand up, damned of the Earth
 Stand up, prisoners of starvation
 Reason thunders in its volcano
 This is the eruption of the end
 Of the past let us make a clean slate
 Enslaved masses, stand up, stand up
 The world is about to change its foundation
 We are nothing, let us be all
  |: This is the final struggle
   Let us group together, and tomorrow
   The Internationale
   Will be the human race :|
