The roleplay we do in this region is tied into the [region]American Union[/region], [region]TransAtlantic Union[/region], [region]European Confederacy[/region] and the [region]African Nations[/region]. We call this the [b]American Union World Story[/b]

[b]The AGME uses a adjusted roleplay system. Drop the last three zeros from the NS population, then add 5,000,000.[/b]

We use [url=http://www.nstracker.net/]NSTracker[/url] in this region to pull numbers such as exchange rates, budgets and military strength. Without NST, you nation will not have a military.
