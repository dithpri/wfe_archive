Welcome to the Ignota Regni! We are a small, young, and neutral region looking for new members.  We will accept nations of all types, ideologies, and sizes. Please join!

We are interested in having a region with realistic politics and role-play. In the Ignota Regni, our nations are all set in a fictional world I came up with. I may eventually make a map for the region once we reach at least five members.

Please respect everyone here in the Ignota Regni. Trolls, raiders, and haters (ha, that rhymed) will be banned!
