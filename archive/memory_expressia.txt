Memory Expressia is a sprawling region of fractured states, all born from the remnants of a once-glorious technological utopia. Situated across a diverse continent, the region is a living testament to the complex legacy of a technocratic civilization that collapsed under its own weight. What began as an ambitious network of city-states and scientific hubs, united by the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, eventually splintered into an intricate web of fractured nations, each with its own ideological approach to the preservation and reinterpretation of the past.
