[b]Bitcoin (&amp;#8383;)[/b] is the world&#39;s first cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash. It is the first decentralized digital currency: the system works without a central bank or single administrator. Bitcoins are sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network directly, without the need for intermediaries. These transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009.
