The White Stag Republic is a Region dedicated to it&amp;#39;s real life counterpart, a micro nation in the northwestern United States. The Republic is dedicated to the environment as well as civil rights (kinda funny &amp;#39;cause my nation&amp;#39;s based off 1984). Anyone willing to support our independence movement may join. Currently the Republic has a permanent population of 8. It covers ~50 acres at the moment, but is looking to expand. We are strongly opposed to large governments and dilution of the individual.
