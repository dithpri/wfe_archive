The White Stag Republic is a Region dedicated to it&amp;#39;s real life counterpart, a micro nation in the northwestern United States. The Republic is dedicated to the environment as well as civil rights. Anyone willing to support our independence movement may join. Currently the Republic has a permanent population of 8. It covers ~50 acres at the moment, but is looking to expand. We are strongly opposed to large governments and dilution of the individual.
