The Southern Coalition
&#147;Unity in Sovereignty.&#148;

The Southern Coalition is a cooperative alliance of independent nations committed to mutual respect, non-aggression, and regional stability. Founded on the principles of sovereignty and shared defense, the Coalition provides a forum for diplomacy, coordinated security, and collaborative development among its members.

Each nation retains full independence while participating in collective decision-making through the Coalition Assembly and Council of Delegates. Together, members work to resolve disputes peacefully, support one another in times of crisis, and promote prosperity across the southern sphere.
