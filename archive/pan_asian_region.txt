We are, as the name suggests, a pan-Asian region. Although ideally you should come here if your nation is Asian inspired (or you are Asian IRL), anyone is welcome. Except for trolls and raiders. On the subject of raiders, the WA delegate does not have administrative powers. 

This region is mostly a region where nations can relax from the chaos of raiding and trolling. I (the founder) am too lazy to create regional forums. Other nations in this region, may. Just please the founder an admin! This region is mostly dedicated to discussion of any subjects [B](subjects deemed inappropriate for this region will be made clear in a dispatch)[/B], from politics (no bigotry!), to RP as long as it does not disrupt. Embassies are encouraged.
