[color=red][b]This area is home base for the legendary duo, the [u][i]FF Gang[/i][/u], sworn enemies of [region]Shrayan Bose[/region] and founder [nation]Udichi[/nation]. We have been wronged in the last year by the ruthless and heartless policy of the corrupt de facto leader of [region]Shrayan Bose[/region], who believes he is an all powerful god. Our quest for peace with them was ruined by an evil agenda to ravage all nations who had an equal amount of influence as them. We seek to destroy Shrayan, piece by piece. Glory to the Duo! Death to Shrayan![/b][/color]
