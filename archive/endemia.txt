Endemia; a group of island nations and territories far to the east of the Rushmore region, from which the peoples of two eastern Rushmore nations originate. Most of them are semi-autonomous overseas territories of the United Federation of Eura, but a handful are independent while Sameba governs one other nation in the region. All of the nations represent themselves at an international level either under their own flag or mother country&amp;#39;s flag (depending on who that mother country is), while the region&amp;#39;s collective body - the Endemian Council - fly under the regional ensign, marked by three gold stars and a rightwards facing triangle. All are welcome. Map and regional rules for new members will be drawn up shortly.
