The New Peace Order (or NPO for short) is to promote peace, help trade, give relief, aid general welfare, and allow nations to prosper in a safe environment without the need to worry about war or other external forces. Another purpose of the NPO is to combat the Black Riders terrorism and control in game (after an attack earlier the prior year from the riders had temporarily crippled the Peace Corps). The NPO&#39;s final purpose is to assist in helping peaceful votes pass in the World Assembly. War and other acts against the purposes of the NPO are not allowed and may lead to permanent banishment.
