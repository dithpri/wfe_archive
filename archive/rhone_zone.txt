[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] love chaos. 

There is only one constant in this world: chaos.  Everything changes, seasons pass, the snow falls and melts.  People may try to work against this universal fact, but it is futile, for chaos comes to all.

As Sun Tzu said, to be chaos, you must first be chaotic yourself. That is why we did a chaotic run and ended up in your region with this WFE!
