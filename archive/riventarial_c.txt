[i]greetings from the administration of the planet Riventarial C[/i]
It is the third most distant planet in the white dwarf system called Riventarial. The axis of rotation of a given planet is aimed directly at the star so that the equator serves as a division for the midnight and light sides. The planet itself has a diameter of 33,452 km.

The region itself welcomes people of all political views, with the exception of the very extreme ones. We welcome discourse and pluralism of opinions.

I hope you have a great time in Riventarial

[u]Raiders and Satanists are not welcome[/u]
