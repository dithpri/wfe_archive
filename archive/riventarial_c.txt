This is a planet orbiting a white dwarf called Riventarial and being the third most remote in the system.
On this planet, due to its axis directed towards the star, there are daytime and midnight zones, and also due to the uneven distribution of atmospheric pressure, water accumulates at the equator, forming vast, foggy oceans and huge archipelagos. The relief consists of sharp changes in elevation gradually turning into high plateaus on the midnight side. The entire planet is quite warm and snow is a rare occurrence on it.
