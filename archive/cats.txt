[color=darkblue]Hullo, &amp;quot;defenders.&amp;quot; Let us tell you something about how our organization works.

You may be able to capture this region for, say, a day. But we&amp;#39;ll always come back. This has happened, this just happened and it will happen again. You cannot win. Give up now, for TBR and its allies have won every time. Boohoo. You can yell at us all you like, but you will never beat us.

Have fun knowing that your team&amp;#39;s a failure.[/color]
