[b][region=The Black Riders] were defeated here. The Cats claim victory![/b]
The USG&amp;#39;s charge was led by Commander [nation no longer exists], and along rode [nation]Free Brisbane[/nation], [nation]The Pacifican Islands[/nation], and [nation]The Remnants of Kobol[/nation] (under the guise of [nation]Carolean Empire[/nation]) into the battle!

[b]The Cats thank [i]The Ugly Black Horses[/i] for giving them time to rebuild the region and protect it to greater extent. But the Relentless Nighttime Horses probably should stay out of the way, or BAD things might happen.[/b]
