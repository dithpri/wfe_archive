[hr][color=RED][b]AN OPEN LETTER TO [region=THE BLACK RIDERS][/color][/b]
[color=yellow]G&amp;#39;day, &amp;quot;Invaders.&amp;quot; Let us tell you something about how the Jihad Raiders roll.

You may be able to capture this region for, say, a day. But we&amp;#39;ll always come back (when we feel like it). This has happened, this just happened and it will happen again. You cannot win. Give up now, for TBR and its allies will lose every time. Boohoo. You can yell at us all you like, but you will never beat us. 

Have fun knowing that your region&amp;#39;s a failure.[/color]
