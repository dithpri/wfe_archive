The East Arctic is a group of barren nations, banished from the rest of the world. The majority of nations are Atheistic but all nations are accepted! Any rude behavior or racist or homophobic statements will lead to a kicking, we are very accepting in the East Arctic. We aim to bring civilization to the barren wasteland of the Arctic.
