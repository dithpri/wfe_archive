[color=dimgrey][i]In the hidden reaches of the universe, there stands an old mansion. Few people know of its existence; fewer are willing to go near it, given the rumors that it is haunted. Which, it is. Haunted by the laughter of the mansion&#39;s various residents, most of which are very much alive. This is Darkstorm Hall, where the strange things of the world gather in peace and friendship.[/i][/color]
