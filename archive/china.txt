Welcome to China![/color] A cultural-civilization with a history lasting 5000 years. A land of beauty and awe with a people both industrious and innovative. China welcomes nations of all governments, and many of us are happy to welcome interested non-biologically Chinese (as in neither Han nor Hakka nor any PRC/ROC recognized minority) peoples/parties. Enjoy your stay.[/b]
