[b][region]The Black Hawks[/region] and their good friends in [region]Balder[/region], [region]Caer Sidi[/region], [region]Kantrias[/region], [region]Lily[/region], [region]Lone Wolves United[/region],  [region]Thaecia[/region], [region]The North Pacific[/region], and [region]The West Pacific[/region], decided to celebrate the holidays! They ate, sang, and exchanged gifts&#133; most of which were weird hands that ended up scarring the updaters, but ignore that for the most part it was great fun.
