[color=#FF0000][region]The Open System[/region], the predecessor to this region, was a place where you could have any freedoms with your nation, provided you didn&#39;t invade any others for those freedoms. That region has since been raided. Here, we keep those policies, but with a few *minor differences*. Among those is the fact that once you enter this system, you&#39;ll need a hell of a lot of bureaucracy to be allowed to leave (Of course, in actual gameplay you can leave at any time, don&#39;t break a sweat)
