[b][color=blue]HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!![/color]

Tonight, [region]The Black Hawks[/region] went on a tour around NationStates, spreading holiday cheer for the new year! There was lots of singing and dancing, as the hawks joyfully partied late into the night! (And perhaps occasionally had a bit too much to drink :P)

[color=blue]Of course, celebration didn&#146;t have [i]quite[/i] the effect the hawks were expecting&#133;.As they had forgotten that New Years Eve was last week XD[/color]
