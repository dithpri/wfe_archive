A pocket dimension where the domain of Enphoso, the Enphosian Pyramidian, resides in, as well as enslaved Enfosi, Enphosians, Mimics, and Risios. &quot;Enphos&quot; is the main language spoken in the pocket dimension. According to the Glaggolian Scriptures, the &quot;Land of the Fallen&quot;, is located in a large pocket dimension deep in the center of the planet, where all glaggles who were unfortunate enough to end up in the Land of the Fallen is subject to unending torture for all time. While the &quot;Land of the Fallen&quot; doesn&#39;t mention Enphoso and his minions, this place is quite close to certain depictions of the pocket dimension.
