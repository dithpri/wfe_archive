[b]Aragon[/b] (Spanish and Aragonese: Arag&oacute;n, Catalan: Arag&oacute;) is a region which compromises three provinces from north to south: Huesca, Zaragoza, and Teruel. It&amp;#39;s capital is Zaragoza.

During the Spanish Civil War, in anarchist-controlled areas, a vast social revolution saw the workers and peasants collectivise land and industry and councils set up.


Welcome to Aragon, inspired by Anarchist Aragon of The Spanish Civil War.
