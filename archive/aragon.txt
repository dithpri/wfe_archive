[b]Aragon[/b] is an autonomous community in Spain, coextensive with the medieval Kingdom of Aragon. Located in northeastern Spain, the Aragonese autonomous community comprises three provinces: Huesca, Zaragoza, and Teruel. Its capital is Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English). The current Statute of Autonomy declares Aragon a nationality of Spain.

As of 2015, the population of Aragon was 1,317,847. The region&#39;s terrain ranges diversely from permanent glaciers to verdant valleys, rich pasture lands and orchards, through to the arid steppe plains of the central lowlands. Aragon is home to many rivers&#151;most notably, the river Ebro, Spain&#39;s largest river in volume. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
