The continent of Ieranna is a large region spanning across 37.12 million kilometres&sup2; in the northern hemisphere. Home to many diverse and rich cultures spanning back thousands of years, its nations built upon the rise and fall of ancient empires that gave birth to the national identities the cultures of Ieranna hold dearly. The diverse, beautiful, and serene landscape of the region is generally colder, from lush temperate forests of the south to the frozen taigas of the north, where temperatures can drop up to -40C. In contrast however, the geopolitical situation of the region is far from serene.
