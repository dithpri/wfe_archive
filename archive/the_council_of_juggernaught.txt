The great council that convenes within a temple of an old god, purged by [b]Emperor Haterius[/b] in his days of ascension.
[b]The Glorious Haterian Empire[/b] heads the council, followed by it&amp;#39;s colonies, vassal-states, allied nations, and other entities of importance.
Though most will not admit it, there is a powerful presence that emanates from the temple, as if the structure itself has ill-intent towards the new occupation.
[b]Emperor Haterius[/b] shows no concern and thus his garrison within the temple as well, so the council ignores it.
