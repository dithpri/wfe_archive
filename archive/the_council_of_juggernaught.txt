The great council that convenes within a temple of an old god, purged by Emperor Haterius in his days of ascension.
The Glorious Haterian Empire heads the council, members including it&#39;s vassal-states, several allied nations, and other parties of importance.

Though most will not admit it, there is a powerful presence that emanates from the temple, as if the structure itself has ill-intent towards the new occupation.
Emperor Haterius shows no concern and thus his garrison within the temple as well, so the council ignores it.
