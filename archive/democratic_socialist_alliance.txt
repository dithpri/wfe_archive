To serve as a beacon of hope to the world around us, the Democratic Socialist Alliance remains.

We stand firm and proud in our choice to be recognized as a free peoples, void of control from outside forces that seek to change our culture to that of false conservatism.

We are thankful for those who have assisted in making this day possible. We are not your colony, but we shall forever be your ally.

Please endorse our Leader and seek to become involved in our government that is growing and adapting.
