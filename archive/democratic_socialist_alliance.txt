This is a moderately left-wing region. Leftist and socialist nations are invited, and capitalist nations are welcomed as well, so long as they do not come in conflict with the Charter. 

All nations with civil rights or political freedoms ranked less than &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; are banned. All nations in prohibited categories are banned. For a complete list see the [url=http://demsocalliance.freeforums.org/charter-of-the-democratic-socialist-alliance-t4.html]Charter[/url], Article I, Section I.
