Ravaged by War.
The Army of [b][color=996402]D[/color][color=000030]E[/color][color=996402]N[/color][/b] shall not prevail.
They Are falling.

Once all was dark.
The land ruled by the [b]Black Riders[/b] for thousands of years.
Rivaled by None.

Yet there was light.
[i]They[/i] were Sick of oppression.
Overconfidence was their demise.
The [b]Black Riders[/b] were cornered.
As [i]They[/i] emerged to fight back.
And fight Back [i]They[/i] did.
At last, [i]They[/i] fought as One.

[b][color=996402]D[/color][color=000030]E[/color][color=996402]N[/color][/b] is Nothing.

Let the Time of freedom be upon us!
