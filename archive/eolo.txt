Eolo is a continent that was discovered in the Atlantic and settled during the 15th century by Europeans and Arabs.
The continent has a climate similar to that of Europe, with a desert in the south and a mountainous mountain range in the north.
When it was discovered, Eolo was quickly inhabited by several peoples forming a single alliance until a war between peoples led to a division and formation of several small countries.
Today all countries are at peace and there are no conflicts
