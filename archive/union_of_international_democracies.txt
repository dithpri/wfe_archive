Welcome to the Union of International Democracies!

What is the Union of International Democracies?
Quite simply, it&#39;s exactly what the region name is, a union of democracies. The region is comprised of different types of democratic governments, ranging from the moderates to the extremists. The only requirement is that a nation is labeled &quot;democratic&quot;; you can be authoritarian sh*thole if ya want.

More will be added later on because I&#39;m lazy...
