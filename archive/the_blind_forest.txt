As outlined by The Canis Checkpoint, the Kingdom is currently not admitting new nations, until further notice, without the direct approval of the Special Inquisitor. We are happy to consider any embassy requests on a case by case basis. The Crown Prince or the Special Inquisitor will be touch, should we have any concerns.
