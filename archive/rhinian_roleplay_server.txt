Welcome to [region]RHINIA[/region]&#39;s official space for the roleplay. At the moment, our roleplay is run by [nation]Castleon[/nation] and I am only here to maintain some sort of control and keep the rules of the roleplay.

[b]There is to be no spamming, flaming or inappropriate posting.[/b] For more information, see the dispatch pinned named [i]&quot;RHINIAN Roleplay Code of Conduct&quot;[/i]. If these rules are broken, then you may face banning from this region (until the current roleplay ends or for life depending on the seriousness of said offence) and possibly a court case.
