The Axis of the Iron Fist was founded for brutal nations, by a brutal nation that seeks everything with a name. The AIF&#39;s goal is to be the uniting force in turning the World Assembly and the Security Council to being an entity of extreme order and law. If your nation is in turmoil, you will be assisted by any other countries that seek aid later in the future. War, oppresion, torture, are all perfectly acceptable, not much will get you banned from the AIF, for being obsessed with law and order we are lax with our war crime punishments.
