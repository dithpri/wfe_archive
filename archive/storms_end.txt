Storm&#39;s End is the seat of House Baratheon, the Lords Paramount of the Stormlands.

One of the strongest castles in the realm, Storm&#39;s End was once the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings of House Durrandon extending back many thousands of years. The castle is said to be protected by spells woven into its very walls that prevent magic from affecting it or passing through it.
