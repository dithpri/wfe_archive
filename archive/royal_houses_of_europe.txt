The [b]RHoE[/b] or [b]Royal Houses of Europe[/b] is a regional faction dedicated to national houses of imperial origin. 
Here we accept nations of both [colour=purple]absolute monarchies[/colour] and [colour=purple]constitutional monarchies[/colour] of any political side, however a national government with socialist and/or communist type governments are forbidden.  

But feel free to join us and help us become a world renowned power.
If you have any Dependent territories, Puppet states or that there are any Royal houses not in Europe but are an associate of a European Royal house, then you have the right to join and/or declare relations through embassies.
