Note from Lumio Magika:

Well people, it&#39;s been fun. But it&#39;s become clear to me that I simply do not have the motivation or time to run a region. So for now, this is it. The region is locked and put on storage. Current residents may choose to stay as long as they want, or they can leave. I don&#39;t mind. Thank you all for your contributions and ideas. May you find warm sands on your travels.
