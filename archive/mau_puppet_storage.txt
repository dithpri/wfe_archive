This decadent hive of Romespawn has been [i]cleansed[/I] by the barbarian hordes of [region]the order of the grey wardens[/region]. Rome may not have been built in one day, but it sure fell in one. Romespawn everywhere cower and flee at sight of our glorious arms.

The corrupt and the wicked and do not falter.
Blessed are the peacekeepers, the champions of the just.
