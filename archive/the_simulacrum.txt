Basically, this is an RPing server set on a solar system far from earth, despite there being human civilizations galore here. All civilizations (Feel free to make yourself an exception here) inhabit one of the many moons orbiting one of two gas giants: Eros, and Dios. If you want to look into the lore of this area I have designed, feel free to! If you wanna do your own thing, that&#39;s totally fine!
No real rules here, just Role Play in a way that everyone will enjoy. You can be casual, too, though I would prefer that the majority of people here are RPing. Of course, if you do anything seriously messed up, like harrassment, expect a punishment for that.

Wander freely!
