The Federation of New World Dominions is a close federation of independent, yet culturally and historically linked nation states. It was formed to foster greater political and economic cooperation, as well as assuring mutual security and defense due to its shared military and border control. The states comprising the federation are largely social-democratic states with progressive social values, yet they adhere very closely to cultural traditions of the past.
