Home to but a single nation, the islands of Dookono are renowned for their sprawling industrial complexes, enormous cities, and barren wastelands. As Dookono and its territorial waters and airspace are administered directly by the Imperial Superlativate of Luvazar, any communications regarding the political status of Dookono as a regional entity should therefore be addressed to the Regional Control Office based in the imperial capital of Luvazon.
