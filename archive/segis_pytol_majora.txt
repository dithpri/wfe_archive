One of the most isolated islands known. Although fairly large, the closest land to Segis Pytol is The Coastal Empire of Plovost, which is 228km away from Segis Pytol&#39;s shore.

The entire island is currently owned by Nor Hurka Forchkia, however, land grants are available for sale.
The island is roughly 3/4ths the size of mainland Australia, and its climate is that of a very rainy tundra. Agriculture, fishing, and general resources are widely accessible.

Smaller uncharted islands dot the sea surrounding Segis Pytol Majora, however, rumor insists that they house old abandoned navy bases from decades ago of some long forgotten nation.
