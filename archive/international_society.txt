Constitution of the International Society:

1- Member states can keep their own ideologic pillars which are not forced to change in order to enter the region.

2- This is a democratic region willing to give power to all. Blocking democracy is punishable.

3- Punishes are decided in RMB and in polls. Everybody can participate in judging a member state.

4- No matter what ideology your state is modeled after, you are welcome to the International Society! After all, debates and exchanging pints of view builds an open, strong and truly democratic society!

5- In democratic processes, voting one-self is not allowed. This said, doing so is considered corruption and will have it&#39;s own open judge.
