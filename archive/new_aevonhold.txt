It is the 3rd Era, year 1163. Mistakes were made, as rifts and astral anchors spread throughout Volvar, and eventually throughout the world unchecked, swallowing and twisting everything in their path. Until the world fought back and used their own power against them.

Many werent lucky to see this happen, though. You were one of the millions that fell to the rifts. It is dark. You open your eyes.

It is the dawn of the 6th era. Where stone castles and villages stood, concrete skyscrapers and megafactories now rise. The world is not what it was. You adapt, but you can&#39;t help but cling on to the past.
