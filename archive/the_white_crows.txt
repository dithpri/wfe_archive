This is a defender region. Many who stand beside me have doubted me. Many have sat and done nothing. Our one goal is to destroy The Black Hawks through passive ways. We do not seek war, but we may bring it. As long as I stand I will try to knock down my enemies. If you are here it is for one of two reasons, so choose one wisely. You would either stand beside me, or you are here to raid me. It would make me sad to think anyone good would want to raid me. I believe that there are three types of people on this Earth. There are those who stand and watch, there are those who want to defend our rights and our freedom, and there are those who want to take it. Nonetheless this is but an elegant dance between good and evil. This is NationStates.
