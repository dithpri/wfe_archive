The [color=lightblue][b]Vanguard Treaty[/b][/color] was once a mighty &quot;mutual cooperation alliance of neutral regions&quot; established in 2016 by the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=ussd][color=red]United Soviet Socialist Dictatorship[/color][/url] ([color=red]USSD[/color]). While its goal of interregional cooperation was commendable, the decadent [color=red]USSD[/color] has long since been unable to properly sustain itself, and as such, the [color=lightblue][b]Vanguard Treaty[/b][/color] equally collapsed under its own weight. Since the founding of the [url=https://www.nationstates.net/region=defense_league_of_militant_convents][color=blue][b]Defense League of Militant Convents[/b][/color][/url], forces from the [color=blue][b]DLMC[/b][/color] have silently monitored the [color=red]USSD[/color]&#39;s decay. And as the [color=lightblue][b]Vanguard Treaty[/b][/color] has finally fallen, the [color=blue][b]DLMC[/b][/color] is ready to reforge a new, reborn [color=lightblue][b]Vanguard Treaty[/b][/color].[hr]
