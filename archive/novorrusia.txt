It is the red powerful, unapologetic industrial heartland where the rusted steel of the armament factories still churns day and night. The entire region exists in a state of perpetual high alert, with every citizen trained for a vital role in the defense of the State, in the Red Army. Dominated by brutalist concrete bunkers and towering statues of granite heroes, the military-industrial complex dictates all policy. The economy is exclusively geared toward war material production and strategic self-sufficiency, ready to withstand an inevitable, generations-long siege.
