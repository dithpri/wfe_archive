The Parish Church of [region]The House of Prayer[/region] Monastery.

[region]Saint Ambrose Parish[/region] is a Byzantine Carmelite Oratory of the Diocese of [region]Saint Margaret Mary[/region] of the [region]Virtual Roman Catholic Church[/region] in [url=https://www.nationstates.net/]NationStates[/url].

Services are in [b]NO WAY A REPLACEMENT[/b] to the real sacraments. Administering the sacraments as a lay person would make the service [b]INVALID[/b], [b]ILLICIT[/b], and [b]NON-SACRAMENTAL[/b]. We have no intention to replace the real ministry of the Church.

Please no talking during the service.

We hope these services would lead you to the REAL thing. [b]Go to your real parish for more of that.[/b]
