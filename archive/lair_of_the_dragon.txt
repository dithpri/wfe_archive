Welcome to the Lair of the Dragon. Here you will find Drakes, Wyverns, and all manner of hoarding creatures focused on a single task - building the largest hoard of wealth possible. Be it a hoard of knowledge, coinage, allies, or draconic lore, all will be collected and used to propel the Lair to ever greater heights.
