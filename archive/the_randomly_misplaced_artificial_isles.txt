The region has dissolved into anarchy after the dissolution of the Supreme Hegemon.

Otherwise, there is a Cold War between two regional superpowers, [nation=short]Quasiphage[/nation] and [nation=short]Infernal Spawn of Evil[/nation].

This war was due to misgivings regarding [nation=short]Infernal Spawn of Evil[/nation]&#39;s subsequently forfeited claim to Azure Isle, which was briefly fought over, but now true conflict has cooled off, and instead relations between them had turned frosty. It remains to be seen how this changes after Azure Isle was generously donated to [nation]Anglica Isle[/nation], a political ally of [nation]quasiphage[/nation]. More on this topic as it unfolds.
