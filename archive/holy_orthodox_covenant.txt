A warm welcome to the Holy Orthodox Covenant.
We acknowledged that all the existing regions self-styled Orthodox are in fact not Orthodox at all, and created this Holy Covenant. This is a space for Nations ruled by Orthodox users, but has some role-playing. We don&#39;t plan to be part of the WA, as we do not accept legislation passed by the NS counterpart of humanist, worldly powers.

Our titles in the Covenant are styled after the honorifics used by ancient Christian rulers.
Our map is under construction.

All the Orthodox Christians - catechumens and inquirers too - are welcome to stay. Open affiliation to a canonical church may be requested. [b]Members must comply to all our Canons.[/b]
