Overview:
The Royal Alliance is a tropical region consisting of a mainland and multiple islands, with a mixture of lush forests and mountainous terrain. We are a diverse and welcoming region, open to all nations regardless of political affiliation, government type, or ideology. Our region is primarily focused on roleplay and competition, with nations vying for control over land in our region map. However, we all work together to defend our region from external threats and maintain peace and stability.
