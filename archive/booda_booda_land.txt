Booda Booda Land is a diverse group of crazy nations that care for each other (expect Spongebobithianopolis) in special ways. We, the nations of Booda Booda Land all are unique, but quite crazy. Many people have asked us leaders if we were high, I promise we are not (pass the weed). We believe in life, liberty, and potatoes. If you go on the RMB, be prepared to die... If ya want to join send Spongebobithian a nice telegram. -Campbellopolis and Spongeithianopolis and
