Of Black and Grey is a novel I wrote about the English Civil War, and since I like it so. I decided maybe people would like the kind of feel.

So I made this region OBAG Auskritia.

But of course since Auskritia itself is a planet and not Scotland, and also more based on the whole &amp;quot;Wars of the Three Kingdoms&amp;quot; so yeah.

If anyone is willing to create Auskritia, go ahead. (The Map)
