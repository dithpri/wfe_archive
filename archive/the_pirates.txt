[b][color=#BFBF40]Avast!  I am your Captain Zaphod, with ye orders.  

M8ies, we set sail aboard a cyberspace ship carried by the photonic winds into the uncharted oceans of the deep cyber space you now see before ye.  

Tis not a voyage for the weak of heart, me sheep heads!   So fortify yourselves at the local establishments tonight for on the morrow we shall set sail at the first photon&#39;s light.   Aye![/color][/b]
