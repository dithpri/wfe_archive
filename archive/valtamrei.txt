[color=blue]After a discussion and a final decision via PM, Valtamrei is to cease activity and rejoin [region]The United States of Europe[/region]. Nations are welcome to stay but if its not too much trouble, please move to [region]The United States of Europe[/region] so that we may begin to rebuild a new home for ourselves.
Thank you to all who have served Valtamrei these past (alomst)6 months. [/color]
