In The Pacific stays hidden Islands of sizes from great to small hidden from most of the world. The Sun stays up on one side and it&#39;s always dark on the other thanks to some supernatural happenings and here stay The humanoids who are not human. These are a safe haven from the problems of the outside world. We mostly stay out of wars going on outside and try not to bicker among ourselves. 

Human rule 1. States humans may live in the Islands as any other creature but must follow our rules and no one shall hurt one another be it verbal or physical and all will thrive with one another.
