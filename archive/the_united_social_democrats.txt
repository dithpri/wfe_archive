[i]Welcome to the United Social Democrats! Founded May 4 2013! Our name is self explanatory, the region has social democratic and democratic socialist ideologies, and is meant for liberals, social democrats, and other nations with left wing ideologies. However all nations are welcome unless you have low civil rights and political freedoms.
