[b][u]Territory of [region]The MT Army[/region]!!![/b][/u]

[I]Captured: 21.03.18[/I]

[color=red]This former Nazi region was conquered by The MT Army in the early to mid 2000&#39;s. It was refounded/defended by the &quot;[i]Shadow Warriors[/i]&quot; in 2009, in dedication of [nation]Vippertooth33[/nation] and [region]The MT Army[/region] but has then constantly swapped hands over the years.

It was most recently held by [region]BLITZKRIEG[/region] in disdane of its Nazi heritage.

It has once again been captured by the mighty Anti-Nazi/Fascist warriors of [region]The MT Army[/region] and shall serve as a museum against HATE in perpetuity.[/color]
