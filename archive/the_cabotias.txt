The Cabotias is a large, varied region consisting mostly of marginally inhabited badlands and rainforest.  The central area, eastern area, and the west coast are the most populous areas of the region.  A vast range of mountains called the Serralada runs the entire length of the region, from the northern tundra to the southern tip of the continent.
