The Pacific Northwest Islands are a group of islands located just 180 km of the coast of West Canada. We are a very Liberal region with a highly organized government. If you are a nation with culture much like the Pacific Northwest in North America or your just a person who likes to kick back and have fun than go ahead.
Cedar, Pine, and Oak trees dot the landscape with mountains to ski on and lakes to fish for salmon this region truly has something for many to enjoy. We also offer a rustic expire de for anyone wanting to escape their troubles. Any member nations can run for an office or even WA Delegate if they get the largest sum of endorsements. Also feel free to vote on new laws and bills within the region
