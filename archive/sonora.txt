[color=orange][b]Hello! Hola! &amp;#1055;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1090;! Sonora is a de facto region for conservatives, libertarians, and capitalists! What &quot;de facto&quot; means is that you don&#39;t [i]have[/i] to be a conservative to reside in Sonora.
We were founded by [nation]Amaryllisia[/nation] after there were conflicts over at [region]The Great Conservative Alliance[/region].
We plan on starting an RP soon!
World Assembly members, endorse whoever you like, this is a democratic region!
