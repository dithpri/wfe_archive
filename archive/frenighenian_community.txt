[b][i]WELCOME TO THE[/i] [color=blue][i]FRENIGHENIAN COMMUNITY[/i][/color][/b]

[b]Started as a  loose assistance agreement between Frenighen and it&#39;s former and current colonies, we are now open to all and any nations.[/b]

We value discussion and comraderie between differing nations in opposition to major regions and we oppose World Assembly&#39;s infrigement of nations&#39; internal affairs.

Every nation has a right for any political and economical system that fits it&#39;s culture, historical context, mentality of it&#39;s people and material conditions.

While WA nations are welcome, they should not expect  their delegate to hold any meaningful position within the Community.

[b]We accept all embassy requests![/b]
