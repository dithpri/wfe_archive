[b][i]WELCOME TO THE[/i] [color=blue][i]FRENIGHENIAN COMMUNITY[/i][/color][/b]

[b]Started as a loose assistance agreement between Frenighen and it&#39;s former and current colonies and dominons, we are now open to all nations.[/b]

We value discussion and comraderie between differing nations and we oppose World Assembly&#39;s infrigement of nations&#39; internal affairs.

We believe that every nation has a right to establish any political and economical system that fits it&#39;s culture, historical context, mentality of it&#39;s people, and material conditions.

While WA nations are welcome, their delegate won&#39;t hold executive position within the Community.
