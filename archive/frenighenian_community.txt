[b][i]WELCOME TO THE[/i] [color=blue][i]FRENIGHENIAN COMMUNITY[/i][/color][/b]

[b]Started as a loose assistance agreement between Frenighen and it&#39;s former and current colonies and dominons, we are now open to any and all nations.[/b]

We value discussion and comraderie between differing nations in opposition to major regions and we oppose World Assembly&#39;s infrigement of nations&#39; internal affairs.

Every nation has a right for any political and economical system that fits it&#39;s culture, historical context, mentality of it&#39;s people, and material conditions.

While WA nations are welcome, they should not expect  their delegate to hold any special position within the Community. WA nations shall be free to vote on WA resolutions however they please.

[b]We accept all embassy requests![/b]
