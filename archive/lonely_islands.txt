Welcome to the Lonely Islands! Here have a quick look around, The biggest island, &quot;Depression Grotto&quot; is a island with a big grove but, the island is full of caves and its always raining. Next is &quot;Annoyance Meadow&quot; Which is more south and has to be one of the best islands, Its also the second biggest island. It has open fields, beautiful flowers, nice weather and calm beaches. However, everything gets annoying real fast. We go more north and travel to &quot;Jealous Peaks&quot; The weather is bad and its mostly forest, rock and seals. You quickly, become jealous of the other islands. We go west, far away from the weather and into &quot;Scared Rivers&quot; Since, its more far, Its more mysterious and scary. The lonely islands are amazing and I hope you join.
