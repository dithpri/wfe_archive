The Benevolent Monarchy of the Ninetales is a kingdom of independent states united in ideals and might. These kingdoms have existed for many years but have recently banned together in a united union. This union is for the mutual profit of all members and seeks to uphold fair representation for each country, though technically it is run by a King.
