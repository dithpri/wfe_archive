A region with nations work well with each other but are drastically different when I comes to policies, people and ideology despite this no conflicts had ever happened between the members of the region. Nations in this region have close enough ties that they formed a Union with each other even though they may not agree and even despise some of the policies of their neighbors, even though a Union between these nations would have been impossible the nations here had achived the impossible and now are closely tied together like brothers in arms. The nations in the Union enjoy high autonomy with no restrictions on what they can or can&#39;t do and only comes together as a council to debate and vote on choices in the WA.
