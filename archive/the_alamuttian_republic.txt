This region supports new, elegant nations that has the right to do anything that they want, as long as they do it with a gracious hand. This region must have nations that are confident to role-play, and to have serious discussion on how we, as possible American citizens, like myself, can make the American nation a better place. We can just relax as well, as a peaceful nation. Democracy in this region is compulsory for a nation to achieve. We verbally fight by the people, for the people.
