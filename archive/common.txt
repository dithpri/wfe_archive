their fortress secure.

[Chorus]
Long live pur Soviet Motherland
built by the people&#39;s mighty hand.
Long live her people united and free
strong in a friendship tried by fire
long may her crimson flag inspire
shining in glory for all men to see.

Through days dark and stormy
when great Lenin led us
our eyes saw the bright sun of Freedom above
and Stalin our leader
with faith in the people
inspired us to build the land that we love.

[chorus]

We fought for the future
destroyed the invader
and brought to our homeland
the laurels of fame.
A glory will live in the memory of nations
and all generations will honor her name.
