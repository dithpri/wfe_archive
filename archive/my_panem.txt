Panem is a dystopian nation from &quot;The Hunger Games,&quot; consisting of a wealthy Capitol and twelve districts. The Capitol is rich, technologically advanced, and holds total power, while the districts are poor, oppressed, and each specializes in a specific industry. The Capitol enforces its control through fear, propaganda, and the Hunger Games, creating a stark divide between its luxurious lifestyle and the harsh conditions in the districts.
