[region]The Black Hawks[/region] had an interesting experience tonight for suddenly, without warning, many of them were turned into frogs!
 After some investigation it was discovered that this was a result of Aleena and Vleerian angering a frog god due to having frog legs on a trip to france. 

Luckily, the frog god had a love for racing and swore to transform them back if they won a race. But, Given frogs are not the best of drivers, they chose to win via cheating. They sabotaged many racing cars including one in your region.
