Ruled by Talonis from atop Angel Island, Talonsbane is a Feudalistic, House-Based Democracy, with each individual member doing whatever they want (save what was banned by them or the constitution, which is waiting to be realesed when member #&amp;#39;s are up) and acting as a House. The Houses convene on all desicions, and Talonis will then carry out their will.
