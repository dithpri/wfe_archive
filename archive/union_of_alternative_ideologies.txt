This region is dedicated to those ideologies that are alternative to mainstream politics.

Puppets are allowed.
All residents who have been here four days and made ten constructive message board posts are given embassy, communications and polls authority.
Political discussion is encouraged.
Don&#39;t use puppets to give the impression of more support for a debate than there actually is, and please confirm that accounts are puppets when you join the region.
If you do something another member considers as power abuse, a vote will be done on whether it counts as power abuse, with each person (anyone with multiple nations can only vote once) voting, and if a majority agrees, you will be stripped of your powers and banned.
