[b]The Death Star II (DS-2 Orbital Battle Station) was a partially completed moon-sized battle station constructed by the Galactic Empire as the successor to the Death Star. 

It was larger and more powerful than the first [region]Death Star[/region]. It&#39;s long-term purpose was to terrorize planets and star systems in league with the Rebel Alliance through the use of its planet-destroying superlaser.

However, the Death Star II also served another purpose: luring the Rebels into a battle that would, the Empire hoped, destroy them once and for all.
