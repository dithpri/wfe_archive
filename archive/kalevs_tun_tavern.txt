When first built in 1685 on Philadelphia&#146;s waterfront, the original Tun Tavern developed a reputation for offering fine beers and being home to important historical events including being the birthplace of the United States Marine Corps on November 10, 1775. Today&#146;s Tun Tavern, KALEVS TUN TAVERN, continues to hold prestige as an award-winning casual gourmet cuisine and handcrafted brews, as well as live entertainment and special events.
