The region is highly anti-World Assembly, and will enlist an army for the purpose of nullifying the power of the WA. The region is also supportive of defenders and will participate in operations to liberate, detag, and protect regions from raiders.

Internally, we will set up forums, start Role Playing, and establish a regional government meant to continually grow and stand the test of time as it fights against the WA and against raiders.
