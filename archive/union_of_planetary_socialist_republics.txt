This brotherhood of planets [color=red][B](UPSR)[/B][/color]  that lay withing a [color=green][i]peaceful coexistence[/i][/color] of the universe under a communist ideal, that yearns for the knowledge of what is out there.

We exist toward perfection of the human species, to make them [B][color=purple]dominant in all corners of the Galaxy[/color][/B], learning new technologies, to see if there are others life other that our own. All the while maintaining [color=red][B]the Utopian existence of the communist ideal. [/B][/color]
