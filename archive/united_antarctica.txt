United Antarctica consists of several unified states located on the continent of Antarctica. What was originally a trading post set up by the Soviets during the Cold War turned international trade federation has grown to become a near world superpower. 

The capital is located on an island 25 miles off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, where the temperature is relatively warm compared to the mainland. 

United Antarctica has two Special Administration Zones. These territories are Nantucket Island (purchased from the United States as part of their cost-saving scheme) and the Kingdom of Tonga.
