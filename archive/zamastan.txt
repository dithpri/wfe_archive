Zamastan is a region contained in a large oceanic swath of nearly 5000 islands. Each nation has its own significant cultural history due to the tribal indigenous populations on each island that adapted to modern society through imperial occupation. The archipelago was once part of the Malatopian government, but through a coup led by the Zamainian tribe, the islands gained independence. The Zamainian tribe formed the nation of Zamastan and set up the Zamastan Alliance. Though the W.A. currently only recognizes Zamastan as a nation, the Region of Zamastan recognizes 47 states, including the Republic of Davori, the Skith Confederacy, and the Islands of Bavor and Turia.
