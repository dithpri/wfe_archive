This is the region of [color=#008000][b]Fangorn[/b][/color].
We try to keep our forest bathed in golden light, from the winds and welkin whispering at our top branches, to dewkissed spiderwebs supported by the undergrowth.

Here, the seasons roll on in a measured pace, while strong roots are entangled in an eternal murmuring dialogue with the mycorrhizae web beneath the duff.

Resting on a mossembraced stone by a clear brook, you may be lulled to slumber, and in your dreams, our land may share its tales of whilom times and tidings.

May your leaves dance in a cool westerly wind, and your sap stay strong.

Since our Entmoot takes a long time to gather, [color=#008000][b]we do not accept embassies[/b][/color] at this point in time.

PS. Anything that is sharp, brutish, burning, and/ or hacking is not welcome.
