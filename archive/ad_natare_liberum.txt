Welcome!
We are glad to see you are interested in the region of Ad Natare Liberum! We are a very new region as you can see but that does not mean we can&#39;t do anything! In fact, with your help as well as many others we will be able to spread our views. What views you may ask? Well I&#39;ll list them out for you:
*High Political Freedom
*High Civil Rights
*High Economy
*High Eco-Friendliness

I do hope you stay with us, but again it&#39;s your decision!
