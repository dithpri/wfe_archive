[color=darkred]A [b]princely state[/b], also called native state or Indian state, was a vassal state under a local or regional ruler in a subsidiary alliance with the British Raj.
In 1947, princely states numbering 555 covered 48% of area of pre-Independent India and constituted 28% of its population.[/color][hr][color=red][i]I have always had a fascination for British India, especially all the many princely states which characterised the region - any such state I&#39;m very lucky to host in some small way here on NationStates. I hope to write factfiles for each of them, which should keep me occupied whenever I feel aimless and have little else to do.[/i][/color]
