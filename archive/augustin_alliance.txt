[b]THE AUGUSTIN ALLIANCE[/b]

[b]Founded in July of 2016, the Augustin Alliance is a multi-region network created for the purposes of cooperation to allow players to focus on their favorite part of the game, while giving them access to a wider community, and maintaining a high level of quality across the whole experience. 

To do that, we built a loose coalition of regions:[/b]
