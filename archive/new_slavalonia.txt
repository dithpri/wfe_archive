After the great nation of Slavalonia&#39;s leadership collapsed and the remnants waged a destructive civil war, vying for control of its more than 3 billion people, it fell to ruin.
Years later, with its capital Slavigrad completely barren and now more of an archeological site, its people&#39;s descendants are finally coming together to form a new civilization.
Starting with the rise of Ewhor from the ruins of the old superpower, new people are coming to these lands, hoping for a bright, longer lasting future.
