A group of lush jungle islands where the nation of Qunexia is housed. this region is dominated by the Qunexian wolf, which frolics majestically in the many beautiful forests of the region. Ships often crash here on their way to other islands and thus as a result the Qunexian people have become very handy in ship repair. The dictatorship of the Brady dynasty is also a nation present in this region.thankfully the qunexians and brady dynastites get along quite well
