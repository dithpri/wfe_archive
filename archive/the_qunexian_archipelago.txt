A group of lush forest islands. this region is dominated by the Qunexian wolf, Brady dynastite rhino, and the asulamadi-nah caterpillar, which compete for dominance of the ecosystem. Ships often crash here on their way to other islands and thus as a result the people of this region  have become very handy in ship repair.
