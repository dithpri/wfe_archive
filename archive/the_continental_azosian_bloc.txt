The Azosian Bloc, comprising the People&#39;s Republic of Azosi, Holy Empire of Mahads, and Miquame Socialist Republic, was formed in the late 20th century as a response to global political and economic challenges. Azosi and Miquame were communist states while Mahads was capitalist, but the bloc overcame their differences and built a strong political and economic alliance. The United States of Rohan, a small capitalist nation with nuclear weapons, and Bharaat, a rising capitalist power, later joined the bloc, adding to its strength and diversity. Although united against threats foreign, the regoin is often embroiled in domestic warfare. (Weekly Map Updates)
