The Azosian Bloc, comprising the People&#39;s Republic of Azosi, Holy Empire of Mahads, and Miquame Socialist Republic, was formed in the late 20th century as a response to global political and economic challenges. Azosi and Miquame were communist states while Mahads was capitalist, but the bloc overcame their differences and built a strong political and economic alliance.

Despite challenges such as globalization and military tensions, the bloc has succeeded in promoting its interests on the world stage.
