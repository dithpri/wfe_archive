[color=brightorange]Welcome to the larger island.[/color]
[color=orange][i]Majorca[/i][/color][color=brightorange], &amp;quot;the larger one&amp;quot; is just that.

Governed from the beach by [b][i]Los Amigos de Durruti[/i][/b][/color][hr][b][color=bluye]&amp;quot;No, Durruti is not dead! He is more alive than living. His glorious example will now be emulated... by all the oppressed and disinherited. The memory of Durruti&amp;#39;s courage and fortitude will spur them on to great deeds until fascism has been slain. Then the real work will begin--the work on the new social structure of human value, justice and freedom.&amp;quot; ~[/color] [color=orange]Emma Goldman[/color][/b][hr][b][color=greeny]Sun-seekers welcome, but remember: General Franco Rots In Hell.[/color][/b]
