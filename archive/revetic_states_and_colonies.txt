Unified under one banner: Forward marching, never standing in one place, we shall unhook the carriages of the idiotic status quo loving masses and usher in a new age where the forward thinking are in charge, Long live the idealist, and immortality to the rebel

From blindness we will see
from madness we will flower
unto the dawn we shall rise!
