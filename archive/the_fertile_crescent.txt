Birthplace of civilisation, the Fertile Crescent is a roughly crescent-shaped area of land encompassing the Euphrates-Tigris river system of Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq plus parts of Syria and Turkey), the Levant (the rest of Syria plus Lebanon, Israel-Palestine and the westernmost bits of Jordan) and the Nile Valley of Egypt.
