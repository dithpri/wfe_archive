Welcome to Golden Sands. We are ruled by [nation]Golden Arabia[/nation], one of the oldest still existing nations in Craftworld! (if you don&#39;t count the transfer from Egypt to Arabia.) We are mostly neutral, but we enjoy relatively ok diplomatic relations with the Avalonist Treaty Organisation. We used to be good allies of the Cliveist Internationale and the Pact of Steel Blood and Creativity, as they helped destroy our ancient enemy, the Bazaar, but relations have soured since the invasion of Egypt and Sudan.
