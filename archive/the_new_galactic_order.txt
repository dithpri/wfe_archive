The New Galactic Order is a region of FT nations and empires. Comprised of the New Dark Empire and other space based civilisations. We strive In-game to create a mutual alliance of people who like roleplaying Future Tech, and develop a roleplaying alliance and off-site forums, where we can develop our own storylines and canon. All stories and events that occur in roleplaying on our offsite forums for members of this region are canonical to us, and we strive to develop a roleplaying system where people can have fun with space-based empire building and conflict in RP, whilst remaining part of a safe and secure region in-game.
