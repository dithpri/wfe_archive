This world, it knows not of what is right, it knows not of what is true, it simply knows not. This world will know what is right, it will know what is true, if it simply unites under one common banner. So I do beseech you! Join under the banner of the one true prophet Sly!

In the name of Sly, the forgiving, the merciful!

If you would like to join, there is only one requirement. 

Think... of... the... know what? Just join.
