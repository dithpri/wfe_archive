[b]Greater Necanica[/b] is a region of the world that was formerly comprised of ten districts, each prosperous in their own way. However, two major events have since changed that. To begin, the [b]War of Sovereigns[/b] caused many nations to turn against their former allies, and allowed enemies to annihilate one another.

Following the [b]War[/b], a [i]massive[/i] volcanic eruption occurred, triggering a freak weather phenomena known as the [b]Ash Winter[/b]. This began 75 years ago, and caused widespread strife in the region. Millions perished, and the already weakened districts dissolved completely. These are hard days for the inhabitants of [b]Greater Necanica[/b], but there is some hope yet for those nations who bind themselves together, work hard, and push for greatness.
