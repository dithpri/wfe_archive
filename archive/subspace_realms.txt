The [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are a cluster of two small extra-dimensional space-time &#39;bubbles&#39; (basically two tiny isolated universes). As the name suggests the [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are located deep inside subspace and thus are extremely inaccessible. 

The two isolated space-time &#39;bubbles&#39; are each controlled by a civilization of  advanced descendents of the human race.
