The [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are a cluster of two small extra-dimensional &#39;microverses&#39; (basically two tiny isolated universes). As the name [b]Subspace Realms[/b] suggests, these &#39;microverses&#39; are located deep inside of subspace and thus are extremely hidden and inaccessible.

The two tiny universes are each controlled by an advanced space-faring civilization.
