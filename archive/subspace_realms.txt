The [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are a cluster of five small extra-dimensional space-time &#39;bubbles&#39; (basically five tiny isolated universes). As the name suggests the [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are located deep inside subspace and thus are extremely inaccessible. 

The five isolated space-time &#39;bubbles&#39; are each controlled by an advanced space-faring civilization.
