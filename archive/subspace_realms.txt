The [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are an isolated cluster of extremely inaccessible extra-dimensional sanctuaries - located deep inside the subspace. They are basically a cluster of a few tiny universes each with its  own isolated space-time reality. Therefore the [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are inaccessible/beyond reach for most space-faring civilizations.

The [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are currently controled by two civilizations:

&#149; [b][nation]The Necron-Empire[/nation][/b] [i](machine civilization)[/i]

&#149; [b][nation]-The Tau Empire[/nation][/b] [i](multi-species civilization)[/i]
