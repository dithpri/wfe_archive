The [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are a cluster of extra-dimensional space-time &#39;tensor-bubbles&#39; (basically tiny isolated universes). As the name suggests the [b]Subspace Realms[/b] are located deep inside of subspace and thus are hidden and extremely inaccessible.

These isolated microverses are controlled by two extremely advanced inter-galactic civilizations.
