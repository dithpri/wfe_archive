The [b]Subspace Realms[/b] is an area located deep inside the subspace, where (through natural quantum-tensor-effects) two otherwise completely isolated extra-dimensional civilizations are able to get access to the Universe, more accuratly, to our space-time reality. Therefor the two civilizations are among the best protected cultures existing.

There are some very limited contacts to the &#39;[region]SICON[/region]-Alliance&#39; and the &#39;[Region]Tkon Inversion[/region]&#39;.
