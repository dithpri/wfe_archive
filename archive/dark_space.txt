[B]Dark Space, the intergalactic space.[/B]

Before the Reaper Wars, the Dark Space was full of the Reapers. However, in 2186, this changed. The Reapers were defeated by the [i]Victory Fleet[/i]. The Galaxy was saved, the cycle had ended.
Or so everyone thought.

In the deepest, darkest sectors of Dark Space, the last Reapers were awaken. Being inactive during the War, they were not affected by the Crucible. They learned from the transmissions sent by their kindred fallen in the War, they would prepare themselves for [region]the Species Alliance[/region]. They would be stronger, wiser.

They are the last of their kind.
[i]They will be back.[/i]
