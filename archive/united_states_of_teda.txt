Tightly knit region separated by the San Da Jie River. Beware the Crater of Cyanide in the East, but take a trip to Mount Tesco in the West. Visit the Tai Feng forest for a nice respite, and frequent the many fine eateries and watering holes spread throughout the area. A trip to the UST wouldn&amp;#39;t be complete without visiting the Ren Ren islands: A land of merchants and wares, but take heed of the drivers!!! Education is kind of a big deal here.
