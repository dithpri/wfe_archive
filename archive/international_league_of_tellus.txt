[color=blue][i][b][u]Welcome to the International League of Tellus![/u][/b][/i][/color]

The International League of Tellus (ILT) is the foremost authority on international politics on the planet of Tellus. It has little to no authority directly speaking, but can be a platform for nations to speak on about international issues or disputes between two member states. Membership in the ILT is automatic upon being recognised by at least half of all members in the ILT, although a nation may opt out at any time. 

Almost all of our rp and communication happens in our [url=https://discord.gg/zyuWMc7qSS]discord[/url], so it&#39;s strongly recommended that you join it.
