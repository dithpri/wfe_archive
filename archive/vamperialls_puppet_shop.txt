Vamperiall&#39;s Puppet Shop is a marketplace for all nation buyers. Heres how it works;

1. All puppets are brought into the region and put on display
2. A nation (you) will come along and see our region.
3. They &quot;browse&quot;, trying to find the right puppet nation for them
4. Once you find a puppet you like, you telegram [nation]Vamperialls Puppet[/nation], and ask for the password to the puppet you wish to purchase. Once you receive this, you may log in to the puppet.

Puppets are for all your daily needs! Raiding, diverting natural resources, card farming, region spamming, and so much more!

BTW there is no currency involved.
