In this region, we are very laid back and really don&#39;t care what you do as long as it doesn&#39;t involve
1. Oppression of the people
2. Corruption
3. Welfare
4. Taxes higher than 15%
5. Anything that would lessen the rights of humanity

Other than those 5 rules, we just want you to have fun and enjoy capitalism. :)
(Forge of Iron Fists is an example to all as to why socialism, communism, fascism, or whatever name you want to pin to it, doesn&#39;t work).
