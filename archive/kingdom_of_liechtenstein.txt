Guten Tag!  Willkommen im Reich der Liechtenstein! I&amp;#39;m currently working on a regional forum. I&amp;#39;m hoping to establish a government so that there can be much more in-depth gameplay. It may take a bit, so please be patient. Please enjoy your time here. (And yes, I know that Liechtenstein does not have a king. It has a prince, and is therefore a principality. But I can&amp;#39;t change the name.)
