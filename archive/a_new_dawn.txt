The year is 2031, a bio-weapon engineered by an unknown group ravaged the human population, killing 38% of the population within 2 weeks. Nations collapsed as chaos and disorder erupted. Then suddenly, as quickly as it came, the weapon, now come to be known as the Violet Flu, was eradicated thanks to the effort of the worlds greatest minds coming together, at the cost of most of their lives.

Now the world stands stunned and battered, with the remnants of fallen nations piecing themselves together and new regimes rising from the ashes of their former homelands. None but time can tell what may happen next.
