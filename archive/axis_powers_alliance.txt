Welcome to the [region]Axis Powers Alliance[/region]

A military based region with focus on invading other regions. We don&#39;t care about rules, we make our own ones. 

If a region annoys you, we can raid and destroy it. Our alliance is in fact so powerful that we once managed to become delegate in [region]The Black Hawks[/region] just to annoy them.

Orders:
Recruit as many nations as possible to join our alliance, and become a member of the world assembly
