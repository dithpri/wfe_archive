Hello! You must be viewing this page.  The AF was a great region. This region has just collapsed due to inactivity. N.W.T, Age Of Utopia being inactive made the RMB practically dead.

Thanks for staying here, Thanks for being part of our community,
Thanks for keeping the RMB Alive, and Thanks for helping us expand.

This region had its time to shine. Officers, Sierra Grand to make us laugh, and everything else. 
Its over now. Good luck wherever you are and wherever you go!

To any remaining on this region, we recommend you move to [region]SolarFlare[/region] or [region]Celeasukomi[/region].
