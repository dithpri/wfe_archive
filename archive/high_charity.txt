Some of the biggest fleets in the entire Covenant armada defended the city, such as the Second Fleet of Homogeneous Clarity and the late Fleet of Particular Justice. 
As it was the Covenant&#39;s major religious center and capital, High Charity was enormously sacred to the Covenant. 
It was thought that true believers should visit it at least once in ones lifetime, though few of the Covenant could afford to do so. 
High Charity was full of Sangheili and San&#39;Shyuum High Councilor, and the general leadership of the entire Covenant hegemony. 
It can be assumed that High Charity had its own set of powerful energy shields and defensive weapons.
