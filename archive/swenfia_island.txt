I was lost and was afraid
I believed all of their lies
I believed that I was safe
And that I would never die
Now I&#39;m all alone 
I&#39;ve been hiding in the dark
I just want to go home
But my deeds send me too far
All stay strong 
We live eternally
All is well in the Afton family
Lives, they fell to pure insanity
All is hell in the Afton family
