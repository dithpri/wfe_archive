[quote=wenday;36221343]It seems it&#39;s my time to go. There is nothing here for me. So I guess i&#39;ll be gone in 28 days so I guess there is a 28 day notice. I wish it didn&#39;t have to come to this but it&#39;s just a waste of time to come back. Good bye I wish the best for the reader reading this.
