Each of the participating Holy Roman nations shall create a puppet and move it over to the The Holy Roman Moon. You may reserve plots of land depending on the population of the puppet: for every 100 million people live in the colony, you get one tile. However, you start with five tiles, so new colonies have a big space to work with. All colonies must be contiguous. People who previously participated may reuse their old colony and rollover their population, since they worked oh so hard. To reserve a tile, contact [nation]Great Jergania and Jonland[/nation] today!
