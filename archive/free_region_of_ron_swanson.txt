Hello and welcome to the Free Region of Ron Swanson.
Do whatever the hell you want.

For new nations that are well... new and can&amp;#39;t decide how they want their custom flag to look like, Telegram me about a FRoRS flag template. You can add your own symbols to it, of course, but should contain your nation&amp;#39;s name. For a good example see the flag of [nation]Amazing Erikland[/nation].
Also, [nation]Kerbalalia[/nation] has a good example what a more &amp;quot;uniform&amp;quot; flag of this region could possibly look like. But as this is a FREE region, it&amp;#39;s all up to you.
Take it easy, man.
