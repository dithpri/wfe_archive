The world of Ekalis is ruled by zealous preists, benevolent kings and tyrannical emperors; both threatened and protected by ancient gods and powerful magics. It is home to the races of men, halfling, elf, dwarf and orc. The superpowers of Ekalis are the corrupt and militaristic Empire of Slaytroya and the pagan and olden Republic of the Druiaun Kingdoms. The smaller (yet still powerful in their own right) and less influencial nations Ekalis include pastoral Lorimere, draconain Hyeatos and exspanionist Lothendian
