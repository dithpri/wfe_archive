The world of Ekalis is ruled by devoted preists, benevolent kings and tyrannical emperors; both threatened and protected by primordial gods and powerful magics. It is home to the races of men, halfling, elf, dwarf and orc. The superpowers of Ekalis are the corrupt and militaristic empire of Slaytroya and the pagan and ancient republic of the Druiaun Kingdoms. The smaller and less influencial nations (yet still powerful in their own right) in Ekalis include pastoral Lorimere, draconain Hyeatos, cannibalistic Kormonth and exspanionist Lothendian
