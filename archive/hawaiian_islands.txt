The [b]Hawaiian Islands[/b] are an archipelago of eight major volcanic islands, several atolls, and numerous smaller islets in the North Pacific Ocean, extending some 1,500 miles from the island of Hawai&amp;#699;i in the south to northernmost Kure Atoll.

The archipelago sits on the Pacific Plate. The islands are exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the Hawaiian&#150;Emperor seamount chain, formed by volcanic activity over the Hawaiian hotspot. The islands are about 1,860 miles from the nearest continent and are part of the Polynesia subregion of Oceania. &#151;Wikipedia [hr]
