The FFC is a newly emerging region where free and liberal nations may enter and help spread freedom to the rest of the world...by force if necessary. Feel free to join, Roleplay will be available if more players join, otherwise feel free to just chat with other members. Allons-y! 

The FCC was founded in 2015 when the two expanded nations of the Federation of the New Australian Commomwealth and the Republic of developed Hellenic Elatha combined forces to spread freedom to the rest of the world, ending all dictatorships and authoritarian states throughout the world.
