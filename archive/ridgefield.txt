Ridgefield, a land of great history. Abandoned by it&amp;#39;s creator and resurrected to serve the former inhabitants, only to be thrust into war with it&amp;#39;s original creator- determined to conquer again yet met with failed diplomacy and no consensus was met.

Feeling the truth, the wrath, the desire... Ridgefield was once again allowed to be the reality of the dreams The First held within.

For three hundred days and three hundred nights, the Void shrouded Ridgefield whilst it waited for The First to reclaim his history, yet to no avail. And thus, The Second returned again, to adopt the mantle of Ridgefield as it&amp;#39;s Protector and it&amp;#39;s Guardian.
