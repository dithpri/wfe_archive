Tucked behind a mountainous barricade that seems specifically designed to say &quot;go away,&quot; Coldwood is a largely forgotten slice of the world blanketed in snow, spruce, and suspicion. It&#146;s an enormous region of sparse, whispering forests, bone-chilling wind, and the occasional city-state that somehow figured out how to get Wi-Fi despite being closer to the Arctic than most polar bears. The entire place looks like it was left out of every map on purpose&#151;and probably for good reason.
