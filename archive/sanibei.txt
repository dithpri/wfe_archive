Welcome to [region]Sanibei[/region], where we welcome anyone with open arms! We are a community that gives no discrimination to anyone, regardless of opinions of politics, ethnicity, or religious beliefs. We hope you find our community open and we hope that you join us. We are currently putting together the government that has been laid out in our Constitution, so if you would like to hold a government office in Sanibei, then all you have to do is be a WA member and move here. We will assess whether you will be a good officer or not, and will tell you what we think you would be good as! Tell your friends and soon we will have a large and fast-growing community!
