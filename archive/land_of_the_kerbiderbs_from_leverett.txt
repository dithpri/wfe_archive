On October 21st, 2015, The Land of the Kerbiderbs from Leverett was created, and immediately sent a request to Kerbiderb for ratification. Kerbiderb then joined and the two of them have been ruling peacefully over the land ever since.

The Land of Kerbiderbs from Leverett is utterly devoted to complete democracy and equality for all its citizens. Even we the founders are not cemented in stone and can give the privilege to other nations if asked to by the democratic process. You will never feel left out or stuck in a rut, and if, by some very unlikely, chance, you do, there will be many ways to become more influential in the region.

We hope you join our region, and if you are already here, we hope you enjoy!
