Welcome to The Republic of Sovereign Nation-States!
We welcome all Nations that seek refuge from the dullness of life elsewhere!
As this is a republic, there shall be one Senate. Four Senators shall be chosen at random approximately every month. [b]If one person has more than one nation, only one such nation will be given the status of Senator.[/b] This means that you will be able to exercise control over polls. However, as only one poll can run at one time, [b]any Senate nation who deletes the poll of another nation will be ejected and banned from this region.[/b]
