The Independent Free Trade Association, or IFTA, is a regional trade organization and free trade area. It serves to unite member nations into a single market, entailing the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, while maintaining a national independence and sovereignty among member states that does not involve mercantilism and protectionism. The organization of the IFTA is extremely decentralized and all administrative roles are semi-honorary, only connoting certain managerial duties and limited authority.
