The Independent Free Trade Association, or IFTA, is a regional trade organization and free trade area. It serves to unite member nations into a single market, entailing the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, while maintaining a national independence and sovereignty among member states that does not involve mercantilism, protectionism, and other forms of economic nationalism. The organization of the IFTA is extremely decentralized and all administrative roles are semi-honorary, only connoting certain managerial duties and limited authority.
