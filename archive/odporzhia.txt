King Alexander III ruled Czervenia as a unitary state until the end of World War I, when the region splintered into the smaller independent states. The republic of Czervenia, the Kingdom of Grakozhia, the Democratic Republic of the Ostregals, the republic of Nordazhia, the republic of Bojatzhia and the Kingdom of Sjevzhia are commonly known as the Odporzhia region. 
In the late 80s, the RDO and Grakozhia discovered petroleum and gas resources in the Grakozhia Sea and caused a surge in the regional economies. Czervenia and its neighboring country Nordazhia developed their mineral resources along their common border in the Dymejo Bizelih range.
