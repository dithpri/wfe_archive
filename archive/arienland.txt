Arienland is an association of states that are united by similar political ideologies. This union was formed to spread our Idea, to strengthen the military power of our countries and economic relations. 
If anyone attacks any of our states, let him be prepared to feel our common strength.
Our states have different cultures and traditions, different peoples, and we recognize their identities. But now we are united by the similarity of ideologies, ideologies that are most natural to our people. 
We deny democracy. We are ready to fight anything that might hinder the prosperity of our nations.
If you are close to right-wing ideas, are authoritarian, and do not support left-wing, liberal, or other hostile currents, then you can join this alliance.
