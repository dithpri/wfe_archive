The Southwest of Aladia spans a region of great plains and towering mountains. Since time inmemorial it has been the home of numerous peoples and nations. It has a population of 205 million people, most of whom live near the shore or close to the many great navigable rivers of the continent. 
It&#39;s also a region of great diversity in cultures, languages, religions and society. 
While historically Aladia has been the ground for many brutal wars, now the continent is mostly at peace.
