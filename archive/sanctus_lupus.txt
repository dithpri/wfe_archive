     Welcome to the region of the Holy Wolf! The land is lush with life and resources. Most abundant with its population of the Sanctus Lupus, the Holy Wolf, a rare species of the wolf, all born with a cross on their foreheads, giving this region its name.

   The currency are Lupus Nummos, or Wolf Coins, called Lummos for short. The regional language is English, mixed with Scandinavian. The regional animal of course is the Sanctus Lupus. The government is mainly democratic with three parties: Archopiren, the Fergonith, and the Bauthrion. When you first join, I will ask you which party of these three you mostly are, (I&amp;#39;ll explain them), and then I will categorize you in here.
