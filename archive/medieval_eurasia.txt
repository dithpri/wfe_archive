[i]&#147;I attacked the English of the Northern Shires like a lion. I ordered their houses and corn, with all their belongings, to be burnt without exception and large herds of cattle and beasts of burden to be destroyed wherever they were found. It was there I took revenge on masses of people by subjecting them to a cruel famine; and by doing so &#151; alas!&#151; I became the murderer of many thousands of that fine race.&#148;[/i]  [b]&#151;&amp;#8201;William the Conqueror[/b]
