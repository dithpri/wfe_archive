[list][i]Whispers cry out in the dark... honor... glory... the Roman Empire shall arise from the ashes once more, as it did so many years ago. 
Laying the ideals of our Roman forefathers as a foundation, we wish to rebuild this great Empire to become a name that strikes fear in the hearts of all those who oppose us, 
and a safe haven for all those who seek a refuge in this Empire. [/i][/list]
