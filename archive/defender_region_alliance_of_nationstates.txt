[b] [color=Darkblue]This is DRANS, a defender alliance that was in effect during summer 2014. Although it was a failure, those who served for the alliance demonstrated true enthusiasm, courage, cooperation, and pride. DRANS will be preserved as a remembrance of its service and for possible future use.
