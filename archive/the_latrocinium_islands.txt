        The Latrocinium Islands are a group of islands in which there are many close-together islands in clusters, with medium-sized space between the islands. One can usually see the closest cluster from the edge of their own. Most islands have lush rain forests, the weather is almost always cool and feels good on the skin, the air almost always has at least a touch of humidity, and a thick mist in the morning that thins toward noon and thickens again in the evening is common. The weather only changes about 10 degrees all throughout the year.
