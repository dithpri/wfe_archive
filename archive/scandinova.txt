The world of Scandinova boasts cultural and ideological diversity, but how it came into existence is still debated. Millions of years ago, vast desolate deserts and volatile volcanic ranges suddenly gave way to swathes of lush green forests booming with biological diversity with no logical explanations as to how and why.
