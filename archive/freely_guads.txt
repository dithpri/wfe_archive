[b][i][u][Color=Blue]Welcome to [region]Freely Guads[/region]![/color][/u][/i][/b]

I, [nation]Guadilten[/nation], have made a nation, named [nation]Freely Guads Frontier[/nation]. I have been making all the changes with this account for the pass year. So, while I&#39;ll still run FG, FGF ([nation]Freely Guads Frontier[/nation]) will make all the dispatches, tags, Embassies, etc. He&#39;ll be cleaning up this region. It&#39;s been very disorganized lately, so It&#39;ll clean up the place, so I don&#39;t have to. It&#39;ll be making changes like sorting festivals, making a master dispatch, cleaning up are Embassies, etc.

If you would like to make a dispatch or add a embassy, you&#39;ll have to notify me or FGF. If not, you&#39;ll be punished. I&#39;m trying to keep this place uncluttered. So please do a favor and not make this hard on me.
