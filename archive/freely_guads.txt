[b]Welcome to [region]Freely Guads[/region]![/b]
Where we are, you are! We have MANY, and I mean MANY options on what to do!
For example, you could work for the National Politics Committee (NPC), you could be a Freely Guads News Reporter (FGN), etc.
If you want to work at the NPC, talk to [nation]Ryderville Islands[/nation]. If you want to work at the FGN, talk to [nation]Guadilten[/nation] or [nation]Saybentopia[/nation].
You could also be the general of the FGM. Talk to [nation]Guadilten[/nation] about it.

Endorse [nation]Guadilten[/nation] so he can become the WA Delegate of FG.
But you need to become a WA member to do so. So go do it already!

Listen to the NationStates Anthem!
