Crags and mossy canyons tear scars through the hilly landscape while cold water fyrds fill the deepest of the canyons. In the south the lands smooth into easily farmable rolling hills while the east relies on many sheltered ports to build an economy on trade. The western cliffs provide strong, secure, and mineral rich fortresses where fishing accounts for a fair part of the sustenance. In the north, migratory animals and dramatic changes in weather dictate life week to week.
