[color=gold]The Primeval Realm stands tall for all eternity, no matter what.
We rebuild, we will rise form the ashes over and over.[/color]

&quot;We are free because we know that we alone are morally responsible for everything we do. We are free, no matter what rules surround us. If we find them tolerable, we tolerate them; if we find them too obnoxious, we break them. We are free because we know that we alone are morally responsible for everything we do.&quot;
