A region for democratic socialists, anarchists and other left-wing nations and communes.

[i]&amp;quot;Enlightenment is man&#146;s leaving his self-caused immaturity. Immaturity is the incapacity to use one&amp;#39;s intelligence without the guidance of another.&amp;quot; -Immanuel Kant[/i]

We are committed to flourishment of all sentient beings, through means of social justice, healthy environment, education and strong democracy. We oppose violence, religion-based ethics and authoritarianism. 

We welcome all nations regardless of ethnic or religious backgrounds.
