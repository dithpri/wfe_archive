We simply exist as a home for all, so long as you know the code, which may or may not be Spoon.
Founded by the nations of Clovio and Stanleyvile in the ruins of Yeeton, the Ripdict Peninsula is home to many creatures and plants and people, most of which you will never encounter or at least, hope you never encounter.

God-Empress Juniper of Clovio and Supreme Leader Stanley of Stanleyvile welcome all new members with open arms.
