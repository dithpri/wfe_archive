[color=DC143C][i]Ave Imperator[/i], and welcome to the [b]Jupiter Pact[/b]! A newly born alliance of empires and kingdoms terrestrial and extraterrestrial, this accord is dedicated to the preservation of each member state&#146;s economic and colonial interests as well as mutual defense in war and peace. We welcome any and all nations and monarchs who would readily defend their Crowns and their People from those who would see progress crushed under the heels of Fascism, Communism, and their foul ilk.

This is a purely monarchist region. There will be no non-monarchist nations within the Jupiter Pact, and member states may not attack or otherwise violate the sovereignty of another member. With that said, may your reign be long and prosperous, Imperator! All Hail The Tsarina.[/color]
