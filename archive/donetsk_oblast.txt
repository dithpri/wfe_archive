The Donetsk Oblast, also referred to as Donechyna, is an oblast (province) of eastern Ukraine. It is the most populated oblast, with around 4.1 million residents. Its administrative center is Donetsk; however, its Regional State Administration has been temporarily relocated to Kramatorsk because of the ongoing crisis in Donetsk. Historically, the region is an important part of the Donbas region. Until November 1961, it bore the name Stalino Oblast as Donetsk was then named &quot;Stalino&quot;, in honor of Joseph Stalin. As part of the de-Stalinization process, it was renamed as its administrative center after Siversky Donets, the main artery of Eastern Ukraine. Population is estimated as 4,131,808 (2020 est.)
