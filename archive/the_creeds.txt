[b][region]Lone Wolves United[/region] has rolled a natural 20 and arrive in your region, mopping up the few goblins that dare to pursue our band of heroes. Having defended the locals from the goblin threat our heroes retire to the local tavern where the locals revel in the tales of their previous deeds and share in the good word of the wolfist creed that protects them wherever they go.
