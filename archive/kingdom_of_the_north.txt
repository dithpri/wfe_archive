The north is one of the constituent regions of Westeros and was a sovereign nation ruled by Kings in the North before Aegon&#39;s Conquest. The largest region of the Seven Kingdoms, the dominion of House Stark extends from the border of the New Gift, which is controlled by the Night&#39;s Watch, to the southern edge of the Neck far to the south.

The north has been ruled by the Starks for thousands of years from the castle known as Winterfell.
