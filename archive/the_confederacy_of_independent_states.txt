The Confederacy of Independent Republics was founded by the Armed Republic of Lomda to protect the freedoms, sovereignty, and property of its nations. Many of these nations were part of the Holy Imperium, which collapsed after the amazing Adam Lynn Janes challenged the Holy Meet Patel. Adam, with his rock hard abs slayed Meet Patel. This region is home to the refugees that managed to escape Adam Lynn Janes.
