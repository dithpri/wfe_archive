The Confederacy of Independent States was founded by the Armed Republic of Lomda as a refugee region. This region is home to many former nations of the fallen Holy Imperium. The Holy Imperium was founded by the holy, gracious Meet Patel. Adam Lynn Janes, after many years of the thriving region, challenged Meet Patel to a duel. Adam overpowered Meet Patel with his rock hard abs, and Meet Patel was slained. Lomda now protects the freedoms of the refugees that have fled from the powerful Adam Lynn Janes.
