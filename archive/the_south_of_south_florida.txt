&amp;quot;The South of South Florida is open to anyone. We welcome any nation regardless of type of government. However, strong economies are encouraged over social or political freedoms. I will work to make sure that all are equitably represented within the region and will monitor the WA Delegate to make sure that he does not abuse his power.&amp;quot; - [nation]The Nash Kingdom[/nation], founder

&amp;quot;Also be sure to sign up for the WA. This will allow us to choose our administrator instead of it randomly choosing. Also, 1 or 2 puppets (extra nations) are also allowed to join the region. Keep in mind still that the NationStates rules allow only one nation to be in the WA at a time.&amp;quot; - [nation]Caek of the Wolfen[/nation], current WA delegate
