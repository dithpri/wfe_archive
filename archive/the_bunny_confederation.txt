This body was created to simplify relations between three sovereign states populated by bunnies: Peaceful rabbits, The United Bunny States, and Leporidaeland. Peaceful rabbits ceased to exist, so its occupants moved to other states in the Bunny Confederation and assimilated seamlessly. A year later, nanobunnies (bunnies whose most appropriate unit of measurement for their height is the nanometer) appeared in the the Bunny Confederation. They, too, assimilated seamlessly into the Bunny Confederation.
