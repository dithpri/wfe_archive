A haunting, dark region,with plains covered in ash, and hills with burnt remains, evidence of what once was something. Through the central valley, surrounded by the black mountain range, runs an ominous river, with it&#39;s water transparent scarlet.

Yet the Ashlands aren&#39;t nearly as dead as it might seem. 

Through the foot of the mountains a massive, endemic lush forest sprawls, with it&#39;s trees light gray with striking crimson leaves, decorating the forest floor occupied by spider lilies. Hidden by the mountainous on the northeast coast lies the isolated hermit valley, best known for it&#39;s seemingly endless fields of roses.
