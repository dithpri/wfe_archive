[i]A silver reflection upon blue glass, The Ashlands stands as the embodiment of the esoteric Moon and its ethereal Maiden, the manifestation of an immemorial legacy. 

Being the testimony of the true liberty of sovereignty, prosperity and racial purity, the Ashlands shall relentlessly guard this ethereal dream of the Lunar Princess. [/i]
