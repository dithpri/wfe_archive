Welcome to the Ashlands, a vast region spanning from the Bering Sea to the North Pacific Ocean.

Establlished through the [i]Treaty of Lepus[/i], we recognize the absolute sovereign rights of nations to forge their own destinies through cultivating ethnic, cultural and economical harmony for their peoples. We, proudly and unconditionally, condemn and reject communism, miscegenation and cosmopolitanism in all shapes and forms.
