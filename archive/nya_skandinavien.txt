 Hi! I am Veastra Gaetaland, the leader of Nya Skandinavien. We are a group of nordic countries that work together for everyone&#39;s best. If we didn&#39;t we would just be barbarians. By uniting and fighting against our natural instincts to wage war upon those who disagrees with our beliefs, we can and will grow stronger than ever. Everyone here in Nya Skandinavien, welcomes you to our glorious region. As long as you are nice to others you can say and talk about whatever you like. 
 Yours sincerely, Veastra Gaetaland. (P.S. you can only speak English and/or Swedish, Finnish or Norwegian here.)
