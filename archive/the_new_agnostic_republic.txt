The New Agnostic Dominion (TNAR) is a peaceful region where nations help each other thrive, not needing the help of higher powers, or religion. TNAR likes to focus on the needs of it&amp;#39;s people, instead of the needs of businesses. We like our people to have many personal freedoms, without infringing on others&amp;#39; freedoms.
