Hello and welcome to Zentari!

Founded by [nation]Krukan[/nation], Zentari provides a safe haven for anyone willing to come. We are a general discussion region although, we have a forum for RPing (needs to be upgraded) and a Discord for all to join. No matter the beliefs held by a nation; whether political, philosophical, or religious, all nations&#146; ideologies are welcomed, working together to achieve a common goal: a place called home. 

Come and join today, and be a part of Zentari.

All resident nations are encouraged to join the World Assembly and to endorse [nation]Thermodolia[/nation] as delegate.
