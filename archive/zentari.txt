[B][color=red]WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE&amp;#39;S REPUBLIC OF ZENTARI![/color]

Some weeks ago, a first uprising of the exploited masses of Zentari was covered in bloodshed by the capitalist oppressors, and the revolutionary people&amp;#39;s government was forced to go into exile. But the Zentari Liberation Front came back, better organized than ever and ready to die. 

The second uprising was victorious, the masses could finally take back the power. A revolutionary government is to be put in place soon. The oppressors and their henchmen will be sent to reeducation camps.

We ask all socialist brother and sister regions to send in International Brigades in order to defend the Zentarian Revolution.

[color=red]Socialism or Death!

Long live the People&amp;#39;s Republic of Zentari![/color][/B]
