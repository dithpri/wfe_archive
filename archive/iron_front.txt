Appalled by the growing threat of extremist ideologies such as fascism and communism in the Nationstates Multiverse, the Iron Front serves as a true force for freedom and democracy to prevail. The mission of Iron Front is to efficiently and effectively curb the spread of both fascism and communism, and end oppression altogether. We will bring freedom and democracy to the Nationstates universe.

The Iron Front is an inclusive region welcoming all political ideologies, including conservatism, liberalism, leftism, democratic socialism, civic nationalism, and more as long as they are not versions of communism or fascism, and promote democracy.
