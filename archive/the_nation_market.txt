&amp;quot;We are absolutely disgusted by the practice of nation trading, a despicable practice where leaders sell out their nation&amp;#39;s sovereignty to another with their peoples treated as commodities. 

We needed to bide our time and today we achieved a great victory as The Nation Market has been refounded. May this be a signal to against all leaders who abrogate their duties to their residents.&amp;quot;
