Hello strangers, welcome to the nation market, a place where nations are traded or swapped. Any nation marked with a &amp;quot;For sale,&amp;quot; motto are for sell by me. 

The exchange I do is based on population. An older nation with a higher population is worth more than a newer nation, so 2 or more newer nations must add up to around the population of the older nation.

Anyone is also free to sell nations on their own, I just ask that you use the motto &amp;quot;For sale by owner.&amp;quot;

Seems the mods left a message saying this is a bad idea. I think everyone understand the risks and realizes stealing nations is against the rules. Also, since I am still here, I also take it that this is in fact legal. Thanks for the recommendation.
