Founded on April 15th

The United Entente was formed with the express purpose of combining nations of different beliefs and government statuses together in the attempt of providing a national sense of security and wealth.

All nations are welcome, no matter how different or extreme your government is. Our only request is that you don&amp;#39;t cause any trouble directed towards our region.

Any Nation wishing to join must contact [nation=mascargo]
