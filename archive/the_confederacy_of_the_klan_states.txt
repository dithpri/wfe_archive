[b] [u] Brothers and Sisters of True America Unite under the righteous banner of God![/b] [/u]

[i] The Confederacy has arisen, with the mantle of the Klan draped over it. With God at our backs I compel you to stand with me, for your god granted rights and shun those who would seek to deny you those aforesaid rights. Communist, Socialist, Anarchist... We are not white supremacists, we&#39;re civil rights activists concerned about European-American rights. [/i]
