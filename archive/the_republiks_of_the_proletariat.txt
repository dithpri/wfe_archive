This is a region for states and nations whose working class are the ones whom control the governments and means of production. The economy is focused on the benefit of communities and society, not profit. From each according to their ability, to those according to their need. This means those able to work do so for the benefit of their community and society, and those that need help the most are taken care of with priority. Governance and economics do not go hand in hand, and civil liberties and the personal wellbeing of the workers should take precedent, even if it requires an autocrat or a vanguard party to bring it about. In the end, the workers, who own their workplaces, should also be the ones governing themselves.
