The United Communist Republics (TUCR) is a slightly radical region full of Liberals, Socialists and of course Communists. Our supreme executive (Lenin, Stalin and Fidel Castro) protect our region from capitalist scum and their satanic gods (Donald Trump and Theresa May). Hope you enjoy and good look with your nations.
