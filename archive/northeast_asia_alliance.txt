Founded by the People&amp;#39;s Republic of Saikhangazar. The Alliance of Northeast Asia is made up primarily of the northern countries of Saikhangazar, Chukotka, Kamchatka, Goryo and the Far East Khanate.

The alliance generally supports left-wing style democracies (as it was founded by a &amp;#39;people&amp;#39;s republic&amp;#39;), and is of course open to any who wish to join.
