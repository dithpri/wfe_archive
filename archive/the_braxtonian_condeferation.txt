The Braxtonian Confederdation believes in the unwavering, absolute, authoritarian leadership of despots as they race to find the most efficient ways to tear down personal freedom and civil liberties. It is the responsibility of this Confederation to spread this supreme ideology as far as possible through the use of unmatched power and force if necessary. We are a collection of socialist, communist, and former capitalist nations. 
We will rise from the ashes of oppression in the name of our God, Braxton!!!
