Right Honourable [nation]Northern Erli Island[/nation],

I would like to thank you for your [color=gold]exceptional service[/color] on behalf of the [region]Turkic Union[/region].
This Union had experienced peace, stability, and, most importantly, [b]security[/b] under your leadership. Residents will never forget how quickly you reacted to all sorts of raids and how [b]many raids you have prevented by always staying alert and warning me[/b]. You have also designed the most beautiful and very first of its kind flag of the Union that now makes us recognizable throughout both real and virtual worlds.
Your responsibility and loyalty to the interests of the Union made us United and Strong, yet it also brought life and the degree of action our regions hasn&#39;t seen in a while.
