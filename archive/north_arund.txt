This region is occupied by the species known as the Aramathi. The land is known as North America to nations in the East. Humans have occupied the land before explorers found the land, but they were driven to South Arund by the Aramathians.

The land is cold and snowy in the north, and grassy with many trees in the south. The native species there are highly resistant to the cold, and are extremely religious.
