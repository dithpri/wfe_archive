Aryanised Scandinavia is now under the administration of the [b][i]People&amp;#39;s Republic of [region]Eurasia[/region].[/b][/i]

It has been confiscated, cleansed of ignorant bile and hate, and now stands as a centre of understanding, acceptance and equality. Never should shelter be provided to the remnants of a bygone era, nor should those who would deny the rights of others be granted any accommodation.
