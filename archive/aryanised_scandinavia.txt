This region has been confiscated, cleansed of ignorance and hate, and now stands as a centre of enlightenment, understanding and acceptance. No accommodation for the bigots, no acceptance to those who would deny the rights of those they view as sub-human, no shelter to the remnants of a bygone era. The progress we&amp;#39;ve made must continue, regression is not an option!
