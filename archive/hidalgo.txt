Welcome to [color=gold]Hidalgo[/color], an experienced region home to those who approve of regulated democracy and a proud liberal community. In this region invaders are punished to the extremity of the law. We here in Hidalgo believe in manifest destiny and feel it is within our rights to take hold of regions that don&amp;#39;t promote our ideal liberal values. We believe in bringing peace to unbalanced regions whether it be by peaceful or forceful means.

We have many positions available. If you&amp;#39;re interested in any positions of importance and responsibility please message [color=blue] Mcallenton[/color] for more information.
