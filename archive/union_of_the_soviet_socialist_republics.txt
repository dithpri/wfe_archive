This region is for all democratic socialist &amp;amp; communist republics.

The Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics is a Marxist - Leninist state dedicated to freeing the oppressed workers of the world through communist revolution.

We as a republic can decide we&amp;#39;re to take this region, to the top or be overrun by fascist. 

When there is 15 republics in the region election will be held and I will accept who the people want as a WAD.
