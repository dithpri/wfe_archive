The Greater Region (French: Grande R&eacute;gion, German: Gro&szlig;region, Luxembourgish: Groussregioun) is the area of Saarland, Lorraine, Luxembourg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Wallonia and the rest of the French Community of Belgium, and the German-speaking Community of Belgium.[1] It is not identical with the SaarLorLux Euroregion, despite being in the same territory.[citation needed]

The Greater Region is divided between Romance and Germanic languages and also forms the hub for transport in Europe. It has an urban, rural (Ardennes-Eifel-Rheinhessen) and industrial fabric which is the source of rich and ongoing economic and cultural relations.
