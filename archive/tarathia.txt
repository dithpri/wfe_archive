Tarathia is a sprawling region located on multi-fractal Earth and home to the metropolitan areas of the Taraskovyan Empire. 

It is also home to the Federation of Technocratic Republics, the Tresthyrien Empire and the Kingdom of Dennholm.

Of course, players often just forget to log into their nations.

Newcomers may poke Tarasovka for requests to get on the map and the player behind Tarasovka will try to do his best to amend the map. But as he&amp;#39;s quite busy, bear with him!
