Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I&#39;d like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I&#39;ll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin&#39; out maxin&#39; relaxin&#39; all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, &quot;You&#39;re movin&#39; with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.&quot;

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, &quot;I might as well kick it.&quot;
