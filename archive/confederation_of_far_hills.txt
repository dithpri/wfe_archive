Founded after civil unrest in the Oakwood region.

Freedom and Democracy can only be achieved without tyranny whether it be conducted by the majority or not. We accept all ideologies (EXCEPT SOCIALISM).

Since we are not technically at war with Oakwood and many recognize us as independent so we are hereby separate from Oakwood. At least until we are raided. That is.

Hail to the new confederation.
We are currently at war with Oakwood (not our fault)
