lalgor, a planet surounded by a nebula. with multiple asteroids in the nebula, lalgor is hard to find, making it a hard place to find. But under the crust,( which vary from 1 to 20 miles thick in certain areas.) is water, and lot&#39;s of ore. iron, gold, plutonium, you name it! it makes lalgor a perfect place for industrialisation

 the surface of lalgor it very dry, except for certain areas where the crust gave way and makes large oasis. So,we use ships and speeder&#39;s to move from one mine/factory to another.
