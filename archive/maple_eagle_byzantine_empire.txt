Hello! We are a revival of an old group, and we are trying to reach out to the old members to join, but we would like new members as well. We are going to be a gaming group. At the moment we are on NationStates, but we plan to expand to other games in the future. Our goal is to have as much fun on these games as possible, and we will also try to think of new creative ways to do so. If you aren&#39;t sure about joining, you can still join the Discord; we welcome everyone, so please do: https://discord.gg/kRtP9p5. Have fun!
