The Crimson-Moon Coalition once thrived under the peaceful rule of divine angels, with cities basking in the soft glow of the moon. Harmony between mortals and celestial beings was the norm, a time of serenity and grace.

Now, the Crimson-Moon Coalition rises from the chaos, driven by vengeance and the hunger for power, seeking to reshape the world in a brutal new image.
