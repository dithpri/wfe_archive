[colour=#002699]Welcome to the New United Galactic Kingdoms![/colour] 

[hr]
Let me point out a few things first.
The Region&#39;s name is outdated but since the Region is old, I&#39;m not going to create a new one. The Region was named before the official name of Ebrilond became the [b]New United Galactic Kingdoms[/b].

The New United Galactic Kingdoms are a constantly expanding force within the Ebriverse and are the lead nation of the UNCIB (United Nations Council of Infinity and Beyond). While the country consists of many races and humans are a delicacy, we have no intentions on taking over planet Earth. [strike]AT LEAST NOT YET HAHA[/strike]
