It has been approximately 14.000 to 14.000.000.000 years since the Great Theocalypse, and the so-called &amp;#39;big bang&amp;#39; that followed. The Asur are dead. The Neochorite threat has been mostly eliminated. The Saurai Empire, although in tatters, still occasionally wields uninmaginable power. The Imperitum Sancti vies for power, but is held back by the unorganised loose cannons of the Karnod. The time of great...[i]change[/i] is almost upon us. There are many chances to be had, and everything to lose.
