The Rakhoutenstad treaty, was signed in 1999 by Nieuw StenenLand and the nations of Zelenostrova, Great New West Wessex, Goudvallei, and Nova Bragia. New Dovera is usually included, due to the uncertainty of its sovereignty, resulting in it often being considered a territory of Nieuw StenenLand. Amanakihikina has been a member nation since 2001.
The treaty was signed after the formation of Nieuw StenenLand, to reduce the tyrannical power of GNWW, and connect the four nations, for mutual protection and economic benefit.
The member nations of the treaty also elect the treaty council, which oversees relations within and outside of the treaty, and oversees the Zelenastrova Defence Force.
