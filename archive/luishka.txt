Luishka is a highly advanced region. The people the region are known as Luishkans, who are highly independent people, self-sufficient upon reaching their adulthood at ten years of age. Luishkans are primarily recognizable by the jewels, called &amp;quot;Elara&amp;quot;, worn on their foreheads. These Elara enable them to communicate through artificial telepathy with others, and they also serve as a means of illuminating dark areas.
