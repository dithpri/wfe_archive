[b]Hello, and welcome to Beta Decay![/b]
We are - er, I am - a [b][color=cc0000]brand[/color]-[color=cc6600]spankin&#39;[/color]-[color=66cc00]new[/color][/b] region, named after a kind of nuclear decay where a neutron in the nucleus of an atom splits into a proton and an electron, and the electron is ejected from the atom as a beta particle! 

Join as you like. [nation=short]Quatroshivier[/nation] doesn&#39;t care who comes here. Just don&#39;t be a jerk and you can stay. [b]Electrons will be ejected.[/b] If you want a position as Regional Officer, just ask.

We are (mostly) neutral in the whole R/D thing. As long as you don&#39;t attack/harm any embassy regions, you may come and go as you please.
