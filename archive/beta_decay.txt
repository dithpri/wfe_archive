[b]Hello, and welcome to Beta Decay![/b]
We are a [b][color=cc6600]brand[/color]-[color=66cc00]new[/color][/b] region, named after a kind of nuclear decay where a neutron in the nucleus of an atom splits into a proton and an electron, and the electron is ejected from the atom as a beta particle! 

Join as you like. We doesn&#39;t care who comes here. Just don&#39;t be a jerk and you can stay. [b]Electrons will be ejected.[/b] If you want a position as Regional Officer, just ask.

We are (mostly) neutral in the whole R/D thing. As long as you don&#39;t attack/harm any embassy regions, you may come and go as you please.

[B][color=194c90]The song of the day is [/color][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NycwOFr5AB8][color=cc0000]Xenocide by Seamless, None Like Joshua, and Boyinaband.[/color][/url][color=194c90] It&#39;s about alien invasion. This region does not endorse xenocide. Also, lyrics and Boyinaband&#39;s face at 1:19 are kinda creepy.[/color][/B]
