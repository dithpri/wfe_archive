If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, 
Or walk with Kings --- nor lose the common touch, 
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, 
If all men count with you, but none too much; 
Yours is the home of the fearless and everything that&amp;#39;s in it,  And --- which is more --- you&amp;#39;ll be a man, my son.
