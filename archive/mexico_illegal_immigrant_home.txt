Foo, we&#39;re illegal and don&#39;t like Migra (ICE). But, in our free time, we drink chelitas (Beer) and you are always welcome to join us. As long as you don&#39;t call ice. So just stay in our illegal immigrant house. So far, no one has turned us in, so plz keep it that way. Or, we will burn you like we burn goat. You can also say as much messages, as long as they are not racist. We banject the racist people, and that would be humiliating to be banjected from a frontier.
