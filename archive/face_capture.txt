And who are you, that proud Phyrexian said,
That I must bow so low?
Only a symbol of a different shape, that&amp;#39;s all the truth I know.
A phi of black or a blade of gold, the Legion you shall meet,
Their plates are hard as bone, my Righteous Caliph,
And you&amp;#39;re still [i]incompleat[/i]
And so he spoke, and so he spoke,
That Cenobite of Phyrexia,
But now the rain weeps o&amp;#39;er his nation
With no one there to hear.
Yes, now the rain weeps oe&amp;#39;r his nation,
And not a soul to hear.
