&amp;quot;Only those who possess the zeal to seize power from their lessers are worthy to wield the full might of Phyrexia.&amp;quot; 
&#151;Sheoldred, Whispering One

Let the [i]incompleat[/i] prognosticate
Concerning the colony of Phyrexia&amp;#39;s fate
We think ourselves to be as seers
That gazeth from beneath the spheres
Our sight goes beyond
The depth of a pond
Or rivers in the greatest rain
Whereby we can tell
That all will be well
When Phyrexia enjoys its own again
Yes, this we can tell
That all will be well
When Phyrexia enjoys its own again
