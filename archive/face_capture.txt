Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workingmen of all countries, unite!

All worthy find equality under Allah ~Mohammad

Beasts of Allahngrad, Beasts of Face Capture,
Beasts of every land and clime,
Hearken to my joyful tidings
Of the Golden future time.
Bright will shine the fields of Face Capture,
Purer shall its waters be,
Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes
On the day that sets us free.
