&amp;quot;Only those who possess the zeal to seize power from their lessers are worthy to wield the full might of Phyrexia.&amp;quot; 
&#151;Sheoldred, Whispering One

Well, you&amp;#39;re walkin&amp;#39; through a city street, wandering without a clue
And you hear a distant calling and you know it&amp;#39;s meant for you
Then you drop what you were doing and you start your [i]compleation[/i]
And before you know what&amp;#39;s happn&amp;#39;n here, you join Phyrexia

They&amp;#39;ve got some in Chirichella, they&amp;#39;ve got some in Basaran too
They got more of it in Allahngrad and a bit in the water blue
So whether you swim or walk about you&amp;#39;ll always get to toil
&amp;#39;Cause wherever you go in Avathar you&amp;#39;ll find Phyrexian oil
