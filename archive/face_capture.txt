&amp;quot;One can only earn their own happiness using their own hands.&amp;quot; 
&#151;Catislon, his Catness 

Well, you&amp;#39;re walkin&amp;#39; through a city street, wandering without a clue
And you hear a distant calling and you know it&amp;#39;s meant for you
Then you drop what you were doing and you start your [i]compleation[/i]
And before you know what&amp;#39;s happn&amp;#39;n here, you join Nyanlania

They&amp;#39;ve got some in Chirichella, they&amp;#39;ve got some in Basaran too
They got more of it in Allahngrad and you might not know what to do
So whether you prance or walk about you&amp;#39;ll always get yourself a mat
&amp;#39;Cause wherever you go in Avathar you&amp;#39;ll find A Nyanlanian cat.
