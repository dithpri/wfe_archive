&amp;quot;Only those who possess the zeal to seize power from their lessers are worthy to wield the full might of Phyrexia.&amp;quot; 
&#151;Sheoldred, Whispering One

Imagine
The first man
Who held a stick in rough hands
And drew lines on a cold stone wall
Imagine when the others looked
When they said, I see the antelope
I see it. 
 
Now we look backwards
At the ones who came before us
Who lived, and swiftly died. 
The first man&amp;#39;s flesh is in all of us now
And for his and his children&amp;#39;s sake
We imagine a world with no more death
And we see ourselves reflected
In the metallic eyes
Of our final creation
