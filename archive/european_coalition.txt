The European Coalition is a loosely tied together region of democratic, centrist nations that vie for independence, and fellowship.

The following regional positions are available to those who would have them:
- Poll Master
- Minister of Embassies
- General of Communications

The &amp;#39;Elected Executive&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Grand Designer of Appearance&amp;#39;, and &amp;#39;Officer of Border Control&amp;#39; positions will be in the hands of the Founder until such a time that the European Coalition is self-sustained and prosperous.

As always, The European Coalition will seek out individuals who they deem to be of interest to join our ranks. 
Mass messaging is not our style, and never will be.
