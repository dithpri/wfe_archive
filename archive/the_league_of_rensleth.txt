A loose confederation of fluctuating states, the League admits nations dotted sporadically around the world that meet &#39;certain governmental and political criteria&#39; into their ranks.

Guided ably by the Tsar of Rislavia and the initial signatories of the Treaty of Rensleth, the League de facto is little more than a mutual non aggression pact that serves to guarantee the &#39;independence of form of governance to all sovereign member nations&#39;.

The increasing diversity of member states has lead the League to pass a broad, general reform that is embracing of the World Assembly and more willing to move with the globalization of the  world, though tensions exist over how far these liberal reforms to the League&#39;s original constitution should go.
