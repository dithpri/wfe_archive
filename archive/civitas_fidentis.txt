Civitas Fidentis is committed to preserving the world&amp;#39;s natural beauty and reminding the masses that nearly all humans are inherently evil and thus, for the greater good, should not be granted political freedoms and must be educated well in order to counter this evil.  Its leadership has a strong isolationist policy, whereby it actively chooses not to get involved in human affairs outside of its borders.
