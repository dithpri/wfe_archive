The Northern Alliance States were created in 1946 after WWII to ensure peace in Scandinavia.
But after twenty years the NAS got more aggressive. In 1972 the NA declared war on the USSR.
1984: the USSR lost Latvia to the NA but strikes back, 13.589 casualties.
2000: Peace, the treaty of Berlin.
2013: The NA declares war to the US.
2014: France and Russia declare war on the NAS.
2015: Poland, Ukraine and Iceland leave the NAS.
          The NAS lost.

We&amp;#39;re now looking for new states to join us so we can take over what is rightfully ours!
