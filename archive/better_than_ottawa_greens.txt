[b][color=green] TO THE MEMBERS:[/b][/color] On the Regional Message Board or in person please tell the WA Delegate or Rex what we can do for you. Get NS++ -&amp;gt; http://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;amp;t=269464 and also join the WA. [b]Ummm[/b]. Rex sent out a message where you can cast your vote to see if you would like to create an embassy with the original Ottawa Greens. Please look at this google doc --&amp;gt; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pg2jTGQExOu9EiXjq0g_spTe3bIUYnUQM0n1OaDohPc for our regional laws. If you disagree please tell me which one!
