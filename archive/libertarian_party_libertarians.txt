This region is open for everyone, but intended as a place for those whose ideals are libertarian as defined by the U.S. [url=http://www.lp.org/platform]Libertarian Party[/url].  We also hope all players who join our region will also join the World Assembly or WA so we can have a positive/libertarian influence on the Nation States world.   Please also take a moment to read the [url=http://www.nationstates.net/nation=laws_of_libertarian_party_libertarians/detail=factbook/id=main]Libertarian Party libertarians Constitution[/url] to learn more about or region.  We hope you like who and what we are, and we hope you join us as well.
