[Color=orange]A kingdom that caught a strange plague and everyone disappeared. One day Hydra troops were sightseeing in the forest of Switzerland and happened to stumble upon it. 

We put down our weapons and started cleaning it up and before you know it, what a sight. It has its own airfield and helicopter pad so we can travel back and forth to [region]Hydra Main Command[/region] since we have our own transportation service called [region]Saigon International Airport[/region].[/color]
