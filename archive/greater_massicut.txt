The traditional homeland of the Massicutian, Pithecan, and Khrabic peoples, this land was once united under the Celestial Empire of Massicut. Western Massicut is composed of the old imperial marches of Pitheca, once home to tribes of nomadic natives and agricultural communities of Massicuto-Pithecan settlers. To the far south lies the nation of Khrabs, ancient rival to the Massicutian Empire and home to fanatical worshippers of death itself. The foothills of the Zhnitslian Alps to the north are home to the holy city of Noblewood, seat of the Celestial Papacy. The Democratic Republic of Zhnitsl, a Massicutian breakaway state loyal to the Celestial Papacy, controls the Alps and the upper Massicut River Valley.
