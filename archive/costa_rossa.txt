Costa Rossa, the Mediterranean-climate region known for the sheer red cliffs of Red Sea Coast of the continent of Antiguatera, also including the Tin Islands. Mainland (Antiguatera-side) Costa Rossa is known for its wet, rainy warm season and mild, damp winter and extends to the Proximal Lime Mountains region. The Divine, Superior Highland, and Flower watersheds innervate 92% of Mainland Costa Rossa with headwaters in the Limes. The Bronchial Temperate Rain Forest has the greatest selection of biodiversity in North-East Antiguatera.
