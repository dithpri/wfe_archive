[region]Secret Societies[/region][color=#ffb912] is an idea, not a region. It&#39;s purpose is to show all what we can do, whether it be power, change, or expressive behavior. We&#39;ll take anything and anyone, but trust me, this is not a liberal biased region. We let anyone speak their mind, without them being interrupted by someone who dislikes their opinions. The Illuminati, Anonymous, The Freemasons, all names of which were huge in their prime. Do you have what it takes to become something great?[/color]
