The ancient region of Mbret has existed for a long time. The first, old region of Mbret (https://web.archive.org/web/20160106033719/https://www.nationstates.net/region=mbret), founded by the ex-nation The Theocracy of Vuori Kuningas, was founded after the Theocracy left [region]South Pacific[/region]. Mbret was memberless, though, and the Theocracy eventually deteriorated and ceased to exist. After the Deterioration of the Theocracy, the Jingoistic States of Ala-Guorkar became a member of Mbret due to cultural reasons, but the absence of the Founder and the World Delegate of Mbret led to the creation of this new region: Mbret - Vuori Kuningas.
