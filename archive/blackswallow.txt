The Blackswallow region is a lively place with a strange mix of advanced and primitive technologies, known to this world as Biopunk and Steampunk genres. The Blackswallow region was cut off from the rest of the world and its countries are now just branching out from where they had made their claims.  Metal is hard to come by in the Blackswallow region. Because of this, lifeweavers have learned how to effectively manipulate the genomes of creatures to make creatures of work, pleasure, and war to help live with nature and not against it. The life weavers may choose to work with whoever they want due to the laws founded after the Elephant Wars.
