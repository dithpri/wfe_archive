[region]Pirizeia[/region]
(Pronounced: Piri-zeya)

A new region in it&#39;s infancy, was founded after the founder ([nation]Theidir[/nation]) had enough of all the regions it had tried to set roots in. It&#39;s creed? To provide a somewhat safe, and welcoming environment for any nations that didn&#39;t feel &quot;enough&quot; to live in other regions, new and old, to settle in peace.
