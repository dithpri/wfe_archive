[b]On a cold summer night Aleena discovered that the hawks have a shotgun! After firing once or twice she decided she much enjoyed this new toy. So the forces of raiderdom spent the rest of the night desperately trying to make sure she didn&amp;#8217;t shoot anything important. To make matters worse this was during raidercon, so there was a lot to keep safe. A shell or two might have landed in your region, sorry! We cleaned the place up to make up for it. 

You also get a very special invitation to raidercon! [url=https://discord.gg/c4TSATqCgc] Come have some fun with us why don&amp;#8217;t you[/url]
