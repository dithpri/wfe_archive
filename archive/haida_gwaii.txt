[b]Haida Gwaii[/b], literally &quot;Islands of the Haida people&quot;), formerly known as the [region]Queen Charlotte Islands[/region], is an archipelago on the North Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Approximately half of its population is of the Haida people.

The islands are separated from the British Columbia mainland to the east by Hecate Strait. Vancouver Island lies to the south, across Queen Charlotte Sound, while the U.S. state of Alaska is to the north, across the disputed Dixon Entrance. &#151;Wikipedia[hr]
