The Revolutionary International is an organisation formed of revolutionary parties and governments from around the world. 

Our purpose is to fight by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State.

To do this, we aim to cohere revolutionary socialists and communists into a united organisation and to train up a cadre of revolutionaries and working class militants.

Onward comrades, to the final struggle!
