Lobster Rock is a group of islands found in the Pacific Ocean, named for the native&#39;s statues of Lobsters left on the islands. As of now, there are only four nations in Lobster Rock, but enough land for plenty more. The two oldest countries in the region, Old Lobster Rock and New Lobster Rock, live in harmony after 12 years of the New Lobster Rockians fighting for their independence from Old Lobster Rock.
