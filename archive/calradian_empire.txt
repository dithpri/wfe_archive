The land of Calradia resembles a continental terrain bordered by a mountain chain to the south and a snow plain to the east. It holds eight rivers, two that end in deltas, three dozen forests of varying sizes, and one lake. The earth is predominantly green except in the steppes, where it appears to be drier, and in the snowfield, where it is covered with snow.
