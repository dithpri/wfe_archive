[color=purple][i]Welcome to [b]Karma![/b] Home to the cutest forest animals you&#39;ve ever seen![/i]

Karma is a meritocratic region guided by our Sages to do what is right, what is reasonable, and what is maybe slightly evil because sometimes that&#39;s what it takes.
We welcome all players, new and old, regardless of background or identity.
