[color=purple][b]Welcome to Karma![/b] Home to the cutest forest animals you&#39;ve ever seen!

Karma is a meritocratic region guided by our Sages to do what is right, what is reasonable, and what is maybe slightly evil because sometimes that&#39;s what it takes.
While Sages may hold ultimate power, we put players into roles with real power. We want to cultivate and teach.

Karma is welcoming to all players, new and old, regardless of background or identity. Have a problem? Let us know.

&amp;#9775; Karma&#39;s government is empowered by our constitution [url=http://zenkarma.boards.net/thread/206/guidance]The Guidance[/url].
