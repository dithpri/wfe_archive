[color=navy][b]Welcome to Alvarez[/b]

Deep within the thick medieval forests of Alvarez the loyal citizens work in Guilds and strive for control of the regional government.  Clashing and competing, campaigning and trading for rank and status is commonplace as everyone is jockeying for power and status.  

Alvarez is designed as a highly competitive, fast paced, democratic region composed of Guilds and weekly elections. Do you have what it takes to survive? To thrive?[/color]
