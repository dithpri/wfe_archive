Formed from refugees of the last inter-universal conflict, the United Concord strives to be a community where all sapient beings, regardless of form or tangible origin are acknowledged and celebrated; where all may find equal and equitable protection and opportunity under the rule of rational law

Pursuant to these aims it is imperative that member states embrace, among other tenets, civil rights, welfare, secularism, scientific progress and rational decision making based on minimizing harm and maximizing tangible utility for all peoples. States of fascist, xenophobic or otherwise cruel persuasions will be resisted with extreme prejudice.
